## Question

What are the most common nonpharmacological interventions used to address dementia-related distress in residents?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which nonpharmacological interventions are most commonly used to address dementia-related distress in residents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "distress" is defined and operationalized in guidelines and studies. Then, I should verify which intervention categories appear most frequently across high-quality reviews and guidelines. Next, I will quantify frequency where possible and note heterogeneity. After that, I should distinguish commonly used from strongly evidence-based, since frequency does not always equal efficacy. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful list with caveats about implementation and context.

> Let me first confirm the construct of "distress" in dementia care. Distress encompasses agitation, aggression, anxiety, apathy, sleep disturbance, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and contemporary guidance frames these as expressions of unmet needs, prompting nonpharmacological approaches as first-line management in residential settings [^115byEao] [^117Afquu].

> Next, I should review which nonpharmacological categories recur most often across sources. Wait, let me verify the dominant themes: caregiver and staff training/education, environmental modifications, person-centered care models, sensory and activity-based therapies (notably music, massage/touch, and exercise), and structured psychosocial interventions such as cognitive stimulation, reminiscence, and CBT adaptations emerge repeatedly across systematic reviews and guidelines, with music therapy and massage/touch particularly prominent in nursing home studies [^112un5Kx] [^112iqzjV] [^11379kpC] [^113A5uTT].

> I will now examine frequency where quantification is available. In a systematic review of anxiety-focused interventions in nursing homes, music therapy was the most commonly studied modality, appearing in multiple trials, while activity-based interventions were also frequent, albeit with mixed effects and notable implementation barriers such as staff capacity and fidelity [^112iqzjV] [^111wXvU5]. Hold on, I should verify broader syntheses: across 77 interventions in a realist review, 82% were implemented in residential care, underscoring the concentration of evidence in long-term care settings and the diversity of approaches tested there [^112un5Kx].

> But wait, what if "most common" reflects availability rather than efficacy? I need to ensure I separate frequency from strength of evidence. Music therapy has repeated endorsements in guidelines for agitation and anxiety, massage/touch therapy is recommended for agitation and depression, exercise is advised for agitation and depressive symptoms, and cognitive stimulation and reminiscence are recommended for depression in community and long-term care, whereas other commonly used approaches like aromatherapy or light therapy have more conditional or limited evidence bases in this context [^112iqzjV] [^11379kpC] [^113A5uTT] [^117Wpqaj] [^114U7z7k] [^114TQPf3] [^116yQhoC].

> Let me consider implementation realities that shape what is "common" in practice. Staff training and environmental approaches are frequently embedded in quality-improvement efforts and policy initiatives to reduce antipsychotic use, making them commonplace operationally even when individual RCT effects are modest or heterogeneous, which helps explain their prevalence despite variable efficacy signals in meta-analyses [^114steKu] [^114V3C8x] [^1123mmfm].

> I should double-check whether multicomponent or single-modality interventions dominate. Evidence and guidance converge on individualized, multicomponent strategies that combine environmental adjustments, caregiver/staff education, and tailored activities as most aligned with sustained benefit, even though single-modality studies (e.g., music alone) are common in the literature and may show short-term improvements [^115KtYzt] [^116m7RT4] [^112Tp5sw].

> Putting this together, the most commonly used nonpharmacological interventions to address dementia-related distress in residents are: music therapy, massage and touch therapy, physical exercise and activity programs, caregiver/staff education and training (including person-centered care models), environmental modifications, and structured psychosocial therapies such as cognitive stimulation and reminiscence, with music therapy and massage/touch particularly frequent in nursing home studies and guideline recommendations, while acknowledging that multicomponent, individualized implementation yields the most consistent clinical utility [^112iqzjV] [^115b1Qm2] [^11379kpC] [^113A5uTT] [^112un5Kx] [^115KtYzt].

---

The most common nonpharmacological interventions for dementia-related distress in residents are **music therapy** [^115b1Qm2], **environmental modifications** (lighting, noise reduction, signage) [^113wa1kS], and **caregiver/staff training** in person-centered care and communication [^114steKu] [^114V3C8x]. Other frequently used approaches include **exercise and physical activity** [^113A5uTT], **massage and touch therapy** [^11379kpC], **cognitive stimulation** [^117Wpqaj], and **reminiscence therapy** [^114U7z7k]. These interventions are recommended as first-line care [^115byEao] because they are safe, person-centered, and can reduce distress without the risks of psychotropic medications [^112Tp5sw] [^117VxD5Y].

---

## Environmental modifications

Environmental modifications are a cornerstone of nonpharmacological care, aiming to reduce confusion, anxiety, and agitation by adapting the physical and social environment [^115KtYzt].

- **Lighting interventions**: Bright light therapy and improved daytime lighting are used to regulate circadian rhythms, improve sleep, and reduce agitation and depression [^113wa1kS].

- **Noise reduction**: Minimizing background noise and creating quiet spaces can decrease sensory overload and agitation.

- **Signage and wayfinding**: Clear, simple signage and visual cues help residents navigate independently, reducing frustration and anxiety.

- **Personalization**: Allowing residents to personalize their living spaces with familiar objects and photos can enhance comfort and reduce distress.

---

## Music therapy

Music therapy is one of the most frequently used and effective nonpharmacological interventions for dementia-related distress [^115b1Qm2]. It involves **active music-making** — singing, playing instruments, and rhythmic activities that engage residents and reduce agitation and anxiety — and **receptive music listening**, wherein personalized playlists of familiar music can evoke positive memories, improve mood, and decrease behavioral symptoms. Music therapy is particularly effective for **reducing agitation, anxiety, and depression**, and improving overall quality of life [^115b1Qm2].

---

## Caregiver and staff training

Training caregivers and staff in dementia-specific care, communication techniques, and person-centered approaches is essential for reducing distress [^114V3C8x]. Key components include **person-centered care**, which emphasizes understanding individual preferences, histories, and needs to tailor care and reduce distress [^115KtYzt], and **communication training**, which teaches staff to use clear, simple language, nonverbal cues, and validation techniques to reduce confusion and agitation. Education on **behavioral management** provides strategies for preventing and de-escalating challenging behaviors [^1122JWEs].

---

## Exercise and physical activity

Regular physical activity is beneficial for managing distress in dementia residents, improving mood, reducing agitation, and enhancing physical function [^113A5uTT]. Interventions include **structured exercise programs** — group or individual sessions incorporating aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility exercises — and **walking programs**, which provide gentle, regular walking to reduce restlessness and improve sleep. Physical activity is also recommended for managing **agitation and depressive symptoms** in long-term care settings [^113A5uTT].

---

## Massage and touch therapy

Massage and touch therapy are simple, low-cost interventions that can significantly reduce distress in dementia residents [^11379kpC]. Techniques include **hand massage**, which reduces agitation, anxiety, and promotes relaxation, and **slow-stroke back massage**, which improves sleep quality and reduces nocturnal disturbances. Touch therapy is particularly useful for residents with **limited communication abilities** [^1147FHcq].

---

## Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST)

CST involves structured activities that engage cognitive functions, improve mood, and reduce behavioral symptoms. Group CST sessions offer **social and cognitive engagement** through themed activities, discussions, and games, while individualized CST tailors activities to personal interests and cognitive abilities. CST is recommended for **mild-to-moderate dementia** to manage depressive symptoms [^117Wpqaj].

---

## Reminiscence therapy

Reminiscence therapy encourages residents to share and reflect on past experiences, promoting identity, social connection, and emotional well-being [^114U7z7k]. Life story work uses **personal histories, photos, and memorabilia** to stimulate memory and reduce distress, and group reminiscence sessions foster social interaction and emotional expression. Reminiscence therapy is recommended for **managing depressive symptoms** in long-term care settings [^114U7z7k].

Abstract

Objective

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) refer to the often distressing, noncognitive symptoms of dementia. BPSD appear in up to 90% of persons with dementia and can cause serious complications. Reducing the use of antipsychotic medications to treat BPSD is an international priority. This review addresses the following questions: What nonpharmacological interventions work to manage BPSD? And, in what circumstances do they work and why?

Method

A realist review was conducted to identify and explain the interactions among context, mechanism, and outcome. We searched electronic databases for empirical studies that reported a formal evaluation of nonpharmacological interventions to decrease BPSD.

Results

Seventy-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Three mechanisms emerged as necessary for sustained effective outcomes: the caring environment, care skill development and maintenance, and individualization of care. We offer hypotheses about how different contexts account for the success, failure, or partial success of these mechanisms within the interventions.

Discussion

Nonpharmacological interventions for BPSD should include consideration of both the physical and the social environment, ongoing education/training and support for care providers, and individualized approaches that promote self-determination and continued opportunities for meaning and purpose for persons with dementia.

### Nonpharmacological management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: what works, in what circumstances, and why? [^111qDnqR]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) refer to the often distressing, noncognitive symptoms of dementia (e.g. aggression, apathy, psychomotor agitation). BPSD appear in up to 90% of persons with dementia and can cause serious complications (e.g. increased emergency department visits, caregiver distress and illness, early institutionalization, and diminished quality of life). Antipsychotic medications are often prescribed to manage BPSD, especially in long-term care (LTC) settings. However, a clear association has been demonstrated between treatment with antipsychotic medications and increased morbidity and mortality in people with dementia. Thus, implementing initiatives aimed at reducing the use of antipsychotic medications for people with dementia has become an international priority. A central feature of these initiatives is the development of guidelines that recommend (or require) the use of nonpharmacological treatment modalities prior to initiating pharmacotherapy.

Nonpharmacological management of BPSD can be grouped into two categories: (a) indirect interventions aimed at decreasing BPSD through working with caregivers or adapting the environment (e.g. caregiver training, multidisciplinary team approaches, individualized treatment plans, and modifying environmental factors) and (b) direct interventions targeted directly at individuals with dementia to decrease BPSD (e.g. individualized recreation therapy, sensory-based therapy, exercise, music therapy, massage).

Review of the literature indicates that little is known about the feasibility and effectiveness of direct and indirect nonpharmacological interventions for the management of BPSD. A recent systematic review of interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications demonstrated that most interventions focus primarily on education of care staff, physicians, and pharmacists. The authors of this review found that some of these indirect interventions may be effective in the short term (i.e. reduced prescribing levels immediately following the intervention) but that the culture and nature of care settings, in addition to the availability and feasibility of additional nonpharmacological alternatives (e.g. beyond education), needs to be addressed to sustain reduced antipsychotic prescribing over the long term.

The complexity of BPSD in dementia suggests that an integrated approach is required for effective intervention and management. Approaches that do not take into consideration the complex biological, psychosocial, psychological, and environmental factors will likely produce results that are sporadic, inconsistent, and short lived. Consequently, a comprehensive and integrated approach, which addresses the needs of the individual with dementia, the caregivers, and the context (e.g. physical and psychosocial environment) is required.

Search Results and Study Characteristics

Seventy-four studies met the selection criteria and, as previously described, 77 interventions were analyzed. Studies from 20 countries were included in this review with the majority having been conducted in the United States (n = 25; 33%) and using RCT as their study design (n = 56; 73%). Of the interventions reviewed, 34% were evaluated as fair to good evidence to support a recommendation for effectiveness ("A" + "B"; n = 26), 44% were evaluated as insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for effectiveness ("C"; n = 34), and 22% were evaluated a fair to good evidence to support a recommendation for ineffectiveness ("D" + "E"; n = 17; see Supplementary Appendix B).

In total, 14 different types of nonpharmacological interventions were included in our sample. They ranged from specific indirect interventions (e.g. training and education, light focused) to specific direct interventions (e.g. massage, music based). Similar to previous reviews, we found the effectiveness of these interventions varied significantly depending on the study (see Table 2). This finding further highlighted the need to examine more closely how different contexts may account for the successes, failures, or partial successes of these interventions.

Table 2.
Effectiveness Rating by Interventions

The duration of the interventions varied widely, ranging from 5 to 92 weeks (mean = 15 weeks, SD = 17 weeks). Sample sizes also varied widely, ranging from 14 to 624 (mean = 110). The majority of interventions did not include any follow-up (n = 47; 63%) and less than a quarter included follow-up lasting longer than 8 weeks (n = 16; 21%). The majority of interventions were implemented in residential care facilities (n = 63; 82%) as opposed to the community (n = 13; 17%) and included persons with dementia who were at any stage of the disease process (n = 56; 73%) as opposed to specifying the stage (e.g. mild, moderate, or severe). Importantly, the effectiveness rating of the interventions was not found to be associated with the participants' stage in the disease process (see Table 3).

### Meta-analysis of nonpharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia [^111LaX3S]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Behavioral and psychological symptoms are common in dementia, and they are especially stressful for family caregivers. Nonpharmacological (or psychosocial) interventions have been shown to be effective in managing behavioral and psychological symptoms, but mainly in institutional settings. The authors reviewed the effectiveness of community-based nonpharmacological interventions delivered through family caregivers.

Method

Of 1,665 articles identified in a literature search, 23 included unique randomized or pseudorandomized nonpharmacological interventions with family caregivers and outcomes related to the frequency or severity of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, caregiver reactions to these symptoms, or caregiver distress attributed to these symptoms. Studies were rated according to an evidence hierarchy for intervention research.

Results

Nonpharmacological interventions were effective in reducing behavioral and psychological symptoms, with an overall effect size of 0.34 (95% CI = 0.20–0.48; z = 4.87; p < 0.01), as well as in ameliorating caregiver reactions to these behaviors, with an overall effect size of 0.15 (95% CI = 0.04–0.26; z = 2.76; p = 0.006).

Conclusions

Nonpharmacological interventions delivered by family caregivers have the potential to reduce the frequency and severity of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, with effect sizes at least equaling those of pharmacotherapy, as well as to reduce caregivers' adverse reactions. The successful interventions identified included approximately nine to 12 sessions tailored to the needs of the person with dementia and the caregiver and were delivered individually in the home using multiple components over 3–6 months with periodic follow-up.

Objectives and Aims

The objective of this study is to improve our understanding of effective nonpharmacological treatment modalities of BPSD by identifying and examining the interactions among context (something that can enable or modify or block a mechanism; the context may be provided by the intervention or it might relate to a broader contextual backdrop — the organizational and system setting in which complex interventions are delivered), mechanisms (the processes that operate in particular contexts that ultimately lead to the outcomes), and outcomes (both intended and unintended).

Conclusions

Nonpharmacological interventions for BPSD should include consideration of the caring environment, care skill development and maintenance, and individualization of care. However, when considering the environment, adapting the physical environment is necessary but not sufficient. To effectively address BPSD, the social environment must also be incorporated into the intervention. Also, when considering care skill development related to initiatives aimed at decreasing BPSD, providing initial training is necessary but not sufficient. Instead, ongoing education and support of care providers in the form of effective enabling and reinforcing factors must also be included. Finally, individualized approaches that promote self-determination and autonomy of persons with dementia should also be included in any interventions aimed at decreasing BPSD. Though we found that the combination of each of these was supportive of the success of these interventions, we also found that they are not the norm. This may help to explain why so many nonpharmacological interventions designed to address BPSD result in inconsistent outcomes. It is our hope that this also provides direction for future research and initiatives aimed at successful and sustainable nonpharmacological management of BPSD in persons with dementia.

### Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia [^112Tp5sw]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Behavioral symptoms such as repetitive speech, wandering, and sleep disturbances are a core clinical feature of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. If untreated, these behaviors can accelerate disease progression, worsen functional decline and quality of life, cause significant caregiver distress, and result in earlier nursing home placement. Systematic screening for behavioral symptoms in dementia is an important prevention strategy that facilitates early treatment of behavioral symptoms by identifying underlying causes and tailoring a treatment plan. First-line nonpharmacologic treatments are recommended because available pharmacologic treatments are only modestly effective, have notable risks, and do not effectively treat some of the behaviors that family members and caregivers find most distressing. Examples of nonpharmacologic treatments include provision of caregiver education and support, training in problem solving, and targeted therapy directed at the underlying causes for specific behaviors (eg, implementing nighttime routines to address sleep disturbances). Based on an actual case, we characterize common behavioral symptoms and describe a strategy for selecting evidence-based nonpharmacologic dementia treatments. Nonpharmacologic management of behavioral symptoms in dementia can significantly improve quality of life and patient-caregiver satisfaction.

Phase two: synthesis and interpretation

On completion of the data extraction, descriptive statistics were computed for each item in the matrix. Next, we identified recurrent contextual features that might have acted as barriers to, or enablers of, the success of the interventions aimed at decreasing BPSD, and tested the explanatory ability of our candidate theories against these. Throughout this process, we sought and highlighted disconfirming data.

The quality of the published evidence was categorized as the level of evidence generated from (a) properly randomized controlled trials (RCT), (b) quasi-experimental designs (i.e. well-designed controlled trials without randomization) (QE), or (c) descriptive case studies or case reports (DCS). Follow-up evaluation of the intervention (i.e. whether the researchers evaluated the sustainability of practice change over time) was noted to better understand the typical length of follow-up used in intervention studies, to assist in the evaluation of the intervention effectiveness, and to determine whether it was sustained.

The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias was used to evaluate risks related to five key domains for each of the randomized studies (i.e. selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias). The Risk of Bias Assessment for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS) was used to evaluate risks in the nonrandomized studies related to five key domains: (a) selection, (b) confounding variables, (c) performance, (d) inadequate blinding, and (e) incomplete outcome data. The risk of bias was classified as follows: "1" = low risk of bias in all key domains with plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results; "2" = unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains with plausible bias that raised some doubt about the results; and "3" = high risk of bias for one or more key domains with plausible bias that seriously weakened confidence in the results.

The effectiveness of each intervention was evaluated independently by the authors. The effectiveness rating was based on a combined overview of the sample size, effect size, outcomes and impact, level of evidence, follow-up, and risk of bias. Following the format utilized by Aylward and colleagues, the effectiveness was rated as follows: "A" = good evidence to support a recommendation of effectiveness, "B" = fair evidence to support a recommendation of effectiveness, "C" = insufficient evidence to recommend for or against effectiveness, "D" = fair evidence to support a recommendation of ineffectiveness, and "E" = good evidence to support a recommendation of ineffectiveness.

From Candidate Theories Toward a Model for Understanding Nonpharmacological Interventions to Manage BPSD

Of the selected candidate theories, none emerged as able to describe conclusively the interactions among context, mechanisms, and outcomes within interventions aimed at decreasing BPSD. As a result, we examined the specific principles within each candidate theory and a preliminary thematic analysis was undertaken to identify aspects of each study that were key to the intervention's success (or which explained its partial success or failure). Following this, we identified three mechanisms by which an intervention to decrease BPSD might achieve its goals and developed a unifying heuristic model to explain the influence of context on these mechanisms with the resulting outcomes (see Figure 2). Two of the mechanisms were indirect interventions — these included the caring environment and care skill development and maintenance. The third mechanism was individualization of care, which is considered a direct intervention. As represented in the model, we assert that all three of these mechanisms, and the contexts within which they occur, must be included and addressed for successful and sustainable outcomes related to the reduction of BPSD to occur.

Figure 2.
Heuristic model for clinical intervention implementation or future research.

The key contextual influences were then grouped according to those that caused the mechanisms to be unsuccessful in decreasing BPSD (and, in fact, could potentially lead to an increase in symptoms), those that produced inconsistent outcomes and we described as "necessary but not sufficient", and those that helped to ensure the mechanisms resulted in the successful decrease in BPSD. Once placed into the model, we found that these contextual influences could be further categorized as those that were more consistent with the medical model (i.e. focused almost exclusively on objective medical and clinical outcomes), to those that were more consistent with a social model of care (i.e. focused on tailoring care to an individual's needs and abilities while also promoting choice and enhanced relationships; see Figure 2). We describe the mechanisms and these contextual influences below.

Case Example: Evidence

Brief narrative: Agitation and aggression are common neuropsychiatric symptoms in PLWD, and highly distressful to patients, caregivers, and nursing home staff. A behavioral treatment intervention based on environmental modifications to mitigate agitation and aggression in persons with dementia has demonstrated effectiveness in nursing home settings with very low health disparities population representation. The current study purports to test the same intervention against routine care in a community-based home care setting with higher representation of diverse racial/ethnic patients, that is, English- and Spanish-speaking Latinx and monolingual English-speaking Black Americans.

Health equity issue: The demonstration of effectiveness for the behavioral trial to address agitation and aggression was well-documented, yet not for the new target population, new treatment setting (environmental factors in particular), or across different languages.

There are racial/ethnic inequities in nursing home quality such that nursing homes with greater proportions of Latinx and Black American residents are more likely to be located in urban areas and to have fewer resources such as lower revenue and staffing levels. These limitations could affect challenges to implementing the intervention. If Latinx and Black American residents are not sufficiently represented in prior trials, the results may not be generalizable to them, and to the facilities in which they reside, and provider groups.

Readiness — Low

Preparatory Strategies:

Engage in initial needs assessment to elucidate needs, preferences, etc. across collaborator groups (patients, family members, interventionists, providers, manager-level decision-makers).
Establish other collaborator input mechanisms to ascertain the same (focus groups, key informant interviews, etc.).
Conduct a scoping review to identify whether similar interventions have been conducted on the new target population, paying attention to sociocultural factors, language/linguistic factors, engagement with index condition (neuropsychiatric symptoms), etc.
Identify whether certain components of the proposed intervention have higher levels of evidence for the individual components among the new target populations.
Engage in culturally appropriate, translation, and transformation procedures to ensure the intervention procedures (and measures) are attuned to language considerations (Latinx Spanish-language/dialects), and available literacy levels for all subgroups.
Conduct a small pilot with nursing home settings, representative target sample, and provider group to establish feasibility and acceptability of the study intervention and research procedures.

### Nonpharmacological interventions for anxiety and dementia in nursing homes: a systematic review [^112iqzjV]. The Gerontologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Interventions for Managing Anxiety

Thirteen articles in this review considered six different interventions where anxiety was a measurable outcome for people with dementia living in nursing homes. The most common interventions were music therapy and activity therapy with more diverse interventions including acupressure, companion robots, exercise, and pain control.

Music therapy fell into two groups: group therapy with a trained music therapist or listening to music of choice independently, withcomparing both forms of music therapy. Active music therapy seeks to engage the participants in music making that enables expressions of emotions in relation to the music therapist whereas receptive music therapy is undertaken by listening to music in isolation with the music therapist only involved in supporting the choice of music. Different tools were used across the studies with the most common being NPI and RAID. Many music therapy studies are hampered by small sample sizes whereas the studies included in this review ranged from 30 to 120 residents in well-designed randomized control trials. Interventions lasted from 6 to 16 weeks usually for 30 min per week. Most studies used multiple measurement time points, at baseline, midpoint and postintervention with the longest study duration of 24 weeks using five time points. The results of the receptive music studies were positive, with; 15 residents in intervention arm assessed with the Hamilton Scale) finding a statistically significant effect on anxiety sustained up to 8 weeks postintervention. Studies using active music groups were mixed with; 30 residents assessed with the NPI) and; 27 residents assessed with the RAID) finding a statistically significant effect on anxiety between control and intervention groups. Similarly to, also found positive effects up to one month following the completion of the music therapy.used a cross over the trial where 47 residents attended a music group using a reading group as control, and demonstrated no statistical effect on anxiety using the RAID.used an active music therapy session across four care homes resulting in 20 residents completing the intervention and found no statistically significant effects between intervention and control (n = 16).undertook multi center three-arm trial of 120 residents to compare receptive and active music therapies with usual care, and although they found an improvement across NPI global scores, there were no significant effects when compared with the control group. This may have been due to the large dropout rate and using the NPI global score as the outcome measure. When the results of these studies were pooled for meta-analysis, the heterogeneity of these studies suggest it is difficult to demonstrate a statically significant outcome for either the effect or the most commonly used measurement tool, the RAID (Figure 4). Means and standard deviations were extracted from four articles and entered into RevMan for meta-anlaysis demonstrating insufficient evidence to show whether music interventions have an effect on anxiety (standardized mean difference = −0.54; 95% CI = −1.19 to 0.12), I² = 77%, tau = 0.34). Where possible, missing data were accessed directly from the authors.

### Targeting and managing behavioral symptoms in individuals with dementia: a randomized trial of a nonpharmacological intervention [^116gS6gw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To test the effects of an intervention that helps families manage distressing behaviors in family members with dementia.

Design

Two-group randomized trial.

Setting

In home.

Participants

Two hundred seventy-two caregivers and people with dementia.

Intervention

Up to 11 home and telephone contacts over 16 weeks by health professionals who identified potential triggers of patient behaviors, including communication and environmental factors and patient undiagnosed medical conditions (by obtaining blood and urine samples) and trained caregivers in strategies to modify triggers and reduce their upset. Between 16 and 24 weeks, three telephone contacts reinforced strategy use.

Measurements

Primary outcomes were frequency of targeted problem behavior and caregiver upset with and confidence managing it at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were caregiver well-being and management skills at 16 and 24 weeks and caregiver perceived benefits. Prevalence of medical conditions for intervention patients were also examined.

Results

At 16 weeks, 67.5% of intervention caregivers reported improvement in targeted problem behavior, compared with 45.8% of caregivers in a no-treatment control group (P = 0.002), and reduced upset with (P = 0.03) and enhanced confidence managing (P = 0.01) the behavior. Additionally, intervention caregivers reported less upset with all problem behaviors (P = 0.001), less negative communication (P = 0.02), less burden (P = 0.05), and better well-being (P = 0.001) than controls. Fewer intervention caregivers had depressive symptoms (53.0%) than control group caregivers (67.8%, P = 0.02). Similar caregiver outcomes occurred at 24 weeks. Intervention caregivers perceived more study benefits (P < .05), including ability to keep family members home, than controls. Blood and urine samples of intervention patients with dementia showed that 40 (34.1%) had undiagnosed illnesses requiring physician follow-up.

Conclusion

Targeting behaviors upsetting to caregivers and modifying potential triggers improves symptomatology in people with dementia and caregiver well-being and skills.

### Nonpharmacological interventions for anxiety and dementia in nursing homes: a systematic review [^111wXvU5]. The Gerontologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Activity tends to be a multifactorial intervention with differing approaches being adopted across different studies. Two studies included a choice of activities known as pleasant events or activities that the person with dementia chose to be involved in. Both studies implemented staff education as part of the intervention, aimed at increasing activity or pleasant events but found limited or no improvement in anxiety between groups.acknowledged the limitations of care home staff being able to deliver the activity intervention resulting in variability of compliance across care homes. This may have accounted for the lack of changes between control and intervention groups. This study underlines the complexity of care home staff engaging with interventions to increase activity for care homes residents in nursing homes. There was no information provided about the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in any of the studies reviewed.was the only study that calculated the cost of the professional delivering the intervention across nursing homes. Limited conclusions can be drawn about the other interventions due to the heterogeneity of the interventions and small sample sizes within each of the studies.raised similar concerns in a systematic review and meta-analysis of nonpharmacological interventions to manage agitation and aggression in dementia in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. These authors similarly concluded that the heterogeneity of interventions, different measures being used alongside small sample sizes all reduced the methodological rigor required to identify the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions.

In a state of the science review for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, suggest that the underlying cause of the behavior needs to be assessed and an intervention designed for that person implemented and evaluated. There were only two studies that identified participants with clinical anxiety in advance of the intervention. This suggests a need for a more systematic screening of anxiety in nursing home populations, particularly with dementia with interventions implemented when assessed symptoms are more prevalent.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^116JdE8o]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Application — nonpharmacologic and caregiver-focused strategies for dementia care indicate that functional difficulties associated with cognitive decline can sometimes be partially mitigated through the use of cognitive training paradigms or external aids; however, both approaches require intensive training, and caregivers and other environmental supports are crucial in maintaining the positive effects of these interventions. The page states that antipsychotic medications have been linked to negative outcomes for people living with dementia and that multiple organizations including the FDA have discouraged their long-term use in this population, while psychosocial and behavioral interventions can frequently mitigate many of these issues. It adds that challenging behaviors are considered by some an attempt to communicate unmet human needs in people living with dementia and related disorders, and that central features of caregiver approaches include dementia education, skills training, caregiver self-care and stress management, social support, addressing behavioral changes, and connecting families with community resources.

### Nonpharmacological management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: what works, in what circumstances, and why? [^111GUwfx]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanism 2: care skill development and maintenance

To our surprise, only 22 (27%) of the interventions in our sample specified the inclusion of an education and training component. When reviewing the literature, it is clear that continuing professional development via education and training courses for care providers related to understanding dementia is necessary for the implementation of best practices in dementia care and that the lack of these opportunities can lead to increased prevalence of, and negative outcomes related to, BPSD. This empirical evidence is reflected in our model.

When examining our matrix to further elucidate the contextual factors that influence outcomes related to the presence of care skill development we found that 22 (28%) interventions included initial training to educate staff in dementia care and/or the benefits of the specific interventions. Of these studies, eight (36%) received an effectiveness rating "A" or "B", nine (40%) received an effectiveness rating "C", and five (23%) received an effectiveness rating "D" or "E". Thus, our review found that providing initial training on these essential topics may be necessary, but it is not sufficient in producing substantive or sustained improvements in decreasing BPSD.

When we compared these findings to those studies that included ongoing training and support (n = 9; 12%), we found that the majority (n = 6; 67%) received an effectiveness rating "A" or "B". This led to our conclusion that the successful reduction in BPSD requires ongoing education and training combined with supports. An exemplary example of this comes from McCabe and colleagues, who found that initial training and structured clinical protocols successfully decreased BPSD behaviors only [my own italics] when they were combined with ongoing training and clinical supports. Review of our matrix indicated that, in addition to having ongoing opportunities for training, the supports that were most influential included being adaptable to the needs of care providers, ensuring that appropriate resources are available to enable the implementation of the intervention, and implementing system (or organizational) processes that support and reinforce the intervention.

### Ongoing medical management to maximize health and well-being for persons living with dementia [^112QMiJH]. The Gerontologist (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Persons living with dementia have complex care needs including memory loss that should be taken into account by providers and family caregivers involved with their care. The prevalence of comorbid conditions in people with dementia is high and, thus, how primary care, community providers and family caregivers provide best practice care, person-centered care is important.

Research Design and Methods

Care providers should understand the ongoing medical management needs of persons living with dementia in order to maximize their quality of life, proactively plan for their anticipated needs, and be as well prepared as possible for health crises that may occur.

Results

This article provides eight practice recommendations intended to promote understanding and support of the role of nonphysician care providers in educating family caregivers about ongoing medical management to improve the wellbeing of persons living with dementia.

Discussion and Implications

Key among these are recommendations to use nonpharmacological interventions to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia as the first line of treatment and recommendations on how to best support the use and discontinuation of pharmacological interventions as necessary.

### Nonpharmacological interventions for anxiety and dementia in nursing homes: a systematic review [^1164UrRD]. The Gerontologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Anxiety in adults is generally considered to be as disabling as severe depression and should be considered a major health concern. A systematic review suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more effective than other psychotherapeutic interventions in treating anxiety in older adults. However, CBT may not always be viable for people living with advanced dementia, particularly in nursing homes. Psychotherapeutic interventions have been used to treat anxiety and depression in people with dementia. However, the latest Cochrane systematic review of psychotherapeutic interventions found no difference in self-rated or carer-rated anxiety with none of the included studies examining people with dementia living in nursing homes. An examination of the relationship between depression, anxiety, and agitation in one facility in the United States for a doctoral thesis suggests that significant relationships exist between these three conditions, with a history of anxiety being a significant predictor of current anxiety in the nursing home.concluded that it is not always possible to separate anxiety from other issues such as agitation and depression and that this might contribute to a more global construct of distress in the person with dementia living in nursing homes. This may account for the dearth of studies considering anxiety as the primary outcome for people living with dementia in nursing homes. The aim of this review was to consider if nonpharmacological interventions used to alleviate anxiety in this population were effective and if so, which interventions demonstrate the greatest effectiveness in reducing anxiety symptoms in older adults with comorbid dementia.

### Characteristics, outcomes, facilitators and barriers for psychosocial interventions on inpatient mental health dementia wards: a systematic review [^117Afquu]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who provide evidence-based recommendations for care in the UK, emphasise that psychosocial interventions, also described as nonpharmacological interventions, should be the first line of treatment for distress behaviours in dementia care. NICE defines psychosocial interventions as interventions that require specific competencies for delivery, are supported by relevant training and supervision, and provide an enhanced level of intervention.

Increasingly such interventions are manualised and their effectiveness to reduce distress and support wellbeing for people with dementia in residential care settings has been tested. However, there are still significant gaps in dementia care research and practice. In particular, little is known about what psychosocial interventions have been delivered in inpatient mental health dementia care, and whether these were helpful. This is concerning as these wards provide specialist care for those who cannot be safely cared for in residential care, and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotic medication, are frequently used to manage distress with concomitant increase in risk of falls, strokes and death. Further understanding of the current research on inpatient mental health dementia wards, including which psychosocial interventions have been delivered and how, positive and negative patient outcomes, and the facilitators and barriers to implementation, is needed to inform future research and practice.

To understand the current literature on this topic, a systematic review of psychosocial interventions in inpatient mental health dementia care was conducted. Based on expert-by-experience and stakeholder feedback, the review focussed on interventions that aim to reduce distress or improve wellbeing for people with dementia, as this is the primary focus of the admission. The following review questions were established:

What are the characteristics of psychosocial interventions designed to improve wellbeing and reduce distress for patients within inpatient mental health dementia wards?
What are the positive and negative outcomes for patients receiving these interventions?
What are the facilitators and barriers to successful implementation?

### A biobehavioral home-based intervention and the well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers… [^116m7RT4]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

By 4 months, 64 COPE dyads vs 48 control group dyads eliminated 1 or more caregiver-identified problems. Conclusion Among community-living dyads, a nonpharmacologic biobehavioral environmental intervention compared with control resulted in better outcomes for COPE dyads at 4 months. Although no group differences were observed at 9 months for patients, COPE caregivers perceived greater benefits. Building on previous nonpharmacologic approaches and best clinical practices, 14 we designed the Care of Persons with Dementia in their Environments trial to test a nonpharmacologic, biobehavioral approach to support physical function and quality of life for patients with dementia and the well-being of their caregivers.

The COPE program targeted modifiable environmental stressors to decrease sensorial, physical, and cognitive demands and align with patient capabilities and also ruled out underlying medical conditions that could lead to reduced patient functioning. The intervention sought to re-engage patients in daily activities and increase functionality, thereby alleviating caregiver burden. The COPE program sought to support patient capabilities by reducing environmental stressors and enhancing caregiver skills. In this multicomponent intervention, all COPE dyads received exposure to each treatment element: assessments; caregiver education; and caregiver training to address caregiver-identified concerns and help them reduce stress.

Training in problem-solving, communication, engaging patients in activities, and simplifying tasks was tailored to address caregiver-identified concerns and patient capabilities. These findings add to an increasing evidentiary base for nonpharmacologic management of patients with dementia. We tested a multicomponent intervention that helped caregivers attend to patients' medical well-being and simplify everyday tasks to align with patient capabilities. COPE addresses core elements of dementia care: optimizing physical health and function, engaging in daily activities, maintaining quality of life, and supporting caregivers. 32 At 4 months, COPE improved patient functioning, especially IADLs; patient engagement; and caregiver well-being and confidence using activities. COPE did not improve caregiver ratings of patient quality of life or frequency of agitated behaviors, although change was in the right direction.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are universally experienced by people with dementia throughout the course of the illness and cause a significant negative impact on quality of life for patients and caregivers. Nonpharmacologic treatments have been recommended as first-line treatment of BPSD by multiple professional organizations and should target patients with dementia factors, caregiver factors, and environmental factors. Psychotropic medications are often prescribed off-label without significant evidence to support their use. The Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate approach can provide a structured method to investigate and treat BPSD with flexibility to use in multiple treatment settings.

Non-pharmacological approaches for distressed behaviours

Distress in this context is defined in an inclusive way, recognising the unique and individual ways in which a person living with dementia may experience it. There is an acknowledgement of the broad range of terminology used in literature and practice, and a recognition that there is no perfect single term to capture this complex concept. Restlessness, pacing, repetitive questioning, agitation, aggression, resisting or not engaging with interventions, apathy and sleep disturbance are all considered potential manifestations of distress, but others are acknowledged.

Distress is also highlighted as an important issue for those experiencing delirium, a diagnosis that is more common in people living with dementia. Evidence-based recommendations around distress and delirium are presented in SIGN 157 (risk reduction and management of delirium).

In the guideline, distress is conceptualised as a potential sign of unmet needs — biological, psychological, social or environmental. For this reason, non-pharmacological approaches are recommended as first line for responding to individuals with distressed behaviours, with a focus on trying to identify unmet needs. The guideline focuses solely on non-pharmacological approaches for distress, as evidence around pharmacological approaches for managing distress is already covered in recent National Institute of Health and Care (NICE) dementia guidelines. The guideline group acknowledges that providing recommendations is complicated by the lack of high-quality evidence assessing models of care used in contemporary clinical practice. This may explain why assessment and management of distressed behaviours varies substantially in practice.

Assessment is identified as a specific area of interest, but no evidence-based recommendations are made. Instead, a good practice recommendation supports the holistic assessment of the individual with distressed behaviour. This can be supported by structured and objective measures to recognise distress, and functional analysis to identify possible triggers.

### Nonpharmacological pain management for people with dementia: a scoping review mapping research gaps from a pragmatic lens [^112yAhMu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonpharmacological pain interventions are effective but underutilized in people living with dementia (PLWD). Leveraging an implementation lens (i.e., the Readiness Assessment for Pragmatic Trials [RAPT] model) to scope the literature may reveal research gaps contributing to this underutilization. The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the literature, map the studies to the RAPT model, and identify research gaps.

Methods

Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA- ScR) guidelines, two reviewers screened, collated, extracted, and mapped data from eligible studies to the 9 RAPT domains (implementation, evidence, risk, feasibility, measurement, cost, acceptability, alignment, and impact). We used descriptive statistics to summarize the studies and the extent to which interventions were mapped to RAPT domains.

Results

Of 81 studies covering 24 interventions, 64% were in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), 66% reported unspecified pain, and 32% reported unspecified dementia. Of the interventions, the Tailored Activities Program had literature informing the most domains (6 domains), followed by exercise, pain education, and stepwise approaches (5 domains each). Most studies were mapped to the evidence domain (33 studies), few studies to feasibility (7 studies), acceptability (5 studies), and implementation (10 studies) domains, one study to cost, and no studies to risk or impact.

Conclusion

Despite the variety of nonpharmacological pain interventions studied, there is a notable lack of literature that aligns with the RAPT model. Furthermore, there is limited consideration of the specific pain and dementia conditions, as well as the diverse environments where PLWD reside and receive care. These gaps underscore the need for robust and holistic research to ensure pain interventions are effectively tailored and implemented for PLWD. Starting with acceptability and feasibility studies can establish a foundation for building robust evidence, ensuring practical and well-received interventions before larger-scale clinical trials.

### Supporting family caregivers with technology for dementia home care: a randomized controlled trial [^116JQgpP]. Innovation in Aging (2019). Medium credibility.

Integrating nonpharmacologic approaches for behavioral management for dementia care involves first describing the behavior, identifying the underlying cause, devising a treatment plan, and evaluating if the intervention was successful. Traditionally, experts are only able to provide care interventions based on retrospective recall from the family caregiver, rather than through direct observation. However, identifying and managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia requires expertise and relying on retrospective recall may limit the information clinicians can use to form recommendations. Due to the stress and strain of caregiving, caregivers may be limited in their historical recall particularly when it comes to identifying and communicating precipitating factors, underlying PLWD needs, environmental stressors, and caregiver triggers. Being unable to accurately identify these factors may limit the advice care providers can provide because addressing the interaction of PLWD needs, environment, neurobiology, and the caregiver itself is the foundation to combating caregiving challenges.

Technology provides an opportunity not only to disseminate evidence-based interventions to caregivers to improve dementia care, but to also allow for new opportunities to tailor caregiver support. Currently, a number of technologies are available to support family caregivers, ranging from simple provision of information, to support programs with peers and/or professionals, to actual training, as well as psychotherapy for caregivers. However, many of these technological interventions may not meet the robust recommendations for effective nonpharmacological interventions including a focus on the dyad with individualized approaches targeting individualized challenges. Caregivers recognized the potential benefits of technology as a resource to assist in caregiving, specifically desiring technology as a resource when it allows for personalized professional consultation and guidance for providing care. Caregivers are receptive to using technology, and as younger caregiver cohorts become more tech-savvy, issues ranging from familiarity with technology to privacy and internet access become less prohibitive. Further, the internet now reaches most rural areas, providing a medium for distributing support to more isolated family caregivers.

### Non-pharmacological interventions for sleep disturbances in people with dementia [^116yQhoC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sleep disturbances occur frequently in people with dementia with a reported prevalence of up to 40%. Common problems are increased number and duration of awakenings and increased percentage of light sleep. Sleep disturbances are associated with a number of problems for people with dementia, their relatives, and carers. In people with dementia, they may lead to worsening of cognitive symptoms, challenging behaviours such as restlessness or wandering, and further harms, such as accidental falls. Sleep disturbances are also associated with significant carer distress and have been reported as a factor contributing to institutionalisation of people with dementia. As pharmacological approaches have shown unsatisfactory results, there is a need to synthesise the research evidence on non-pharmacological strategies to improve sleep in people with dementia. As interventions are often complex, consisting of more than one active component, and implemented in complex contexts, it may not be easy to identify effective intervention components.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of non-pharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in people with dementia compared to usual care, no treatment, any other non-pharmacological intervention, or any drug treatment intended to improve sleep, and to describe the components and processes of any complex intervention included.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 13 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included individually or cluster-randomised controlled trials in people with dementia comparing non-pharmacological interventions to improve sleep compared to usual care or to other interventions of any type. Eligible studies had to have a sleep-related primary outcome. We included people with a diagnosis of dementia and sleep problems at baseline irrespective of age, type of dementia, severity of cognitive impairment, or setting. Studies reporting results on a mixed sample (e.g. in a nursing home) were only considered for inclusion if at least 80% of participants had dementia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. objective sleep-related outcomes (e.g. total nocturnal sleep time, consolidated sleep time at night, sleep efficiency, total wake time at night (or time spent awake after sleep onset), number of nocturnal awakenings, sleep onset latency, daytime/night-time sleep ratio, night-time/total sleep ratio over 24 hours) and 2.

Adverse Events

Our secondary outcomes were 3. subjective sleep-related outcomes, 4. behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, 5. quality of life, 6. functional status, 7. institutionalisation, 8. compliance with the intervention, and 9. attrition rates. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence and chose key outcomes to be included in summary of findings tables.

Main Results

We included 19 randomised controlled trials with 1335 participants allocated to treatment or control groups. Fourteen studies were conducted in nursing homes, three included community residents, one included 'inpatients', one included people from a mental health centre, and one included people from district community centres for older people. Fourteen studies were conducted in the US. We also identified nine ongoing studies. All studies applied one or more non-pharmacological intervention aiming to improve physiological sleep in people with dementia and sleep problems. The most frequently examined single intervention was some form of light therapy (six studies), five studies included physical or social activities, three carer interventions, one daytime sleep restriction, one slow-stroke back massage, and one transcranial electrostimulation. Seven studies examined multimodal complex interventions. Risk of bias of included studies was frequently unclear due to incomplete reporting. Therefore, we rated no study at low risk of bias. We are uncertain whether light therapy has any effect on sleep-related outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Physical activities may slightly increase the total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency, and may reduce the total time awake at night and slightly reduce the number of awakenings at night (low-certainty evidence). Social activities may slightly increase total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency (low-certainty evidence). Carer interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time, may slightly increase sleep efficiency, and may modestly decrease the total awake time during the night (low-certainty evidence from one study). Multimodal interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time and may modestly reduce the total wake time at night, but may result in little to no difference in number of awakenings (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effects of multimodal interventions on sleep efficiency (very low-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence that daytime sleep restrictions, slow-stroke back massage, and transcranial electrostimulation may result in little to no difference in sleep-related outcomes. Only two studies reported information about adverse events, detecting only few such events in the intervention groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the inclusion of 19 randomised controlled trials, there is a lack of conclusive evidence concerning non-pharmacological interventions for sleep problems in people with dementia. Although neither single nor multimodal interventions consistently improved sleep with sufficient certainty, we found some positive effects on physical and social activities as well as carer interventions. Future studies should use rigorous methods to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal interventions using current guidelines on the development and evaluation of complex interventions. At present, no single or multimodal intervention can be clearly identified as suitable for widespread implementation.

### Do nonpharmacological interventions prevent cognitive decline? a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EvevR]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Current evidence for prevention of cognitive decline was insufficient. Nonpharmacological therapy could have an indicative role in reducing the case of MCI or dementia. This meta-analysis provides important new evidence that nonpharmacological therapy may be effective in reducing the case of MCI or dementia among older people. For acceptability, nonpharmacological therapy was not significantly associated with fewer dropouts than control groups. Given the heterogeneity of the included RCTs, we call for large, preregistered RCTs of good quality investigating the association between nonpharmacological therapy and cognitive decline prevention, and considering relevant moderators.

### Are interventions for formal caregivers effective for improving dementia care? A systematic review of systematic reviews [^114V3C8x]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

While all six publications reviewed interventions for formal caregivers working with persons living with dementia, they varied by types of interventions and reported outcomes. Two reviews focused on interventions for formal caregivers to mitigate agitation among persons living with dementia and solely reported on the outcome of agitation level changes with no mention of formal caregiver outcomes.aimed to review the literature regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for agitation in older adults living with dementia, finding only two of 14 studies focused on formal caregiver training, with agitation of persons living with dementia reported as the outcome measure. The article byaimed to review the evidence for nonpharmacological interventions for agitation in persons living with dementia, both immediately and longer term. The authors identified six of the 33 RCTs focused on formal dementia caregiver training and the review focused on change in agitation levels of persons living with dementia as the outcome of the interventions. A third review, by, focused on agitation and aggression as the outcome measures and assessed 18 RCTs aimed at formal dementia caregivers. The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions (staff training in providing care, various care-delivery models, and changes to the environment) to reduce and manage agitation and aggression in nursing homes and assisted living residents living with dementia.

More broadly, were interested in the outcome of formal caregiver interventions on neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. The authors' objective was to review the evidence for nonpharmacological interventions for neuropsychiatric symptoms in long-term care and to assess the feasibility of the interventions. In this review, 11 of 40 RCTs focused on staff training and education as well as one additional intervention that included a comprehensive assessment with educational rounds and case management.

In contrast, the aim of the review bywas to assess the effect of multidisciplinary psychosocial interventions in nursing homes on the psychotropic drug prescription rate. Ten of 11 individual RCTs reviewed focused on health care worker interventions, such as education around prescribing. The outcome of focus in this article was on medication use (e.g. change in psychotropic use) and there was no mention of formal caregiver outcomes.

Lastly, thereview was unique from the others as it aimed to assess the current level of evidence on how dementia care worker training initiatives affect organizational capacity, through factors such as retention and service delivery. This review focused on synthesizing findings from six RCTs to examine intervention outcomes on the worker, organization, and consumer in residential care settings.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^112Rao1T]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the general recommendation of non-pharmacological approach as the first-line choice in treating dementia-related agitation and the available evidences supporting some of them, a survey study conducted by Cohen-Mansfield et al. in Israeli nursing homes, to examine physicians' actual practice in treating dementia-related agitation and to check their familiarity with use of non-pharmacological interventions showed that 92.5% of physicians prescribed psychotropic medications for treating agitation. Quite astonishingly, the 67 physicians studied show low-familiarity levels with the use of non-pharmacological interventions. More so, as can be predicted, physicians with non-specialty in geriatrics were noted to have higher levels of unfamiliarity with non-pharmacological interventions.

With so much being said, the non-pharmacologic interventions are not without challenges. They are sometimes more difficult to carry out and could take longer time to be effective. They are also best tailored to individual clinical needs. Little wonder, their uptake as the preferred treatments for dementia-related agitation and neuropsychiatric symptoms remains limited in the real-world clinical settings. More so, even as most evidence of non-pharmacologic interventions available from literatures show good efficacy in the early and mid-stages of dementia, whether these interventions are effective in the later stages of dementia remains unclear.

Finally, it is important to note that agitation may occur as an end-of-life symptom in people with advanced dementia, Eapcnet.eudiscusses the palliative care approach to managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) which may include agitation behavior that challenges caregivers, or be distressing for the patient. In these situations, they recommend getting the opinions of geriatricians or dementia care/palliative care specialists. van der Steen et al. further elaborated on the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) recommendations and provide a framework guidance for clinical practice, research and policy. To further buttress the need for palliative care approach in managing agitation symptoms in advanced dementia, Hendriks et al. reviewed the qualities of life of 330 nursing home residents with dementia who were in their last week of life and found that 35% of them had agitation symptoms.

### Care-delivery interventions to manage agitation and aggression in dementia nursing home and assisted living residents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114steKu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions (staff training, care-delivery models, changes to the environment) to reduce and manage agitation and aggression in nursing home and assisted living residents.

Design

Three bibliographic databases, references of systematic reviews, ClincalTrials.gov, and the International Controlled Trials Registry Platform were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials reporting behavioral outcomes for nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Five investigators independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Inclusion was limited to studies with low to moderate risk of bias.

Setting

Nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

Participants

Facility caregiving staff.

Measurements

Agitation, aggression, antipsychotic and other psychotropic use, general behavior.

Results

Nineteen unique studies met entry criteria, addressing several categories of facility caregiver training interventions: dementia care mapping (DCM; n = 3), person-centered care (PCC; n = 3), clinical protocols to reduce the use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs (n = 3), and emotion-oriented care (n = 2). Eleven additional studies evaluated other unique interventions. Results were pooled for the effect of each type of intervention on agitation and aggression: DCM (standardized mean difference -0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.66 to 0.42), PCC (standardized mean difference -0.15, 95% CI = -0.67 to 0.38), and protocols to reduce antipsychotic and other psychotropic use (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory mean difference -4.5, 95% C = -38.84 to 29.93). Strength of evidence was generally insufficient to draw conclusions regarding efficacy or comparative effectiveness.

Conclusion

Evidence was insufficient regarding the efficacy of nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions to reduce agitation or aggression in nursing home and assisted living facility residents with dementia.

### Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long-term care [^114Mw2h8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and distressing mental disorder. It is often caused by a combination of stressor events in susceptible people, particularly older people living with frailty and dementia. Adults living in institutional long-term care (LTC) are at particularly high risk of delirium. An episode of delirium increases risks of admission to hospital, development or worsening of dementia and death. Multicomponent interventions can reduce the incidence of delirium by a third in the hospital setting. However, it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long-term care settings.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) 's Specialised Register of dementia trials (dementia.cochrane.org/our-trials-register), to 27 February 2019. The search was sufficiently sensitive to identify all studies relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), major healthcare databases, trial registers and grey literature sources to ensure that the search was comprehensive.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs) of single and multicomponent, non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium; and mortality. Secondary outcomes included falls, hospital admissions and other adverse events; cognitive function; new diagnoses of dementia; activities of daily living; quality of life; and cost-related outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-event outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. For each outcome, we assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included three trials with 3851 participants. All three were cluster-RCTs. Two of the trials were of complex, single-component, non-pharmacological interventions and one trial was a feasibility trial of a complex, multicomponent, non-pharmacological intervention. Risk of bias ratings were mixed across the three trials. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the interventions, we did not combine the results statistically, but produced a narrative summary. It was not possible to determine the effect of a hydration-based intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and very serious imprecision). This study did not assess delirium prevalence, severity or mortality. The introduction of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a medication review was probably associated with a reduction in delirium incidence (12-month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51; 1 study, 7311 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias) but probably had little or no effect on mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17; 1 study, 9412 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision), hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10; 1 study, 7599 participant-months; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision) or falls (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15; 1 study, 2275 participant-months; low-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). Delirium prevalence and severity were not assessed. In the enhanced educational intervention study, aimed at changing practice to address key delirium risk factors, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.39; 1 study, 137 resident months; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision) or delirium prevalence (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.19; 1 study, 160 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and serious imprecision). There was probably little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.82, CI 0.50 to 1.34; 1 study, 215 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded for imprecision). The intervention was probably associated with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR 0.67, CI 0.57 to 0.79; 1 study, 494 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to indirectness).

Authors' Conclusions

Our review identified limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC. A software-based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist-led medication review, probably reduces incidence of delirium in older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the US and may not be practical in other countries or settings which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. In the educational intervention aimed at identifying risk factors for delirium and developing bespoke solutions within care homes, it was not possible to determine the effect of the intervention on delirium incidence, prevalence or mortality. This evidence is based on a small feasibility trial. Our review identified three ongoing trials of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions. We identified no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of multicomponent non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence-based care for this vulnerable group.

### Atypical antipsychotic use in patients with dementia: managing safety concerns [^117VxD5Y]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation and delusions occur commonly in elderly patients with dementia and often cause significant distress. Data on treatment efficacy are strongest for atypical antipsychotics, but these agents must be used with great caution. Adverse effects in patients with dementia include an increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular events, as well as metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, falls, cognitive worsening, cardiac arrhythmia, and pneumonia. Conventional antipsychotics may pose an even greater safety risk. No clear efficacy evidence exists to support the use of alternative psychotropic classes (e.g., antidepressants, anticonvulsants), although they may be safer options. An antipsychotic trial is warranted when nonpharmacological intervention is unsuccessful and neuropsychiatric symptoms or associated behaviors cause severe distress or pose a significant safety risk. Before an atypical antipsychotic is started, a comprehensive assessment should be performed to rule out medical causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and to ascertain whether any contributing environmental or caregiver factors are present. Risks, benefits, and alternatives should be discussed with the patient and surrogate decision maker, with an opportunity given to ask questions. Dosages should be the lowest necessary, and metabolic parameters should be regularly monitored. Face-to-face visits are important to monitor response, tolerance, and the need for continued treatment. For patients in whom neuropsychiatric symptoms have been much improved or have been in remission for 3–6 months, a discontinuation trial should be considered. Through careful selection of appropriate patients for treatment, education of patients and caregivers, and close monitoring, safety risks can be minimized.

### Core outcome set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent or treat delirium in long-term care older residents: international key stakeholder informed consensus study [^117Kya2A]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study employed rigorous methodology recruiting a panel of international experts to develop a COS comprising six outcomes to be used in all future trials of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in older adults resident in LTC. Outcomes that achieved consensus were 'delirium occurrence'; 'delirium-related distress'; 'delirium severity'; 'cognition including memory'; 'admission to hospital' and 'mortality'. This COS completes the Del-COrS programme of work, with COS now available for delirium interventional research in LTC, critical care, acute hospital care, and palliative care settings. There are similarities across these COS, with the outcomes 'delirium occurrence', and 'emotional distress' or 'delirium-related distress', common to all.

'Delirium occurrence' is a composite measure including both delirium incidence and prevalence. Measurement of delirium occurrence is fundamental to determining the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent delirium. This outcome was introduced at the COS item reduction phase of all four COS due to the challenges of accurately determining the timing of onset of delirium, and thus delirium incidence. This is particularly pertinent to the older adult LTC population who have high rates of underlying dementia making delirium detection challenging.

The following constitutes key background information on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia:

- **Definition**: BPSD is a heterogeneous range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors occurring in people with dementia of any etiology.
- **Pathophysiology**: BPSD are caused due to a complex interplay of psychological, social, and biological factors including neurochemical, neuropathological and genetic factors.
- **Disease course**: The complex interaction of psychosocial and biological factors results in BPSD, which have clinical manifestations of agitation, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, elation, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes. Disease progression is associated with poor QoL, distress among patients and caregivers, long-term hospitalizations, medication misue, a nd increased health-care costs.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Moderate and severe BPSD are associated with an increased risk of mortality with HR 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08–1.60) and 1.74 (95% CI 1.44–2.12), respectively.

### Preparing for pragmatic trials in dementia care: health equity considerations for nonpharmacological interventions [^117C3ZKU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Major disparities in cognitive health and dementia care exist in the United States. A recent review identifies continuing inequities with regard to population brain health, economic costs, and the evidence base for dementia care and long-term services and supports. Ensuring that dementia care incorporates equal access to assessment, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments for all segments of the US population is essential for health equity. – Achieving health equity in dementia care requires rigorous efforts to ensure that disproportionately affected populations fully participate in clinical research. Health equity refers to having access to assessment, diagnosis, evidence-based care, and supports for all people, including populations with documented health care disparities — namely, historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, individuals with low socioeconomic status, underserved rural residents, and sexual and gender minorities. –

Embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs), provide ways to test proven interventions in healthcare systems within routine clinical practices. Embedding-proven interventions under real-world conditions and within existing healthcare systems have the potential to examine an intervention's effectiveness, improve dementia care, and leverage existing resources. Achieving health equity in dementia care, and ePCTs more specifically, is an ethical, regulatory, and scientific goal, such that all people have a fair and just opportunity to access evidence-based care and be as healthy as possible. Nonpharmacological interventions in dementia care improve outcomes for people and families living with dementia whether offered singularly, in combination with other nonpharmacological interventions, or with pharmacological treatments. – Developing ePCT designs for nonpharmacological care interventions involves a plethora of a priori assumptions and decisions such as identifying which evidence gaps to address, evaluating an intervention's stage of development and the relative risks and benefits, ascertaining the target population, assessing alignment with person-centered outcomes across multiple collaborators and partners, and selecting relevant design and analytic strategies.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^116rB5E5]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Further analysis by Abraha et al. claims that some behavioral management techniques directed at enhancing staff communication skills, formal caregiver training and dementia mapping were effective at reducing agitation. But, interventions such as exercise and pet therapy failed to show any beneficial effects on the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia patients. Meanwhile, quite oppositely, a systematic review and meta-analysis of nineteen studies by Jutkowitz et al. to evaluate the efficacy of selected nonpharmacological care-delivery interventions including staff training, care-delivery models and environment changes in reducing agitation and aggression in care home dementia residents found insufficient evidence to prove that the behavioral management techniques are any more effective than the usual care in improving agitation and aggression in dementia patients.

When assessing the safety of ECT, Acharya et al. analyzed 23 subjects who had 12 ECT courses to treat their symptoms of agitation and aggression. They report that the use of antipsychotic medications for agitation and aggression symptoms was significantly reduced during the period of the ECT treatment. Acharya et al. suggest that ECT may be considered a suitable, safe and effective treatment for some patients with dementia whose behavioral disturbances are unresponsive to the standard non-pharmacological interventions and pharmacotherapy, or are not able to tolerate the latter.

In another experimental study, Yang et al. assess the efficacy of aroma-acupressure and aromatherapy in the treatment of dementia-related agitation. Although agitation improved in both groups, aroma-acupressure showed a better effect than aromatherapy in reducing agitation in dementia patients. They recommend future studies are necessary to further explore the benefits of aroma-acupressure and aromatherapy in treating agitation in dementia patients.

Several further studies have discussed various positive findings that promote the safety and efficacy of non-pharmacological approaches at improving dementia-related agitations in care facilities. Although, a recent review by Abraha et al. that analyzes three studies of differing design, involving 144 dementia persons, assessing whether simulated presence therapy intervention using video or audiotape recordings of family members played to dementia person, helps in reducing agitation and distressed symptoms. They concluded there to be inadequate evidence available to believe simulated presence therapy intervention has significant efficacy in treating behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia patients.

### Pain treatments for nursing home residents with advanced dementia and substantial impaired communication: a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of a cluster randomized controlled trial [^117HhCm5]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This is a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of a cluster randomized controlled trial to identify factors associated with the use of pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain treatments by nursing home residents with dementia and impaired communication.

Methods

One hundred thirty-four residents with dementia and impaired communication were recruited. Nine of them were excluded because data on their pain treatments were missing, resulting in 125 for analysis. Hierarchical generalized estimating equations analyses controlling for the clustering effect of nursing homes were used to identify factors associated with the use of pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain treatments.

Results

Although all participants had a confirmed pain condition, only 23 (18.4%) and 45 (36%) had received pharmacological or nonpharmacological pain treatments, respectively. Participants with a higher ability to communicate (P = 0.031) and fewer pain locations were found to be more likely to receive pain medications, with the impact of communication ability being greater among participants with better cognitive status than among those with poor cognitive status. Participants who had been living in the home longer and who were more dependent were less likely to receive nonpharmacological treatments.

Conclusion

Suboptimal pain management was common among this population. Severe impairment in the ability to communicate is a major reason for the underuse of pain medications. Staff may become desensitized and fail to perceive subtle changes in the residents' behavior as indicative of pain, leading to the underadministering of nonpharmacological treatments. To improve this situation, it is suggested that observational pain assessments be systematically carried out in nursing homes.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^116R9Hiu]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Meanwhile, as agitation in dementia patients may be due to other causes, focusing to alleviate pain and sleep disorders problems, and discontinuation of inappropriate medications may markedly help the management of behavioral symptoms related to dementia. Likewise, dealing with hypothesized unmet needs of dementia patients play remarkable role in managing agitation-related symptoms in dementia. The latter point was further buttressed by Jakobson et al. who demonstrated that patient specific intervention programs that aim to address unmet needs have proven evidence in reducing agitation in dementia patients.

Abraha et al. present an overview of nonpharmacological interventions for behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia through systematic overview of 38 systematic reviews and 142 primary studies comprising different categories of nonpharmacological interventions. They studied various sensory stimulation interventions (acupuncture, aromatherapy, massage therapy, light therapy, sensory garden intervention, cognitive stimulation, music/singing and dance therapy, snoezelen and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy); with cognitive/emotion-oriented interventions; behavioral management technique; and other interventions including exercise therapy, pet-therapy and special care unit. Abraha et al. found that music therapy is the only effective nonpharmacological sensory intervention that reduces agitation in dementia patients. This finding is corroborated by other previous studies (Ridder et al; Sung and Chang; Ray and Mittelman), which demonstrated significant beneficial effects of music therapy in reducing symptoms of agitation in dementia patients. Meanwhile, in another randomized trial by Vink et al. comparing the effects of music therapy with general day activities on agitation in 77 dementia persons resident in nursing home, claimed that both music therapy and recreational activities only resulted in short-term decrease in agitation, and that music therapy did not show any additional beneficial effects over general activities.

Searching for peer-reviewed studies and trials to extract primary and secondary measures

The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, at the Medical Sciences Division at Oxford University, manages the ALOIS database, which is a comprehensive and open-access database of dementia studies. ALOIS is updated by monthly searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organisation International Clinical Trial Registry Platform meta-registry, Cochrane Controlled Register of Controlled Trials, and LILACs (via Bireme). The database contains records of randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and other "open-label" studies. The ALOIS database was used to extract measurement instruments used in existing studies evaluating nonpharmacological interventions from inception in 2008 to July 2019.

Searching for peer-reviewed reviews and reports of measurement instrument development

The following databases were searched for reviews (of interventions, outcomes, and measurement instruments) and publications that report on or describe the development of an instrument:

MEDLINE
PsycINFO
CINAHL
SocINDEX
COSMIN database of reviews

For the COSMIN database, all relevant reviews categorized under the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems were searched. For the other databases, searches extracted records for a period covering the last 10 years from January 2009 to December 2019. Three search strings were designed. Two search strings focused on dementia and terms designed to focus on outcome measurement instruments. Added to these were strings tailored to each of the 13 outcome items and the initial conceptual domains used to categorize the outcome items in the Delphi survey. The two search strings are outlined below. These were followed by search strings designed to focus on each outcome item and conceptual domain (for string 3 see Supplementary Appendix 1):

### Beyond the medication pass: attitudes, ethics, agency, and antipsychotic medications in assisted living / residential care [^1123mmfm]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Assisted living and residential care (AL/RC) is a significant segment of the long-term services and supports sector in the United States. Of the estimated 918 700 AL/RC residents in the United States, 49% have an Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD) diagnosis. Over 70% of AL/RC residents living with ADRD or cognitive impairment experience behavioral expressions. Behavioral expressions can include aggression, agitation, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, and sleeplessness. Chronic or severe behavioral expressions have implications for residents' quality of life, family and caregiver burden, and care transitions.

Existing guidelines and practices encourage psychosocial or environmental interventions as the first line of treatment in managing behavioral expressions as a person-centered, safe, alternative to medication. When nonpharmaceutical interventions fail or a resident is in considerable, persistent distress, pharmaceutical management of behaviors using psychotropic medication may be appropriate. Psychotropic medications interact with the central nervous system and include the following drug classes: antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, and mood stabilizers.

Though every psychotropic medication class is associated with significant risks in older adult populations, antipsychotic medications have received explicit empirical and regulatory attention. In the early 2000s, studies demonstrated that off-label use of antipsychotic medications in older adults with dementia was associated with a higher risk of early mortality, leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue a "black box" warning on antipsychotic medication use (APU) in older adults. Given the prevalence of older adults living with dementia in long-term residential care settings, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services developed quality improvement efforts related to the use of these medications, forming the National Partnership for Quality Dementia Care, which has been associated with reductions in APU in nursing home populations over time. There is still lack of evidence regarding how antipsychotic medications are used, staff training and implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions, uptake of other psychotropic medications beyond antipsychotics, or potential discrimination against older adults whose behaviors are deemed "challenging" within the AL/RC context.

### Effectiveness of expanded implementation of STAR-VA for managing dementia-related behaviors among veterans [^113QUFqF]. The Gerontologist (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Study

Nonpharmacological, psychosocial approaches are first-line treatments for managing behavioral symptoms in dementia, but they can be challenging to implement in long-term care settings. The Veterans Health Administration implemented STAR-VA, an interdisciplinary behavioral approach for managing challenging dementia-related behaviors in its Community Living Center (CLCs, nursing home care) settings. This study describes how the program was implemented and provides an evaluation of Veteran clinical outcomes and staff feedback on the intervention.

Design and Methods

One mental health professional and registered nurse team from 17 CLCs completed STAR-VA training, which entailed an experiential workshop followed by 6 months of expert consultation as they worked with their teams to implement STAR-VA with Veterans identified to have challenging dementia-related behaviors. The frequency and severity of target behaviors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and agitation were evaluated at baseline and at intervention completion. Staff provided feedback regarding STAR-VA feasibility and impact.

Results

Seventy-one Veterans completed the intervention. Behaviors clustered into 6 types: care refusal or resistance, agitation, aggression, vocalization, wandering, and other. Frequency and severity of target behaviors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and agitation all significantly decreased, with overall effect sizes of 1 or greater. Staff rated both benefits for Veterans and program feasibility favorably.

Implications

This evaluation supports the feasibility and effectiveness of STAR-VA, an interdisciplinary, behavioral intervention for managing challenging behaviors among residents with dementia in CLCs.

### Efficacy of nonpharmacologic interventions for agitation in advanced dementia: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^11742Aaw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken to determine the efficacy of nonpharmacologic individualized interventions (individualized to address unmet needs such as boredom or pain) in decreasing agitation in persons with dementia.

Method

Agitated nursing home residents with advanced dementia (from 9 nursing homes in 5 locations in Maryland, United States) were randomized into an intervention group (n = 89) and a placebo control group (n = 36). On the basis of data from baseline assessment, a systematic methodology for individualizing nonpharmacologic interventions, Treatment Routes for Exploring Agitation (TREA), was used with the intervention group: an unmet need was hypothesized, a corresponding treatment category was identified, and specifics of the treatment were chosen to fit the person's need, past identity, preferences, and abilities. (Unmet needs were hypothesized based on physician evaluations, structured staff interviews, relative questionnaires, direct observations of agitation with the Agitation Behavior Mapping Instrument [the primary outcome measure] and affect with Lawton's Modified Behavior Stream [the secondary outcome measure], and resident assessments.) TREA interventions were implemented for 2 weeks, and observations of agitation and affect were recorded. The study was conducted from June 2006 until December 2011.

Results

Relative to a control group, TREA interventions for unmet needs produced statistically significant declines in total (P < .001), physical nonaggressive (P < .001), and verbal agitation (P = 0.004) and significant increases in pleasure (P < .001) and interest (P < .05).

Conclusions

This is the first large randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of TREA and one of only a few such trials of nonpharmacologic interventions for agitation in persons with dementia. The translation of these findings into practice is sorely needed and would require structural changes dedicating staff time to observing each agitated resident, determining unmet needs, obtaining appropriate intervention materials, conducting the individualized nonpharmacologic interventions, and evaluating results.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112hzVdL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — psychosis and agitation management emphasizes nonpharmacological interventions first with careful risk–benefit assessment. Clinicians must weigh the risk of not treating against the risks of active treatment and the consideration and use of behavioral, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic treatments is particularly critical. If symptoms cause significant distress or are associated with behavior that may place the patient or others at risk, treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication is indicated in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and treatment with an antipsychotic is also indicated if a patient is agitated or combative in the absence of psychosis, with the use of these agents reevaluated and their benefit documented on an ongoing basis. When antipsychotics are ineffective, carbamazepine, valproate, or an SSRI may be used in a careful therapeutic trial, and a low-dose benzodiazepine may prove useful for symptoms limited to specific times or settings, noting problematic side effects in elderly patients. Although mood stabilizers and SSRIs are commonly used for agitation, delusions, and aggression, they have not been consistently shown to be effective or safe and should not be seen as having improved safety or comparable efficacy compared to antipsychotics. As illness evolves, the continued use of any intervention must be evaluated and justified on an ongoing basis, and periodic reevaluation and revision of the treatment plan, including a change in dose, a change in medication, or medication discontinuation, may be indicated, with patients whose initial symptom severity was relatively low potentially more easily withdrawn from psychotropics.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^112SDEBf]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Because of increased longevity, the number of people being diagnosed with dementia is on the rise. In the year 2015 alone, an estimated 9.9 million new cases of dementia was expected to be diagnosed worldwide, equivalent to one new case of dementia in every 3.2 s. World Alzheimer Report in 2015 estimates about 46.8 million people worldwide have dementia. These numbers are projected to almost double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050. In the United States of America, the Alzheimer's Association claims over 5 million of Americans have dementia, and by the year 2050, it is estimated that up to 16 million Americans will have dementia.

The 2015 global societal economic cost of dementia was estimated at US$818bn, and this is expected to rise to a trillion dollars by the year 2018. In the United States, in 2010, the yearly monetary cost per person with dementia varied from $41 689 to $56 290. The American Alzheimer's Association claim the monetary costs alone attributable to dementia were $172 billion.

Unfortunately, during the course of their disease, over 90% of dementia patients will suffer from psychiatric or behavioral problems commonly referred to as neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia patients include agitation, delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy and aberrant motor activity that include wandering. Agitation, being one of the most commonly observed neuropsychiatric symptoms, is reported to be found in up to 70% of dementia patients. A longitudinal observational study in Dutch nursing homes, where 372 residents with dementia were followed up for 3.5 years (2007–2011) to assess the prevalence and course of symptoms exhibited during dementia illness from the time of admission into care facility to the time of death, found agitation to be the most common prevalent symptom, accounting for up to 71%. Agitation can be described as restless behavior, or improper physical and verbal actions that may cause trouble for family members, caregivers and other service users. Quite commonly, it is associated with caregiver burden that results in the caregivers getting burnout. Likewise, agitation in one resident may trigger agitation in the other residents.

### Nonpharmacological intervention for agitation in dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115sQB6z]. Aging & Mental Health (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for agitation in older adults with dementia.

Methods

Seven electronic databases (to 2004) were searched, and randomized clinical trials employing nonpharmacologic interventions for agitation in dementia published in English or Korean were selected. In addition, the reference lists from relevant review articles and all eligible studies were searched to identify other trials. Interventions were categorized into seven types: sensory intervention, social contact, activities, environmental modification, caregiver training, combination therapy, and behavioral therapy. Studies were abstracted, and data were pooled by intervention category.

Results

Fourteen studies (n = 586) were included. Sensory interventions were statistically significantly effective in reducing agitation (standardized mean difference: SMD -1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.76 to -0.38, p = 0.002), while social contact (SMD -0.19; CI -0.71 to 0.33), activities (SMD -0.20; CI -0.71 to 0.31), environmental modification (weighted mean difference: WMD 1.90; CI -2.82 to 6.62), caregiver training (SMD 0.21; CI -0.15 to 0.57), combination therapy (WMD 1.85; CI -1.78 to 5.48), and behavioral therapy interventions (SMD -0.27; CI -0.72 to 0.19) were not significantly effective in reducing agitation. These results were consistent among higher quality studies.

Conclusion

This systematic review indicated that among the seven types of nonpharmacological interventions available for agitation in older adults with dementia, only sensory interventions had efficacy in reducing agitation. More trials are needed to confirm this finding and future research should use more rigorous methods.

### Neuropsychiatric management of young-onset dementias [^115WjaWN]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

A combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches is necessary for the appropriate neuropsychiatric management of patients with young-onset dementia. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including psychological management, environmental strategies, and caregiver's support, should be the first choice for neuropsychiatric management. Pharmacologic interventions differ according to the underlying causes of dementia; thus, differential diagnoses are very important. Antipsychotics should be prescribed carefully; they should be used for the shortest time possible, at the lowest possible dose.

### Evaluation of personalised, one-to-one interaction using montessori-type activities as a treatment of challenging behaviours in people with dementia: the study protocol of a crossover trial [^111Y7Thb]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dementia is associated with cognitive decline as well as behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD). Agitation (e.g. pacing and calling out) is the most commonly exhibited symptom in older adults with dementia. The prevalence of agitated behaviours amongst persons with dementia in nursing homes is 48–82%. These challenging behaviours are stressful to carers and difficult to treat. Behaviours stemming from pain, major depression or psychosis benefit from treatment with analgesics, antidepressants or antipsychotics. In other cases, psychotropic medications have limited efficacy but are widely used. Some pharmacological interventions are reported to precipitate agitation in nursing home populations and can have adverse effects including confusion, somnolence, gait abnormalities and falls. Therefore, increasingly more attention has been paid to nonpharmacological interventions which are associated with fewer risks.

Three psychologically-oriented paradigms have emerged to explain BPSD and to generate testable interventions. Learning theory asserts that behaviours are reinforced when carers reward them with attention. Calling out, for example, increases in frequency if nursing staff attend to residents when they are noisy but otherwise ignore them. In the unmet needs paradigm, inappropriate behaviours stem from normal human needs - physical, emotional and social - that carers fail to perceive and address. Needs for social interaction and physical movement, for example, might be addressed by carefully selected group activities and exercise. According to the stress threshold model, dementia reduces the capacity to cope with stress, resulting in inappropriate behaviours. Stress levels can be modulated to tolerable levels by attending to signals of distress and alternating periods of rest and activity. In reality, most psychosocial treatments blend elements of all three paradigms.

### Quality improvement in dementia care: dementia management quality measurement set 2018 implementation update [^113zzTZd]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Dementia Management Quality Measurement Set — pharmacologic treatment of dementia: This measure specifies that discussion with patients or their caregivers should occur regarding options for guideline-appropriate pharmacologic treatment and nonpharmacologic behavioral and lifestyle modifications. Recent data in the 2018 review reaffirm this measure. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors in AD and in dementia with Lewy bodies/PD dementia continues to be supported, and a recent consensus statement supported the use of memantine as well. Nonpharmacologic and lifestyle interventions continue to show supportive evidence in the management of dementia of all types, particularly in the context of vascular-related dementia, where there is less evidence in support of pharmacologic interventions.

### Interventions for preventing delirium in older people in institutional long-term care [^115fBnu6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and distressing complication of a range of stressor events including infection, new medications and environment change that is often experienced by older people with frailty and dementia. Older people living in institutional long-term care (LTC)are at high risk of delirium, which increases the risk of admission to hospital, development of or worsening of dementia, and mortality. Delirium is also associated with substantial healthcare costs. Although it is possible to prevent delirium in the hospital setting by providing multicomponent delirium prevention interventions it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTCare effective.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in long term care.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register- on 23 April 2013. The search was as sensitive as possible to identify all studies on ALOIS relating to delirium. We ran additional separate searches in major healthcare databases, trial registers, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and grey literature sources, to ensure that the search was as comprehensive as possible.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cluster-RCTs) of single- and multi componentn on-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in older people (aged 65 years and over) in permanent LTC residence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors examined the titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data, with any disagreements settled by consensus. Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium. Secondary outcomes included new diagnosis of dementia, activities of daily living, quality of life and adverse outcomes. We used risk ratios (RRs)as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time to event data. Main results We included two trials that recruited 3636 participants. Both were complex single-component non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions. Risk of bias for many items was unclear due to inadequate reporting. Notably, there was no evidence of blinding of trial participants or assessors in either trial. One small cluster-RCT (n = 98) of a hydration-based intervention reported no reduction in delirium incidence in the intervention group compared to control (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00, analysis not adjusted for clustering, very low quality evidence). Results were imprecise and there were serious limitations evident in trial design. One large cluster-RCT (n = 3538) of a computerised system to identify medications that may contribute to delirium risk and trigger a pharmacist-led medication review reported a large reduction in delirium incidence (12-month HR 0.42, CI 0.34 to 0.51, moderat equality evidence) but no clear evidence of reduction in hospital admissions (HR 0.89, CI 0.72 to 1.10, moderate quality evidence), in mortality (HR 0.88, CI 0.66 to 1.17, moderate quality evidence) or in falls risk (HR 1.03, CI 0.92 to 1.15, moderate quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Our review identified very limited evidence on interventions for preventing deliriumin older people in LTC. Introduction of a software based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk so that a pharmacist-led medication review and monitoring plan can be initiated may reduce incidence of delirium for older people in institutional LTC. This is based on one large RCT in the United States and may not be practical in other countries which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes. Our review identified only one ongoing pilot trial of a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention and no trials of pharmacological agents. Future trials of computerised medication management systems and multicomponent non-pharmacological and pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence based care for this vulnerable group.

### Do nonpharmacological interventions prevent cognitive decline? a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ZS4NX]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the benefits of nonpharmacological interventions, recent efforts have focused on the study of these interventions. There is no consistent evidence of a benefit for any pharmacologic agent in preventing cognitive decline in healthy older adults. High-quality clinical trials have demonstrated that nonpharmacological methods could improve or maintain cognitive abilities. Although Rodakowski et al.explored the effect of nonpharmacological interventions in slowing decline in older adults with MCI or early-stage dementia, they did not assess the at-risk population of elderly people. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether nonpharmacological interventions play a role in preventing cognitive decline among older people.

### Management of agitation and aggression associated with Alzheimer disease [^114hjdjA]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Agitation and aggression are frequently occurring and distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These symptoms are disturbing for individuals with Alzheimer disease, commonly confer risk to the patient and others, and present a major management challenge for clinicians. The most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for these symptoms-atypical antipsychotics-have a modest but significant beneficial effect in the short-term treatment (over 6–12 weeks) of aggression but limited benefits in longer term therapy. Benefits are less well established for other symptoms of agitation. In addition, concerns are growing over the potential for serious adverse outcomes with these treatments, including stroke and death. A detailed consideration of other pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer disease is, therefore, imperative. This article reviews the increasing evidence in support of psychological interventions or alternative therapies (such as aromatherapy) as a first-line management strategy for agitation, as well as the potential pharmacological alternatives to atypical antipsychotics-preliminary evidence for memantine, carbamazepine, and citalopram is encouraging.

### Predictors of the impact of nonpharmacologic interventions for agitation in nursing home residents with advanced dementia [^1133UFXT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Research is needed to determine specific factors that contribute to the success of nonpharmacologic interventions. In this study, we examined the influence of personal characteristics (demographic, medical, and functional variables) and possible barriers (eg, staff or family barriers) on the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions in reducing agitation.

Method

Agitation was systematically observed at baseline and intervention stages using the Agitation Behavior Mapping Instrument (ABMI) in a sample of 89 residents from 6 Maryland nursing homes (mean age = 85.9 years). Each participant received interventions based on an individualized algorithm (TREA-Treatment Routes for Exploring Agitation), which identifies unmet needs and matches interventions to needs and to the participant's sensory, cognitive, and functional abilities, as well as to self-identity and preferences. The study was conducted between June 2006 and December 2011.

Results

Analyses revealed that decreased levels of agitation during intervention correlated significantly with higher levels of cognitive function (r = 0.36, P < .001), with fewer difficulties in the performance of activities of daily living (r = 0.29, P < .01), speech (r = 0.47, P < .001), communication (r = 0.23, P < .05), and responsiveness (r = 0.28, P < .01). In addition, less reduction of agitation during intervention was significantly related to the presence of staff barriers (eg, refusals, interruptions) (r = -0.38, P < .001) and the occurrence of pain (r = -0.21, P ≤ .05).

Conclusions

The findings elucidate the characteristics of those who are most likely to respond to TREA intervention, and point to the need of systemic changes to reduce staff-related barriers and to improve methodologies for increasing the impact of intervention on those at the lowest levels of functioning.

### Dementia-related agitation: a review of non-pharmacological interventions and analysis of risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy [^112mVQUm]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Recommended management for dementia-related agitation and other behavioral symptoms involve non-pharmacological interventions and pharmacotherapy. The American (including the American Associations for Geriatric Psychiatry), British and Canadian Geriatrics Societies recommend non-pharmacological interventions as the first-choice approach in managing dementia-related agitation. However, in emergency situations when non-pharmacological approach is not feasible due to an imminent danger to patient's safety, drug therapy is recommended as a first-line treatment intervention. However, many years on, there is still no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-pharmacotherapy in treating dementia-related agitation. This review discusses the current knowledge of non-pharmacological interventions and analyses the risks and benefits associated with pharmacotherapy in the management of dementia-related agitation, as well as providing an anecdotal of the author's clinical experience.

### Nonpharmacologic approaches are better than medication to… [^114CPjdn]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best approach to agitated patients with dementia. Bottom Line Nonpharmacologic approaches to agitation or aggression in patients with dementia are more effective than medication. Outdoor activities, multidisciplinary care, and massage and touch therapy with or without music are all effective. Synopsis The authors searched five databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL and bibliographies of retrieved studies, identifying 163 randomized controlled studies of 23, 143 patients that compared interventions for treating aggression and agitation in adults with dementia. Two investigators independently selected, abstracted, and evaluated the studies. Almost one-half of the studies were categorized as being at high risk of bias, mostly because of missing outcome data.

Because not every intervention is directly compared with one another, the authors performed a network analysis, which allows indirect comparisons based on a common comparator. Typical antipsychotics provided no additional benefit compared with modifying instrumental activities of daily living. Cannabinoids and dextromethorphan/quinidine were moderately more effective than instrumental activity of daily living modification. Outdoor activity, multidisciplinary care, and massage and touch therapy, with or without music, were effective in producing a large reduction in aggression and agitation.

### Effect of ambient bright light on behavioral and psychological symptoms in people with dementia: a systematic review [^113wa1kS]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Significance of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia

Up to 97% of persons living with dementia experience behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD;). Common BPSD includes agitation, aggression, wandering, apathy, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. BPSD results in significant negative consequences, including functional decline, poor quality of life, and caregiver burden. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended as the first-line treatment, but most are labor-intensive and show mixed effects on BPSD. Therefore, identifying effective and feasible nonpharmacological interventions to reduce BPSD is imperative. One such promising intervention is changes in lighting conditions in the living environment.

Impact of Bright Light for Persons with Dementia

Over the past two decades, research has tested the impact of bright light (BL) on BPSD. Evidence suggests that poor sleep, circadian disruption, short daylight exposures, and BPSD are associated with interior daylight conditions, with the most robust evidence concerning depressive symptoms and agitation. Persons living with dementia have degenerative changes in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which is responsible for generating a circadian rhythm. This degeneration can deteriorate biological rhythm and contribute to agitation. Light is the strongest external stimuli regulating the circadian rhythm; yet persons living with dementia, especially those residing in shared residential settings, are not exposed to sufficient sunlight to maintain a stable rhythm. Based on this biological basis, BL interventions work to mimic exposure to natural light and regulate SCN, maintain a stable circadian rhythm, and reduce BPSD. Moreover, lighting interventions are noninvasive and have minimal adverse effects, making them ideal nonpharmacological interventions for persons living with dementia.

### Guideline summary: assessment, diagnosis, care and support for people with dementia and their carers [Scottish intercollegiate guidelines network SIGN guideline 168] [^114q1hpH]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the most rapidly evolving aspects of dementia care is around biomarkers. With new developments in blood-based biomarkers, there is a danger that the evidence-based recommendations given here, and indeed in any contemporary guideline, may soon be outdated. SIGN differs from some other guidelines in that it fully considers the implementation requirements of the recommendations made. Given the limited UK access to technologies such as amyloid PET imaging, the recommendation that advanced imaging should not (yet) be routine seems appropriate locally but may not be relevant to other healthcare systems.

Although the anticipation with any SIGN guideline is that the guidance will be useful to all clinicians, the primary evidence users are the Scottish Health and Care systems. For dementia, more so than in other diseases, the guidance given was adapted to suit the local context. For example, the section on postdiagnostic support recognised that it is already a national standard to provide a year of a postdiagnostic support package. This explains why the focus of recommendations is more around the delivery of support, rather than asking whether the approach works or the optimal intervention content. NICE guidance does not use the terminology of postdiagnostic support instead referencing the need for review after diagnosis and care coordination, with a resource coauthored with the Social Care Institute for Excellence for people with dementia and their carers.

Devoting an entire chapter of the guideline to non-pharmacological treatment of distress is welcome as these approaches are notoriously under-used in many areas of practice, including in dementia. Despite this, clinicians might be left frustrated at the lack of clearer guidance on individual therapies and specific instructions on what they should actually do when faced with a person with dementia in distress. This is partly down to a limited base but mostly reflects the diversity of personalities, preferences and needs of those living with dementia, such that only a person-centred, multi-component assessment and individually tailored interventions could be recommended for all. In this section, and in other sections throughout the guideline, evidence-based recommendations are made, but the specifics of how these should be implemented are often left to practitioners. This offers a degree of flexibility for clinicians and teams, but for areas such as management of distress, where there are so many theories and models, more operationalised guidance may have been preferred.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^114CUZ5x]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Site-specific issues — home care for dementia: The majority of Americans with dementia reside in the community, although as many as 90% will receive long-term care during their lifetimes, and providing care at home can also have adverse emotional effects on caregivers. Depressive disorders are common in caregivers, with an estimated 30% of spousal caregivers experiencing a depressive disorder and the prevalence among adult children ranging from 22% to 37%. Multifaceted family interventions that provide emotional support, focus on specific behavior problems, and include careful monitoring of pharmacological treatment have demonstrated efficacy in reducing caregiver depression, caregiver burden, and rate of nursing home placement. The use of home health aides, day care, and respite care may provide stimulation for patients and needed relief for caregivers. End-of-life care is extremely demanding, with many family caregivers reporting high levels of depressive symptoms while caring for relatives with dementia; however, within 3 months of the death, caregivers experience significant declines in depressive symptoms.

### The outcomes of a person-centered, non-pharmacological intervention in reducing agitation in residents with dementia in Australian rural nursing homes [^111nr3hf]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In Australia, 60–70% of the people residing in nursing homes have dementia and about 70–90% of residents with dementia suffer from psychiatric or behavioral symptoms. These behaviors include agitation, mood dysregulation, and disturbed thoughts and perceptions, which pose a major challenge for the residents with dementia and nursing home staff. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms are associated with diminished quality of life of the residents and increased difficulty associated with caregiving for the staff. Agitation is often the most common challenging behavioral symptom being reported in 70% of dementia residents. However, nursing home staff in rural Australia have poor understanding of appropriate methods of management and lack of adequate resources to manage behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, including agitation in dementia. There is an overwhelming need to build best-practice evidence to address the residents' behavioral problems, leading to improve patient outcomes and staff quality of life in rural nursing homes.

Evidence of non-pharmacological interventions is growing and have been recommended to be pursued at first instance, rather than pharmacological treatments, in the management of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of residents with dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended to be person-centered to truly mitigate behavioral symptoms in residents with dementia. Person-centered dementia care accentuates well-being and quality of life as regarded by the individual with dementia and their family members and creating an environment that considers the person's past life and current status. However, there is shortage of staff education and adequate training in rural nursing homes to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence in the use of evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions in person-centered care. Staff turnover, challenges in recruiting and retaining skilled staff, lack of resources compared to metropolitan areas pose major challenges for rural nursing homes.

### Are interventions for formal caregivers effective for improving dementia care? A systematic review of systematic reviews [^1122JWEs]. Innovation in Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Theoretical Frameworks

None of the six systematic reviews described a theoretical framework guiding the review. Regarding theoretical frameworks or models used within the individual RCTs, there was an overall lack of reporting on this in the systematic reviews.reported that they identified no theoretical models presented in the two intervention study publications focused on formal caregivers. Additionally, stated that out of five RCTs focused on formal dementia caregivers, the trials byandwere the only ones that were theory-led, but no information is conveyed regarding which theories guided the work. The other four reviews did not provide information on theoretical frameworks or models.

Educational Interventions Categorizations

We found inconsistencies in how the authors of the systematic reviews categorized intervention types. For example, used a broad category, nursing and staff training approaches, to encompass all training programs reviewed, including an RCT on dementia-care mapping and person-centered care, which were reported as individual intervention categories by other authors. In the systematic review by, the authors described conceptual challenges with grouping training interventions and created a category named "unique comparisons" for some of the interventions reviewed. A full description of 15 intervention categories that the individual systematic review authors prescribed is given in Table 2.

Due to the inconsistencies of categorizations of interventions by the systematic review authors, we examined each intervention as reported in the original RCT publication and developed our own categorization of interventions by educational foci. We identified five categories that are expanded on further below: communication techniques; general dementia education; nonpharmacological, behavioral interventions; person-centered care; and strengths-based care.

Communication techniques

Three educational interventions focused on communication techniques for working with persons living with dementia.

General dementia care

Six interventions delivered training in general dementia care, which included multiple modules covering topics such as description of dementia, person-centered care, behavioral management, and communication techniques.

Nonpharmacological, behavioral interventions

Fourteen interventions fell under the category of nonpharmacological, behavioral interventions. Thirteen interventions focused on training formal dementia caregivers on behavioral management techniques specific to persons living with dementia. An additional intervention evaluated the use of referrals to a multidisciplinary psychogeriatric team that included psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and community nurses to develop a management plan aligning the needs of the person living with dementia residing in residential care facilities.

### Behavioral disturbance in dementia [^111jHJN1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Behavioral disturbances are frequently the most challenging manifestations of dementia and are exhibited in almost all people with dementia. Common behavioral disturbances can be grouped into four categories: mood disorders (e.g., depression, apathy, euphoria); sleep disorders (insomnia, hypersomnia, night-day reversal); psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations); and agitation (e.g., pacing, wandering, sexual disinhibition, aggression). They are often persistent, greatly diminish quality of life of patients and their family caregivers, cause premature institutionalization, and pose a high economic burden on the patient, family, and society. Behavioral disturbances can be prevented and treated with a multifaceted approach that supports dignity and promotes comfort and quality of life of persons with dementia and their family members. Management involves prompt treatment of reversible factors and management of symptoms using primarily individualized nonpharmacological interventions. Pharmacological interventions need to be restricted to behavioral emergencies and for short-term treatment of behavioral disturbances that pose imminent danger to self or others.
