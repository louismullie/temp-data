## Question

Can hemoglobin and lead be done by finger prick for screening pediatric patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hemoglobin and lead can be done by finger prick for screening pediatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and what "screening" implies. Then, I should verify the evidence for capillary hemoglobin testing, including accuracy and guideline support. Next, I will examine the evidence for capillary blood lead testing, including sensitivity, specificity, and confirmatory requirements. After that, I need to consider operational and quality-assurance issues that affect feasibility in practice. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats and follow-up steps, making sure I anchor to authoritative sources and correct any outdated thresholds along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Screening typically means a rapid, acceptable test used to identify children who may have a condition, with the understanding that abnormal results warrant confirmatory testing and appropriate follow-up; for hemoglobin, we are generally screening for anemia, and for lead, we are screening for elevated blood lead levels that warrant public health or medical action, so I need to ensure any capillary method I endorse meets that bar for accuracy and follow-through [^eec1e953] [^09988c60].

> Now, for hemoglobin, I should verify whether finger-prick capillary testing is accurate enough for screening. Wait, let me verify the comparative performance. Multiple studies and reviews show that when capillary hemoglobin is measured with quality-controlled point-of-care devices and proper technique, sensitivity and specificity can be high and agreement with venous laboratory hemoglobin is strong, supporting its use for screening in children, including toddlers and preschoolers [^95fb5b69] [^872daddb]. Hold on, I should also check guideline alignment; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal hemoglobin screening at 12 months, and while it does not mandate the sampling method, capillary testing is commonly used in practice and quality-improvement work for its feasibility and acceptability in young children [^eec1e953] [^fd742238]. I need to ensure I note the caveat that venous sampling remains the reference standard for definitive diagnosis or when results are discordant or quality is questionable [^95fb5b69].

> For lead, I should confirm whether capillary finger-stick testing is acceptable for screening and what the confirmatory pathway looks like. The CDC and AAP endorse capillary blood lead testing as an acceptable screening method, but elevated capillary results must be confirmed with a venous blood lead level before making clinical decisions, given the risk of external contamination and analytic variability at low levels [^a3da981a] [^b2f6c1aa]. Let me double-check the test performance; a high-quality evidence review found capillary testing had sensitivity around 87–91% and specificity greater than 90% compared with venous measurement, which supports its utility for screening when properly collected and confirmed [^3ad05fbc]. But wait, what if the child is in a high-risk group or the result is near the action threshold? I should confirm that confirmatory venous testing is still recommended in those scenarios, and indeed CDC guidance emphasizes venous confirmation for any elevated capillary result and for ongoing management decisions [^a3da981a] [^09988c60].

> Next, I should review operational and quality-assurance considerations that can make or break screening programs. Capillary testing improves uptake and completion rates in real-world pediatric settings, and point-of-care lead programs have been shown to substantially increase screening rates at 1- and 2-year visits, which is a practical advantage over venous-only workflows [^77525f6c] [^fd742238]. Hold on, I should verify the quality caveats: proper skin cleaning, avoiding milking or squeezing, using lead-free collection devices, and ensuring free-flow blood are critical to minimize contamination and hemolysis; documentation of sampling conditions and device QC is essential for reliable results, especially for lead at low concentrations [^a3da981a] [^50daddbe]. I need to ensure I also note that as population blood lead levels fall, laboratories may need tighter proficiency and contamination controls to accurately detect values near the current reference level, reinforcing the need for confirmatory venous testing when results are elevated or uncertain [^3f55924e].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating anything. Yes, hemoglobin and lead can both be screened using finger-prick capillary samples in children, provided that hemoglobin is measured with validated point-of-care devices and standardized technique, and that lead is collected with meticulous skin preparation and lead-free materials with a plan to confirm any elevated capillary result with a venous blood lead level before treatment or case management decisions [^95fb5b69] [^a3da981a]. I should confirm the follow-up steps: for hemoglobin below the age-specific threshold, confirm with a CBC and evaluate for iron deficiency; for lead at or above the local reference value, confirm venously, assess exposure sources, and initiate case management per CDC guidance, recognizing that the current reference value is 3.5 µg/dL and that jurisdictional action levels may vary [^c0fbc504] [^09988c60].

> But wait, what if someone cites older action levels or outdated thresholds? I should double-check and correct that. Earlier literature and some older guidance referenced a 10 µg/dL action level; however, CDC updated the blood lead reference value to 3.5 µg/dL in 2021, and clinical decisions should align with current local and CDC recommendations, even though the confirmatory principle for capillary results remains unchanged [^c0fbc504] [^413816cc]. I need to ensure I also emphasize that screening questionnaires alone are insufficiently sensitive for lead risk identification, so direct blood testing remains the cornerstone of detection strategies in at-risk children [^3ad05fbc] [^09988c60].

> Final recommendation, keeping it clinically actionable: finger-prick capillary testing is appropriate for pediatric screening of hemoglobin and lead when performed with validated devices, proper technique, and quality controls, with the explicit understanding that any elevated capillary lead result must be confirmed by a venous blood lead level before definitive management, and that hemoglobin results should be interpreted in clinical context with confirmatory testing as indicated for diagnosis or discordant results [^95fb5b69] [^a3da981a] [^eec1e953].

Capillary fingerstick testing is **acceptable for pediatric screening** of hemoglobin and lead, but **confirmatory venous testing is required** for abnormal lead results [^a3da981a] and for hemoglobin when results are discordant or clinical suspicion is high [^notfound]. Capillary hemoglobin is **accurate and practical** for routine screening [^95fb5b69], whereas capillary lead is **sensitive but prone to contamination**; therefore, elevated capillary lead must always be confirmed venously [^a3da981a] [^3ad05fbc]. Proper technique and quality control are essential to minimize errors [^50daddbe].

## Hemoglobin screening by finger prick

### Accuracy and reliability

Capillary hemoglobin measured by point-of-care devices (e.g. HemoCue) shows **strong agreement with venous hemoglobin** [^notfound] and is widely used in pediatric screening programs [^95fb5b69]. Studies report high sensitivity and specificity when devices are maintained and operators are trained [^95fb5b69]. Limitations include potential for **microclot formation**, **hemolysis**, or **dilution errors** if technique is poor; results may also be affected by poor perfusion or anemia severity [^993321c8].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends universal hemoglobin screening at **12 months** [^e68eac08], and capillary testing is acceptable in routine care [^notfound]. Capillary hemoglobin is appropriate for screening in primary care, WIC, and community programs, with venous confirmation when results are abnormal or clinical suspicion persists [^notfound].

---

## Lead screening by finger prick

### Accuracy and reliability

Capillary blood lead testing is **sensitive and specific** compared with venous testing, with sensitivity 87–91% and specificity > 90% in high-quality studies [^3ad05fbc]. However, capillary samples are **vulnerable to external contamination** from skin surface lead or improper collection, which can cause false positives [^3f55924e].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

CDC and AAP endorse capillary lead screening for **high-risk children** [^a3da981a], but **elevated capillary results must be confirmed venously** before clinical decisions or public health actions [^a3da981a]. Medicaid-enrolled children should be screened at 12 and 24 months, and again at 36–72 months if not previously tested [^b6543413].

---

## Practical considerations and limitations

| **Factor** | **Hemoglobin screening** | **Lead screening** |
|-|-|-|
| Accuracy | High agreement with venous samples when technique is good [^95fb5b69] | Sensitivity 87–91%; specificity > 90% [^3ad05fbc] |
| Contamination risk | Low | High (external lead on skin) [^3f55924e] |
| Confirmatory testing | Venous confirmation if abnormal or discordant [^notfound] | Mandatory venous confirmation if elevated [^a3da981a] |
| Clinical acceptance | Widely accepted for routine screening [^notfound] | Accepted with mandatory confirmation [^a3da981a] |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Hemoglobin**: Capillary fingerstick testing is accurate and acceptable for routine pediatric screening; confirm abnormal results venously if clinical suspicion is high or results are discordant [^notfound].

- **Lead**: Capillary fingerstick testing is acceptable for screening, but any elevated result must be confirmed with a venous blood lead level before clinical action [^a3da981a] [^3ad05fbc].

- **Quality assurance**: Use validated devices, train staff, and follow standardized collection procedures to minimize errors [^50daddbe].

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia among children and... [^2d46e812]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Case Study Reflecting on your last office session, you recall several pediatric visits. Among these was a visit from a six-month-old infant who was brought in for a checkup and completion of papers for the Women, Infants and Children program. You ordered blood work for this infant, because it was required by the program. While most of these blood draws for infants in the WIC program are normal, on occasion, anemia is detected. You begin to wonder if it might be worthwhile to screen all pediatric patients for anemia rather than miss an occasional case. D. The USPSTF recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia for all children at least once between the ages of two and 10 years. E. The USPSTF recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia for all children at least once before beginning elementary school. Which one of the following additional laboratory parameters is most useful in the detection of iron deficiency anemia. A. Mean corpuscular volume. B.

Red blood cell distribution width. C. Serum ferritin. D. Serum iron. E. Transferrin. Significantly better mental and motor development after four months of therapy among high-risk children with hemoglobin levels less than 10. 5 g per dL 4, 5 has been demonstrated in the largest of controlled trials on the benefits of correcting iron deficiency, although some other studies have produced inconsistent results. While capillary blood sampling is often preferred because of the ease of collection, venous specimens are more reliable for the detection of iron deficiency anemia. Results from one study revealed the capillary microhematocrit to have a sensitivity of 90 percent and a specificity of 44 percent when compared with values obtained from venous blood with an automated cell counter. 8 Children and adolescents who have recently immigrated from developing countries should be screened for iron deficiency anemia.
9. 2.

The answer is A: the USPSTF recommends that high-risk infants be screened for iron deficiency anemia between six to 12 months of age. Screening for iron deficiency anemia is not recommended in the general infant population because of low overall prevalence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed specific criteria for anemia: hemoglobin levels less than 11. 0 g per dL for children between six months and five years of age.

### Lead poisoning in children [^b2f6c1aa]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence and severity of childhood lead poisoning have been greatly reduced since the removal of lead from paint and gasoline in the 1970s. Despite these efforts, approximately 310,000 U.S. children younger than five years have elevated blood lead levels. Health care professionals should perform targeted screening for lead poisoning in children who are Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible, foreign born, or identified as high risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) location-specific recommendations or by a personal risk questionnaire. Venous sampling is the preferred method for measuring blood lead levels, but a carefully collected finger-stick sample is an acceptable alternative. Capillary samples of elevated levels should be confirmed by a venous sample. The CDC recommends that the threshold for follow-up and intervention of lead poisoning be a blood lead level of 10 microg per dL or higher. Recommendations for treatment of elevated blood levels include a thorough environmental investigation, laboratory testing when appropriate, iron supplementation for iron-deficient children, and chelation therapy for blood lead levels of 45 microg per dL or more. Prevention consists of education and avoidance of lead-contaminated products.

### Using health data to highlight milestones: a cookbook for non-profit program managers [^b7eed491]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Childhood lead poisoning—diagnosis through blood lead testing states that overt clinical symptoms are rare at blood lead levels of less than 70 μg/dL, so blood lead testing is necessary to identify asymptomatic children with elevated blood lead levels. Blood lead testing/screening can be conducted through a capillary test (finger stick) or a venous test, and elevated blood lead levels identified through a capillary test are usually confirmed through a venous test. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently defines child blood lead levels of greater than or equal to 5 μg/dL as elevated.

### Are children still at risk for lead poisoning? [^c98abd20]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) has decreased nationally, creating challenges in identifying children at risk.

Methods

In a community known to have lead hazards, we screened children with a field-administered capillary blood lead test and asked parents to complete a questionnaire about lead risk factors.

Results

Of the 77 child-parent pairs screened with a blood lead test and a parental questionnaire, 4 had finger stick blood lead levels of ≥10 µg/dL. Of these, one child had a confirmatory venous blood lead level >10 µg/dL (1.3%; 95% CI = 0.0%-4.7%), which is near the US prevalence but less than the historic prevalence for this region. A median of 2 risk factors for each of the environmental, behavioral, and knowledge/awareness domains were noted.

Conclusions

Despite a low prevalence of children with EBLL, parental report suggested that approximately 29% of children had lead-based paint in their home environment.

Alternative screening technologies for blood lead screening—since 1997 a portable device approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided instant results, with the most recent version not requiring specific laboratory certifications; both this device and filter paper can be used with capillary or venous samples, CDC encourages use of capillary sampling where benefits outweigh drawbacks, and elevated capillary blood lead levels (BLLs) should be confirmed through venous blood testing using sound analytic methods.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^a3da981a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Blood lead level (BLL) testing accuracy and specimen collection—Federal regulations allow laboratories that perform blood lead testing to operate with a total allowable error of ± 4 µg/dL or ±10%, whichever is greater, so at BLLs ≤10 µg/dL a laboratory might operate within an error range of 8 µg/dL and still meet federal proficiency standards; for example, an actual value of 7 µg/dL could be reported as 3 µg/dL to 11 µg/dL and remain within the allowable error limit. Duplicate testing of identical samples with a mean blood lead value <10 µg/dL at eight laboratories reported all results as <10 µg/dL and within 3 µg/dL of the overall mean, and a 2006 study indicated the majority of laboratories can achieve routine performance of ± 2 µg/dL at concentrations of ≤ 10 µg/dL without difficulty. Collection of capillary blood from a fingerstick into a lead-free collection device is an accepted method for obtaining a screening test, but because capillary and venous values can differ in the same person, elevated capillary results should be confirmed with blood drawn by venipuncture; multiple studies have reported uncertainty at thresholds of 10 µg/dL or 15 µg/dL, and none has examined the sensitivity or specificity of capillary methods at thresholds <10 µg/dL.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^7001ecc6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Blood lead screening and targeted risk assessment—CDC recommendations specify ages and high-risk follow-up: CDC recommends that locally developed targeted risk assessment and blood lead screening strategies be applied at ages 1 and 2 years, and children aged 36–72 months who have been identified as being at high risk and who have not been screened previously also should receive a blood lead test. For clinicians in areas that lack a state or local screening plan, CDC recommends that a blood lead test be performed on all children at ages 1 and 2 years and on children aged 36–72 months who have not been screened previously. Because exposures may change, two routine screenings are recommended (at approximately ages 1 and 2 years). Among children in Chicago at high risk with blood lead levels (BLLs) <10 μg/dL at age 1 year, 21% had a BLL of ≥10 μg/dL when tested again at age ≥2 years. Certain local health departments recommend BLL testing starting at ages 6–9 months in high risk areas, testing every 6 months for children aged <2 years, and additional education and more rapid follow-up testing for children aged <12 months with BLLs 6–9 μg/dL.

Pediatric screening practice and burden—screening is common in regular pediatric care with age-based recommendations, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal newborn screening for metabolic conditions, hemoglobinopathy, and hearing loss, with selective screening for elevated lead; however, such programs are "not always evidence-based," and "a recommendation for universal screening requires a high burden of proof" because screening is performed on "asymptomatic individuals," downstream consequences may be "not obvious," and "widespread screening programs are costly."

### Healthy housing reference manual [^d6d4bab1]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Blood lead testing thresholds and actions (Centers of Disease Control 1991 guidance) indicate that tests are from drawn blood, not from a finger-stick test, which can be unreliable if performed improperly, and that units are measured in micrograms per deciliter. Action levels include: Children: 10 μg/dL (level of concern)—find source of lead; Children: 15 μg/dL and above—environmental intervention, counseling, medical monitoring; Children: 20 μg/dL and above—medical treatment; Adults: 25 μg/dL (level of concern)—find source of lead; and Adults: 50 μg/dL—Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard for medical removal from the worksite.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^8e5ec2b5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations—For clinicians, provide anticipatory guidance to parents of all young children regarding sources of lead and help them identify sources of lead in their child’s environment. Evaluate laboratory performance by reviewing the laboratory’s quality control chart or statistical quality control summary, and review office procedures and policies to ensure that lead exposure risk assessment or blood lead screening is performed on all children as required by state or local health officials or as recommended by CDC. Consider the child’s age, season of testing, and exposure history when deciding when to obtain follow-up blood lead tests; for a child whose blood lead level (BLL) is approaching 10 µg/dL, more frequent blood lead screening (i.e., more than annually) might be appropriate, particularly if the child is aged <2 years old, was tested at the start of warm weather when BLLs tend to increase, or is at high risk for lead exposures. Perform a diagnostic blood lead test on all children suspected of having lead exposure or an elevated BLL and institute the recommended management guidelines if a child’s BLL increases to ≥10 µg/dL. Help parents to understand the uncertainty of a blood lead value and potential reasons for its fluctuation, including error introduced by the sampling methods and laboratory-, age-, and season-related exposures. Whenever possible, utilize laboratories that can achieve routine performance of ±2 µg/dL for blood lead analysis.

### Screening for elevated blood lead levels in childhood and pregnancy: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^3ad05fbc]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Elevated blood lead level is associated with serious, often irreversible, health consequences.

Objective

To synthesize evidence on the effects of screening, testing, and treatment for elevated blood lead level in pregnant women and children aged 5 years and younger in the primary care setting to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Cochrane CENTRAL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through June 2018) and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 2018); surveillance through December 5, 2018.

Study Selection

English-language trials and observational studies of screening for and treating elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers using predefined criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Elevated blood lead level, morbidity, mortality, clinical prediction tools, test accuracy, adverse events.

Results

A total of 24 studies (N=11 433) were included in this review. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening vs no screening in children. More than 1 positive answer on the 5-item 1991 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening questionnaire was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 48% (95% CI, 31.4% to 65.6%) and specificity of 58% (95% CI, 39.9% to 74.0%) for identifying children with a venous blood lead level greater than 10 μg/dL (5 studies [n=2265]). Adapted versions of the CDC questionnaire did not demonstrate improved accuracy. Capillary blood lead testing demonstrated sensitivity of 87% to 91% and specificity greater than 90%, compared with venous measurement (4 studies [n=1431]). Counseling and nutritional interventions or residential lead hazard control techniques did not reduce blood lead concentrations in asymptomatic children, but studies were few and had methodological limitations (7 studies [n=1419]). One trial (n=780) of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) chelation therapy found reduced blood lead levels in children at 1 week to 1 year but not at 4.5 to 6 years, while another trial (n=39) found no effect at 1 and 6 months. Seven-year follow-up assessments showed no effect on neuropsychological development, a small deficit in linear growth (height difference, 1.17 cm [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.93]), and poorer cognitive outcomes reported as the Attention and Executive Functions subscore of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (unadjusted difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -4.5 to 1.0]; adjusted P=.045) in children treated with DMSA chelation. Evidence was too limited to determine the accuracy of screening questionnaires or benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening questionnaires were not accurate for identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Chelating agents in children were not significantly associated with sustained effects on blood level levels but were associated with harms.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^c0fbc504]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Policy Update

The BLRV is a population-based measurement which indicates that 2.5% of U.S. children aged 1–5 years have BLLs ≥3.5 μ g/dL. It is not a health-based standard or a toxicity threshold. The BLRV should be used as a guide to 1) help determine whether medical or environmental follow-up actions should be initiated for an individual child and 2) prioritize communities with the most need for primary prevention of exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Whether a BLL measurement at or above the BLRV triggers medical or environmental follow-up will depend on existing jurisdictional laws, regulations, and resource availability. Follow-up lead testing to confirm BLLs is recommended. CDC strongly advises that providers follow CDC’s Recommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Level.

### Who to test? A retrospective study of lead testing in high-risk children [^86a9b8b5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nearly all pediatric patients in our setting meet high-risk criteria for lead exposure based on screening recommendations and guidelines. Implementation of screening and testing has been inconsistent.

Objective

To assess the utility and efficacy of performing universal lead testing between ages 1 and 5 at an urban academic pediatric practice.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients with routine lead testing between 2010 and 2015. Key variables included demographics, serum lead level, and behavioral diagnoses.

Results

A total of 6597 serum lead levels from 3274 patients were reviewed. Forty-seven samples (0.7%) from 24 patients (0.7%) were elevated. Of the 24 patients with elevated lead, 75% were identified at age 1 or 2. Sixty-seven percent of patients with first elevated lead level at age 3 or older had a diagnosis of developmental delay.

Conclusion

Routine testing of high-risk patients yielded minimal specificity in identifying elevated lead levels, especially in patients older than 3 years and without developmental delay.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^75ae634a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Testing asymptomatic children—screening tools and targeted criteria: Screening questionnaires frequently used in primary care fail to identify children with elevated blood lead concentrations, but they may be useful to identify lead hazards in children who have a blood lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb). In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended universal blood lead testing for all children; in 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that states and cities formulate their own screening recommendations on the basis of local data. The AAP, consistent with the CDC, recommended universal screening if communities had more than 27% of housing built before 1950 or a prevalence of blood lead concentrations ≥10 μg/dL in children 12 to 36 months old of 12% or greater. Screening is not efficient after 36 months of age unless specific high-risk factors are identified, and the likelihood of a child having a blood lead concentration >10 μg/dL after 36 months of age is low. A detailed evaluation and follow-up of children who have blood lead concentrations <10 μg/dL (<100 ppb) is now indicated.

### Primary prevention of pediatric lead exposure requires new approaches to transfusion screening [^4a39c89e]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To facilitate further assessment of transfusion-associated lead exposure by designing a procedure to test packed red blood cells (pRBCs) prepared for transfusion.

Study Design

The relationship between pRBCs and whole blood lead concentration was investigated in 27 samples using a modified clinical assay. Lead concentrations were measured in 100 pRBC units.

Results

Our sample preparation method demonstrated a correlation between whole blood lead and pRBC lead concentrations (R(2) = 0.82). In addition, all 100 pRBC units tested had detectable lead levels. The median pRBC lead concentration was 0.8 μg/dL, with an SD of 0.8 μg/dL and a range of 0.2-4.1 μg/dL. In addition, after only a few days of storage, approximately 25% of whole blood lead was found in the supernatant plasma.

Conclusion

Transfusion of pRBCs is a source of lead exposure. Here we report the quantification of lead concentration in pRBCs. We found a >20-fold range of lead concentrations in the samples tested. Pretransfusion testing of pRBC units according to our proposed approach or donor screening of whole blood lead and selection of below-average units for transfusion to children would diminish an easily overlooked source of pediatric lead exposure.

### Blood lead concentrations among pediatric patients with abdominal pain: a prospective cross-sectional study [^f31642b7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Pediatric patients presenting to the GI clinic of Mofid Pediatric Hospital and the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of Loghman-Hakim Hospital with the chief complaint of abdominal pain were eligible for enrollment. Those younger than 18 years of age were considered for enrollment. The goals and objectives of the study were explained to guardians, and if agreed, written consent was obtained. A pre-enrollment standardized questionnaire was provided to the parents. Questions included the patients' age, sex, weight, height, address, duration of living in their current home, age of the residential building the patients and their families resided in, history of recent renovation and painting, type of the wall paint and pipes of their home, history of playing with soil, living near industrial zones (confirmed through municipality map), type of the toys the children played with, parents' level of education and occupation, accompanying signs and symptoms with abdominal pain (e.g. nausea, vomiting, extremity pain), location and quality of the pain, onset and duration of the pain, history of previous visits for abdominal pain and treatments performed, abdominal imaging and endoscopy results and abdominal surgery (if performed), history of treatments for lead poisoning, special diet (if any), using frequent (more than 1–2 times per week) amounts of spices (e.g. turmeric’s color and weight may be augmented with lead) or herbal medicine, and presence of ice eating or pica. Findings in the abdominal examination, blood lead level (BLL), and complete blood count (CBC) results were also recorded. Blood samples were then taken, after appropriated skin preparation using ethyl alcohol, to measure BLL and CBC. BLL was measured using the atomic absorption technique and by using Lead care II device (finger prick).

The analysis was performed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) software version 24 using Kolmogorov Smirnoff test to find the distribution patterns of quantitative variables, Chi square test to evaluate the differences of qualitative variables and T-test / Mann Whitney U test to test parametric and non-parametric quantitative variables. Cutoff points were determined using the ROC curve test for the variables which showed significant differences among patients with normal and elevated BLL. Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression by entering variables with P values less than 0.2 in the model.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^3f55924e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

As population BLLs decrease, along with overt clinical signs of lead exposure, laboratory testing has become paramount in detection and subsequent management of lead exposures. Thus, laboratories play an essential role in the overall public health response to lead exposure. A BLRV of 3.5 μ g/dL creates challenges as well as opportunities for state, local, and private laboratories that perform BLL testing. Some laboratories might need to reduce their reporting limit policies, adopt new repeat testing practices, improve limits of detection of laboratory developed tests, acquire new instrumentation, and validate updated or new laboratory-developed tests. Measures are also needed to eliminate lead contamination in laboratory consumables and processes and might increase workloads because of additional repeat and confirmatory testing. For example, skin prick tests can often be contaminated with environmental sources of lead, so collecting blood from the vein is less likely to have this contamination. Reducing the BLRV might strengthen considerations to tighten the federal proficiency testing criteria for acceptable blood lead testing performance from ±4 μ g/dL or ±10%, whichever is greater, to something tighter. Optimizing laboratory practices to meet the more stringent proficiency testing criteria might also be needed. Laboratory methods are sufficiently precise to measure BLLs at 3.5 μ g/dL.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1-5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^df735ad2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Targeted screening strategy development—Medicaid-eligible subpopulations: Assessments in pediatric health-care settings can be used to identify subpopulations of Medicaid-enrolled children who are at risk for EBLLs, and states should examine whether specific targeted screening strategies should be incorporated for children in populations who have been identified as being at risk for EBLLs, such as recent immigrants, refugees, or foreign adoptees; until state-level recommendations are revised to include targeted strategies, states with existing recommendations for non–Medicaid-eligible children should decide whether to continue to require testing of all Medicaid-eligible children or to immediately subsume Medicaid-eligible children under the existing targeted strategy for the non–Medicaid-eligible population.

### Elevated blood lead levels and blood lead screening among US children aged one to five years: 1988-1994 [^e7bd2676]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the proportion of children 1 to 5 years of age who received blood lead testing during 1988-1994 and to assess whether predictors of testing coincided with predictors of elevated blood lead levels.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants. US children 1 to 5 years of age. Outcome Measures. Prevalence of blood lead testing and elevated blood lead levels among children 1 to 5 years of age and odds ratios for factors predicting blood lead testing and elevated blood lead levels.

Results

Overall, 6.3% had elevated blood lead levels and 10.2% had undergone previous blood lead tests. Being of minority race/ethnicity, living in an older home, residing in the Northeast or Midwest regions of the United States, being on Medicaid, having a head of household with <12 years of education, and having a history of anemia were significant factors in both models. Additional independent risk factors for an elevated blood lead level included being sampled in phase 1 of the survey, being 1 to 2 years of age, not having a regular doctor, and being sampled during the summer months. Additional independent correlates of a previous blood lead test included having moved less than twice in one's lifetime, having a female head of household, and having parents whose home language was English. Of an estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age who had elevated blood lead levels and no previous screening test in 1993, 62% were receiving Medicaid, 40% lived in homes built before 1946, and 34% were black, non-Hispanic.

Conclusions

Lead screening was more frequent among children with risk factors for lead exposure. However, among children with elevated blood lead levels, only one third had been tested previously. In 1993 an estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age had elevated blood lead levels but were never screened. Physicians should screen Medicaid-eligible children and should follow state or local health department recommendations about identifying and screening other at-risk children. In areas where no health department guidelines exist, physicians should screen all children or screen based on known risk factors.

### Screenings during well-child visits in primary care: a quality improvement study [^fd742238]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment visits are designed to address physical, mental, and developmental health of children enrolled in Medicaid.

Methods

We conducted a mixed methods intervention by using a quality improvement theory. We assessed preintervention and postintervention screening rates of development, anemia, lead, oral health, vision and hearing, interventions for improvement, and barriers for the well-child visits at an academic family medicine clinic. For quantitative analysis, we assessed the preintervention baseline for 183 children and postintervention outcome for 151 children. For qualitative analysis, we used group interviews and key informant interviews to develop interventions in the preintervention stage and to explore potential barriers for further improvement in the postintervention stage.

Results

Interventions based on baseline results included user-friendly materials, checklists, posters, education, and order sets. After the intervention, there were significant statistical improvements ( P < .05) for the anemia test ordered rate, serum lead test ordered rate, oral health screening and referral rates, and ordered and confirmed test rates for both vision and hearing. Despite these improvements, 3 qualitative findings indicated barriers for further improvement, including difficulties in venipuncture, medical assistant aversion to vision screening, and poor fit of equipment for hearing assessment. The procedures prompted further continuous quality improvement activities using fingerstick hemoglobin testing, a child-friendly vision screener, and manual audiometer with headphones.

Conclusions

The trial findings demonstrated potential benefits of improving screenings in an office-based intervention by using a quality improvement process. Postintervention qualitative findings illustrate additional factors that could be addressed for further improvements.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^bc76a14d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant, and exposure to lead is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. Lead is associated with negative outcomes in children, including impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, CDC defined the blood lead level (BLL) that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, CDC also recognized that a BLL of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at BLLs < or =10 microg/dL. This report summarizes the findings of a review of clinical interpretation and management of BLLs < or =10 microg/dL conducted by CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. This report provides information to help clinicians understand BLLs < or =10 microg/dL, identifies gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outlines strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. In addition, this report summarizes scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of BLLs, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within +/-2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As local and patient circumstances permit, clinicians should consider early referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and consider more frequent rescreening of children with BLLs approaching 10 microg/dL, depending on the potential for exposure to lead, child age, and season of testing. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health-care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

### Measurement challenges at low blood lead levels [^a46ae6cb]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adopted its Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention recommendation to use a population-based reference value to identify children and environments associated with lead hazards. The current reference value of 5 μg/dL is calculated as the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of blood lead levels (BLLs) in children 1 to 5 years old from 2007 to 2010 NHANES data. We calculated and updated selected percentiles, including the 97.5th percentile, by using NHANES 2011 to 2014 blood lead data and examined demographic characteristics of children whose blood lead was ≥90th percentile value. The 97.5th percentile BLL of 3.48 µg/dL highlighted analytical laboratory and clinical interpretation challenges of blood lead measurements ≤5 μg/dL. Review of 5 years of results for target blood lead values <11 µg/dL for US clinical laboratories participating in the CDC's voluntary Lead and Multi-Element Proficiency quality assurance program showed 40% unable to quantify and reported a nondetectable result at a target blood lead value of 1.48 µg/dL, compared with 5.5% at a target BLL of 4.60 µg/dL. We describe actions taken at the CDC's Environmental Health Laboratory in the National Center for Environmental Health, which measures blood lead for NHANES, to improve analytical accuracy and precision and to reduce external lead contamination during blood collection and analysis.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^f220ffe0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Personal lead risk assessment questionnaires—diagnostic performance and limitations: The effectiveness of personal risk assessment questionnaires in identifying children with elevated BLLs has been documented, but no studies have evaluated the performance of these questionnaires at cut-off levels <10 μg/dL or their effectiveness in directing counseling or in identifying lead hazards in the home. In clinical settings, the sensitivity of such questionnaires to identify children with BLLs ≥10 μg/dL varies considerably by population, and in certain studies the sensitivity improved if higher cut-off levels were used or if the questions were developed specifically for the population tested. In general, to identify approximately 80% of children with BLLs ≥10 μg/dL, a blood test had to be performed for more than half of those children whose risk factors for lead exposure were assessed using a questionnaire. Multiple studies in populations with low or high prevalence for elevated BLLs concluded that risk assessment questionnaires were not effective tools in their clinical assessment.

Pediatric screening population and tests: This recommendation applies to children and adolescents younger than 18 years without known diabetes or prediabetes or symptoms of diabetes or prediabetes; although there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening in patients without signs or symptoms, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by measuring fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, or with an oral glucose tolerance test, which is performed in the morning in a fasting state, with blood glucose concentration measured 2 hours after ingestion of a 75-g oral glucose load.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1-5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^2b852a5d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Lead screening policies for Medicaid-eligible children—state and local risk–based approaches emphasize that state-issued recommendations might be more implementable and improve screening, and that providers might follow policies they helped develop and that reflect local risk for elevated blood lead levels (EBLs). State and local health authorities should consider practicality and ensure feasibility when developing recommendations. Many policies might not require individual risk assessment before testing; states could choose to screen all Medicaid-eligible children, apply the same screening policies to Medicaid-eligible and general-population children, or use objective criteria to select populations. In most CDC-funded programs, surveillance and Medicaid enrollment data can be matched to assess screening rates and examine blood lead levels (BLLs). Personal risk questionnaires often have limited effectiveness and might be impractical in some settings.

### Segregation and childhood blood lead levels in North Carolina [^d93f5be1]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Blood Lead Testing Data

Blood lead testing data were obtained from the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program of the NC Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, Environmental Health Section. In NC, all children enrolled in Medicaid or the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program are required to be tested at 1 and 2 years of age. Beyond children in these programs, health care providers would typically use the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s lead risk screening questionnaire to determine if a non-Medicaid/non-WIC child should be tested. In theory, all Medicaid and WIC enrollees, as well as all children whose parents responded “yes” or “don’t know” during any pediatric or health department visit to any of the 3 questions on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Lead Risk Assessment Questionnaire,should have been tested for lead. However, it is difficult to ascertain true practice at the time.

The blood lead testing data include child name, birth date, test date, blood lead level, type of test (venous or capillary), and home address and were provided pursuant to a data use agreement. The NC State Laboratory of Public Health analyzed 90% of the blood samples. During the study period, all children with BLLs <1 μg/dL or below the level of detection were assigned a value of 1 μg/dL. BLLs were recorded and stored in the state database as integer values.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^413816cc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The negative impact of lead exposure on young children and those who become pregnant is well documented but is not well known by those at highest risk from this hazard. Scientific evidence suggests that there is no known safe blood lead level (BLL), because even small amounts of lead can be harmful to a child’s developing brain. In 2012, CDC introduced the population-based blood lead reference value (BLRV) to identify children exposed to more lead than most other children in the United States. The BLRV should be used as a guide to 1) help determine whether medical or environmental follow-up actions should be initiated for an individual child and 2) prioritize communities with the most need for primary prevention of exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. The BLRV is based on the 97.5th percentile of the blood lead distribution in U.S. children aged 1–5 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. NHANES is a complex, multistage survey designed to provide a nationally representative assessment of health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized civilian adult and child populations in the United States. The initial BLRV of 5 μ g/dL, established in 2012, was based on data from the 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 NHANES cycles. Consistent with recommendations from a former advisory committee, this report updates CDC’s BLRV in children to 3.5 μ g/dL using NHANES data derived from the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 cycles and provides helpful information to support adoption by state and local health departments, health care providers (HCPs), clinical laboratories, and others and serves as an opportunity to advance health equity and environmental justice related to preventable lead exposure. CDC recommends that public health and clinical professionals focus screening efforts on populations at high risk based on age of housing and sociodemographic risk factors. Public health and clinical professionals should collaborate to develop screening plans responsive to local conditions using local data. In the absence of such plans, universal BLL testing is recommended. In addition, jurisdictions should follow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requirement that all Medicaid-enrolled children be tested at ages 12 and 24 months or at age 24 – 72 months if they have not previously been screened.

### Efficacy and safety of hepcidin-based screen-and-treat approaches using two different doses versus a standard universal approach of iron supplementation in young children in rural Gambia: a double-blind randomised controlled trial [^4c4b269a]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Recruitment, enrolment and randomisation

A summary chart of all study procedures is illustrated in Fig. 1. Mothers/Guardians of the young children identified during child welfare clinics at the selected health centres will be visited at home where the study will be clearly explained. Demographic information will be collected once the child’s mother/guardian has signed the informed consent form. If the inclusion criteria are met, the child will be invited for further eligibility screening during which they will be physically examined. Height, weight, head circumference, mid-upper arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness will be measured and a finger prick blood sample for Hb and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria will be taken. If Hb is ≥ 7 and < 11 g/dL, and the RDT is negative, a venous blood sample of 5 mL will be collected. The mother will then be asked to collect a stool sample from the child within the next two days. Enrolled children will be randomized to one of the three study arms (equal number in each arm) using a block randomization, balanced by Hb concentration and age, to minimise potential baseline imbalance.

Fig. 1 
Main study flow chart. Legend: Hb, Haemoglobin; Fe, Iron; MNP, Micronutrient powder

Children with Hb < 7 g/dL will not be enrolled and will be referred to the regional health centre for treatment according to national guidelines. Children with Hb ≥ 11 will not be enrolled as they do not need iron supplementation. Malaria positive children (positive RDT and confirmation by blood film) will not be enrolled and will be treated according to national guidelines.

The 90 children additionally participating in the sub-study will be recruited as described above, but the enrolment day procedure is slightly different (Fig. 2). Children eligible for the sub-study will not have a venous blood sample drawn, but will receive the stable isotope dose on the day of enrolment. They will then be followed up monthly using a morbidity questionnaire until their participation in the main study (earliest seven months after stable isotope administration). This period is to ensure that the stable isotope has homogenously equilibrated with total body iron. On the day of enrolment into the main study, these children will undergo the same procedure as described above for the main study.

Improve rates of blood lead screening—Medicaid-eligible children at increased risk: State and federal Medicaid agencies and their partners should work to improve screening rates of Medicaid-eligible children at risk for lead exposure, and although children who are eligible for Medicaid can no longer be assumed to have an increased risk for EBLLs, certain Medicaid-eligible children will still need blood lead screening and would benefit from follow-up services.

### EMR-based intervention improves lead screening at an urban family medicine practice [^a5e34a93]. Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Elevated blood lead levels have well-described detrimental effects to growth and development in children, yet screening rates remain low. We sought to determine if a reminder within the electronic health record (EHR) could change provider behavior and improve blood lead level (BLL) screening test ordering rates in an urban academic family medicine practice.

Methods

Baseline BLL test ordering rates were calculated for children ages 9-72 months. An update adding reminders to screen was made to the electronic note template used during pediatric well and sick visits at the practice. Data from the 10-week periods both before and after the change was made were compared through a retrospective chart review.

Results

A total of 210 children were seen during the pre-intervention period. Forty-eight percent (n=101) had already been screened. Of the 109 eligible for screening, 23 had tests ordered, and 18 of those had tests completed. Eighty-four children were eligible for screening in the post-intervention period. Forty-one of those children had tests ordered, and 15 had tests completed. Provider ordering rates increased from 21% of eligible patients to 49%. Test completion rates only increased from 17% to 18%.

Conclusions

An electronic note-based reminder system significantly improves provider ordering rates of BLL tests. Researchers are currently investigating how the use of point-of-care BLL sample collection can improve test completion rates and therefore increase the frequency of successful screening.

### Efforts to identify at-risk children for blood lead screening in pediatric clinics – clark county, Nevada [^1509bf9d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood lead poisoning continues to be a public health problem; however, lead screening rates remain low in many areas. Our objective is to increase screening in pediatric clinics, while testing a questionnaire for its predictability of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs).

Methods

Participants were approached at pediatric clinics in Las Vegas, Nevada. A brief questionnaire assessed the child's potential exposure to lead and a blood sample was collected from each child.

Results

Of 564 children tested, 35 had detectable BLLs. Two questions from the questionnaire demonstrated significant differences in proportions (Fisher's exact test: P < .05) of affirmative/negative responses, for the 35 participants with detectable BLLs.

Conclusion

The questionnaire failed to identify reliable associations between detectable BLLs and affirmative responses, limiting its use as an in-office tool. More research is recommended to identify and alleviate barriers to childhood lead screening in the clinical setting and to develop more applicable risk assessment tools.

### Anemia in disadvantaged children aged under five years ; quality of care in primary practice [^95fb5b69]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Long term neurodevelopmental and educational outcomes have been linked to early deprivation and micronutrient intake, so it is concerning that very young infants aged 6–11 months had both high levels of anemia and poor quality of care and follow-up in our study. This low prevalence of care for our youngest and most vulnerable infants may be because of the perception that anemia commences later in childhood. 

There were some limitations to our study. Some items may not have been documented in client records thus there may have been under reporting of the level of care provided. Participation of health services was voluntary therefore limiting generalisability. We were unable to collect data on cause of anemia e.g. iron deficiency so we cannot comment on aetiology specific issues. We are also aware that our anemia rates were reported only in the 70% of children who received screening for anemia. Children that did not receive screening may be more disadvantaged and have even higher anemia burden. Our anemia burden data relied on capillary samples (heel prick and finger prick) analysed by hemoglobinometers. Venous blood full blood examinations (FBE) are well known to be the gold standard technique for measuring hemoglobin levels. However, there have been many hemoglobinometer diagnostic accuracy studies that report high levels of sensitivity, specificity and level of agreement with venous Coulter samples if the hemoglobinometer is used by well trained staff under optimal situations such as in our study. 

Strengths of our study included the large sample size and multicenter design which included a large number of primary health care centers across different regions of Australia. Within the statistical analysis we controlled for confounders such as age, sex, year, geographic location, governance and CQI participation and we feel that residual confounding was unlikely. We also controlled for the effects of clustering of health care centers.

### Point-of-care testing improves lead screening rates at 1-and 2-year well visits [^77525f6c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To increase blood lead level screening rates in children at 12- and 24-month well visits through provider education and the implementation of a point-of-care (POC) lead screening program in 4 primary care practice offices located in and neighbored by counties with ≥5% prevalence of blood lead levels ≥5 μg/dL.

Study Design

Baseline data were collected July 2017 to June 2018. All providers received education on screening recommendations and local prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in July 2018. POC testing began June 2019 at 1 of the 4 practice sites. Screening rates were measured by electronic medical record abstraction. Rates were plotted monthly on statistical process control charts during implementation and analyzed using logistic regression under an interrupted time series approach for program evaluation.

Results

There was a small but significant increase in screening following provider education (OR 1.04 per month, 95% CI 1.02-1.07). POC testing was associated with a substantial immediate increase (OR 4.17, 95% CI 2.45-7.09) and a substantial continued increase (OR 1.34 per month, 95% CI 1.17-1.54) in screening at the site that implemented POC.

Conclusions

POC testing substantially increases blood lead level screening rates at 12- and 24-month well visits and may be beneficial in other primary care settings.

### Abstract (...) [^2ad3a47c]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Pallor has poor sensitivity for predicting mild anemia, but correlates well with severe anemia. 11–13 One study showed that physical examination findings of pallor of the conjunctivae, tongue, palm, or nail beds is 93 percent sensitive and 57 percent specific for the diagnosis of anemia in patients with an Hgb level of less than 5 g per dL. 14 The sensitivity decreases to 66 percent when the Hgb level is 5 to 8 g per dL. 14 Chronic anemia may be associated with glossitis, a flow murmur, and growth delay, although these conditions are rare in developed countries.
1. 15 Alternatively, many cases of anemia in children are not caused by iron deficiency. Therefore, measurement of a single Hgb level may result in unnecessary treatment and retesting. 16 Measurement of RHC may help avoid this issue.

In a study of infants nine to 12 months of age, an Hgb level of less than 11 g per dL was only 26 percent sensitive in detecting iron deficiency, whereas an RHC of less than 27. 5 pg was 83 percent sensitive in detecting iron deficiency. In newborns, an elevated bilirubin level in association with anemia suggests hemolysis. If this infant's biliru-bin level had been elevated, further testing would have included a Coombs test to evaluate for isoimmunization and a peripheral smear to evaluate for spherocytosis or other RBC membrane defects. Testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should be considered if the patient's ethnicity or family history is a risk factor. 35 This child's age, ill appearance, and lack of viral symptoms make TEC less likely.

The first step in evaluation of normocytic anemia is determination of the reticulocyte count to distinguish cases of increased RBC turnover, such as hemolysis, from bone marrow disorders. The low reticulocyte count suggests bone marrow hypofunction. Leukemia and aplastic anemia reduce RBC production. Because leukemia is a consideration in the differential diagnosis for this patient, a peripheral smear is ordered, which confirms the diagnosis of leukemia. Other Considerations Macrocytic anemia is rare in children. The initial workup is a peripheral smear.

### Decreases in young children who received blood lead level testing during COVID-19-34 jurisdictions, January-May 2020 [^f55451a0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Exposure to lead, a toxic metal, can result in severe effects in children, including decreased ability to learn, permanent neurologic damage, organ failure, and death. CDC and other health care organizations recommend routine blood lead level (BLL) testing among children as part of well-child examinations to facilitate prompt identification of elevated BLL, eliminate source exposure, and provide medical and other services (1). To describe BLL testing trends among young children during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC analyzed data reported from 34 state and local health departments about BLL testing among children aged <6 years conducted during January-May 2019 and January-May 2020. Compared with testing in 2019, testing during January-May 2020 decreased by 34%, with 480,172 fewer children tested. An estimated 9,603 children with elevated BLL were missed because of decreased BLL testing. Despite geographic variability, all health departments reported fewer children tested for BLL after the national COVID-19 emergency declaration (March-May 2020). In addition, health departments reported difficulty conducting medical follow-up and environmental investigations for children with elevated BLLs because of staffing shortages and constraints on home visits associated with the pandemic. Providers and public health agencies need to take action to ensure that children who missed their scheduled blood lead screening test, or who required follow-up on an earlier high BLL, be tested as soon as possible and receive appropriate care.

### Smartphone app for non-invasive detection of anemia using only patient-sourced photos [^12e3646b]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although smartphone-based telehealth has the potential to change how healthcare is delivered by enabling remote diagnosis, these technologies have yet to non-invasively replace blood-based testing, which remains a major cornerstone of disease diagnosis in modern medicine –. Indeed, while custom-designed smartphone attachments may allow for blood-based, point-of-care diagnosis and analysis, the burden of blood sampling combined with the additional cost and need for equipment external to the smartphone prevents broader adoption of these potentially disruptive technologies.

Due to its high prevalence affecting over 2 billion people globally, anemia, characterized by low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, was chosen as the initial disease target for us to study. Anemia has numerous causes, ranging from common nutritional causes, such as iron or folate deficiency, which are relatively straightforward to treat and cure, to rarer genetic causes, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia major, which lead to severe and chronic anemia that requires frequent monitoring. Detection of anemia involves either anemia screening or anemia diagnosis, and both require different degrees of measurement accuracy. First, a clear clinical need exists for easily and widely accessible tools to screen for anemia among at-risk populations (e.g. pregnant women, toddler-age children, elderly patients) or the general public to determine whether an individual will need formal confirmatory testing with the gold standard Hgb level test obtained via a complete blood count (CBC). However, there is also a need to for non-invasive methods to more quantitatively and officially diagnose and monitor anemia with higher precision Hgb levels, especially patients with known or chronic anemia.

Existing clinical approaches to measure blood Hgb levels require specialized equipment and represent tradeoffs between invasiveness, accuracy, infrastructure requirements, and cost –, all of which are especially problematic in rural and low-resource settings, where anemia is most prevalent. For example, the gold standard CBC Hgb level measurement requires: blood sampling by a trained phlebotomist, a clinical hematology analyzer with the required electrical power, biochemical reagents, and infrastructure thereof, along with a trained laboratory technician to perform the analysis. Aside from being cost-prohibitive in resource-poor settings, the necessary invasive blood sampling to measure Hgb levels causes discomfort in younger pediatric patients. Interestingly, several reports have suggested that anemia may qualitatively correlate with subjective assessments of pallor in various anatomic regions of the patient’s body –, namely the fingernail beds, conjunctiva, and palmar creases.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels of less than 10 microg / dL in children and reducing childhood exposure to lead: recommendations of the centers for disease control and prevention advisory committee on childhood lead poisoning prevention [^8a28f1d0]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant. Lead exposure is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. In children, lead is associated with impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined the blood lead level that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recognized that a blood lead level of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at blood lead levels of < 10 microg/dL. In this report we provide information to help clinicians understand blood lead levels < 10 microg/dL, identify gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outline strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. We also summarize scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead-exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of blood lead levels, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within +/-2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead-prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As circumstances permit, clinicians should consider referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and more frequent rescreening of children with blood lead levels approaching 10 microg/dL. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1-5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^2366adc6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

State surveillance data and local relevance—As disparities among subpopulations have decreased, accurately assessing risk nationally has become more difficult because NHANES is not constructed to measure prevalence in small populations, and thus state and local data have gradually become more important for developing lead exposure prevention policies. State-reported surveillance corroborates NHANES: results from tests of children aged <72 months screened at least once during January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2004, show decreasing numbers of confirmed EBLL cases and decreasing percentages of confirmed EBLLs among children tested; however, because of small proportions and variability of the estimates, the statistical significance of the difference between these percentages could not be determined.

Conclusion—“BLLs decreased in the United States population overall and in every subpopulation during 1976–2004.” “BLLs decreased among certain Medicaid-enrolled children, but the geographic disparities increased.” These findings indicate that “a national blood lead screening policy that requires universal screening of all young Medicaid-eligible children is not justified,” and that “State and local public health authorities are better positioned, with assistance from CDC, to assess local risk variations, develop appropriate screening policies to identify EBLLs among Medicaid-eligible children, and develop and evaluate lead screening strategies.”

Blood lead screening policies—CDC policies transitioned from universal to targeted approaches with specified testing ages. As early as 1978, CDC recommended universal screening of all children aged 9 months–6 years but emphasized screening children with specific risk factors. In 1997, CDC replaced universal screening of children aged 9 months–6 years with targeted screening, called for states to analyze their BLL data and develop state screening plans, and recommended continued universal screening of Medicaid-eligible children “unless there [are] reliable, representative BLL data that demonstrate the absence of lead exposure in this population.” As an interim measure, CDC recommended two blood lead tests for higher-risk children—one at age 9–12 months and one at age 2 years—because BLLs peak at 24 months, and also recommended that high-risk children who have never been tested be retested at age 3 years.

### Lead poisoning in children [^09988c60]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic lead poisoning has become more common in children. Blood lead levels of less than 5 µg per dL are associated with impairments in neurocognitive and behavioral development that are irreversible. Risk factors for lead poisoning include age younger than five years, low socioeconomic status, living in housing built before 1978, and use of imported food, medicines, and pottery. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a recommendation in 2019 citing insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of universal screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. Local risk factors can be substantial, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that states and cities formulate their own targeted screening guidelines. In the absence of local guidance, the CDC recommends screening all Medicaid-eligible children at 12 months and again at 24 months, or at least once between 36 and 72 months if not previously screened. The CDC also recommends universal screening in areas where more than 27% of the housing was built before 1950, or where at least 12% of children 12 to 36 months of age have blood lead levels greater than 10 µg per dL. Life-threatening lead levels are treated with chelation therapy, and lower levels should prompt case management and environmental investigations to identify and remove the source of exposure. Primary prevention strategies are essential to eliminate the harmful effects of lead on child development.

Universal blood lead screening—states without screening plans: The nine states without lead screening plans should continue to perform universal blood lead screening of Medicaid-enrolled children until these states have completed assessments of risk for lead exposure among these children, reached consensus on data-driven primary and secondary lead poisoning prevention strategic plans for the community (including blood lead screening), and implemented these plans, and the 1997 CDC lead screening recommendations include guidance on involving community stakeholders in such a process.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1-5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^2882c503]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Update Blood Lead Screening Policies for Medicaid-Eligible Children—since the 1997 CDC recommendation for targeted blood lead screening, certain jurisdictions have collected reliable blood lead level (BLL) data that do not show higher rates of EBLs among children enrolled in Medicaid compared with children not enrolled in Medicaid, challenging the assumption that all Medicaid-eligible children are at increased risk for EBLs. These findings suggest blood lead screening of children in Medicaid populations should be targeted toward subgroups at higher risk rather than all Medicaid-eligible children, with the decision regarding whether to screen all Medicaid-eligible children made at the state and local levels rather than the national level; in 1997, CDC endorsed continued universal screening of Medicaid children unless reliable data demonstrated “the absence of lead exposure in this population.”

### Dried blood spots for global health diagnostics and surveillance: opportunities and challenges [^993321c8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Analyte abundance in venous versus capillary blood.

There are several reports describing a difference in the natural abundance of biomarkers between capillary and venous blood, – some of which are described in Table 2. For low-abundant analytes, the impact of this variability on test results is likely to be amplified, given that smaller volumes of blood collected in DBS increase the probability of false-negative detection. Unlike venous blood draw, there is also a higher risk for inconsistent volumes with static fingerprick- or heelprick-drawn blood; “milking” the skin puncture to increase volume through direct pressure also increases risk for hemoconcentration.

Table 2 
Examples of reports investigating physiological differences in biomarker abundance between capillary and venous blood

Different hemoglobin concentrations were measured when fingerprick blood was extracted from either the left or right hand of the same individual.Bond and Richards-Kortum also reported higher degrees of variability in hemoglobin, white blood cell, and platelet count measurements from fingerprick-derived blood compared with venous-derived blood.In that study, collecting larger volumes of blood did not reduce the difference in total variability between capillary- and venous-derived blood (i.e. increased fingerprick volumes did not align the magnitude of variability with venous-derived blood). The authors also reported different degrees of drop-to-drop variability between patients, sharing that these results indicate interindividual physiological differences in the abundance of these analytes between the two circulatory pathways. Adding to the complexity, Hct levels were reportedly higher in capillary blood compared with venous blood in neonatal and young infants.

As demonstrated by these examples, partitioning between venous and capillary circulation is likely analyte specific and cannot be simply rationalized by smaller diameters of peripheral capillaries or mitigated by larger volumes of collected blood. Higher concentrations of some analytes in capillary blood can be attributed to hemoconcentration effects or, alternatively, lower concentrations may be due to the presence of extracellular fluid. This physiological basis for biomarker partitioning needs to be considered in guiding the clinical relevance of bioanalytical data, particularly if reported clinical correlations are based on a different source or component of blood.Assessments of analytical and clinical equivalence for any biomarker measured by capillary- and venous-derived samples should be conducted before implementing DBS within a research study or clinical workflow.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1-5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^5a299c6f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Link and share data between Medicaid and state lead surveillance systems—Since 1998, CDC has encouraged states to link blood lead surveillance with Medicaid encounter databases by requiring CDC-funded programs to maintain ongoing identification of Medicaid-eligible children in the surveillance system. Successfully linking databases can improve screening for children at high risk for EBLs by identifying service gaps and can improve report accuracy. When linked records include Medicaid status, health plan enrollment, race/ethnicity, and address, more focused analyses can be conducted; the information can also be provided to providers and managed care organizations to improve service delivery. Although states have begun linking data and can track screening tests, almost none have reported using these systems to track and analyze EBL rates among Medicaid-enrolled children who are tested.

### Lead poisoning in United States-bound refugee children: Thailand-Burma border, 2009 [^daf68e47]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated blood lead levels lead to permanent neurocognitive sequelae in children. Resettled refugee children in the United States are considered at high risk for elevated blood lead levels, but the prevalence of and risk factors for elevated blood lead levels before resettlement have not been described.

Methods

Blood samples from children aged 6 months to 14 years from refugee camps in Thailand were tested for lead and hemoglobin. Sixty-seven children with elevated blood lead levels (venous ≥10 µg/dL) or undetectable (capillary <3.3 µg/dL) blood lead levels participated in a case-control study.

Results

Of 642 children, 33 (5.1%) had elevated blood lead levels. Children aged <2 years had the highest prevalence (14.5%). Among children aged <2 years included in a case-control study, elevated blood lead levels risk factors included hemoglobin <10 g/dL, exposure to car batteries, and taking traditional medicines.

Conclusions

The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels among tested US-bound Burmese refugee children was higher than the current US prevalence, and was especially high among children <2 years old. Refugee children may arrive in the United States with elevated blood lead levels. A population-specific understanding of preexisting lead exposures can enhance postarrival lead-poisoning prevention efforts, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for resettled refugee children, and can lead to remediation efforts overseas.

2. Glucose meters

a. There are insufficient published data to support a role for portable meters and skin-prick (finger-stick) blood samples in the diagnosis of diabetes or for population screening. C (moderate)

b. The imprecision of the results, coupled with the substantial differences among meters, precludes the use of glucose meters from the diagnosis of diabetes and limits their usefulness in screening for diabetes. A (moderate)

c. SMBG is recommended for all insulin-treated patients with diabetes. A (high)

d. In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and oral agents, SMBG may help achieve better control, particularly when therapy is initiated or changed. Data are insufficient, however, to claim an associated improvement of health outcomes. The role of SMBG in patients with stable type 2 diabetes controlled by diet alone is not known. C (high)

e. Patients should be instructed in the correct use of glucose meters, including quality control. Comparison between SMBG and concurrent laboratory glucose analysis should be performed at regular intervals to evaluate the performance of the meters in the patient's hands. B (moderate)

f. Multiple performance goals for portable glucose meters have been proposed. These targets vary widely and are highly controversial. Manufacturers should work to improve the imprecision of current meters, with an intermediate goal of limiting total error for 95% of samples to ≤15% at glucose concentrations ≥5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and to <0.8 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) at glucose concentrations <5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). Lower total error would be desirable and may prove necessary in tight glucose-control protocols and for avoiding hypoglycemia in all settings. C (low)

g. Meters should measure and report plasma glucose concentrations to facilitate comparison with assays performed in accredited laboratories. GPP

h. Studies are needed to determine the analytical goals (quality specifications) for glucose meters in SMBG and in intensive care units. C (moderate)

i. Recommendations for future research: Important end points in studies of SMBG should include, at a minimum, hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes to ascertain whether improved meters enable patients to achieve better glucose control. For studies of meter use in intensive or critical care, important end points include mean blood glucose, frequency of hypoglycemia, and variation of glucose control. Ideally, outcomes (e.g. long-term complications) should also be examined. GPP

### Epidemiologic characteristics of children with blood lead levels ≥ 45 μ g / dL [^6347b241]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify risk factors and describe outcomes for children newly identified with blood lead levels (BLLs) ≥45µg/dL in New York City (NYC) during 2004-2010 to promote timely identification as well as inform clinical practice and public health policy.

Study Design

Inclusion criteria were residence in NYC and an elevated confirmatory venous test within 2 weeks of the initial BLL ≥45µg/dL. Data collected during case coordination of these children were linked with blood testing data and home inspection reports. Children with BLLs ≥45µg/dL also were compared with the general population of children younger than 18 years of age in NYC.

Results

A total of 145 children <18 years of age were newly identified with BLLs ≥45µg/dL. The mean age was 3.83 years, and the median time for BLL to decline below 10µg/dL was 3.26 years. Major reported risk factors were eating paint (36%), spending time outside the US (34%), having a developmental delay (27%), using imported products (26%), being foreign born (14%), being of Pakistani descent (12%), eating soil (5%), and having sickle cell disease (4%). Compared with the age-standardized NYC population, cases were more likely to be Asian or black and live in housing built before 1940.

Conclusions

Although the incidence of lead poisoning has declined in the US, severe cases still occur. Physicians should be especially vigilant in certain at-risk populations including children who eat paint chips or soil, spend time outside the US (particularly in Pakistan), use imported products, or have developmental delays or sickle cell disease.

### Is it time to offer routine screening for iron deficiency in healthy adolescent females? [^480a34ed]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

HOWEVER, DOES THIS APPROACH TRULY WORK?

In a study involving 493 adolescents and young adults, ID (ferritin <15 μg/L or transferrin saturation < 15%) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) (ID with haemoglobin ≤11 g/dL) were evaluated.Among females (n = 350), 34.6% had ID and 6.3% had IDA, with nearly one‐third of those with ID lacking identifiable risk factors. Among males, 12.6% had ID, although none were diagnosed with IDA (most likely due to the restrictive definition), and over one‐third of those with ID had no identifiable risk factors. This suggests that the current screening methods would have missed over 50% of ID cases in females and over 95% in males. In another study, the use of ID risk assessment questionnaires in 96 female individuals 12–21 years old failed to predict objective measures of iron status,highlighting the need for improved screening strategies. In a study of 1756 adolescent females, the sensitivity and specificity of haemoglobin testing for predicting ID were 15.6% (95% CI: 9.4%–21.8%) and 99.2% (95% CI: 98.7%–99.8%), respectively.In a community‐based screening of reproductive‐aged women using fingertip haemoglobin testing, those with ID had similar haemoglobin concentrations to those without (11.89 ± 1.11 g/dL vs. 12.15 ± 0.71 g/dL, p = 0.364) and were no more likely to be anaemic (40% vs. 35%, p = 1.000), highlighting the limitation of haemoglobin alone in identifying ID.

### Blood lead screening [^ef88b78c]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate local procedures for and barriers to testing Medicaid patients for lead toxicity, a retrospective review of 675 charts of Medicaid patients' age 12 to 36 months form the 7 practices who serve the vast majority of Medicaid children in Kalamazoo, Michigan was undertaken. We identified and tested a model for barriers to patients and physicians obtaining blood lead levels. Only 27.6% had blood lead levels substantially lower than the universal testing mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Physicians overestimated the number of children having blood lead tests, even with adjusting for patient non-compliance. Practices varied sharply in their approach to screening. Of 489 patients without findable lead test results, 139 (28.4%) were attributable to previous screening, 98 (20.0%) to patient failure, 181 (37.0%) to physician failure, 52 (10.6%) to patient + physician failure and 19 (3.9%) were indeterminate. There is need for improvement, standardization and unification of lead screening guidelines. Understanding barriers to blood lead testing is also necessary to develop credible data to promote shifts in public policy regarding lead abatement. Further studies should be done, such as interviews and questionnaires to determine why physicians fail to order blood lead tests, and patients fail to appear for a test that has been ordered.

### Individual-and community-level factors associated with detectable and elevated blood lead levels in US children: results from a national clinical laboratory [^69f9ca63]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

No safe level of exposure to lead has been identified.

Objective

To evaluate individual- and community-level factors associated with detectable and elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional, retrospective study analyzed deidentified results from blood lead tests performed at a large clinical laboratory from October 1, 2018, to February 29, 2020. Participants were 1 141 441 children younger than 6 years living in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia who underwent blood lead testing during the study period. Children who underwent lead testing of unknown source and those with elevated BLLs who received capillary blood lead testing without confirmatory venous testing were excluded.

Exposures

Individual demographic categories included sex, age, and insurance type; community-level demographic categories included pre-1950s housing, poverty, predominant race and ethnicity, and geographical regions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportions of children with detectable (≥1.0 μg/dL) and elevated (≥5.0 μg/dL) BLLs, by exposure category.

Results

Of the 1 141 441 children (586 703 boys [51.4%]; mean [SD] age, 2.3 [1.4] years) in the study, more than half of the children tested (576 092 [50.5%; 95% CI, 50.4%-50.6%]) had detectable BLLs, and 21 172 children (1.9% [95% CI, 1.8%-1.9%]) had BLLs of 5.0 μg/dL or more. In multivariable analyses, children with public insurance had greater odds of having detectable BLLs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.01 [95% CI, 1.99-2.04]) and elevated BLLs (AOR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04-1.12]). The proportion of children with detectable and elevated BLLs increased significantly for progressive pre-1950s housing and poverty quintiles (P<.001). The odds of detectable BLLs were significantly higher among children in the highest vs lowest quintile of pre-1950s housing (AOR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.62-1.68]) and of poverty (AOR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.86-1.93]). A similar association was found for those with elevated BLLs, with an AOR of 3.06 (95% CI, 2.86-3.27) for the highest vs lowest quintile of pre-1950 housing and 1.99 (95% CI, 1.88-2.11) for the highest quintile of poverty. Children residing in zip codes with predominantly Black non-Hispanic and non-Latinx populations had higher odds of detectable BLLs (AOR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.11-1.15]) but lower odds for elevated BLL (AOR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.80-0.88]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that, despite progress in reducing pediatric lead exposure, substantial individual- and community-level disparities persist.

Hemoglobinopathies are priority genetic diseases for prevention programs in at-risk populations. We implemented an accurate and simple methodology to identify hemoglobin (Hb) variants and to quantify HbA2 and HbF in capillary blood samples stored at room temperature for up to 7 days after collection. This methodology is particularly indicated for screening for carriers in primary care medical centers in which facilities for collecting venous blood are not available.

### A bland-altman comparison of the lead care® system and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for detecting low-level lead in child whole blood samples [^5b9b05f9]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic childhood lead exposure, yielding blood lead levels consistently below 10 μg/dL, remains a major public health concern. Low neurotoxic effect thresholds have not yet been established. Progress requires accurate, efficient, and cost-effective methods for testing large numbers of children. The LeadCare® System (LCS) may provide one ready option. The comparability of this system to the "gold standard" method of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the purpose of detecting blood lead levels below 10 μg/dL has not yet been examined. Paired blood samples from 177 children ages 5.2-12.8 years were tested with LCS and ICP-MS. Triplicate repeat tests confirmed that LCS and ICP-MS had comparable repeatability. As compared with ICP-MS, LCS had a negative bias of 0.457 μg/dL with an average variability of 1.0 μg/dL. The reproducibility and precision of the LCS is appropriate for the evaluation and monitoring of blood lead levels of individual children in a clinical setting. Recent research however has suggested that increments as small as 0.5 μg/dL may distinguish those at risk of low-level lead-induced neurotoxicity. Thus, we also conclude that the LCS is not useful for research applications attempting to identify neurotoxic effect thresholds for chronic lowest level lead exposure in children. For these types of research applications, a convenient and low-cost device is needed for the precise detection of child blood lead levels below 10 μg/dL.

### CDC recommendations for lead poisoning prevention in newly arrived refugee children [^2fe3a84a]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

New Hampshire refugee child screening—testing timing, elevated BLLs, and growth findings: New Hampshire requires blood lead screening of newly arrived refugee children aged 6 months to 16 years; beginning in May 2004, 242 refugee children were resettled and, of these, 96 were tested twice for blood lead levels (BLLs). The first samples were collected within 90 days of arrival and the second 3 to 6 months after resettlement; most had initial capillary BLLs <10µg/dL. Venous follow-up tests found that 38 (40%) children had BLLs >10 µg/dL and 5 other children who were siblings of cases were also affected (range: 11 to 73 µg/dL), and 11 families had at least one child with a BLL >20 µg/dL. Environmental investigations revealed moderate lead hazards within residences and lead-contaminated soil in play areas. Health examinations before arriving in the US indicated that 16 (37.2%) had severe growth retardation (Height per Age Z-score <-2), and among the 40 children for whom weight was measured, 10 (25%) had evidence of failure to gain weight or of loss of weight (Weight per Height Z-score <-2).

States with data-driven lead screening recommendations for non–Medicaid-eligible children—background and next steps for Medicaid populations: Since the 1997 CDC recommendations were made, all 42 CDC-funded childhood lead poisoning prevention programs in 37 states have developed data-driven targeted screening recommendations, with agencies assessing local lead exposure risks, reviewing surveillance and census data, identifying relevant factors of local importance, and developing infrastructures for involving relevant persons; in addition, state blood lead surveillance systems have improved through more complete collection and analysis of blood lead data, and many states have established community-wide lead exposure assessment and analysis programs; after the State Medicaid Manual is updated to allow targeted, rather than universal, blood lead testing of children enrolled in Medicaid, state-level lead poisoning prevention programs, in partnership with state Medicaid agencies and members of state lead advisory committees, should analyze available data on lead screening and exposure patterns in the Medicaid-eligible population and modify their lead screening recommendations on the basis of local factors; for example, one such analysis involved a study of physician screening practices in Michigan to determine risk factors associated with rates of blood lead testing and the proportion of children with EBLLs among Medicaid-enrolled children.

### Hemoglobinopathy screening in primary care in the Netherlands: exploring the problems and needs of patients and general practitioners [^c48887fe]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Future implications

Already in 1998 researchers were thinking about a screening program in The Netherlands, however this was felt to be inappropriate, because of a low number of diagnosed children, a poor understanding of HBP in the at-risk population and difficulties concerning the best moment for screening or prevention. However, since 1998 migration increases in The Netherlands and nowadays 24.4% of the total Dutch population has a migration background. The World Health Organization (WHO) published in 2006 two resolutions on HBP and encouraged a screening program when there are more than 20 affected births per year. In The Netherlands 42 children are diagnosed by the heel prick screening in 2018, thus according to the WHO a screening program is warranted. The heel prick screening is not sufficient as a screening program as the consequences cannot be averted, because of the detection after birth.

### Hemoglobinopathy screening in primary care in the Netherlands: exploring the problems and needs of patients and general practitioners [^5d859c02]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hemoglobinopathies (HBPs) are the most common monogenic autosomal-recessive diseases in humans. The most severe types are sickle cell disease and alpha/beta thalassemia major. Carriers are generally asymptomatic and unaware of their carrier status. Therefore, carrier couples are often unaware that each pregnancy they are facing a 25% genetic risk of having a child with HBP.

Genetic defects in the globin genes encoding the hemoglobin protein are the cause of HBPs. Thalassemia patients have expression defects of the globin genes leading to chronic hemolytic anemia, while sickle cell patients have a specific defect in the globin gene which may lead to polymerization of HbS in deoxygenated state and deformity of the erythrocytes known as sickle cells. These expression and structural defects have severe effects on the patients. Palliative treatment of HBPs is available, consisting of administration of hydroxyurea or blood transfusions. A hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment, however compatible stem cell donors are not always available and the procedure can cause severe complications such as graft-versus-host disease as well as infections.

HBPs are frequently occurring in regions where malaria is or was endemic, as the heterozygous carrier status protects against death from malaria tropica in infancy. Increasing migration on a global scale caused HBPs to become more common in regions non-endemic for malaria, such as North-America and Northern Europe. Nowadays in The Netherlands, around nine children are born with homozygote or compound heterozygote HBP mutations for every 10,000 migrant births.

In 2007 sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia were added to the so-called ‘heel prick’ test, a blood sample taken in the first week after birth. However detecting beta thalassemia carriers is not feasible in the first week of life, because expression of the characteristically elevated hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) is still too low in the first months after birth. From 2007 about 800 HbS heterozygotes and 35–40 babies are detected yearly with sickle cell disease or beta-thalassemia major. Antenatal screening or screening before conception, could be supplementary to the current neonatal screening. This will allow couples at-risk to make an informed reproductive choice for prenatal diagnostics, pre-implantation diagnostics or otherwise and prevent being unexpectedly confronted with a child with a severe disease.

### A novel nano-iron supplement versus standard treatment for iron deficiency anaemia in children 6-35 months (IHAT-GUT trial): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled non-inferiority phase II trial in the Gambia [^3d622817]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

We screened and enrolled children in 3 clusters that were run sequentially (i.e. starting in Jan, May or August 2018). If the enrolment criteria were met, then a small venous blood sample was collected by the study nurse to send to the laboratory for confirmation of Hb levels and determination of serum ferritin. If 7≤ Hb < 11 g/dL and serum ferritin <30 μg/L, the child was invited to a pre-enrolment day back at the clinic (Day 0), 4–5 weeks after the screening visit, for a finger prick to confirm absence of malaria by RDT and to remeasure haemoglobin concentration. Those confirmed eligible were then randomised and enrolled in the study.

On study Day 1, venous blood and stool samples were collected (baseline samples), demographic and immunisation data were collected and a morbidity questionnaire was completed (full details in Supplementary Data S4). Each arm included an intervention period of 85 days plus an additional active follow-up period of 4 weeks post intervention (until Day 113). Highly trained and experienced field workers visited all children every day during the 85 day supplementation period in order to administer the iron supplements or placebo. Every week, at the study health facilities children's wellbeing was checked by the study nurses and they had a finger prick capillary blood collection to determine their malaria and Hb status. On Days 15 and 85, another stool sample and another venous blood sample were collected.

Any child found to have Hb below 7 g/dL during the follow-up study period stopped the study supplementation and was referred to the health centre for management and provided with standard iron syrup for 3 consecutive months according to national and WHO guidelines. These children continued to be followed up for adverse events by the field team without receiving any of the study treatments.

The final study visit was on day 113 (in the post-intervention follow-up period) when a finger prick blood sample was collected and those children that remained anaemic were given standard iron syrup for 3 consecutive months according to the national and WHO guidelines.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^eec1e953]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Effectiveness of a pediatric verbal lead exposure screening protocol in emergency department patients [^94fb7b89]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The population demographics found in many urban emergency departments (EDs) often mirrors those of children at risk for elevated serum lead levels. We evaluated the effectiveness of a verbal lead screening program for screening high-risk children presenting to the ED.

Methods

A prospective observational cohort study was conducted of children aged 9 months to 6 years, living in 2 target counties and presenting to an urban, academic, Midwestern ED. Those with a prior lead level, enrolled in a program requiring lead testing, or with an unstable medical condition were excluded. A 6-question validated verbal survey was administered to all parents of eligible children, and the results recorded in the patient's electronic medical record. Children who screened positive were referred to their local health department for blood lead testing. Health department records were reviewed for follow-up visits and blood lead levels.

Results

During the study period, 3513 children were eligible (mean age, 2.6 years; 53.3% male), with 815 patients screened and 209 (25.6%) screening positive. Most positively screened patients (71.8%) documented only 1 affirmative question, most often indicating they lived in a home built before 1978. Of those children who screened positive, 14.8% (31/209) had a blood lead level performed within 6 months. Of those tested, 4 children had an elevated lead level (>10 µg/dL).

Conclusions

Use of an ED verbal lead exposure screening tool identified children requiring additional follow-up testing. However, health department-referred children had poor follow-up, and few children were ultimately documented with elevated lead levels.

### Elevated blood lead levels in refugee children – new hampshire, 2003-2004 [^5540a95b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

As a result of reductions in lead hazards and improved screening practices, blood lead levels (BLLs) in children aged 1-5 years are decreasing in the United States. However, the risk for elevated BLLs (> or =10 microg/dL) remains high for certain populations, including refugees. After the death of a Sudanese refugee child from lead poisoning in New Hampshire in 2000, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) developed lead testing guidelines to screen and monitor refugee children. These guidelines recommend 1) capillary blood lead testing for refugee children aged 6 months-15 years within 3 months after arrival in New Hampshire, 2) follow-up venous testing of children aged <6 years within 3-6 months after initial screening, and 3) notation of refugee status on laboratory slips for first tests. In 2004, routine laboratory telephone reports of elevated BLLs to the New Hampshire Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (NHCLPPP) called attention to a pattern of elevated BLLs among refugee children. To develop prevention strategies, NHDHHS analyzed NHCLPPP and Manchester Health Department (MHD) data, focusing on the 37 African refugee children with elevated BLLs on follow-up for whom complete data were available. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that 1) follow-up blood lead testing is useful to identify lead exposure that occurs after resettlement and 2) refugee children in New Hampshire older than those routinely tested might have elevated BLLs. Refugee children in all states should be tested for lead poisoning on arrival and several months after initial screening to assess exposure after resettlement.

### Comparability of hemoglobin A1c level measured in capillary versus venous blood sample applying two point-of-care instruments [^391d537e]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although various studies have investigated the difference between the mean capillary blood glucose levels and mean venous blood glucose levels, as mentioned in the introduction, our study can be considered as the first one to assess such a difference in regards to the measurement of mean venous and capillary blood hemoglobin A1c levels with same method.

The findings of our study demonstrated that when NycoCard Reader II assay was used there was a strong correlation between venous and capillary hemoglobin A1c levels, a finding less significant when another assay (CERA STAT 2000) was employed (correlation coefficient: 0.96 versus 0.94). Regardless of the association between hemoglobin A1c levels assessed in venous and capillary blood samples, capillary sampling demonstrated to be of high diagnostic value in both assays in terms of differentiation between poorly-controlled and well-controlled diabetes. Therefore, based on our findings, it can be suggested that due to the high concordance between venous and capillary Hb A1c levels as well as high discriminatory value, the use of capillary blood can be recommended to be applied in diabetes clinical settings for the assessment of diabetes control.

In some studies indicating significant difference in venous and capillary values, some documents were presented to explain this difference such as concentration of proteins and blood cells. In this regard, although some studies have suggested that there are negligible differences when a free flow of blood has been obtained, others have shown definite differences in composition between skin puncture and venous blood samples in neonates, children and adults. On the composition of capillary and venous blood sample, Kupke et al. showed that total protein, bilirubin, calcium, sodium and chloride concentrations were significantly lower in capillary than in venous sample. There was also a tendency for glucose concentrations to be higher in capillary than in venous sample. With regard to difference in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations of capillary and venous blood samples, Kupke et al. also showed that the concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins measured in capillary blood taken from young adults were significantly lower than in venous blood that may reflect differences in the morphological and hemodynamic conditions existing either in large veins or in the peripheral circulatory system. Also, some studies focused difference between venous and fingerstick capillary blood glucose values. Rasaiah et al. showed a typically quoted difference value up to 80 mg/dL between venous and fingerstick capillary blood glucose values one hour after ingestion of 100 grams of glucose.

Hemoglobin and parasitological diagnosis

Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was measured from a finger-prick blood sample using a HemoCue hemoglobin meter (HemoCue301+, Angelholm, Sweden). The hemoglobin meter was checked daily using control blood samples before the survey started. Two to three drops of blood, enough to fill a cuvette, was obtained from each child using the finger prick method by a professional phlebotomist to measure the Hb level of each participant and reported in grams per deciliter. Approximately, 5 g of fresh stool samples were collected from each individual, following the standard operating procedures (SOPs) using clean and labeled leak-proof stool cups. A 10% formalin was added to the stool specimens and transported in screw-capped cups to the laboratory. Direct saline wet mount and formal-ether concentration methods were used to detect intestinal helminths and protozoa infections microscopically within 2–8 h of sample collection.

### Point of care testing for pediatric following up of hemoglobin A1c: concern on product's property [^0d2d6352]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Point of care testing (POCT) is a new concept in laboratory medicine. The POCT tool helps perform the laboratory test at site giving fast result and requires only small amount of sample. It is presently and increasingly used in pediatrics. In pediatric diabetology, the use of POCT for following up of hemoglobin A1C is a new concept. At present, there are several POCT tools for this purpose. In this specific article, the author compares on important aspects (turnaround time and required amount of specimen) of 5 available POCT tools for measurement of hemoglobin A1C level. The test that is the fastest and requires the least amount of blood sample, which means the least harm to the pediatric patient is the most preferable. Here, it can be seen that there is no ideal POCT that has both properties. However, if it is standardized to compare the amount of required blood sample, the special concern in the pediatric patients, the product from multiplication shows that Siemen DCA 2000+ and Siemen DCA Vantage are the two most preferable POCT tools for hemoglobin A1C determination in pediatric diabetes mellitus management.

### Evaluation of the use of non-invasive hemoglobin measurement in early childhood [^ddcc3d57]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia in children affects psychomotor development. We compared the accuracy and trend of a non-invasive transcutaneous spectrophotometric estimation of arterial hemoglobin (Hb) concentration (SpHb) by rainbow pulse CO-oximetry technology to the invasive blood Hb concentration measured by an automated clinical analyzer (Hb-Lab).

Methods

We measured the SpHb and Hb-Lab in 109 patients aged 1-5 years. Regression analysis was used to evaluate differences between the two methods. The bias, accuracy, precision, and limits of agreement of SpHb compared with Hb-Lab were calculated using the Bland-Altman method.

Results

Of the 109 enrolled subjects, 102 pairs of the SpHb and Hb-Lab datasets were collected. The average value of measured Hb was 12.9±1.03 (standard deviation [SD]) g/dL for Hb-Lab. A significant correlation was observed between SpHb and Hb-Lab measurements (SpHb=7.002+0.4722 Hb-Lab, correlation coefficient r=0.548, 95% confidence interval=0.329-0.615). Bland-Altman analysis showed good visual agreement, with a mean bias between SpHb and Hb-Lab of 0.188±0.919g/dL (mean±SD).

Conclusions

We concluded that non-invasive Hb measurement is useful for Hb estimation in children and provides new insights as a screening tool for anemia.

Impact

Our results indicated a good correlation between non-invasive transcutaneous spectrophotometric estimation of arterial hemoglobin (Hb) concentration using a finger probe sensor by rainbow pulse CO-oximetry technology and invasive blood Hb concentration. Although previous studies have indicated that in patients with a worse condition, the bias between the two methods was large, this study, which was conducted on children with stable disease, showed a relatively small bias. Further studies using this non-invasive device might help to understand the current status of anemia in Japan and promote iron intake and nutritional management in children.

Methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Adults 21 to 75 years old with BMI of 30 to 50 kg/m 2, a diagnosis of T2DM 12, 13, a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥ 6.5% and < 10%, and a fasting C‐peptide level > 1.0 ng/mL, who were on a stable diet and exercise routine with or without metformin for ≥ 12 weeks prior to the first day of study drug dosing, were enrolled. Patients with fasting plasma glucose > 240 mg/dL, ≥ 5% weight loss within 8 weeks of screening, symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes or a history of any antihyperglycemic therapy other than metformin for > 3 consecutive days or 7 nonconsecutive days within 12 weeks of screening, a history of insulin therapy within 1 year of screening, osteoporosis, or any history of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, or bariatric surgery were excluded. Patients with recent alcohol abuse (within 6 months of enrollment) as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria were excluded as were patients who tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen.

Study design and procedures

In this phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study (MB130‐002, NCT02097277), patients who completed screening were enrolled in a lead‐in period and received training in subcutaneous injection, finger‐stick procedures, glucose monitoring, and diary completion. Patients who completed the lead‐in phase and were ≥ 80% adherent to treatment were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to receive placebo, pegbelfermin 1 mg daily, 5 mg daily, 20 mg daily, or 20 mg weekly, all subcutaneously administered. Randomization occurred according to a computer‐generated scheme. After the 12‐week treatment period, patients were monitored for an additional 6 weeks. All patients were eligible for open‐label rescue medication for hyperglycemia.

Closed blood sampling devices

Eight studies [,–] examined the impact of using a closed blood sampling device (Table 1, Fig. 3). The studies by Mukhopadhyay and Gleason were rated as fair quality; the other five studies were rated as good quality. The 2011 paper by Mukhopadhyay et al. is a subgroup analysis of their 2010 study ; it includes only patients whose hemoglobin at admission was 115 g/L or higher and who were not transfused during the study. Widness et al. studied a closed blood sampling device used in a pediatric population. They conducted a randomized controlled trial of an in-line blood gas monitor sampling device in the NICU of two institutions. The device returned blood to the infant, combining features of a closed blood sampling system and a point of care testing device, and was classified as a closed blood sampling device for analysis.

The impact of closed blood sampling devices

Four studies, all randomized controlled clinical trials, reported on the impact of closed blood sampling devices on the volume of patient blood loss (Table 1). In all four studies, patients in the intervention group lost less blood than patients in the control group. Three studies found that closed blood sampling devices reduced blood loss by approximately 25%. The absolute reduction among adult patients ranged from 11.4 mL/day (95% CI -19.1, 41.9) to 34 mL/day (95% CI 10.1, 57.9). Widness et al. reported that the in-line blood gas monitor reduced total blood loss during the first 2 weeks of NICU admission by 24%. We included only the studies of adults in the meta-analysis due to differences between adults and newborns in total body blood volume and the volume of blood drawn for testing. The pooled estimate of blood conserved by the use of closed blood sampling devices in adult patients is 24.7 mL/patient/day (95% CI 12.1, 37.1).

### Noninvasive hemoglobin measurement in pediatric trauma patients [^01966be6]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhage is a major cause of preventable death secondary to traumatic injury. Diagnosis often requires multiple blood draws, which are psychologically stressful in pediatric patients. The Pronto device is a pulse co-oximeter that measures the total hemoglobin level using multiple wavelengths of light. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the noninvasive hemoglobin measurements relative to current invasive and point of care testing methods in pediatric trauma patients.

Methods

We performed a prospective observational trial involving patients younger than 17 years presenting to a Level I pediatric trauma center. Following admission, blood was sampled from each patient for testing using an i-Stat device (point-of-care hemoglobin) and a complete blood count within our core laboratory (invasive hemoglobin). Noninvasive hemoglobin analysis was performed within 15 minutes of phlebotomy. Data were evaluated using Spearman correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.

Results

Over 2 years, 114 patients had attempted noninvasive hemoglobin measurements, with a success rate of 89%. Mean ± SD age was 9.2 ± 5.1 years. Ninety percent of admissions were for blunt injury, 3% penetrating, 5% near drowning, and 1% burns. Mean invasive hemoglobin was 12.6 ± 1.9 g/dL, mean point-of-care hemoglobin was 12.2 ± 2.0 g/dL, and mean noninvasive hemoglobin was 12.3 ± 1.6 g/dL. Noninvasive hemoglobin values were strongly correlated with both invasive and point of care measurements (R = 0.672 and R = 0.645, respectively; p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis comparing noninvasive to point-of-care and invasive hemoglobin levels resulted in an estimated bias of -0.39 and -0.49, respectively.

Conclusion

Noninvasive hemoglobin values had excellent correlation with both invasive and point-of-care hemoglobin measurements, although the device was not successful for all patients. Given the rapid availability of results and the lack of requirement of venipuncture, noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring may be a valuable adjunct in the initial evaluation and monitoring of pediatric trauma patients.

### Validation of a novel point of care testing device for sickle cell disease [^8a893db0]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited blood disorders in the world. SCD is caused by the inheritance of two copies of the gene encoding hemoglobin S, a protein that results from a missense mutation in the β-globin subunit of hemoglobin A, or the co-inheritance of the gene for hemoglobin S and another abnormal or nonfunctional hemoglobin gene. Resulting erythrocytes are both unstable, leading to excessive hemolysis, and abnormal, leading to inflammation and vascular occlusion. Patients with SCD have a multitude of complications, including pain, infections, stroke, acute chest syndrome (sickling and occlusion within the pulmonary vasculature), and multi-organ damage. However, improvements in early diagnosis and enhanced preventive care treatment in high-resource countries has led to a dramatic improvement in childhood survival and increase in average lifespan of affected individuals.

Many of the current improvements in treatment of persons with SCD are the direct result of newborn screening, which became universal in the United States 15 years ago. Early diagnosis allows for the initiation of prophylactic antibiotics as well as education of affected families on the importance of immediate evaluation for children with symptoms of complications. However, many low-resource countries in which SCD is far more prevalent remain unable to provide universal newborn screening, and affected children may not be diagnosed until they present with symptoms. In addition to the financial limitations of newborn screening, some countries with relatively high incidences of SCD are also limited by governments that may not recognize or agree with the importance or utility of early testing.

Even in the United States, there remain many barriers to care for persons with SCD. Pain is the hallmark symptom of SCD and is the primary reason for which affected patients seek care. Adult persons with SCD often rely on urgent care services due to a paucity of trained and available specialty providers. In many community hospitals and rural areas, physicians may not have the capability to diagnose affected individuals or confirm disease in patients seeking urgent care. Even when testing is available, results are often delayed and not available until after patients have left the hospital setting. This inability to validate disease status may lead to delay in treatment for affected patients or use of treatment in patients not actually affected by SCD.

### Comparison of the gold standard of hemoglobin measurement with the clinical standard (BGA) and noninvasive hemoglobin measurement (SpHb) in small children: a prospective diagnostic observational study [^1e319355]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Collecting a blood sample is usually necessary to measure hemoglobin levels in children. Especially in small children, noninvasively measuring the hemoglobin level could be extraordinarily helpful, but its precision and accuracy in the clinical environment remain unclear. In this study, noninvasive hemoglobin measurement and blood gas analysis were compared to hemoglobin measurement in a clinical laboratory.

Methods

In 60 healthy preoperative children (0.2-7.6 years old), hemoglobin was measured using a noninvasive method (SpHb; Radical-7 Pulse Co-Oximeter), a blood gas analyzer (clinical standard, BGAHb; ABL 800 Flex), and a laboratory hematology analyzer (reference method, labHb; Siemens Advia). Agreement between the results was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and by determining the percentage of outliers.

Results

Sixty SpHb measurements, 60 labHb measurements, and 59 BGAHb measurements were evaluated. In 38% of the children, the location of the SpHb sensor had to be changed more than twice for the signal quality to be sufficient. The bias/limits of agreement between SpHb and labHb were -0.65/-3.4 to 2.1 g·dl(-1) . Forty-four percent of the SpHb values differed from the reference value by more than 1 g·dl(-1) . Age, difficulty of measurement, and the perfusion index (PI) had no influence on the accuracy of SpHb. The bias/limits of agreement between BGAHb and labHb were 1.14/-1.6 to 3.9 g·dl(-1) . Furthermore, 66% of the BGAHb values differed from the reference values by more than 1 g·dl(-1) . The absolute mean difference between SpHb and labHb (1.1 g·dl(-1) ) was smaller than the absolute mean difference between BGAHb and labHb (1.5 g·dl(-1) /P = 0.024).

Conclusion

Noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin agrees more with the reference method than the measurement of hemoglobin using a blood gas analyzer. However, both methods can show clinically relevant differences from the reference method (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01693016).

All patients signed written consent to participate in testing by finger stick at the POC. For pediatric patients under 18 years of age, informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from their parent or guardian. IRB approval was obtained from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to conduct a pilot trial using this POC test device in patients with SCD and their family members followed at the MUSC SCD clinic. All SCD providers in the clinic were trained in reading the testing device prior to the initiation of testing.

Subjects of all ages were included in the trial. According to the approved IRB protocol, all included patients with SCD had to have a current HPLC hemoglobin variant result. In most infants between 6–12 months of age, HPLC is not assessed routinely after the initial confirmatory assessment. Thus, although the LoD for both HbS and HbC (1 % and 2 %, respectively) discussed above in the ex vivo study demonstrates that the test will likely be useful in newborn children, they were not included in this validation study and a follow-up study in neonates will be undertaken. Those who had received a blood transfusion within the last 60 days or whose hemoglobin genotype was not previously known were excluded. Patients receiving hydroxyurea therapy were included. At the time of consent, 71 patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria based on their history and were consented to undergo testing. Blood was obtained from the finger pad using a standard lancet for capillary testing. Five microliters of blood was collected using the capillary sampler provided in the testing kit and added to the buffered loaded module. After inverting the module × 3, five drops of hemolyzed sample were dropped onto the inlet of the Sickle SCAN™ cartridge. Results were read within 120 seconds. The Sickle SCAN™ test result was determined after visual inspection sequentially by two independent providers who determined the results separately without reference to one another. Due to timing, the initial provider read the test at 2 minutes and the second provider read the test between 4–10 minutes after sample had been added. In affected patients, the first provider had knowledge of the patient’s genotype prior to testing. However, the second provider was always blind to the sample being tested. On average, all testers reviewed each sample within 5 minutes of testing.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^7281e13f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric dyslipidemia—testing methods and thresholds: Use of fasting total cholesterol (total-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) to calculate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) is described, with nonfasting sampling acceptable for non–HDL-C; if non–HDL-C is ≥145 mg/dL (95th percentile) additional follow-up is recommended and two fasting lipid profiles should be obtained and averaged; blood samples may be drawn by venipuncture or finger stick and point-of-care lipid testing correlates with standard laboratories; routine measurement of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], apolipoprotein B (apo B), apolipoprotein A1 (apo A1), and lipoprotein subclasses is not recommended at this time but Lp(a) may be useful in selected cases, including as a risk accelerator in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in addition to non–HDL-C and LDL-C levels.

### Poor validity of noninvasive hemoglobin measurements by pulse oximetry compared with conventional absorptiometry in children in Côte D'ivoire [^e4e3cb9c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia remains a major public health issue in many African communities. We compared a novel, commercially available noninvasive hemoglobin (Hb)-measuring device to direct Hb measurements by finger-prick samples in a pediatric cohort in rural Côte d'Ivoire. Noninvasive Hb measurements were attempted in 191 children 2-15 years of age and obtained in 102 (53.5%) children. The median Hb for the 102 children was 12.0 g/dL (interquartile range [IQR] = 11.3-12.7 g/dL) for conventional absorptiometry and 13.3 g/dL (IQR = 12.1-14.2 g/dL) for noninvasive measurements. A Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a median bias of +1.1 g/dL (IQR = 0.4-2.0 g/dL), with greater overestimation of Hb by noninvasive testing occurring at low Hb values. This overestimation of the noninvasive Hb-measuring device to direct Hb measurements persisted across preschool- and school-aged children, and both sexes. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.50 for children 4-9 years of age, and 0.33 for children 10-15 years of age. Further study and development of noninvasive Hb devices is necessary prior to implementation in African pediatric populations.
