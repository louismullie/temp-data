## Question

Can diltiazem be used in combination with other antihypertensive medications?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diltiazem can be used in combination with other antihypertensive medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indications. Then, I should verify pharmacodynamic compatibility and key safety caveats, especially with beta-blockers and heart failure. Next, I will review pharmacokinetic interactions that could alter exposure of coadministered drugs. After that, I should consider special populations such as cancer patients, those with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, and patients with CKD or diabetes. Finally, I will synthesize practical combination strategies and monitoring recommendations, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that anchors the answer. Multiple FDA labels for diltiazem extended-release formulations explicitly state that diltiazem may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications, which directly supports combination therapy in hypertension management [^114BhusA] [^112Cpm1d] [^112tXu61] [^113kCZfV] [^111Cpbrr] [^1153G3cS].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacodynamic rationale before jumping ahead. Diltiazem lowers blood pressure primarily by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and reducing peripheral resistance, and its antihypertensive effect is additive when combined with other classes, which is why labels advise dose adjustments when adding or removing concomitant antihypertensives to avoid excessive hypotension [^115X42CJ] [^112inTFk] [^111Evyno].

> Hold on, I should confirm the key safety caveats, especially around beta-blockers and cardiac conduction. Although diltiazem is often combined with beta-blockers, both agents can depress AV nodal conduction and myocardial contractility, so the combination warrants caution and may require dose modification; labels and clinical guidance emphasize monitoring for bradycardia, heart block, and heart failure exacerbation, and contemporary European guidance recommends avoiding the combination in patients with coronary artery disease when feasible [^112inTFk] [^113x9FVN].

> I need to check heart failure considerations carefully. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem, are not recommended in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to negative inotropy and potential to worsen symptoms; if hypertension persists despite GDMT, dihydropyridine CCBs like amlodipine are preferred, and diltiazem should generally be avoided in this setting [^1126ELQq] [^1162KnnB].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetic interactions that could change exposure of coadministered drugs. Diltiazem is a moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, so it can increase levels of substrates like simvastatin, lovastatin, certain immunosuppressants, and dabigatran; labels and guidelines advise dose limits for simvastatin and lovastatin when combined with diltiazem and recommend preferential use of non–CYP3A4 statins when possible, while observational data suggest increased bleeding risk when diltiazem is combined with dabigatran, prompting caution and consideration of alternatives or dose adjustments [^114u33Xy] [^1172hB1v] [^116Knrhv].

> But wait, what if the patient is on oncology therapy or has cancer treatment–induced hypertension. I should double-check that guidance. Nondihydropyridine CCBs, including diltiazem, are generally avoided in active cancer treatment because many anticancer agents are CYP3A4 substrates, and coadministration can raise chemotherapy exposure and toxicity; in this scenario, dihydropyridine CCBs or other classes are preferred for blood pressure control [^114WCrtR] [^116iSRm6] [^114DH6YD].

> Let me consider atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation, since diltiazem is commonly used for rate control. I should confirm bleeding risk signals. Real-world comparative studies suggest that coadministration of diltiazem with dabigatran increases bleeding risk compared with amlodipine or metoprolol, and guideline statements advise caution with nondihydropyridine CCBs when used with oral anticoagulants; if used together, close monitoring and dose adjustments are prudent [^114hs4u9] [^111wXkvG].

> I will now examine CKD and diabetic kidney disease, because proteinuria modifies agent selection. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs like diltiazem can modestly reduce proteinuria beyond blood pressure lowering, and KDIGO notes they can be considered when ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not tolerated, though they are not first-line for renoprotection; in transplant recipients, diltiazem can increase calcineurin inhibitor levels, so if used, immunosuppressant doses may need reduction and closer monitoring [^114BD5tH] [^1118zHW9].

> Let me synthesize practical combination strategies while keeping these constraints in mind. Diltiazem combines well with thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs, and these pairings are consistent with guideline-preferred combinations that leverage complementary mechanisms and mitigate adverse effects; however, when combining with a beta-blocker, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for bradycardia, conduction delays, and heart failure symptoms, especially in patients with CAD or conduction disease [^115qwZwT] [^111tvyis] [^113x9FVN].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and titration details to ensure safe implementation. Typical starting doses of extended-release diltiazem for hypertension are 180–240 mg once daily, with titration to 360–540 mg if needed, and maximum antihypertensive effect is usually seen by about 14 days; when adding another antihypertensive, consider reducing the dose of the incumbent agent to mitigate additive hypotension, then titrate based on response [^112inTFk] [^112Ywias] [^111qUd74].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities. Baseline and periodic checks should include blood pressure, heart rate, signs of edema, and symptoms of hypotension or bradycardia; in patients with conduction disease, on beta-blockers, or with heart failure, consider ECG monitoring, and in those on statins or anticoagulants affected by CYP3A4 or P-gp, review drug levels or clinical effects and adjust as indicated [^116Dv1aF] [^114u33Xy] [^114hs4u9].

> In summary, yes, diltiazem can be used in combination with other antihypertensive medications, and multiple FDA labels endorse this practice. However, I need to ensure careful selection of partners, avoid high-risk combinations in heart failure and certain cancer therapies, respect CYP3A4/P-gp interactions, and monitor closely for hypotension, bradycardia, and conduction effects, adjusting doses as needed to maintain safety and efficacy [^114BhusA] [^112Cpm1d] [^1126ELQq] [^114WCrtR] [^114u33Xy].

---

Diltiazem can be used with other antihypertensives, but **caution is required** due to additive effects and interactions. It is commonly combined with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics, and dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. amlodipine) to improve blood pressure control [^115qwZwT] [^111tvyis]. Avoid combining diltiazem with **beta-blockers** or **nondihydropyridine CCBs** (e.g. verapamil) because of the risk of bradycardia, heart block, and heart failure [^113x9FVN] [^notfound]. Monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and drug interactions — especially with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. simvastatin, dabigatran) — and adjust doses as needed [^113ZebWZ] [^114u33Xy] [^114hs4u9].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for combination therapy

Diltiazem, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, lowers blood pressure by **vasodilation and reduced peripheral resistance** [^115X42CJ]. Combining it with other antihypertensives can provide additive or synergistic effects, enabling lower doses and fewer side effects [^115qwZwT].

---

## Common and recommended combinations

Several combinations with diltiazem are **clinically accepted and commonly used**:

| **Combination** | **Rationale** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors (e.g. lisinopril, enalapril) | - Additive BP lowering <br/> - Reduced proteinuria in CKD | - Monitor for hypotension <br/> - Hyperkalemia <br/> - Renal function |
| ARBs (e.g. losartan, valsartan) | - Additive BP lowering <br/> - Reduced proteinuria in CKD | - Monitor for hypotension <br/> - Hyperkalemia <br/> - Renal function |
| Thiazide diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide) | - Additive BP lowering <br/> - Counter edema from CCBs | - Monitor for electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Dehydration |
| Dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. amlodipine) | - Additive BP lowering <br/> - Reduced peripheral edema | - Monitor for hypotension <br/> - Peripheral edema |

---

These combinations are supported by clinical guidelines and studies showing improved blood pressure control and favorable safety profiles [^115qwZwT] [^113RewBE].

---

## Combinations requiring caution or avoidance

Certain combinations with diltiazem should be **avoided or used with extreme caution** due to significant risks:

- **Beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol, carvedilol)**: Risk of bradycardia, heart block, and heart failure exacerbation [^113x9FVN] [^113PGhcr].
- **Nondihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. verapamil)**: Increased risk of bradycardia, heart block, and negative inotropic effects [^114RUYTq].
- **CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin, dabigatran)**: Diltiazem inhibits CYP3A4, increasing levels and toxicity risk; dose adjustments or alternative agents are recommended [^114u33Xy] [^114hs4u9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Clinical studies support diltiazem combinations, including with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which provide **additive BP lowering and renal benefits** in CKD [^114BD5tH]. Thiazide diuretics enhance efficacy and mitigate edema, while dihydropyridine CCBs offer additional BP lowering with a favorable side-effect profile [^115qwZwT].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Combination therapy with diltiazem may cause:

- **Hypotension**: Especially with other vasodilators or diuretics [^114VXSkv].
- **Bradycardia and conduction disturbances**: Particularly with beta-blockers or other nondihydropyridine CCBs [^113x9FVN] [^113PGhcr].
- **Drug interactions**: Due to CYP3A4 inhibition, increasing levels of coadministered drugs [^113ZebWZ] [^114u33Xy].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment strategies

When combining diltiazem with other antihypertensives:

- **Monitor blood pressure and heart rate**: Regularly, especially after initiating or adjusting therapy.
- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Hypotension, bradycardia, edema, and signs of drug interactions.
- **Adjust doses**: Based on clinical response and tolerability; consider lower initial doses when combining with other antihypertensives [^112inTFk].

---

## Special patient populations

- **Elderly patients**: Greater risk of hypotension and bradycardia; start low and titrate slowly.
- **Patients with renal impairment**: Monitor renal function and electrolytes closely.
- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Diltiazem metabolism may be impaired; dose adjustments may be necessary [^114Q5TxX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines support diltiazem in combination therapy for hypertension, emphasizing careful selection of coadministered agents, monitoring for adverse effects, and dose adjustments to optimize efficacy and safety [^111tvyis] [^115qwZwT].

---

Diltiazem can be combined with other antihypertensives, but **careful selection, monitoring, and dose adjustments are essential** to balance efficacy and safety. Avoid combinations with beta-blockers or other nondihydropyridine CCBs, and be vigilant for drug interactions, especially with CYP3A4 substrates.

1.1 Hypertension

Diltiazem Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Diltiazem Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.

1.2 Angina

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Patients controlled on diltiazem alone or in combination with
other medications may be switched to diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release
capsules at the nearest equivalent total daily dose. Higher doses of diltiazem
hydrochloride extended-release capsules may be needed in some patients. Patients
should be closely monitored. Subsequent titration to higher or lower doses may
be necessary and should be initiated as clinically warranted. There is limited
general clinical experience with doses above 360 mg, but doses to 540 mg have
been studied in clinical trials. The incidence of side effects increases as the
dose increases with first-degree AV block, dizziness, and sinus bradycardia
bearing the strongest relationship to dose.

Hypertension: Dosage needs to be adjusted by
titration to individual patient needs. When used as monotherapy, reasonable
starting doses are 180 to 240 mg once daily, although some patients may respond
to lower doses. Maximum antihypertensive effect is usually observed by 14 days
of chronic therapy; therefore, dosage adjustments should be scheduled
accordingly. The usual dosage range studied in clinical trials was 240 to 360 mg
once daily. Individual patients may respond to higher doses of up to 480 mg once
daily.

Angina: Dosages for the treatment of angina should be
adjusted to each patient's needs, starting with a dose of 120 or 180 mg once
daily. Individual patients may respond to higher doses of up to 480 mg once
daily. When necessary, titration may be carried out over a 7- to 14-day
period.

CONCOMITANT USE WITH OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR AGENTS:

1. Sublingual NTG - May be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks
during diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release capsules therapy.

2. Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy - Diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release
capsules may be safely coadministered with short-and long-acting
nitrates.

3. **Beta-Blockers**: (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

4. Antihypertensives - Diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release capsules have
an additive antihypertensive effect when used with other antihypertensive
agents. Therefore, the dosage of diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release
capsules or the concomitant antihypertensives may need to be adjusted when
adding one to the other.

Antihypertensive medication interactions — classification, CYP3A4 involvement, and combination effects — are described with practical examples: Drug-drug interactions are categorized as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, with key pharmacokinetic interactions involving the CYP3A4 pathway where verapamil and diltiazem can alter metabolism of other medications. Beneficial pharmacodynamic combinations include pairing a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize diuretic-induced hypokalemia or combining a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas overlapping mechanisms such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) plus angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or direct renin inhibitor increase the risk of hyperkalemia as an adverse pharmacodynamic interaction.

### Diltiazem (diltiazem hydrochloride) [^111W7QDn]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

As with all drugs, care should be exercised when treating patients with
multiple medications. Diltiazem undergoes biotransformation by cytochrome P-450
mixed function oxidase. Coadministration of diltiazem with other agents which
follow the same route of biotransformation may result in the competitive
inhibition of metabolism. Especially in patients with renal and/or hepatic
impairment, dosages of similarly metabolized drugs, particularly those of low
therapeutic ratio, may require adjustment when starting or stopping
concomitantly administered diltiazem to maintain optimum therapeutic blood
levels.

Beta-Blockers:Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that
concomitant use of diltiazem and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated, but
available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant
treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction
abnormalities.

Administration of diltiazem concomitantly with propranolol in five normal
volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and
bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%. In vitro,
propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If
combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol,
an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted. (See WARNINGS .)

Cimetidine:A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase
in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and area-under-the-curve (53%) after a
1-week course of cimetidine at 1200 mg per day and a single dose of diltiazem 60
mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect may be
mediated by cimetidine's known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P-450, the
enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem. Patients
currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for a change
in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with
cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted.

4 Antihypertensive therapy needs to be individualized in cancer patients, given considerations for the effects of cancer and cancer therapies

In addition to adhering to ACC/AHA guidelines, clinicians should be aware that cancer patients are at higher risk for orthostatic hypotension after initiation of antihypertensive medications and may warrant short-interval assessment of symptoms and orthostatic vitals. One can tailor antihypertensive therapy to cancer patients allowing for "sick-day protocol": withholding these medications for 24 to 48 h during symptomatic episodes to prevent risk of volume depletion. Consideration of medication interactions from oncology therapeutics is necessary, including the avoidance of hypertensive agents that are metabolized by cytochrome p450 3A4 (i.e. verapamil and diltiazem) given many cancer therapies also interact with this pathway. The investigators recommend an individualized discussion of goals of care, prognosis, comorbidities, and pain control before antihypertensive therapy initiation and/or modification.

### Heart rate-lowering and-regulating effects of once-daily sustained-release diltiazem [^116eoxsa]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that an elevated heart rate (HR) is an adverse and independent prognostic factor in arterial hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Although diltiazem is characterized as an HR-lowering calcium antagonist, no studies have quantified the magnitude of HR changes in patients with angina or hypertension.

Hypothesis

The study was undertaken to explore the magnitude of proportional HR reduction at varying levels of resting HR with the sustained-release formulation of diltiazem (SR diltiazem) at the usual clinical doses of 200 or 300 mg once daily.

Methods

This meta-analysis was conducted on six comparative double-blind studies including 771 patients with angina or hypertension in which SR diltiazem 200–300 mg once daily was compared either with placebo or with other agents known not to influence HR (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics). Sustained-release diltiazem decreases elevated baseline HR, with an increasing effect at higher initial rates.

Results

Multiple comparisons by baseline HR category showed a significant difference between both groups for baseline HR of 74–84 beats/min and ≥ 85 beats/min (p = 0.001). Sustained-release diltiazem had no significant HR-decreasing effect on baseline HR ≤ 74 beats/min but appears to have a genuine regulating effect on HR: it reduces tachycardia without inducing excessive bradycardia. These findings are in contrast to those with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, which tend to increase HR and have been associated with an adverse outcome in acute cardiovascular conditions. At the same time, there is evidence to suggest that HR-lowering calcium-channel blockers decrease cardiovascular event rates following myocardial infarction.

Conclusion

When calcium antagonists are indicated for use in patients with angina or hypertension, an HR-lowering agent, that is, diltiazem rather than dihydropyridine, should be recommended.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^116Knrhv]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), first introduced into the market in 2010, have become more popular as a stroke prevention therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation owing to less complexity in therapeutic dosing in addition to equivalent efficacy and superior safety compared with warfarin. Even though adverse bleeding events are of less concern among patients receiving DOACs compared with those receiving traditional warfarin therapy, the risk of major bleeding events is still present. This risk can be further increased when DOACs are administered with other medications that inhibit their metabolic or absorption pathways, such as through CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition.

The prevalence of hypertension is high among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation — about 70% to 90% based on data from randomized clinical trials of DOACs, — and use of antihypertensive drugs is common. Verapamil hydrochloride and diltiazem hydrochloride are nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking antihypertensives that are also recommended as a heart rate control therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. As both drugs are combined P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors, they can contribute to clinically relevant drug-drug interactions when coadministered with DOACs. Little direct clinical evidence has been provided regarding these drug-drug interactions. An observational study by Chang et alfound no increased bleeding risk among patients receiving both DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem compared with those receiving DOACs alone. However, the lack of active comparators in that study could lead to insurmountable biases and residual confounding as pointed out by several response letters. Suspected drug-drug interactions should be evaluated individually using active control groups strategically selected to better overlap either in biological target or therapeutic use to the exposure of interest.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (matzim LA) [^115X42CJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The therapeutic effects of diltiazem are believed to be related to its ability to inhibit the cellular influx of calcium ions during membrane depolarization of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.

Hypertension: Diltiazem produces its antihypertensive effect primarily by relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and the resultant decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension; thus hypertensive individuals experience an antihypertensive effect, whereas there is only a modest fall in blood pressure in normotensives.

Angina: Diltiazem has been shown to produce increases in exercise tolerance, probably due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. This is accomplished via reductions in heart rate and systemic blood pressure at submaximal and maximal workloads. Diltiazem has been shown to be a potent dilator of coronary arteries, both epicardial and subendocardial. Spontaneous and ergonovine-induced coronary artery spasms are inhibited by diltiazem.

In animal models, diltiazem interferes with the slow inward (depolarizing) current in excitable tissue. Diltiazem causes excitation-contraction uncoupling in various myocardial. Diltiazem produces relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle and dilation of both large and small coronary arteries at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect. The resultant increases in coronary blood flow (epicardial and subendocardial) occur in ischemic and nonischemic models and are accompanied by dose-dependent decreases in systemic blood pressure and decreases in peripheral resistance.

For patients unable to tolerate even low-dose ACEi, ARB, MRA, or DRI, alternative antihypertensive agents are recommended for both control of BP and improvement in urine protein excretion; nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil modestly reduce proteinuria, whereas beta blockers, diuretics, and α-1 blockers also reduce proteinuria but to a lesser degree, and dihydropyridine CCB, methyldopa and guanfacine have little impact and may even increase proteinuria; patients who fail to achieve adequate reduction in urine protein despite BP control should be counseled to further restrict dietary sodium as a nonpharmacologic means of reducing proteinuria.

Thiazide — the first-choice antihypertensive drug?

The LEGEND project (Large-Scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases) evaluated data of 4.9 million patients from 9 different databases in the USA, South Korea, Germany and Japan, in which treatment of hypertension was initiated with a single drug. A total of 55 safety and efficacy endpoints were examined. The following three events were chosen as primary endpoints: acute myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization and stroke. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness compared with ACE-I. The relative risk reduction when treated with thiazide diuretics compared with ACE-I was 17% (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74–0.95) for stroke, 17% (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74–0.95) for heart failure hospitalization and 16% (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.75–0.95) for acute myocardial infarction, respectively. There were no differences between ACE-I, ARB and CCB. Significantly inferior to all classes were non-dihydropyridine-CCB (diltiazem). Interestingly, the side effects were comparable across all groups.

Clinical implication

One of the limitations of this analysis is the retrospective design. Physicians might have preferred ACE-I over a diuretic in patients with increased CV risk. That would explain why the effects on CV diseases in this group are more significant compared with the ACE-I-group. Furthermore, patients were treated with monotherapy, which is no longer recommended. Lastly, information about adherence to therapy and BP data are missing.

### Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: basic pharmacological similarities but fundamental therapeutic differences [^116v8y6U]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Recent trials indicate that treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients (including those with significant coronary artery disease). Since the fundamental mechanism of action of all CCBs is the same, it might be assumed that the findings of these outcome studies can be generalized to all types of CCB. However, in the light of the well-recognized clinical pharmacological differences between the 'rate-limiting' agents, verapamil and diltiazem, and the dihydropyridine group of CCBs, this must be considered to be a misconception. Less well-recognized, and often ignored, are the significant differences between agents within the dihydropyridine group. These differences translate to distinct differences in the therapeutic profiles and may well translate into differences in outcome during long-term treatment. Thus, the differences in pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and therapeutic profiles make it clear that caution should be exercised in assuming that all dihydropyridine CCBs licensed for once-daily administration are equivalent in terms of their durations of action and overall antihypertensive efficacy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

Inter-current illness

There are risks of large reductions in eGFR with RAAS blockade, particularly during intercurrent illness or with intravascular fluid depletion (diarrhoea, vomiting and high fever). It is therefore recommended to reduce the dose or to hold off ACEI or ARB use until recovery is made, because ensuing hypotension may cause an acute decline in eGFR in people with type 2 diabetes with CKD who are taking ACEIs or ARBs. It is recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be advised to stop RAAS-blocking drugs during periods of acute illness and restarted 24–48 h after recovery from the illness. These precautions should especially be taken if an individual is on a combination involving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or diuretics.

Other agents for blood pressure lowering in people with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy

Most of the evidence for the use of other antihypertensive agents (apart from ACEIs or ARBs) is extrapolated from the general population and there is little evidence of their specific use or rationale in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Calcium channel blockers

There is good evidence to suggest that non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) reduce proteinuria. A multicentre trial in people with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy suggested that adding a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker to an ACEI-based regime can be effective at lowering residual albuminuria with or without a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure. Thus non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be used as a valid additive or alternative to ACEIs or ARBs in people with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that their renal protective effects are over and above blood pressure lowering alone. Diltiazem and verapamil can induce bradycardia and heart block in combination with beta blockers; dihydropyridines such as amlodipine are more appropriate alongside beta blocker use.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^114hs4u9]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In our study of patients with no history of kidney disease receiving DOACs who had received a standard dose of each drug, use of dabigatran with concomitant verapamil or diltiazem was associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with the combination of DOACs with amlodipine or metoprolol. There were no statistically significant findings for comparisons within groups using rivaroxaban or apixaban with verapamil or diltiazem vs the active comparison groups. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first real-world evidence of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between these medications and suggest that caution may be necessary when coprescribing dabigatran with common antihypertensive medications — verapamil and diltiazem — and possibly other moderate to strong P-gp inhibitors regardless of kidney function.

Dabigatran is a prodrug that undergoes efflux by P-gp and subsequent elimination via the intestinal tract or other elimination organs and is not a substrate for CYP450 enzymes. Thus, inhibition of P-gp increases the bioavailability of the prodrug, leading to increased serum concentrations of the active metabolite. Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate to strong P-gp inhibitors along with other common medications, such as amiodarone, proton-pump inhibitors, some antidepressants, and azole antifungals. In US Food and Drug Administration briefing documents, verapamil, used as a reference agent for drug-drug interactions, was reported to increase the area under the curve of dabigatran by over 143% with a single concomitant dose and by 18% when separated by a 2-hour dosing interval. In the phase 3 RE-LY clinical trial, P-gp inhibition led to an increase in major bleeding event rates (4.12% vs 2.96% for 150 mg dose; 3.99% vs 2.38% for 110 mg dose) though these findings were not statistically significant given the sample size in the trial. These figures represented a relative increase in bleeding risk of 39% to 68%, which are consistent with the findings from this study.

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first real-world observational study that evaluated the drug-drug interaction between DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs active comparators. This design may help to reduce indication and healthy user biases, provide some control for disease severity, and also provide useful information for patients and prescribers when they need to consider an alternative treatment.

However, there are still several limitations in our study. First, we only looked at the use of verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and metoprolol before DOAC initiation, and required 90 days of cumulative use of these medications during the previous 6-month period with strict criteria for censoring at discontinuation or switching of any study medication (DOACs or antihypertensives). While this approach substantially reduced our sample size, it helped to create a more homogeneous population of patients receiving long-term therapy with each medication and provided strong exposure definitions. Second, owing to the small sample size, we combined data on verapamil and diltiazem. Although this combination is not ideal from a study design perspective, both verapamil and diltiazem are categorized as combined P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, have similar on-label and off-label indications, and are expected to behave similarly in terms of drug-drug interaction mechanisms.

As in all other observational studies, the potential of unmeasured confounding may not be avoided; however, we minimized this by having an active comparator study design in addition to IPTW methods and a large number of covariates. Owing to the limitations of claims data, we could not observe when patients administered the drugs; thus, our conclusions were based on the assumption that patients followed what had been recommended by physicians. Our exposure definition required continuous adherence with a small gap window (7-day) to ensure exposure. Likewise, the claims database would not include information on when patients acquired prescriptions not paid for by their insurance coverage, such as over-the-counter or sample medications, but this information is not expected to be imbalanced between treatment groups and would likely not affect the study results. Our results were consistent in direction and magnitude to several sensitivity analyses including use of standardized mortality ratio weighting in place of IPTW, use of a 15-day gap censor criterion, outcome measurement using all primary and secondary diagnoses, and separating verapamil and diltiazem.

Background

The aim of the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study was to compare patients with essential hypertension receiving calcium-antagonist-based treatment with diltiazem and similar patients receiving conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based treatment, with respect to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To assess the influence of age, sex, severity of hypertension and heart rate on treatment effects, in a sub-analysis.

Methods

The NORDIL study was prospective, randomized, open and endpoint-blinded. It enrolled, at health centres in Norway and Sweden, 10 881 patients aged 50–74 years who had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 100 mmHg or more. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP were decreased by 20.3/18.7 mmHg in the diltiazem group and by 23.3/18.7 mmHg in the diuretic/beta-blocker group - a significant difference in SBP (P < 0.001).

Results

The incidence of the primary endpoint - a composite of cardiovascular death, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction - was similar for the two treatments. Fatal and non-fatal stroke occurred in 159 patients in the diltiazem group and in 196 patients in the conventional treatment group [relative risk (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; P = 0.040], whereas there was a non-significant inverse tendency with respect to all myocardial infarction. There were significantly fewer cerebral strokes in patients receiving diltiazem in the subgroups with baseline SBP > 170 mmHg (n = 5420, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98; P = 0.032), DBP ≥ 105 mmHg (n = 5881, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.97; P = 0.030) and pulse pressure ≥ 66 mmHg (n = 5461, RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.99, P = 0.041), and more myocardial infarctions in those with heart rate less than 74 beats/min (n = 5303, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; P = 0.040). However, the tendencies for fewer strokes and greater incidence of myocardial infarction were present across subgroups when results were analysed for age, sex, severity of hypertension and heart rate, and treatment-subgroup interaction analyses were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Compared with a conventional diuretic/beta-blocker-based antihypertensive regimen, there were additional 25% reductions in stroke in the diltiazem-treated patients with blood pressure or pulse pressure greater than the medians, and an increase in myocardial infarction in those with heart rate less than the median. Such findings may be attributable to chance, but the consistency of, in particular, the stroke findings may also suggest an ability of diltiazem, beyond conventional treatment, to prevent cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients with the greatest cardiovascular risk.

### Pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112CdtuD]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — calcium channel blocker dosing, tolerability, and regulatory status: High doses of CCBs may be required to realize full hemodynamic benefit, with typical dosages of amlodipine 20 to 30 mg/d, nifedipine 180 to 240 mg/d, or diltiazem 720 to 960 mg/d; these high dosages are well tolerated with ankle edema as the major side effect, which can be treated with diuretics, and CCBs are not specifically approved for PAH by the FDA or European Medicines Agencies.

### Hypertension and prohypertensive antineoplastic therapies in cancer patients [^116iSRm6]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, specific guidance on the choice of antihypertensive agents in the cancer population is lacking. When choosing antihypertensive agents, it is important that careful consideration is given to drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as the presence of comorbidities and potential side effects. For example, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), such as verapamil and diltiazem, should not be used in combination with most VEGFI as they have the potential for cytochrome P450 inhibition, which may lead to elevated circulating VEGFI concentrations. The choice of first-line antihypertensive agent generally follows national guidelines for hypertension management, as there is currently no clinical evidence to support the use of one class of agent over another.

Dihydropyridine CCB such as amlodipine or nifedipine potently reduce arterial smooth muscle cell contractility in blood vessels. Therefore, given the role vascular dysfunction plays in the development of hypertension with many anticancer agents (Figure 3), CCB are likely to be effective in this setting. Indeed, a study of 36 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer who developed hypertension with bevacizumab therapy demonstrated the efficacy of amlodipine in achieving blood pressure control. Nonetheless, it is often necessary to combine 2 or more antihypertensive agents to achieve satisfactory blood pressure levels. In this setting, combination of an ACEI or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with a CCB is generally accepted as the first choice (Figure 4).

Despite a lack of robust evidence for a major role of the RAAS in the prohypertensive mechanisms of most anticancer therapies, ACEI and ARB are frequently used in the treatment of VEGFI-associated hypertension and in the treatment of hypertension associated with other cancer therapies. ACEI/ARB may be used preferentially in cancer patients with diabetic nephropathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and cancer-therapy associated proteinuria. Other antihypertensive agents such as diuretics and β-blockers may be used when ACEI/ARB and CCB are ineffective in normalizing blood pressure. Of note, diuretics should be prescribed with caution for patients at risk of dehydration. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as eplerenone and spironolactone are increasingly being administered to patients with resistant hypertension, and they may be a useful option in the management of cancer therapy-associated hypertension that is unresponsive to conventional therapy.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^112FctRa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our objective was to conduct a targeted comparative safety analysis of the potential drug-drug interaction between verapamil or diltiazem and DOACs using an active comparator study design to reduce the residual confounding present in existing real-world studies. An ideal active comparator should be either of the same medication class or be used for similar purposes as the reference product. Therefore, we selected 2 different comparators: amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking antihypertensive drug, and metoprolol, a β-blocker antihypertensive that is also recommended for heart rate control in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. These 2 drugs are not classified as P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors and provide similar pharmacologic pathways and therapeutic uses compared with verapamil and diltiazem. We aimed to compare the risk of major, moderate, and minor adverse bleeding events among patients with concomitant use of DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs concomitant use of DOACs and amlodipine or metoprolol.

### Hypertension in cancer patients and survivors: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^114DH6YD]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

In individuals at high risk of volume depletion who also have proteinuria, it may be preferable to defer renin-angiotensin system–blocking drugs or, in those with transient risk of volume loss, recommend a sick-day protocol to temporarily withhold these medications on days in which they have symptoms. Correspondingly, diuretic and mineralocorticoid antagonist therapies are often added, or titrated, later in the cascade of antihypertensive therapy in patients on undergoing active cancer treatment, because these patients are at higher risk for volume depletion through reduced intake of nutrients and fluids, as well as increased volume losses from diarrhea or vomiting, predisposing them to electrolyte abnormalities and acute kidney injury. If there is no further individual-level contraindication, diuretic therapy (specifically thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics) should be considered first-line therapy in patients undergoing active surveillance and in cancer survivors. Similarly, if there is no contraindication, mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy should be used in individuals with resistant hypertension, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia.

Depending on the half-life and frequency of chemotherapy administration, some individuals may not be able to be treated with a fixed dose of antihypertensive medication. These individuals may particularly benefit from frequent home blood pressure monitoring (see the preceding section Approach to out-of-office blood pressure monitoring), including instructions on antihypertensive medication–holding parameters and appropriate supplemental dosing of antihypertensive medications for fluctuations in blood pressures related to chemotherapy administration and side effects.

Consideration of medication interactions, interfering substances, and polypharmacy

Currently, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem are avoided because they use cytochrome p450 3A4, a feature shared by many chemotherapy agents, risking potentiation of chemotherapy toxicity by inhibiting chemotherapy drug metabolism.

In some individuals undergoing active cancer treatment, the blood pressure cannot be controlled even with multiple antihypertensive agents. In this case, it is reasonable to discuss with the oncologist and the patient a trial of chemotherapy dose reduction, or a chemotherapeutic holiday period. It is also reasonable to consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of other therapeutic agents that may be contributing to high blood pressures, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and high-dose corticosteroids.

Polypharmacy is common in cancer patients. In individuals who require > 1 agent to achieve adequate blood pressure control, it is reasonable to use fixed-dose combinations of first-line agents to minimize pill burden and optimize adherence.

Summary of evidence — statin–calcium channel blocker drug–drug interactions (DDIs) indicates the following: Pharmacokinetic data suggest a minor increase in statin exposure with coadministration of amlodipine and lovastatin or simvastatin, and combination therapy may be considered; there is no evidence of significant interaction when amlodipine is coadministered with other statins; combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and is reasonable in appropriate patients; interactions between diltiazem and either lovastatin or simvastatin are associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although combination therapy may be considered in appropriate patients; DDIs with verapamil and lovastatin or simvastatin are also of moderate intensity, and combination therapy may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks.

### DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE tablet, extended release… [^112z4x2A]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diltiazem Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablet is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker indicated for:

- treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. It can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.
- improving exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects. These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release tablets once-a-day at approximately the same time. Do not chew or crush the tablet. Cardiac Failure: Administer inotropic agents and diuretics. Hypotension: Use vasopressors. Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician. Drug Interactions Impact of diltiazem on other coadministered drugs Anesthetics: The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully.

Beta-blockers: Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated, but available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities. Carbamazepine: Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine, resulting in toxicity in some cases. Clonidine: Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concurrently with diltiazem. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving concomitant diltiazem and clonidine.

Calcium channel blockers — statin co-prescription context is as follows: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) include dihydropyridines (eg, amlodipine, felodipine) and nondihydropyridines (diltiazem and verapamil), and because of clearly defined cardiovascular benefits, CCBs are often co-prescribed in patients treated with statin therapy.

In people unable to tolerate standard doses of amlodipine due to ankle oedema, switching to a more lipophilic agent - such as lercanidipine or lacidipine may be helpful. Alternatively, non-dihydropyridines CCB such as long-acting formulations of verapamil or diltiazem (e.g. diltiazem LA 200/300 mg) may be used, assuming there are no cardiac contra-indications.

In general, SPCs are preferred as they improve adherence and lead to better BP control, compared with single-drug equivalent combinations. However, there is limited availability of suitable SPCs in the UK, as combinations generally do not contain standard doses or drugs. For example, the only dual SPC available in the UK containing indapamide has only 5 mg of perindopril, and the only triple SPC contains olmesartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Although hydrochlorothiazide is commonly used as monotherapy in the USA and is a component in several SPCs in the UK, it is not a first-line NICE-recommended diuretic. While often considered to be less efficacious than chlorthalidone (dose-dependent results), hydrochlorothiazide was not inferior to chlorthalidone in preventing major CV outcomes in a large pragmatic trial (albeit with some design limitations) that randomised more than 13,000 people in the Department of Veterans Affairs Health System. Similar findings were reported from two other large cohort studies. Low-dose thiazides have no placebo-controlled RCT evidence of mortality or morbidity benefits and concerns have been raised about the risk of skin cancer with long-term use of hydrochlorothiazide, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued guidance on its use in the UK. People need to be warned of the cancer risk and the need to avoid sun exposure, and it should not be used in people with a history of skin cancer.

### Efficacy and safety of a once daily graded-release diltiazem formulation in essential hypertension [^114YzUP7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of a chronotherapeutic, graded-release diltiazem HCl extended-release (GRD) 120-, 240-, 360- and 540-mg dose administered once-daily at bedtime (10 PM) were evaluated in a 7-week randomized, double-blind comparison to placebo and to GRD 360 mg administered once-daily at 8 AM in 478 patients with moderate-to-severe essential hypertension.

Methods

We assessed the change from baseline to end point in trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at 6 PM to 10 PM and in mean DBP from 6 AM to 12 noon between GRD 360 mg PM and GRD 360 mg AM, measured by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).

Results

Bedtime doses of GRD showed dose-related mean reductions in trough DBP that were significant for GRD doses of 240 mg and higher. Bedtime GRD 360 mg was associated with a significantly greater reduction in mean DBP between 6 AM and 12 noon compared to morning GRD 360 mg with a least squares mean for treatment difference of -3.3 mm Hg (P = 0.0004). Similar dose-related and significant reductions in systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were obtained. Incidence of adverse events (AEs) for all GRD groups (44.5%) was less than that obtained for the placebo group (49.3%). The 540-mg group showed an incidence of AEs (43.5%) similar to that observed for the 240-mg group (42.6%).

Conclusions

The GRD dose-dependently significantly reduces BP and HR over the 24-h interval after once-daily bedtime dosing. Further greater reductions were obtained between 6 AM and 12 noon, when circadian BP is highest, compared to morning administration of the same dose. The 540-mg GRD was safe, well tolerated, and offers further therapeutic option for patients with severe hypertension who required additional BP control.

### Combination antihypertensive drugs: recommendations… [^113RewBE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

21 assessed the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive therapy using the cardioselective beta blocker bisoprolol alone and in combination with low dosages of hydrochlorothiazide. The dosages of bisoprolol were 2. 5, 5 and 10 mg per day. The hydrochlorothiazide dosages were 6. 25 and 25 mg per day. The study showed that monotherapy with either agent was more effective than placebo, but that when combination therapy was used, the beneficial effects were greater than when either agent was used alone.
21. 22 of black patients with hypertension compared monotherapy using 20 mg per day of enalapril with combination therapy consisting of 20 mg of enalapril plus
12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide per day. Combination therapy significantly reduced systolic, diastolic and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements compared with monotherapy. Combination therapy controlled blood pressure to a level of less than 140/90 mm Hg in 74 percent of patients.

The treatments were compared with each other and with placebo. 27 The greatest antihypertensive effect occurred with the combination of 50 mg of losartan and 12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. This treatment reduced diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in 78 percent of patients. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers work effectively in combination to lower blood pressure. 30–32 In one representative study, 33 diastolic blood pressures were reduced by 3. 6 mm Hg more with a trandolapril-verapamil combination than with monotherapy using either agent. No increase in side effects was observed for treatment with combined trandolapril and verapamil. Calcium channel blocker–ACE inhibitor combinations may result in fewer or milder side effects than occur with either agent alone.

The addition of an ACE inhibitor to therapy with a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist significantly reduces the incidence of peripheral edema and reflex tachycardia. Neither class of medications has prominent metabolic side effects, an advantage in patients with diabetes and renal disease. Four fixed-dose combinations of calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are currently available in the United States. These combinations have yet to be proved more efficacious than antihypertensive combinations containing diuretics.

### Pulse pressure changes with six classes of antihypertensive agents in a randomized, controlled trial [^114JQnoE]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Pulse pressure has been more strongly associated with cardiovascular outcomes, especially myocardial infarction and heart failure, than has systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure in a variety of populations. Little is known, however, of the comparative effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents on pulse pressure. In retrospective analyses of the Veterans Affairs Single-Drug Therapy for Hypertension Study, we compared changes in pulse pressure with 6 classes of antihypertensive agents: 1292 men with diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 109 mm Hg on placebo were randomized to receive hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, prazosin, or placebo. Drug doses were titrated to achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg during a 4- to 8-week medication titration phase. Pulse pressure change (placebo subtracted) was assessed from baseline to the end of the 3-month titration and 1-year maintenance. Mean baseline systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures were 152, 99, and 53 mm Hg, respectively. Reductions in pulse pressure during titration were greater (P < 0.001) with clonidine (6.7 mm Hg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6.2 mm Hg) than with captopril (2.5 mm Hg), diltiazem (1.6 mm Hg), and atenolol (1.4 mm Hg); reduction with prazosin (3.9 mm Hg) was similar to all but clonidine. After 1 year, pulse pressure was reduced significantly more (P < 0.001) with hydrochlorothiazide (8.6 mm Hg) than with captopril and atenolol (4.1 mm Hg with both); clonidine (6.3 mm Hg), diltiazem (5.5 mm Hg), and prazosin (5.0 mm Hg) were intermediate. These data show that classes of antihypertensive agents differ in their ability to reduce pulse pressure. Whether these differences affect rates of cardiovascular events remains to be determined.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^116yT1jH]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

An important caveat is that most patients with hypertension require multi-drug therapy to reach treatment goals, especially diabetic patients whose targets are lower. Many patients will require three or more drugs to reach target goals. If blood pressure is refractory to multiple agents, clinicians should consider an evaluation for secondary forms of hypertension.

During pregnancy in diabetic women with chronic hypertension, target blood pressure goals of systolic blood pressure 110–129 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 65–79 mmHg are reasonable, as they contribute to long-term maternal health. Lower blood pressure levels may be associated with impaired fetal growth. During pregnancy, treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is contraindicated, since they are likely to cause fetal damage. Antihypertensive drugs known to be effective and safe in pregnancy include methyldopa, labetalol, diltiazem, clonidine, and prazosin. Chronic diuretic use during pregnancy has been associated with restricted maternal plasma volume, which might reduce uteroplacental perfusion.

Diltiazem and verapamil — effects on simvastatin and lovastatin exposure and product labeling are as follows: Diltiazem and verapamil are moderate to weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, and in 10 healthy volunteers diltiazem increased the Cmax of simvastatin by 3.6-fold and simvastatin acid by 3.7-fold (P < 0.05), with the AUC of simvastatin increased by 5-fold (P < 0.05) and the elimination t1/2 by 2.3-fold (P < 0.05); diltiazem also increased the AUC of lovastatin by 3.6-fold and Cmax from 6 ± 2 to 26 ± 9 ng/mL but did not change the elimination t1/2. Current labeling advises that the dose of simvastatin not exceed 10 mg daily when co-prescribed with diltiazem or verapamil in adult patients and that the dose of lovastatin not exceed 20 mg daily; the approved labeling for diltiazem recommends the use of non–CYP3A4-metabolized statins in combination with diltiazem if possible; the product labeling for atorvastatin does not include dose adjustments for combination therapy with amlodipine, diltiazem, or verapamil, and labeling for verapamil recommends that when coadministration lower doses of atorvastatin may be considered.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious adverse reactions have been rare in studies carried out to date, but it should be recognized that patients with impaired ventricular function and cardiac conduction abnormalities have usually been excluded from these studies.

The adverse events described below represent events observed in clinical studies of hypertensive patients receiving either diltiazem hydrochloride tablets or Diltiazem Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, as well as experiences observed in studies of angina and during marketing. The most common events in hypertension studies are shown in a table with rates in placebo patients shown for comparison. Less common events are listed by body system; these include any adverse reactions seen in angina studies that were not observed in hypertension studies. In all hypertensive patients studied (over 900), the most common adverse events were edema (9%), headache (8%), dizziness (6%), asthenia (5%), sinus bradycardia (3%), flushing (3%), and first degree AV block (3%). Only edema and perhaps bradycardia and dizziness were dose related. The most common events observed in clinical studies (over 2,100 patients) of angina patients and hypertensive patients receiving diltiazem hydrochloride tablets or Diltiazem Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules were (i.e., greater than 1%) edema (5.4%), headache (4.5%), dizziness (3.4%), asthenia (2.8%), first-degree AV block (1.8%), flushing (1.7%), nausea (1.6%), bradycardia (1.5%), and rash (1.5%).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) — perioperative use — CCBs are subdivided into nondihydropyridine (verapamil, diltiazem) and dihydropyridine agents and are used for hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, and angina. Initiation of CCBs failed to reduce perioperative mortality or perioperative myocardial infarction (MI), although reductions were seen in the composite of MI and death and postoperative supraventricular tachycardia; significant hypotension and bradycardia were observed in individual studies but not overall. A more recent meta-analysis of CCBs (largely dihydropyridines) versus other antihypertensives for postoperative hypertension found no significant differences in postoperative hemodynamics. Although these data do not support perioperative CCB initiation, continuation may be reasonable with recognition of the potential for intraoperative hypotension for dihydropyridines and bradycardia for nondihydropyridines.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release tablets (diltiazem hydrochloride) [^112WNWYZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Diltiazem is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is subject to an extensive first-pass effect, giving an absolute bioavailability (compared to intravenous administration) of about 40%. Diltiazem undergoes extensive metabolism in which only 2% to 4% of the unchanged drug appears in the urine. Drugs that induce or inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes may alter diltiazem disposition.

Total radioactivity measurement following short IV administration in healthy volunteers suggests the presence of other unidentified metabolites, which attain higher concentrations than those of diltiazem and are more slowly eliminated; half-life of total radioactivity is about 20 hours compared to 2 to 5 hours for diltiazem.

In vitrobinding studies show diltiazem is 70% to 80% bound to plasma proteins. Competitive in vitroligand binding studies have also shown diltiazem hydrochloride binding is not altered by therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, hydrochlorothiazide, phenylbutazone, propranolol, salicylic acid, or warfarin. The plasma elimination half-life following single or multiple drug administration is approximately 3.0 to 4.5 hours. Desacetyl diltiazem is also present in the plasma at levels of 10% to 20% of the parent drug and is 25% to 50% as potent as a coronary vasodilator as diltiazem. Minimum therapeutic plasma diltiazem concentrations appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ng/mL. There is a departure from linearity when dose strengths are increased; the half-life is slightly increased with dose.

### Contributory risk and management of comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in chronic heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1126ELQq]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association scientific statement — hypertension therapy in heart failure: Antihypertensive treatment thresholds are recommended in individuals with ≥ 140 mmHg SBP or 90 mm Hg diastolic BP (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics can be used for blood pressure (BP) control and to reverse mild volume overload in symptomatic heart failure (HF) with volume overload, with this use rated (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). The addition of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate to background therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a β-blocker may be beneficial in nonblack patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hypertension (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Drugs to avoid in HF with hypertension include nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) and moxonidine (Class III: Harm; Level of Evidence C), and α-adrenergic blockers such as doxazosin should be avoided and might be used only if other drugs for the management of hypertension and HF are inadequate to achieve BP control at maximum tolerated doses (Class III: Harm; Level of Evidence C).

### Contributory risk and management of comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in chronic heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112o3WiX]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment of refractory hypertension in HFrEF — Most patients with advanced stage C or D HF do not manifest hypertension, and if a patient with HFrEF has refractory hypertension there are no definitive studies to guide additional antihypertensive approaches when recommended HF therapies are inadequate. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are not recommended as routine treatment for patients with HFrEF, whereas amlodipine and felodipine neither improve nor worsen survival and a dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers could be used to control hypertension only after other medications have failed. There are few data on specific combinations of ≥ 3 drugs, so recommendations are largely empirical or anecdotal; a triple-drug regimen of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a calcium channel blocker, and a thiazide diuretic is effective and can be well tolerated. Among β-blockers, carvedilol, 1 of the 3 β-blockers proven to reduce mortality in HF, is more effective in reducing BP than metoprolol succinate or bisoprolol and may be the β-blocker of choice in patients with HFrEF with refractory hypertension, whereas evidence with nebivolol and labetalol is very limited and they are not the β-blocker of choice for the treatment of HFrEF according to HF guidelines; experience with prazosin or clonidine is very limited and studies suggest potential adverse outcomes with these classes of agents.

### Bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (bisoprolol fumarate hydrochlorothiazide) [^113LjUXd]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Drug interactions

Bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive agents used concomitantly. Bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide should not be combined with other beta-blocking agents. Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or guanethidine, should be closely monitored because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of bisoprolol may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity. In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of clonidine.

Bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists [particularly of the phenylalkylamine (verapamil) and benzothiazepine (diltiazem) classes], or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.

Bisoprolol

Concurrent use of rifampin increases the metabolic clearance of bisoprolol, shortening its elimination half-life. However, initial dose modification is generally not necessary. Pharmacokinetic studies document no clinically relevant interactions with other agents given concomitantly, including thiazide diuretics, digoxin and cimetidine. There was no effect of bisoprolol on prothrombin times in patients on stable doses of warfarin.

Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117JMHTP]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Statin–calcium channel blocker combinations — dose limits and agent selection are specified as follows: Combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and this combination therapy is reasonable. Diltiazem administered with either lovastatin or simvastatin is associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although these combination therapies may be considered in appropriate patients. Coadministration of verapamil with lovastatin or simvastatin results in moderate increases in statin exposure. Therefore, these combination therapies may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks. Doses of lovastatin or simvastatin > 20 mg daily when coadministered with amlodipine are not recommended. A non–CYP3A4-metabolized statin is preferred in combination with diltiazem or verapamil. Doses of simvastatin > 10 mg daily and doses of lovastatin > 20 mg daily when used with diltiazem or verapamil are not recommended. However, it should be noted that verapamil labeling recommends a higher dose limit of lovastatin of 40 mg daily when coadministered with verapamil. For adult patients on stable therapy with simvastatin 80 mg daily (a dose that is no longer recommended for general use), clinicians should change to a non–CYP3A4 statin such as pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin if therapy with diltiazem or verapamil is initiated. Caution should be exercised with statin-CCB combination therapy in patients of various ethnic backgrounds, particularly those of Asian descent.

Adult liver transplant (LT) recipients — hypertension management and first-line agents are detailed as follows: In LT recipients with systemic hypertension, it is prudent to target a blood pressure treatment goal of 130/80 mm Hg, and the treatment of hypertension should aim for a target goal of 130/80 mm Hg with a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological agents as appropriate (grade 1, level A). Immunosuppression leading to hypertension should be minimized; lifestyle modifications (including weight loss and dietary salt restriction) and home blood pressure measurement are encouraged, with antihypertensive medications introduced if these measures do not achieve the goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors should be used as first-line antihypertensive therapy in LT recipients with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and/or significant proteinuria (grade 1, level A), with monitoring of potassium when these drugs are used with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as tacrolimus. Calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine and nifedipine may be more effective; non-dihydropyridine agents (verapamil and diltiazem) should be used with caution because they may increase CNI bioavailability, beta-blockers are equally as effective as calcium channel blockers, thiazide or loop diuretics should be used with caution, and combination therapy may be required to control blood pressure.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^113iU47u]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

An important caveat is that most patients with hypertension require multi-drug therapy to reach treatment goals, especially diabetic patients whose targets are lower. Many patients will require three or more drugs to reach target goals. If blood pressure is refractory to optimal doses of at least three antihypertensive agents of different classifications, one of which should be a diuretic, clinicians should consider an evaluation for secondary forms of hypertension.

During pregnancy in diabetic women with chronic hypertension, target blood pressure goals of 110–129 mmHg systolic and 65–79 mmHg diastolic are reasonable, as they contribute to long-term maternal health. Lower blood pressure levels may be associated with impaired fetal growth. During pregnancy, treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is contraindicated, since they can cause fetal damage. Antihypertensive drugs known to be effective and safe in pregnancy include methyldopa, labetalol, diltiazem, clonidine, and prazosin. Chronic diuretic use during pregnancy has been associated with restricted maternal plasma volume, which might reduce uteroplacental perfusion.

### Plasma renin activity testing to guide triple antirenin system drug therapy in a patient with difficult-to-treat hypertension [^116BMo53]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of difficult-to-treat hypertension ultimately managed with triple antirenin (anti-R) therapy using plasma renin activity (PRA) to guide medication selection.

Case Summary

A 66-year-old white man was referred to the cardiology pharmacotherapy clinic for difficult-to-treat hypertension. His initial office blood pressure (BP) was 152/71 mm Hg on diltiazem and chlorthalidone. After a series of medication adjustments based on serial PRA measurements, the patient achieved his target BP with a regimen that included 3 anti-R angiotensin system medications: carvedilol, valsartan, and aliskiren.

Discussion

Despite continued progress in the understanding and advances in pharmacological therapy for hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension remains a major problem. The most common strategy to control hypertension is the stepped-care approach with progressive addition of medications to eventually reach BP goal. An alternative approach includes the use of PRA measurements to guide both the addition and removal of drugs in an attempt to effectively control BP. At times, this has the potential to result in a drug regimen that is incongruous with current guidelines and practice recommendations. However, if this results in more effective BP control with the same, or fewer, number of medications, it may represent a reasonable alternative.

Conclusion

This case report illustrates a real-world application of PRA-guided therapeutics in a patient with difficult-to-treat hypertension. It highlights how a personalized approach can lead to BP control with a more streamlined regimen than would likely result if a stepped-care approach was used.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / AMSSM / HRS / PACES / SCMR guideline for the management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115kFDy5]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — pharmacologic management and escalation: In general, nonvasodilating beta blockers are considered first-line therapy, and the calcium channel blockers — verapamil or diltiazem — are reasonable alternatives to beta-blocker therapy. For patients who do not respond to trials of ≥ 1 of these drugs, advanced therapies with disopyramide, mavacamten, or septal reduction are often the next step. Medications should be titrated to a dose where symptom benefit is observed, but failure of beta-blockade should not be declared until demonstrated physiologic evidence of beta-blockade (ie, suppression of resting heart rate) is reported. The use of calcium channel blockers in combination with beta blockers, as therapy directed at HCM, is unsupported by evidence; however, these may have a role in management of concomitant hypertension. Patients with HCM who do not respond to first-line therapy are candidates for escalation of therapy, including cardiac myosin inhibitors (eg, mavacamten) (in adult patients only), disopyramide, and SRT. Mavacamten is a cardiac myosin inhibitor and has been shown to improve left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients, symptoms, and functional capacity in 30% to 60% of patients with obstructive HCM. In the United States, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is required due to the observed decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% in 5.7% of patients attributable solely to the drug, but as high as 7% to 10% of patients when other extenuating clinical conditions are considered that nevertheless may also result in temporary discontinuation. One key management step is to eliminate medications that may promote outflow tract obstruction, such as pure vasodilators and high-dose diuretics, while low-dose diuretics, when added to other first-line medications, are sometimes useful for persistent dyspnea or congestive symptoms. Because disopyramide can enhance conduction through the atrioventricular node, which could lead to rapid conduction with the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF), it should be used in combination with another medication that has atrioventricular nodal blocking properties.

Minimum therapeutic plasma diltiazem concentrations appear to be in the range of 50 to 200 ng/mL. There is a departure from linearity when dose strengths are increased; the half-life is slightly increased with dose. A study that compared patients with normal hepatic function to patients with cirrhosis found an increase in half-life and a 69% increase in bioavailability in the hepatically impaired patients. A single study in nine patients with severely impaired renal function showed no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of diltiazem compared to patients with normal renal function.

### Calcium antagonists [^117Q8uTG]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium antagonists were introduced for the treatment of hypertension in the 1980s. Their use was subsequently expanded to additional disorders, such as angina pectoris, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, diffuse esophageal spasms, and migraine. Calcium antagonists as a group are heterogeneous and include 3 main classes — phenylalkylamines, benzothiazepines, and dihydropyridines — that differ in their molecular structure, sites and modes of action, and effects on various other cardiovascular functions. Calcium antagonists lower blood pressure mainly through vasodilation and reduction of peripheral resistance. They maintain blood flow to vital organs, and are safe in patients with renal impairment. Unlike diuretics and beta-blockers, calcium antagonists do not impair glucose metabolism or lipid profile and may even attenuate the development of arteriosclerotic lesions. In long-term follow-up, patients treated with calcium antagonists had development of less overt diabetes mellitus than those who were treated with diuretics and beta-blockers. Moreover, calcium antagonists are able to reduce left ventricular mass and are effective in improving anginal pain. Recent prospective randomized studies attested to the beneficial effects of calcium antagonists in hypertensive patients. In comparison with placebo, calcium antagonist-based therapy reduced major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death significantly in elderly hypertensive patients and in diabetic patients. In several comparative studies in hypertensive patients, treatment with calcium antagonists was equally effective as treatment with diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. From these studies, it seems that a calcium antagonist-based regimen is superior to other regimens in preventing stroke, equivalent in preventing ischemic heart disease, and inferior in preventing congestive heart failure. Calcium antagonists are also safe and effective as first-line or add-on therapy in diabetic hypertensive patients. Heart rate-lowering calcium antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) may have an edge over the dihydropyridines in post-myocardial infarction patients and in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, calcium antagonists may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina pectoris.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^114RUYTq]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Vasoreactivity: Calcium Channel Blockers

Approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH are vasoreactive. This is defined by a reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 10 mm Hg to an absolute value of < 40 mm Hg with unchanged or improved cardiac output when exposed to a rapidly active pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled NO or IV epoprostenol) during right heart catheterization. These cases of vasoreactive PAH respond well to high doses of oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine, nifedipine, or diltiazem. All CCBs are metabolized by CYP3A4, which introduces opportunity for significant drug interactions if coadministered with other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and nifedipine also are CYP3A4 inhibitors, with verapamil and diltiazem exhibiting more potent inhibition activity. Potent CYP3A4 inhibition by diltiazem and verapamil may increase the plasma concentrations of medications that rely on this enzyme for metabolism. Verapamil has a higher drug interaction risk profile than all the CCBs as a substrate and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. The nondihydropyridine CCBs, verapamil and diltiazem, can cause excessive bradycardia. Care should be used when these nondihydropyridine CCBs are coadministered with other medications known to cause bradycardia, including noncardiac medications such as lacosamide for seizures, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators for multiple sclerosis or ulcerative colitis, and ceritinib for non-small cell lung cancer.

Stage C heart failure (HF) with cardiac structural abnormalities or remodeling — hypertension management recommendations and evidence ratings: Patients with previous or current symptoms of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) should be treated with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) including diuretics, ACE inhibitors (or ARBs if ACE inhibitor intolerant), β-blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists; Class of Recommendation (COR) I; Level of Evidence (LOE) A for clinical outcomes, B for BP control. Addition of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate to ACE inhibitor or ARB and β-blocker in self-described black patients with HFrEF and persistent NYHA class III or IV HF symptoms is beneficial to reduce morbidity and mortality and can lower BP; COR I; LOE A for reduction in morbidity and mortality in HF, B for BP control. The treatment of hypertension in patients with HF should include behavioral modification such as sodium restriction and a closely monitored exercise program; weight reduction in overweight or obese, an appropriate diet, and moderation of alcohol intake are recommended; COR I, LOE C. Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics can be useful for BP control and to reverse mild volume overload in symptomatic patients with HF, whereas loop diuretics are less effective than thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics in lowering BP; COR IIa, LOE C. Addition of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate to ACE inhibitor or ARB and β-blocker may be beneficial for BP control in nonblack patients with HFrEF and hypertension; COR IIa, LOE C. Drugs to avoid in patients with HF and hypertension include nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) and moxonidine, and an attempt should be made to avoid α-adrenergic blockers such as doxazosin unless other drugs are inadequate; COR III: Harm, LOE C.

### The central mechanism underlying hypertension: a review of the roles of sodium ions, epithelial sodium channels, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress and endogenous digitalis in the brain [^116wguFz]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

CCBs are widely used because they are potent antihypertensive agents with minimal adverse effects. Again, this kind of agent does not induce reflex tachycardia regardless of its hypotensive effect, except when it acts rapidly. Some agents act directly on cardiac muscle to suppress pacemaker activity. Even with dihydropyridine CCBs, which have less of an effect on the pacemaker, reflex tachycardia is usually absent and the heart rate may decrease. Of course, reflex tachycardia occurs when a potent CCB like nifedipine is administered and rapidly lowers blood pressure. However, when blood pressure is lowered gradually with slow-release nifedipine or amlodipine, reflex tachycardia is absent; instead, there is bradycardia. Thereby, peripheral sympathetic tone is decreased. Therefore, when CCBs are administered, there are effects that are very similar to those induced by α 1 -blockers. Diltiazem given intravenously causes hypotension and bradycardia without peripheral sympathetic excitation. ICV injections of diltiazem elicit vasodepression with decreases in abdominal sympatholytic activity, which is attenuated by electric ablation of the hypothalamic anteroventral third ventricle area. Similar findings have been reported with nifedipine in rats on a high-salt diet.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. 4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5. Direct renin inhibitors were not considered by the JNC8 because there were no studies showing their benefits on kidney or cardiovascular outcomes. The ESC notes that aliskiren combined with an ACEI or ARB led to adverse events in patients with diabetes. 5 Although newer direct renin inhibitors are being developed, they are not yet widely used. DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. 5, 6 A meta-analysis showed that ACEIs — but not ARBs — reduce the incidence of doubling of the serum creatinine level in patients with diabetes, but they do not affect progression to end-stage renal disease.

46 Another meta-analysis showed that ACEIs are superior to ARBs in reducing all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 47 The ACCOMPLISH trial showed that patients with diabetes who are treated with a combined ACEI/CCB have a lower risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events compared with those treated with a combined ACEI/thiazide diuretic. 48.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release) [^114joFPw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines

Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and the Cmaxby 2-fold, compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sedation) of both midazolam and triazolam.

Beta-blockers

Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem hydrochloride and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated, but available data are not sufficient to predict the effects of concomitant treatment in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities.

Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%. In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted (see WARNINGS).

Buspirone

In nine healthy subjects, diltiazem significantly increased the mean buspirone AUC 5.5-fold and Cmax4.1-fold compared to placebo. The T1/2and Tmaxof buspirone were not significantly affected by diltiazem. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible during concomitant administration with diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments may be necessary during coadministration and should be based on clinical assessment.

Carbamazepine

Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11315gMd]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults — population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study designs are defined for the key question. The question asks: For adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, what are the comparative effectiveness and safety of (1) mono- or combination pharmacotherapies using calcium channel blockers, prostanoids, endothelin antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, or selexipag; (2) cardiopulmonary rehabilitation; (3) palliative care; (4) supportive care; and (5) preventive care on intermediate- and long-term patient outcomes? The population is Adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: Group 1 within the pulmonary hypertension World Health Organization clinical classification with Children excluded. Interventions include Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine), Prostacyclin derivatives or related (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost), Endothelin antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan), Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil), Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), Selexipag, Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, Palliative care, Supportive care (supplemental oxygen, diuretics, digoxin, anticoagulants, physical therapy/rehabilitation), and Preventive care (influenza and pneumonia immunizations, contraception, high-risk pregnancy management, avoiding nonessential surgery and perioperative risk management). Comparators include One pharmacotherapy vs another pharmacotherapy as monotherapy; Monotherapy vs combination therapy, including either as add-on therapy or as an initial treatment regimen using combination therapy; One combination therapy to another combination therapy; Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation vs pharmacotherapy; Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation plus pharmacotherapy vs pharmacotherapy alone; and Palliative care vs no palliative care. Outcomes include Intermediate-term outcomes (hemodynamic parameters, dyspnea, 6-min walk distance considering MID) and Long-term outcomes (functional class, QoL, right-sided heart failure or right ventricular dysfunction, mortality, PAH-related hospitalization, need for interventional procedures). Eligible study designs are Systematic reviews (with or without, meta-analyses), RCTs, prospective and retrospective cohort studies.
