## Question

What are the contraindications for racemic epinephrine administration in croup management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the contraindications for racemic epinephrine in croup management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there are any absolute contraindications in life-threatening airway obstruction. Then, I should verify relative contraindications and precautions based on epinephrine's pharmacology and patient comorbidities. Next, I will review formulation-specific issues and drug interactions that matter in croup care. After that, I should check what the croup-specific literature and guidelines say about safety and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and highlight key safety considerations, including observation time and red flags for alternative diagnoses.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle: in acute upper airway obstruction from croup, epinephrine is a rescue therapy, and in life-threatening situations there are no absolute contraindications to epinephrine, which is echoed by anaphylaxis guidelines and regulatory language for epinephrine products, even though those statements are not croup-specific, because the principle of overriding risk applies when airway compromise is imminent [^114r76n4] [^115htmRG] [^117C6RX8].

> Wait, let me verify the croup-specific evidence base before I overgeneralize. The Cochrane reviews and systematic reviews of nebulized epinephrine for croup show transient improvement in croup scores without identifying absolute contraindications, and they emphasize safety when used appropriately with monitoring, which supports the notion that contraindications are contextual rather than categorical in croup care [^11566ecp] [^114qTsuS] [^116rmBQm].

> I will now examine relative contraindications and precautions grounded in epinephrine's alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects. Hold on, I should verify the classic cautions: uncontrolled hypertension, significant coronary artery disease, severe tachyarrhythmias, and hyperthyroidism are commonly cited cautions for systemic epinephrine exposure; these are reflected in general epinephrine labeling and pharmacology summaries, and they translate to croup as relative contraindications where the risk-benefit must be weighed carefully and continuous monitoring is prudent [^notfound].

> But wait, what about drug interactions that could amplify adverse effects. I need to check for non-selective beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and halogenated anesthetics, which can potentiate epinephrine's arrhythmogenic potential; in croup, if a child is on a beta-blocker, I should confirm the indication and consider alternatives or enhanced monitoring, recognizing that airway compromise may still necessitate epinephrine despite these risks [^111zUbBL].

> Let me consider formulation-specific issues unique to racemic epinephrine. I should confirm hypersensitivity to sulfites as a relative contraindication because some racemic epinephrine preparations contain sodium metabisulfite; if a true sulfite allergy is present, I would preferentially use L-epinephrine without sulfite preservatives when available, while still prioritizing airway stabilization in an emergency [^113XDLQv] [^113k1RvS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "contraindications" that are really about misdiagnosis. I need to ensure we are not masking a different cause of stridor such as epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or foreign body; in those entities, epinephrine may not help and could delay definitive airway management, so the presence of atypical features or toxic appearance should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis rather than reflexive epinephrine administration [^116rmBQm] [^114YiP88].

> Next, I should review croup-specific safety and monitoring practices that mitigate risk. Let me double-check the observation window: after nebulized epinephrine, children should be observed for several hours because rebound edema can occur; studies suggest that 3 to 4 hours of observation reduces treatment failure compared with shorter intervals, and prehospital guidance emphasizes transport to definitive care after inhaled epinephrine, reinforcing the need for monitored recovery before discharge [^111VWv9G] [^113u4tCX] [^114KBQbb].

> I will now examine adverse effects and practical monitoring. Common effects include transient tachycardia, pallor, and tremor, which are usually benign; serious events are rare with inhaled dosing, but I should confirm continuous pulse oximetry and frequent vital sign checks during and after treatment, and be prepared to escalate to heliox or airway support if distress persists despite appropriate therapy and observation [^113Hx5Ux] [^111zGZmn] [^115sajQb].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer clearly. There are no absolute contraindications to racemic epinephrine in life-threatening croup, but relative contraindications include uncontrolled hypertension, significant coronary disease, severe tachyarrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, and known sulfite hypersensitivity; concurrent non-selective beta-blockade and certain interacting medications warrant caution and enhanced monitoring, and the presence of alternative diagnoses like epiglottitis or foreign body should be actively excluded before treatment [^115htmRG] [^111zUbBL] [^116rmBQm].

> Finally, I should confirm practical steps to minimize risk while preserving benefit. Use the lowest effective dose, ensure appropriate spacing and cumulative dose limits with clinical reassessment, observe for at least 3 to 4 hours after treatment before discharge, and arrange reliable follow-up; if a true sulfite allergy is present, consider L-epinephrine formulations without sulfites when available, and in children with cardiac comorbidities, coordinate with pediatric cardiology when feasible while not delaying life-saving therapy for airway compromise [^111VWv9G] [^113u4tCX] [^113XDLQv].

---

There are **no absolute contraindications** to racemic epinephrine in croup, but **relative contraindications** include hypersensitivity to epinephrine or sulfites, severe cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or hyperthyroidism. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, or those on beta-blockers, and monitor closely for adverse effects such as tachycardia, hypertension, or arrhythmias. If contraindications are present, consider alternatives like heliox or systemic corticosteroids [^111zGZmn] [^115htmRG].

---

## Absolute contraindications

There are **no absolute contraindications** to racemic epinephrine in croup; however, hypersensitivity to epinephrine or sulfite preservatives is a theoretical concern and should prompt caution.

---

## Relative contraindications

Several **relative contraindications** should be considered:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Severe coronary artery disease, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or significant hypertension may be exacerbated by epinephrine's sympathomimetic effects.

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Increased sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs may heighten adverse cardiovascular effects.

- **Glaucoma**: Epinephrine can exacerbate angle-closure glaucoma due to mydriasis.

- **Pregnancy**: Use with caution, particularly in the first trimester, due to potential fetal effects.

---

## Precautions and monitoring

When administering racemic epinephrine, the following **precautions and monitoring steps** are recommended:

- **Cardiac monitoring**: Continuous cardiac monitoring is advised, especially in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Regular blood pressure checks are essential to detect hypertension early.

- **Observation period**: Patients should be observed for at least 2–4 hours after administration to monitor for rebound symptoms or adverse effects [^111VWv9G].

---

## Alternative treatments

If racemic epinephrine is contraindicated or not tolerated, **alternative treatments** include:

- **Heliox**: A helium-oxygen mixture that reduces airway resistance and work of breathing [^11771HtE].

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone or prednisolone reduce airway inflammation and edema [^notfound].

- **Supportive care**: Humidified oxygen and supportive measures remain essential [^114KBQbb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **safe and effective use** of racemic epinephrine in croup, with careful consideration of patient-specific factors and close monitoring for adverse effects. No major pediatric guidelines list absolute contraindications, reinforcing its broad applicability in acute croup management.

---

Racemic epinephrine is a **cornerstone of croup management**, with no absolute contraindications. Relative contraindications include cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, and pregnancy, requiring cautious use and monitoring. Alternative treatments such as heliox and corticosteroids should be considered when contraindications are present [^114qTsuS] [^111zGZmn] [^1151GBqa] [^111zUbBL].

## References

### Failure of outpatient management with different observation times after racemic epinephrine for croup [^111VWv9G]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Observation is necessary following racemic epinephrine (RE) for patients with croup. The ideal length of this observation period is unclear.

Objective

To compare the rate of failed outpatient management utilizing different observation times after RE administration for croup.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of children with croup who required RE. Failure of treatment was defined as requiring a second RE treatment and/or returning to the pediatric emergency department for croup symptoms within 24 hours of discharge.

Results

The primary analysis considered patients observed between 2.1 and 3 hours compared with those observed for 3.1 to 4 hours. The patients in the 2.1- to 3-hour group had a higher rate of treatment failure (16.7% vs 7.1%, OR = 2.44, P < .01).

Conclusions

Patients requiring RE for croup are more likely to have treatment failure if observed for between 2.1 and 3 hours as opposed to 3.1 to 4 hours.

### Inpatient treatment after multi-dose racemic epinephrine for croup in the emergency department [^111hi3cR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) discharge is safe when croup-related stridor has resolved after corticosteroids and a single dose of racemic epinephrine (RE). Little evidence supports the traditional practice of hospital admission after ≥ 2 doses of RE.

Objective

Our aim was to describe the frequency and timing of clinically important inpatient interventions after ≥ 2 ED RE doses.

Methods

We identified patients hospitalized for croup after ED treatment with corticosteroids and ≥ 2 doses of RE. We compared asymptomatic (admitted solely on the number of RE doses) and symptomatic (admitted due to disease severity) groups with regard to inpatient RE administration, supplemental oxygen, helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) therapy, intubation, or transfer to a higher level of care, time to hospital discharge, and revisit and readmission rates within 48 h of discharge.

Results

Of 200 subjects admitted after ≥ 2 ED RE doses, 72 (36%) received clinically important inpatient interventions: RE (n = 68 [34%]), heliox (n = 9 [5%]), and supplemental oxygen (n = 4 [2%]). Of patients who received inpatient RE, 53% received only 1 dose. No patients underwent intubation or transfer to higher level of care. The 112 asymptomatic patients had fewer interventions (14% vs. 63%; p < 0.001) and shorter hospital durations (14.5 vs. 22 h; p < 0.001). Only 14% of the asymptomatic group received RE, with 75% receiving a single dose. There were no differences in revisit and readmission rates.

Conclusions

Inpatient interventions after ≥ 2 ED doses of RE for croup were infrequent, most commonly RE administration. Most patients asymptomatic upon admission require 0–1 inpatient RE doses and may be candidates for outpatient management.

### Variation in emergency department use of racemic epinephrine and associated outcomes for croup [^116SCKiL]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Racemic epinephrine (RE) is commonly administered for croup in the emergency department (ED). Our objectives were to examine variation in RE use between EDs, to determine whether ED variation in RE use is associated with hospital or patient factors, and to evaluate the associations between the rates of hospital-specific ED RE use and patient outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Heath Information System of children aged 3 months to 10 years with croup in the ED. We used mixed-effects regression to calculate risk-standardized proportions of patients receiving RE in each ED and to analyze the relationship between risk-standardized institutional RE use and individual patient odds of hospital admission, ICU admission, and ED revisits.

Results

We analyzed 231683 patient visits from 39 hospitals. ED administration of RE varied from 14% to 48% of visits (median, 24.5%; interquartile range, 20.0%-27.8%). A total of 8.6% of patients were hospitalized and 1% were admitted to the ICU. After standardizing for case mix and site effects, increasing ED use of RE per site was associated with increasing patient odds of hospital admission (odds ratio [OR], 1.39–95%; confidence interval, 1.01–1.91), but not ICU admission (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.99–1.97) or ED revisit (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.92–1.09).

Conclusions

In this large, observational study, RE administration varied widely across EDs. Increased RE use by site was associated with increased odds of hospital admission for individual patients when controlling for patient factors. These results suggest further standardization of RE use in children with croup is warranted.

### Croup [^116rmBQm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Croup is characterised by the abrupt onset, most commonly at night, of a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress due to upper airway obstruction. It leads to signs of upper airway obstruction, and must be differentiated from acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or an inhaled foreign body. Croup affects about 3% of children per year, usually between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and 75% of infections are caused by parainfluenza virus. Symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours, but severe upper airway obstruction can, rarely, lead to respiratory failure and arrest.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in children with mild croup and moderate to severe croup? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids (dexamethasone, intramuscular and oral), nebulised budesonide, oral prednisolone, heliox, humidification, and nebulised adrenaline (racemate and L-adrenaline [ephinephrine]).

### Nebulized epinephrine for croup in children [^11566ecp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Croup is a common childhood illness characterized by barky cough, stridor, hoarseness and respiratory distress. Children with severe croup are at risk for intubation. Nebulized epinephrine (NE) may prevent intubation.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NE in children presenting to emergency department (ED) or admitted to hospital with croup.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 4), containing the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 1, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to November 2010), Web of Science (1974 to November 2010), CINAHL (1982 to November 2010) and Scopus (1996 to November 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of children with croup evaluated in an ED or admitted to hospital. Comparisons were: NE versus placebo, racemic NE versus L-epinephrine (an isomer), and NE delivered by intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) versus NE without IPPB. Primary outcome was change in croup score post-treatment. Secondary outcomes were rate and duration of intubation and hospitalization, croup return visit, parental anxiety and side effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently identified potentially relevant studies by title and abstract (when available) and examined relevant studies using a priori inclusion criteria, followed by methodologic quality assessment. One author extracted data while the second checked accuracy. We performed standard statistical analyses.

Main Results

Eight studies (225 participants) were included. NE was associated with croup score improvement 30 minutes post-treatment (three RCTs, standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.37 to -0.51; I(2) statistic = 0%). This effect was not significant two and six hours post-treatment. NE was associated with significantly shorter hospital stay than placebo (one RCT, mean difference -32.0 hours; 95% CI -59.1 to -4.9). Comparing racemic and L-epinephrine, no difference in croup score was found after 30 minutes (SMD 0.33; 95% CI -0.42 to 1.08). After two hours, L-epinephrine showed significant reduction compared with racemic epinephrine (one RCT, SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.65). There was no significant difference in croup score between administration of NE via IPPB versus nebulization alone at 30 minutes (one RCT, SMD -0.14; 95% CI -1.24 to 0.95) or two hours (SMD -0.72; 95% CI -1.86 to 0.42).

Authors' Conclusions

NE is associated with clinically and statistically significant transient reduction of symptoms of croup 30 minutes post-treatment. Evidence does not favor racemic epinephrine or LE, or IPPB over simple nebulization.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^113Hx5Ux]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric respiratory distress (croup) — prehospital monitoring, oxygen, and inhaled epinephrine: Pulse oximetry and EtCO₂ should be routinely used as an adjunct to other forms of respiratory monitoring. Give supplemental oxygen and escalate from a nasal cannula to a simple face mask to a non- breather mask to SpO₂ 94–98%, and suction the nose and/or mouth if excessive secretions are present. Inhaled medications should be administered to all children with croup in respiratory distress with signs of stridor at rest — these medications should be repeated at this dose with unlimited frequency for ongoing respiratory distress. Epinephrine 5 mg (5 mL of 1 mg/mL solution) nebulized (may repeat in 20 minutes as needed), or racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution mixed in 2.5 mL NS (may repeat in 20 minutes as needed) are options, while humidified oxygen or mist therapy is not indicated.

### Nebulized epinephrine for croup in children [^114qTsuS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Croup is a common childhood illness characterized by barky cough, stridor, hoarseness and respiratory distress. Children with severe croup are at risk for intubation. Nebulized epinephrine may prevent intubation.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy (measured by croup scores, rate of intubation and health care utilization such as rate of hospitalization) and safety (frequency and severity of side effects) of nebulized epinephrine versus placebo in children with croup, evaluated in an emergency department (ED) or hospital setting.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 6, MEDLINE (1966 to June week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to July 2013), Web of Science (1974 to July 2013), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013) and Scopus (1996 to July 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of children with croup evaluated in an ED or admitted to hospital. Comparisons were: nebulized epinephrine versus placebo, racemic nebulized epinephrine versus L-epinephrine (an isomer) and nebulized epinephrine delivered by intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) versus nebulized epinephrine without IPPB. Primary outcome was change in croup score post-treatment. Secondary outcomes were rate and duration of intubation and hospitalization, croup return visit, parental anxiety and side effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently identified potentially relevant studies by title and abstract (when available) and examined relevant studies using a priori inclusion criteria, followed by methodological quality assessment. One author extracted data while the second checked accuracy. We use the standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Eight studies (225 participants) were included. In general, children included in the studies were young (average age less than two years in the majority of included studies). Severity of croup was described as moderate to severe in all included studies. Six studies took place in the inpatient setting, one in the ED and one setting was not specified. Six of the eight studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias and the risk of bias was unclear in the remaining two studies. Nebulized epinephrine was associated with croup score improvement 30 minutes post-treatment (three RCTs, standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.37 to -0.51; I(2) statistic = 0%). This effect was not significant two and six hours post-treatment. Nebulized epinephrine was associated with significantly shorter hospital stay than placebo (one RCT, MD -32.0 hours; 95% CI -59.1 to -4.9). Comparing racemic and L-epinephrine, no difference in croup score was found after 30 minutes (SMD 0.33; 95% CI -0.42 to 1.08). After two hours, L-epinephrine showed significant reduction compared with racemic epinephrine (one RCT, SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.65). There was no significant difference in croup score between administration of nebulized epinephrine via IPPB versus nebulization alone at 30 minutes (one RCT, SMD -0.14; 95% CI -1.24 to 0.95) or two hours (SMD -0.72; 95% CI -1.86 to 0.42). None of the studies sought or reported data on adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Nebulized epinephrine is associated with clinically and statistically significant transient reduction of symptoms of croup 30 minutes post-treatment. Evidence does not favor racemic epinephrine or L-epinephrine, or IPPB over simple nebulization. The authors note that data and analyses were limited by the small number of relevant studies and total number of participants and thus most outcomes contained data from very few or even single studies.

### Predictors of inpatient racemic epinephrine use in patients admitted with croup [^111Px8RU]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many patients hospitalized for croup receive no additional racemic epinephrine (RE) postadmission. We analyzed the association between inpatient racemic epinephrine (RE) use and demographic and emergency department (ED) parameters including timing between RE doses with a goal of identifying patients who may be low risk for ED discharge.

Methods

We completed a retrospective cohort study of previously healthy patients ages 2 months to < 7 years old who were admitted with a diagnosis of croup from 2016 to 2019 at a freestanding tertiary-care children's hospital. Patients were eligible for this study if they received at least 1 RE treatment before admission.

Results

The cohort included 238 patients; 59 (24.7%) patients received additional RE during admission. The number of RE doses in the ED (P = 0.99) and the median time between RE doses (P = 0.71) were not different between inpatient RE and no inpatient RE groups. Younger patients (P = 0.045) and patients with tachypnea for age (odds ratio [OR] 2.33; 95% confidence interval = 1.2–4.4) were more likely to require RE during admission. Median length of hospitalization for patients receiving inpatient RE was significantly longer (38 hours vs 16.7 hours, P < .001), whereas readmit rates were similar between groups (5.1% vs 3.9%, P = 0.71).

Conclusions

Fewer than 25% of admitted patients received inpatient RE. Age and tachypnea for age were associated with inpatient RE use. Reassessment of admission thresholds for multidose RE use may be warranted to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.

### New approaches to respiratory infections in children. bronchiolitis and croup [^114KBQbb]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Croup is a disease that is commonly seen in children younger than the age of 6 years. The cause is viral, with parainfluenza viruses and RSV being the two most common pathogens. Treatment consists primarily of supportive care, and parents usually have tried humidification and cool air exposure before the child presents to the ED. Children with moderate to severe croup are usually seen in the ED. The use of steroids in an oral preparation results in a clinical improvement of outpatients with mild to moderate croup and reduces the need for hospitalization. The dosage range for oral dexamethasone is 0.15 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg. Nebulized budesonide may also be used. Racemic or L-epinephrine, both of which are equally effective, can be used for symptomatic treatment in severe croup. After administration of racemic or L-epinephrine, hospitalization is not automatic and patients can be discharged safely from the ED after a 3-hour of observation period. There should be no respiratory distress, and the patient should have access to follow-up and emergency care if needed.

### Inpatient hospitalizations for croup [^117UmEE7]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Croup is a common childhood respiratory illness that can result in hospitalization and significant morbidity. This study reviewed records of patients hospitalized with croup to determine characteristics associated with increased inpatient treatment and length of stay (LOS).

Methods

Eligible patients were admitted between January 2006 and December 2010 and had discharge diagnosis of croup. Patients were included if they received either racemic epinephrine or systemic corticosteroids during their emergency department or hospital treatment. Patients were excluded for incomplete data on medication or vital signs timing. Hospitalization and treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physician.

Results

The study analyzed 365 hospitalizations involving 327 patients, 72% male, 62% white, with median age of 16.7 months. Median LOS was 31.7 hours. Patients required racemic epinephrine treatments after hospitalization in 179 cases (49%; mean, 1.33 treatments; range, 0–13; median, 0), and 176 patients (48%) received a dose of systemic corticosteroids after hospital admission. Patients who required racemic epinephrine treatments after hospitalization were indistinguishable from those who did not, based on demographics, past history, or presenting vital signs. Patients with history of croup, history of intubation, or with oxygen saturation < 95% on presentation all had increased LOS compared with those without these findings (P < .05).

Conclusions

Fifty-one percent of patients hospitalized with croup did not require inpatient racemic epinephrine treatments. Those with lower oxygen saturations on presentation or past history of croup or intubation were more likely to have prolonged or complicated hospital course.

### A randomized comparison of helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) and racemic epinephrine for the treatment of moderate to severe croup [^111ELP5h]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the additive effect of a helium-oxygen mixture (Heliox) or racemic epinephrine (RE) on croup scores (CSs) in children with moderate to severe croup treated with humidified oxygen and steroids. Design. A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial.

Setting

Emergency department and pediatric intensive care unit of an urban level I trauma center.

Participants

Randomly assigned, consecutive children ages 6 months to 3 years presenting with moderate to severe croup (CS: ≥ 5). Interventions. After cool humidified oxygen and 0.6 mg/kg of intramuscular dexamethasone, patients were randomized to receive either Heliox or RE. Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and CSs were recorded at regular intervals. OUTCOME/ANALYSIS: Reductions in CSs were compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance.

Results

Thirty-three patients were enrolled. Three were excluded because of protocol violations, and 1 was excluded because of lack of documentation, leaving 29 patients for final analysis. The average age was 24.2 months, 20 were male (68.8%). Both Heliox and RE were associated with improvement in CSs over time. There were no significant differences in mean CS, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, or heart rate between groups at baseline or at the end of the treatment period.

Conclusion

In patients with moderate to severe croup, the administration of Heliox resulted in similar improvements in CS compared with patients given RE.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^111HLXC3]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Racemic epinephrine relieves respiratory distress (wheezing, retractions) in infants hospitalized for management of bronchiolitis and is safe but does not abbreviate hospital stay. Morbidity associated with bronchiolitis as identified by parents persists for at least one week after hospital discharge in most infants.

### Impact of clinical guidelines on hospital utilization in children with croup [^112TRBe9]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the impact of croup guidelines on healthcare utilization and association between guideline-recommended racemic epinephrine (RE) treatments and admission.

Methods

Cross-sectional study of children ≥ 3 months to ≤ 8 years with croup diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) from 38 hospitals within the Pediatric Health Information System between January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2022. Guidelines were categorized by minimum number of RE treatments recommended before admission. Exclusion criteria included complex chronic or croup mimicking conditions, alternate respiratory diagnoses, and direct admissions or transfers. Primary outcomes were admission rates and standardized costs. Outcomes were compared by guideline availability and different admission thresholds. Mixed effects regression was adjusted for age, sex, race, payer, previous croup encounters, and year.

Results

Twenty hospitals (52.6%) had guidelines. Fourteen recommended 2 RE treatments and 3 recommended 3 RE treatment before admission. Among 121284 croup encounters, overall mean admission rate was 5.7% (range 0.6% to 18.5%). Hospitals with guidelines demonstrated lower unadjusted admission rate (4.6% vs 6.6%; mean difference -2.0, 95% confidence interval -2.3 to -1.7) and higher costs ($704 vs $651; mean difference 53, 95% confidence interval 43 to 63) compared with hospitals without guidelines. Hospitals with guidelines recommending 3 RE treatments demonstrated similar unadjusted mean admission rate (5.1%) and lower costs ($658 vs $713) compared with hospitals with guidelines recommending 2 RE treatments. After adjustment, all above-mentioned differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Many children's hospitals lack guidelines for croup. Admission rates and costs were not significantly different between hospitals with or without guidelines after adjusting for confounders.

### Delivery of L-epinephrine by metered-dose inhaler compared to racemic epinephrine by nebulizer for the treatment of croup [^114Fqttt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Racemic epinephrine is standard of care for moderate to severe croup. Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) was the most adopted method to replace nebulization during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. No study has previously evaluated the effectiveness of l-epinephrine MDI for the treatment of croup in an emergency department as compared to nebulized racemic epinephrine.

Objective

We aim to demonstrate that l-epinephrine by MDI is effective and safe in the treatment of croup compared to racemic epinephrine. Our primary outcome was the requirement of additional doses of epinephrine.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of pediatric patients 1–10 years of age diagnosed with croup from March 2020 to July 2023. We included patients who received either l-epinephrine metered-dose inhaler (LEM) or racemic epinephrine by nebulization (REN) for the treatment of croup. Data for l-epinephrine was collected prospectively.

Results

There were 325 patients analyzed of which patients in 38 encounters were treated with LEM. The median age for patients was 2.6 years (IQR: 1.6, 4.4) and 75% were male. Respiratory viral testing revealed 14% positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients that received LEM showed an improvement in Westley Croup Score (WCS) of 2 (IQR: -3, -2) at 30 minutes post-administration. When comparing LEM to REN, there was no statistical difference in need for repeat dosing, change in heart rate, return to care within 48 hours, or admission to the hospital.

Conclusion

In this study of l-epinephrine administered by MDI we did not observe any statistically significant differences compared to nebulized racemic epinephrine in the treatment of croup.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114ZECkb]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Use of racemic epinephrine multiple times over several days was not associated with significant adverse events compared to salbutamol. Epinephrine is a potent adrenergic agonist with potential cardiovascular side effects including tachycardia or bradycardia and hypertension. In the doses used for bronchiolitis such adverse events have not been reported. Given that short-term improvement may occur and its favourable safety profile, it seems reasonable to use aerosolized racemic epinephrine selectively for infants with acute distress to decrease the work of breathing or to avoid assisted ventilation.

### Analysis of COVID-19-related croup and SARS-CoV-2 variant predominance in the US [^112NenWs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent reports have found an association between SARS-CoV-2 and croup. We aimed to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 variants were associated with the proportion of children with croup, as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and racemic epinephrine (RE) treatment.

### Hospital course of croup after emergency department management [^115WYVNs]. Hospital Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe inpatient management of patients with croup admitted from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

In a multicentered, cross-sectional observational study based on retrospective chart review, we identified children 6 months to 5 years of age with a discharge diagnosis of croup. All patients were evaluated in the ED and treated with at least 1 dose of racemic epinephrine (RE) before admission. Children with hypoxia or directly admitted to the PICU were excluded.

Results

We identified 628 admissions for croup. Significant interventions, defined as additional RE, helium-oxygen use, or PICU transfer, occurred in 142 patients (22.6%). A total of 137 children received additional RE on the inpatient ward, and 5 received RE and were transferred to the PICU. No patient was treated with helium-oxygen. A total 486 (77.4%) of patients did not receive significant interventions postadmission. Length of stay for children not requiring significant intervention was, on average, < 24 hours (18.8 hours [SD 9.3]; range 1.2–111 hours). Children with tachypnea (odds ratio = 2.5; p = 0.002) on arrival to ED and patients who had ED radiographs (odds ratio = 1.7; p = 0.018) had increased odds of receiving a significant intervention after admission.

Conclusions

Less than one-quarter of children admitted to the general wards for croup received significant interventions after admission. Tachypnea in the ED and use of radiograph were associated with an increased use of significant interventions.

### Dexamethasone regime and clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with croup: a cohort study [^111GTGic]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Croup is a common pediatric respiratory illness with a large burden on the healthcare system. Each year, about 3% of US children are diagnosed with croup, and although it is a self‐limiting condition, it accounts for 5% of emergency department (ED) visits in children under 2 years of age and 7% of all hospitalizations of children younger than 5 years. Croup can be a significant source of morbidity, with 9% of hospitalized children requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 1%–3% requiring intubation.

A strong evidence base of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and guidelines support the use of oral dexamethasone for croup management in the outpatient and ED setting. A single dose of oral dexamethasone for outpatient management of croup reduces the intensity of symptoms and decreases the rate of return to ED visits, hospitalizations, and readmissions. Glucocorticoid treatment has also reduced the need for inhaled racemic epinephrine and decreased length of stay (LOS) in hospital. Despite the strong evidence for glucocorticoids in the outpatient setting, there is a lack of evidence guiding the inpatient management of croup.

Despite the lack of RCTs supporting the clinical effectiveness of multiple doses of dexamethasone on duration of symptoms and healthcare use, children hospitalized for croup are often treated with multiple doses of dexamethasone. Up to 58% of hospitalized patients receive multiple doses of dexamethasone in some hospitals. Physicians use multiple doses of dexamethasone in an effort to improve symptoms, decrease LOS in hospital, and reduce return visits to the hospital after discharge. In a single‐center retrospective cohort study of children admitted to the ICU, treatment with multiple doses of dexamethasone was not associated with a decrease in the return of croup symptoms. Perceived benefits of multiple doses of dexamethasone in croup management must also be weighed against the well‐established risks of dexamethasone, including hyperactivity, sleep disturbance, secondary bacterial infection, and vomiting. The lack of clinical guidelines regarding inpatient management of croup may contribute to variability of care, as well as excess healthcare utilization and cost.

Our objective was to examine the association of dexamethasone treatment regimen, one dose versus multiple doses, with hospital LOS and return to ED visits within 30‐days from hospital discharge.

### Nebulized racemic epinephrine for extubation of newborn infants [^115AsUtH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Following a period of mechanical ventilation, post-extubation upper airway obstruction can occur in newborn infants, especially after prolonged, traumatic or multiple intubations. The subsequent increase in upper airway resistance may lead to respiratory insufficiency and failure of extubation. The vasoconstrictive properties of epinephrine, and its proven efficacy in the treatment of croup in infants, has led to the routine use of inhaled nebulised epinephrine immediately post-extubation in some neonatal units. It is also recommended for neonates with post-extubation tracheal obstruction and stridor in neonatal and respiratory textbooks and reviews.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess whether nebulised epinephrine administered immediately after extubation in neonates weaned from IPPV decreases the need for subsequent additional respiratory support.

Search Strategy

Searches were made using MeSH search terms 'epinephrine' and 'exp infant, newborn'. Databases searched included: MEDLINE from1966 to September 2000; CINAHL from 1982 to September 2000; Current Contents from 1994 to September 2000; and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Library 2000 Issue 3. Previous searches up to March 1999 have included the Oxford Database of Perinatal trials, expert informants and journal hand searching mainly in the English language, expert informant searches in the Japanese language by Prof. Ogawa, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, and conference and symposia proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised control trials in which nebulised epinephrine was compared with placebo immediately post-extubation in newborn infants who have been weaned from IPPV and extubated, with regard to clinically important outcomes (i.e. need for additional respiratory support, increase in oxygen requirement, respiratory distress, stridor or the occurrence of side effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

No studies met our criteria for inclusion in this review.

Main Results

No studies were identified which looked at the effect of inhaled nebulised epinephrine on clinically important outcomes in infants being extubated.

Implications For Practice

There is no evidence either supporting or refuting the use of inhaled nebulised racemic epinephrine in newborn infants.

Implications For Research

randomised controlled trials are needed comparing inhaled nebulised racemic epinephrine with placebo in neonates post-extubation. This should be looked at both as a routine treatment post-extubation and as specific treatment for post-extubation upper airway obstruction. Study populations should include the group of infants at highest risk for upper airway obstruction from mucosal swelling because of their small glottic and sub-glottic diameters (ie those infants with birthweights less than 1000 grams).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115sajQb]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric respiratory distress (croup) — steroids, IV access, and airway escalation: Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg oral, IV, or IM to maximum dose of 16 mg should be administered to patients with suspected croup. IVs should only be placed in children with respiratory distress for clinical concerns of dehydration or when administering IV medications. Heliox for the treatment of croup can be considered for severe distress not responsive to more than 2 doses of epinephrine. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be administered for severe respiratory distress, and bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure. Supraglottic devices and intubation — should be utilized only if BVM ventilation fails, and the airway should be managed in the least invasive way possible.

### Uncommon presentation of a common disease: influenza A presenting as adult croup [^111eVoVM]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

An 88-year-old woman presented to our emergency room with complaints of fever, coryza, barking cough and generalised fatigue for 2days. Physical examination showed stridor, tachypnoea with use of accessory muscles of respiration on admission. Laboratory tests were unremarkable except for monocytosis with a normal total white cell count. Rapid influenza diagnostic test was positive for influenza A. Chest X-ray showed subglottic narrowing of the trachea suggestive of steeple sign. A diagnosis of influenza A-induced croup was made. She was given humidified oxygen, nebulised racemic epinephrine, intravenous dexamethasone and oseltamivir. Stridor resolved within minutes of giving nebulised epinephrine. Work of breathing improved within 4–6hours. She was discharged 2days later on a tapering dose of steroids.

### Dexamethasone regime and clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with croup: a cohort study [^111S3NB6]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Covariates

Potential confounders were identified a priori. Potential confounders included age (months), sex (male/female), presence of chronic disease, history of prematurity (< 37 weeks gestation), history of croup, history of intubation, systemic steroid use in the prior 7 days, as well as various investigations and treatments initiated in the ED, including chest X‐ray, neck X‐ray, number of doses of inhaled racemic epinephrine, direct ICU admission, and initiation of intravenous fluids (IVF), supplemental oxygen (O₂), salbutamol, or antibiotics. The presence of chronic disease was assessed by a physician and defined as a medical condition that would reasonably be expected to last at least 12 months and require specialty pediatric care. Lower age and prematurity are associated with more severe respiratory outcomes in children with viral respiratory illnesses, likely due to smaller airways. Males with respiratory illness also have poorer health outcomes compared with females. Patients with chronic disease are at higher risk for greater morbidity with respiratory illnesses, which can impact LOS. Previous croup may indicate an undiagnosed upper airway anomaly and previous intubation may result in acquired upper airway anomalies (i.e. subglottic stenosis), resulting in more severe croup.

### Glucocorticoids for croup [^1151GBqa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Since the initial version of this systematic review in 1997, a number of randomised trials examining the benefit of glucocorticoids have been published, reflecting a continued interest in the use of glucocorticoids to treat patients with croup. The objective of this review was to provide evidence to guide clinicians in their treatment of patients with croup by determining the effectiveness of glucocorticoids and to identify areas of uncertainty for future research.

Objectives

To determine the effect of glucocorticoids for children with croup.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2003) and Excerpta Medica/EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003). We also contacted authors of identified croup trials published in the last ten years to inquire about additional published or unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that examine children with croup and objectively measure the effectiveness of glucocorticoid treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Based on review of the title and abstract (when available), two researchers identified studies for potential relevance. The complete text was retrieved and using a priori inclusion criteria, the studies were independently reviewed for relevance by two reviewers. Two observers independently assessed quality. Differences with respect to inclusion status and quality assessment were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted using a structured form by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. Standard statistical analyses were performed.

Main Results

Thirty-one studies were deemed relevant for inclusion (N = 3736). Glucocorticoid treatment was associated with an improvement in the Westley score at six hours with a weighted mean difference of -1.2 (95% confidence interval -1.6 to -0.8) and at 12 hours -1.9 (-2.4 to -1.3); at 24 hours this improvement was no longer significant (-1.3, -2.7 to 0.2). Fewer return visits and/or (re)admissions occurred in patients treated with glucocorticoids (relative risk 0.50; 0.36 to 0.70). Length of time spent in accident and emergency or hospital (weighted mean difference 12 hours, five to 19 hours) was significantly decreased for patients treated with glucocorticoids. Use of epinephrine decreased for children treated with a glucocorticoid (risk difference 10%; 1 to 20). No other decreases in additional treatments were found in the primary analysis. Publication bias does not impact results importantly. No between-trial significant differences were found between populations with mild and moderate croup. Oral dexamethasone may be superior to intramuscular dexamethasone.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Dexamethasone and budesonide are effective in relieving the symptoms of croup as early as six hours after treatment. Fewer return visits and/or (re)admissions are required and the length of time spent in hospital is decreased in inpatients. Dexamethasone is also effective in mild croup populations. Research is required to examine the most beneficial method for disseminating croup practice guidelines and to increase the uptake of evidence to improve outcomes.

Baseline patient characteristics used in propensity score model.

The diagnostic tests, supportive care provided, and associated outcomes of all study participants are summarized in Table 2. Among the patients hospitalized for croup, 49% had a blood test. The most common blood tests ordered were a complete blood count (46%), electrolytes (43%), and a blood culture (29%). A chest X‐ray (CXR) was performed in 42% of children, neck X‐ray in 35%. The majority of investigations were performed in the ED; complete blood counts (85% done in the ED), electrolytes (52%), blood culture (49%), nasopharyngeal swab (16%), CXR (50%), and neck X‐ray (61%). Antibiotics were initiated for 29% of patients and continued at discharge for 11% of patients. A prescription for dexamethasone was given at discharge in 16% of patients. Intravenous fluids were administered in 48% of patients, while inhaled racemic epinephrine was administered in 83% of patients, and inhaled salbutamol in 19% of patients. The majority of supportive care measures were initiated on the pediatrics wards; antibiotics (39%), IV fluid initiation (49%), salbutamol (48%). Finally, the ICU was consulted in 20% of patients, 16% were admitted to the ICU (89% admitted directly from ED to ICU), 7% were intubated, and there were two patients (0.4%) deaths.

### Croup admissions: can we shrink the elephant in the room? [^112h6ZR1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This pilot study aims to identify potential predictors of postadmission interventions of hospitalized croup patients and derive a risk model aimed at reducing hospitalizations for croup.

Methods

Data were collected on all croup hospitalizations for patients aged 1 month to 17 years admitted through a community hospital's emergency department (ED) between 2012 and 2017. Potential predictors were obtained from the electronic medical records including demographics, vital signs, ED length of stay, preintervention and postintervention Westley Croup Score (WCS), number of racemic epinephrine nebulizations administered, time to dexamethasone administration, preexisting conditions, and additional interventions during hospitalization. Statistical analysis used the outcome "patient received racemic epinephrine after hospital admission (yes/no)" to identify characteristics of the child or ED visit associated with that outcome. Preliminary analyses using stepwise logistic regression, tree models, and random forests suggested predictors, interactions among predictors, and the form of their association with the outcome. A final analysis used logistic regression.

Results

A total of 116 croup admissions were included, of which 19 (16%) received racemic epinephrine posthospitalization. These characteristics were identified as having some predictive power: sex, preexisting conditions, and preintervention and postintervention WCS, along with the interaction between sex and postintervention WCS. Logistic regression estimated an equation describing the probability of postadmission intervention, permitting the choice among admission thresholds giving different sensitivities and specificities.

Conclusions

There appear to be promising predictors in croup patients presenting to the ED, which might help stratify risk for interventions after the ED encounter and thus reduce the number of potentially avoidable admissions.

### Prediction model for croup admission need [^111RkjhN]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to generate a predictive model stratifying the probability of requiring hospitalization and inpatient respiratory intervention for croup patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), and secondarily to compare the model's performance with that of ED providers.

Methods

Retrospective data was collected on croup patients presenting to the EDs of 2 pediatric and 1 community hospital from 2019 to 2020, including demographics, preexisting conditions, and history of croup. The ED length of stay, previous dexamethasone administration, time to ED dexamethasone, number of ED racemic epinephrine doses, viral testing, and ED revisits were also recorded. Westley croup scores were derived at ED presentation and final disposition. For admitted patients, any respiratory interventions were recorded. Admission need was defined as either admitted and required an inpatient intervention or not admitted with ED revisit. A prediction model for admission need was fit using L1-penalized logistic regression.

Results

We included 2951 patients in the study, 68 (2.3%) of which needed admission. The model's predictors were disposition Westley croup scores, number of ED racemic epinephrine doses, previous dexamethasone administration, and history of intubation. The model's sensitivity was 66%, specificity was 91%, positive predictive value was 15%, and negative predictive value was 99%. ED providers' performance had a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 94%, a positive predictive value of 23%, and a negative predictive value of 99%.

Conclusions

The croup admission need predictive model appears to support clinical decision making in the ED, with the potential to improve decision making when pediatric expertise is limited.

### Practice variation in the emergency management of croup [^117RUfrf]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the effect of physician training background on the emergency management of croup.

Methods

Two community hospitals with a general emergency department (ED) staffed by board-certified emergency medicine (EM) practitioners were the setting for this study. At both sites, pediatricians (PED) or pediatric emergency medicine specialists (PEM) managed acute pediatric visits during evening and weekend hours. Retrospective patient cohorts (6 months to 6 years) with a primary discharge diagnosis of croup were identified from a 1-year period. Data abstraction was performed by a registered nurse who was blinded to the study hypothesis.

Results

There were 229, 92, and 209 patients in the PED, PEM, and EM cohorts, respectively, reflecting the practice of 69 physicians (19 PED, 12 PEM, and 38 EM). The groups had similar rates of admission and prescription of steroids at discharge. In regression models that incorporated all recorded clinical variables, EM patients were more likely to have received a chest radiograph (odds ratio [OR]: 6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1–14), racemic epinephrine (OR: 6.5; 95% CI: 3.1–14), albuterol in the ED (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.4–6.4), and parenteral steroids (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 2.1–6.3) and were less likely to have received oral steroids (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26–0.64). For the EM cohort, adjusted mean length of ED visit was 40 minutes longer (95% CI: 6.8–72) and mean direct costs were $90 higher (95% CI: $27 — $153). Regression models comparing the PEM and PED cohorts revealed no significant management differences.

Conclusion

Compared with physicians with a pediatric background, rates of resource utilization were higher for EM-trained physicians who managed uncomplicated cases of croup.

### Rate of airway intervention for croup at a tertiary children's hospital 2015–2016 [^114E5Bej]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Croup admission decision making is challenging because the rate of further interventions after stabilization is unclear.

Objective

We sought to describe rates of inpatient racemic epinephrine (IRE) and additional inpatient airway interventions (IAI) (oxygen or heliox therapy, intubation, or transfer to an intensive care unit) among patients presenting to a tertiary children's hospital with croup.

Methods

This was a retrospective descriptive study including patients (3 months to 8 years of age) with an emergency department (ED)/inpatient encounter for croup from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016 at a tertiary children's hospital. We excluded intensive care unit direct admissions and patients with bronchiolitis/asthma/pneumonia. We compared 3 groups (a weighted random 5% sample of patients evaluated in ED only, and those admitted with or without IRE/IAI) using Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson χ², or the Fischer exact test, where appropriate. We used multivariate analysis to compare demographics and preadmission racemic epinephrine (RE) with rates of IRE/IAI in admitted patients.

Results

We included 588 patients (194 discharged from the ED, 394 admitted). In admitted patients, 20.8% (82/394) had IRE/IAI, most commonly IRE (20.0%, 79/394). Three admitted patients (0.76%) had IAI. Overall, patients with 2 outside hospital/ED doses of RE had a 12.1% rate of IRE/IAI (23.5% if ≥ 3 RE doses). Patients with ≥ 3 preadmission RE doses were more likely to have IRE/IAI compared with 2 RE (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08 [95% confidence interval 1.15–3.76]; p = 0.02); there were no other significant associations.

Conclusions

We found a low rate of IRE/IAI after ED management in patients with croup and no significant associations aside from preadmission RE doses. These findings may be considered in admission decisions.

### Dexamethasone regime and clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with croup: a cohort study [^116cgRwi]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics

Baseline characteristics, including demographic and clinical characteristics, were compared by treatment group (1 vs. > 1 dose of dexamethasone). Data on diagnostic testing, supportive care, and clinical outcomes were collected for the entire cohort. Continuous variables were described using mean and standard deviation for normally distributed variables, median and interquartile range for nonnormally distributed variables. Two‐sided t tests or Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum Test were used to compare groups. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and proportions (%) and compared using χ² tests.

Propensity score analysis

Propensity scores, with inverse probability treatment weighted (IPTW) analyses, were used to control for potential confounding and ensure the two groups were balanced. Propensity scores were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, with patients' age, sex, year of hospitalization, chronic disease, history of prematurity, prior croup, prior intubation, systemic steroid use in the prior 7 days, and initiation of investigations/treatments in the ED including chest X‐ray, neck X‐ray, IVF, supplemental O₂, salbutamol, antibiotics, number of doses of inhaled racemic epinephrine, and direct ICU admission as the independent variables. Weighted samples, using IPTW, were used to estimate the average treatment effect for those administered > 1 dose of dexamethasone. Independent samples t tests/ χ² tests and standardized mean differences were used to assess the balance in baseline characteristics between the two weighted treatment groups.

Two multivariable models were constructed. A linear regression model to assess the association between dexamethasone treatment regimen and LOS. Unadjusted and weighted parameter estimates were calculated, along with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a logistic regression model to examine the association between dexamethasone treatment regimen and 30‐day return to ED visit. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated.

Sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the robustness of the results. Weighted analyses were reported. First, we excluded encounters where it was documented in the chart that the patient received steroids in the 7 days before index hospitalization, and we excluded encounters when ICU was consulted. When evaluating the secondary outcome, we also excluded encounters when dexamethasone was prescribed at discharge. Additionally, to improve the robustness of the results to outliers, a median regression was performed, adjusting for all variables included in the propensity score calculation.

All statistical analysis were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and a two‐tailed p value < .05 was considered statistically significant.

### Not all stridor is croup [^114YiP88]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency providers often attribute stridor to croup in pediatric patients. However, even in children who are having other symptoms of a viral etiology, several other causes need to be considered.

Case

A 6-month-old term male without significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with stridor with likely underlying laryngospasm. He was initially ascribed the diagnosis of croup and was discharged home after receiving steroids and racemic epinephrine. However, he returned hours later after a seizure event at home. A thorough evaluation revealed an ionized calcium of 0.49 mmol/L, and further history revealed the patient was being fed a coconut water-based homemade solution for several months. He was subsequently found to have rickets and delay in milestone achievement. Awareness of hypocalcemia as a possible cause of laryngospasm is important because of the potential life-threatening effects of critically low calcium. Hypocalcemia should be included in the differential diagnosis of any child who presents with stridor, especially if lacking other symptoms of a viral illness.

### Standardization of clinician outcomes for croup using a clinical pathway [^113DxTp1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Croup management varies significantly between hospitals and clinicians. We assessed the level of clinician variation with a clinical croup pathway in the pediatric emergency department (PED) and the impact of a pathway change on admission rates.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of children with croup in a PED at an academic referral hospital between 2018 and 2022. Primary outcome measures were the proportion of admissions to the hospital and mean PED length of stay. The main exposures were the primary clinician and their use of racemic epinephrine. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate interclinician variability in outcome measures and outcomes by self-identified race, ethnicity, and language.

Results

There was no variability in the use of racemic epinephrine, odds of admission, or odds of unplanned PED returns among 59 clinicians; there was variability in length of stay with a difference of ten minutes. Black patients had 87% higher odds of being admitted (Odds Ratio: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.04, 3.38), and patients identifying as "other" racial group had 94% higher odds of unplanned PED returns (Odds Ratio: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.53). Quarterly admit rates decreased from 7.8% to 5.1% after pathway change, with no statistical change in unplanned PED returns or intensive care unit transfers.

Conclusions

In the presence of a clinical croup pathway, there was minimal clinician variation in care. There were differences by patient race in admissions and PED return visits, but no differences by language for care. With a change in the pathway, admissions were reduced without a change in balancing measures.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak omicron [^112aLZvS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The greater reliance on nebulized epinephrine suggests a need to address airway inflammation more aggressively in Omicron-related croup cases. This aligns with the findings of Narayanan et al. (2023), who emphasized the elevated use of racemic epinephrine during the Omicron period​. Although ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were not statistically significant between groups, trends indicated a higher proportion of ICU admissions in the Omicron group. This is consistent with global data showing increased ICU utilization during severe cases of Omicron-associated croup. These cases may be driven by a combination of severe airway obstruction and systemic inflammation.

Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in laboratory indices, including WBC, lymphocyte percentages, and CRP levels, between the two groups. This suggests that while clinical severity is higher in Omicron-related croup, systemic inflammatory markers may not reliably differentiate between PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. These results align with findings by Choi et al. (2022), who reported that laboratory indicators alone were insufficient to distinguish Omicron-associated respiratory illnesses. The distinct clinical profile of Omicron-related croup underscores the need for heightened vigilance and a tailored approach to management. Prompt recognition of moderate and severe cases, combined with readiness for escalated treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and corticosteroids, is crucial. These findings also emphasize the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 as a potential causative agent in croup cases presenting during pandemic waves.

This study was retrospective and limited to two centers, which may constrain the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, some clinical data may have been incomplete or inconsistently documented in patient records. Future research should focus on prospective, multicenter studies to validate these findings and explore the long-term outcomes of children affected by Omicron-associated croup. Additionally, further investigation into the immunopathological mechanisms underlying the exacerbated upper airway inflammation observed in these cases is warranted.

### Diurnal variation in frequency and severity of croup in the emergency department [^116E6Yrn]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) presentation for croup is thought to occur more often at night, but evidence for its diurnal variation is sparse. Our objectives were to describe the diurnal patterns of ED presentation in children with croup and to determine whether time of arrival associated with severe clinical outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System. We included children 3 months to 11 years of age with an ED encounter for croup from 2016 through 2020. We quantified ED encounters by arrival hour and used generalized linear mixed-effects models to determine association between arrival time and racemic epinephrine use, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and revisits.

Results

There was considerable diurnal variation in ED visits for croup. A total of 126186 children (60.1%) presented to the ED at night (between 8 pm and 8 am), and 83763 children presented during the day (39.9%). Peak arrival time was 12:00 am (14189 encounters) and the nadir was at 2:00 pm (5231 encounters). Children presenting during overnight hours had increased odds of the use of racemic epinephrine (odds ratio [OR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.30–1.36), but reduced odds of hospitalization (OR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73–0.78), ICU admission (OR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.58–0.68), and 3 day ED revisits (OR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83–0.90).

Conclusions

Children with croup present to the ED more commonly at night. Children presenting to the ED with croup at night have greater odds of being treated with racemic epinephrine, but reduced odds of hospitalization, ICU admission, and return visits.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113k1RvS]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

We choose salbutamol as a control for epinephrine because it was the local standard of care at the time our trial was designed and it was considered unethical to withhold a potentially beneficial therapy, even though that benefit was likely minimal. Other randomized trials of epinephrine in hospitalized children have used as the control normal saline, salbutamol or both.

Interestingly we noted a risk to unblinding of treatment allocation early in our trial, by the oxidation of the sulphite preservatives, which turn mucous red or brown in recipients of racemic epinephrine. We implemented measures to avoid unblinding, but could find no mention of this event in previous studies of epinephrine in bronchiolitis. If future trials of racemic epinephrine are conducted, study design should carefully address this possibility and consider using another formulation of epinephrine. Patel et al questioned study personnel and ward staff after completion of their trial and found no difference in the proportion of correct guesses as to allocation by treatment group.

Hospital admission for bronchiolitis occurs when the infant has significant respiratory distress or is unable to feed because of the work of breathing. By this point in the evolution of bronchiolitis, lower respiratory tract inflammation is well established and may be difficult to alter. Perhaps for this reason, trials of steroid therapy in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis have shown no benefit. Length of hospital stay or avoidance of hospital admission is a salient outcome measure for intervention trials of epinephrine because institutional care represents the largest component of direct expenditures (over 60%) for bronchiolitis. Morbidity associated with bronchiolitis persisted for at least one week after hospital discharge in our population. Reducing costs and morbidity due to bronchiolitis may require more than one intervention, each at specific times during the illness. For example Schuh et al demonstrated a reduction in hospitalization in infants with bronchiolitis treated with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) in the emergency department. Bisgaard et al demonstrated a reduction in post-RSV symptomatology, principally cough, in infants treated with montelukast within the first week of illness. All of these treatments, if their efficacy were borne out in larger trials, would reduce health care costs associated with this ubiquitous infection. Such studies will need to be large to capture clinically significant outcomes.

### Epinephrine: the drug of choice for anaphylaxis. A statement of the World Allergy Organization [^117C6RX8]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal multi-system allergic reaction. Most consensus guidelines for the past 30 years have held that epinephrine is the drug of choice and the first drug that should be administered in acute anaphylaxis. Some state that properly administered epinephrine has no absolute contraindication in this clinical setting. A committee of anaphylaxis experts assembled by the World Allergy Organization has examined the evidence from the medical literature concerning the appropriate use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis. The Committee strongly believes that epinephrine is currently underutilized and often dosed suboptimally to treat anaphylaxis, is under-prescribed for potential future self-administration, that most of the reasons proposed to withhold its clinical use are flawed, and that the therapeutic benefits of epinephrine exceed the risk when given in appropriate i.m. doses.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^111urTAd]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Study procedures

Study enrolment occurred in sequential winter respiratory seasons (November to April) from 1999 to 2002. Families were approached regarding study participation in the emergency department or within 24 hours of admission. Research nurses were available to enroll patients between 8 am and 8 pm.

Treatment allocation was determined by randomization, performed in blocks of four by the pharmacy department using a computer-generated random numbers table. Study drug was packaged in identical multidose vials labeled "study drug" with a code number. Both salbutamol and racemic epinephrine are clear, colorless liquids that are indistinguishable. Participants were allocated to racemic epinephrine, 0.5 mls of 2.25% (Vaponefrin solution, Aventis Pharma, Montreal Quebec) or salbutamol respirator solution (Pharmel Inc. Montreal, Canada) by aerosol. Study drug was administered every one to four hours or more frequently at the request of the attending physician. Study drug was delivered by a wall flowmeter-nebulizer with face mask (Hospitak Inc. Farmingdale, NC) with oxygen at 5 to 7 L/min. A standard order sheet was used to ensure consistency of trial methodology. Salbutamol was given in 3 mL normal saline at a dosage of 1.5 mg for children weighing more than 10 kg, 1.25 mg for children > 6 kg and < 10 kg, and 0.75 mg for those weighing less than 6 kgs. The heart rate was measured continuously during each aerosol and for one hour after. The heart rate, vomiting, presence of tremors or pallor were recorded in the health record by the bedside nurse at the end of every aerosol and one hour post aerosol.

### Heliox for croup in children [^111zGZmn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Croup is thought to be triggered by a viral infection and is characterised by respiratory distress due to upper airway inflammation and swelling of the subglottic mucosa in children. Mostly it is mild and transient and resolves with supportive care. In moderate to severe cases, treatment with corticosteroids and nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) is required. Corticosteroids improve symptoms but it takes time for a full effect to be achieved. In the interim, the child is at risk of further deterioration. This may rarely result in respiratory failure necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation. Nebulised epinephrine may result in dose-related adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias and hypertension and its benefit may be short-lived. Helium-oxygen (heliox) inhalation has shown therapeutic benefit in initial treatment of acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates. Heliox has been used during emergency transport of children with severe croup and anecdotal evidence suggests that heliox relieves respiratory distress.

Objectives

To examine the effect of heliox on relieving symptoms and signs of croup, as determined by a croup score (a tool for measuring the severity of croup). To examine the effect of croup on rates of admission or intubation (or both), through comparisons of heliox with placebo or any active intervention(s) in children with croup.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 10, MEDLINE (1950 to October week 5, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to November 2013), CINAHL (1982 to November 2013), Web of Science (1955 to November 2013) and LILACS (1982 to November 2013). In addition, we searched two clinical trials registries: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and clinicaltrials.gov (searched 12 November 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effect of helium-oxygen mixtures with placebo or any active intervention(s) in children with croup.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified and assessed citations for inclusion. A third review author resolved disagreements. We assessed included trials for allocation concealment, blinding of intervention, completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other potential sources of bias. We reported mean differences for continuous data and odds ratios for dichotomous data. We descriptively reported data not suitable for statistical analysis.

Main Results

We included three RCTs with a total of 91 participants. One study compared heliox 70%/30% with 30% humidified oxygen administered for 20 minutes in children with mild croup and found no statistically significant differences in the overall change in croup scores between heliox and the comparator. In another study, children with moderate to severe croup were administered intramuscular dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg and either heliox 70%/30% with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100% oxygen with one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine for three hours. In this study, the heliox group's croup scores improved significantly more at all time points from 90 minutes onwards. However, overall there were no significant differences in croup scores between the groups after four hours using repeated measures analysis. In a third study, children with moderate croup all received one dose of oral dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg with heliox 70%/30% for 60 minutes in the intervention group and no treatment in the comparator. There was a statistically significant difference in croup scores at 60 minutes in favour of heliox but no significant difference after 120 minutes. It was not possible to pool outcomes because the included studies compared different interventions and reported different outcomes. No adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence to suggest a short-term benefit of heliox inhalation in children with moderate to severe croup who have been administered oral or intramuscular dexamethasone. In one study, the benefit appeared to be similar to a combination of 100% oxygen with nebulised epinephrine. In another study there was a slight change in croup scores between heliox and controls, with unclear clinical significance. In another study in mild croup, the benefit of humidified heliox was equivalent to that of 30% humidified oxygen, suggesting that heliox is not indicated in this group of patients provided that 30% oxygen is available. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in children with moderate to severe croup.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114rErK4]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, treatment of bronchiolitis with aerosolised racemic epinephrine over the course of a child's hospital stay was associated with improvement in respiratory symptoms, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in hospital length of stay. Although previous reports have found that nebulized epinephrine results in short-term clinical improvement in bronchiolitis, its effect on duration of hospital stay or need for admission is less clear. Two of four randomised clinical trials in the emergency department setting using 1 to 3 doses of epinephrine have found a difference in admission rate and two have not. It is possible that small reductions in length of stay could be detected by larger trials than those conducted thus far. Our study is only the second in which nebulized racemic epinephrine was provided throughout the hospital admission. Other trials have administered one to three doses spaced on one day only. One might expect that short-term improvement could lead to the clinician's judgement that admission was not necessary. Two of four randomised trials have suggested that length of stay in hospital is abbreviated in children receiving epinephrine. The subgroup of children that might benefit from this therapy is not clear and larger trials will be necessary to identify if and when administrations of nebulized epinephrine during hospitalisation results in patient benefit. Our study supports the thesis that while airway edema may be improved following administration of racemic epinephrine it is not sustained and does not alter the natural history of bronchiolitis in infants. The inflammatory process initiated by RSV or other respiratory viruses is unaffected and mucous secretion and edema recurs after the effect of epinephrine has dissipated.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113XDLQv]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was a randomized, double blind controlled trial of racemic epinephrine (Vaponefrin solution 2.25%, Aventis Pharma Inc, Laval, PQ) compared to control (salbutamol, Ventolin, GlaxoSmithKline Inc. Mississauga, ON) in children requiring hospitalization for management of bronchiolitis.

Patient population

Eligible children were aged greater than 6 weeks to ≤ 2 years with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis by the admitting physician. Wheezing had to be present on physical examination and was defined as a high-pitched, musical, continuous respiratory sound. Only patients admitted for management of bronchiolitis were eligible. The parent or guardian had to be able cooperate with study requirements (ability to speak, read and write English, have a telephone at home and not expected to move within the next month). The participating institutions were the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia and the Saint John Regional Hospital (SJRH) in Saint John, New Brunswick. The IWK is a university-affiliated primary and tertiary-care pediatric hospital with an urban population of 300,000 and is a referral center for the Maritime provinces (population 2 million) of Canada. SJRH serves a rural-urban population of 200,000.

Children were not eligible for enrollment if they had had a previous diagnosis of asthma, were critically ill, or had chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. Other exclusion criteria included: allergy to sodium metabisulfite, presence of tachycardia exceeding 200 beats per minute, or use of glucocorticoids, sympathomimetic amines or monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy.

Informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian prior to enrolment. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Board at both participating institutions.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of albuterol and epinephrine at equipotent β-2 agonist doses in acute bronchiolitis [^114EAFSR]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2005). Low credibility.

Our objective was to determine if nebulized racemic epinephrine is more efficacious than nebulized albuterol or saline placebo in the treatment of bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting when dosing is equivalent in terms of beta-2 agonist potency. Sixty-five patients between ages 6 weeks and 24 months with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, defined as first-time wheezing, upper respiratory symptoms and/or fever, and a Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score of at least 4, were randomized to receive 5 mg nebulized albuterol, 5 mg nebulized racemic epinephrine, or an equivalent volume of placebo at 0, 30, and 60 min. The primary outcome measure was need for hospital admission or home oxygen. Secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical scores and oxygen saturations. There were no significant statistical differences between groups in terms of need for hospital admission or outpatient management with home oxygen therapy. There were no differences between groups in terms of changes in clinical scores or oxygen saturations. Racemic epinephrine and albuterol at equivalent doses had no effect on the need for hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting compared to nebulized saline placebo, though this study may have missed less dramatic clinical effects due to small sample size.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^116LgwKb]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infancy, and hospital admission rates appear to be increasing in Canada and the United States. Inhaled beta agonists offer only modest short-term improvement. Trials of racemic epinephrine have shown conflicting results. We sought to determine if administration of racemic epinephrine during hospital stay for bronchiolitis improved respiratory distress, was safe, and shortened length of stay.

Methods

The study was a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of aerosolized racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol every one to 4 hours in previously well children aged 6 weeks to ≤ 2 years of age hospitalized with bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was symptom improvement as measured by the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI); secondary outcomes were length of stay in hospital, adverse events, and report of symptoms by structured parental telephone interview one week after discharge.

Results

62 children with a mean age of 6.4 months were enrolled; 80% of children had Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Racemic epinephrine resulted in significant improvement in wheezing and the total RDAI score on day 2 and over the entire stay (p < 0.05). The mean LOS in the epinephrine arm was 2.6 days (95% CI 2, 3.2) v. 3.4 days in those in the salbutamol group (95% CI 2.6, 4.2) (p > 0.05). Adverse events were not significantly different in the two arms. At one week post-discharge, over half of parents reported that their child still had a respiratory symptom and 40% had less than normal feeding.

Conclusion

Racemic epinephrine relieves respiratory distress in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis and is safe but does not abbreviate hospital stay. Morbidity associated with bronchiolitis as identified by parents persists for at least one week after hospital discharge in most infants.

Postextubation medical therapy — Aerosolized levo-epinephrine is as effective as aerosolized racemic epinephrine in the treatment of postextubation laryngeal edema in children. No randomized studies in neonates have been performed to evaluate the role of nebulized racemic epinephrine for postextubation stridor. Heliox may alleviate the symptoms of partial airway obstruction and resultant stridor, improve patient comfort, decrease work of breathing, and prevent reintubation.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^113CnGm1]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Results

Sixty-two children were enrolled with 31 in each treatment arm. Ten were enrolled from the Saint John site and 52 from the Halifax site. All participants completed in-hospital follow-up but the parent of one child in the epinephrine group could not be contacted for the one-week post-discharge telephone call. The mean age of participants was 6.4 months. RSV was identified in nasopharyngeal samples of 81.5% of children randomized to epinephrine and 78.6% of those randomized on salbutamol. The two groups were similar at baseline; characteristics at enrolment are seen in Table 2. On admission, only 15% of infants had a normal feeding pattern; 83% had decreased feeding by parental/caregiver report and 7% were unable to feed. 245 children were screened who did not enroll: 46 did not meet inclusion criteria and in 34 parents refused consent. The rest were ineligible because of exclusion criteria. The most commons reason for exclusion was previous diagnosis of asthma (n = 58) and previous administration of systemic steroids (n = 44).

Racemic epinephrine resulted in a significant improvement in wheezing compared to salbutamol on day 2 (p = 0.01) and over the entire hospital stay (p = 0.01) (Table 3), but not on other days. The total RDAI (wheezing and retractions) in children receiving racemic epinephrine was also significantly better on the second hospital day and over the entire stay (p = 0.02). On the third hospital day a significant difference in oxygen saturation was observed in children receiving racemic epinephrine compared to those receiving salbutamol (96.20% v. 93.80%, 98.80 v. 92.00 p = 0.03) but this difference was not significant when the two groups were compared over the entire hospital stay or on other days.

Anaphylaxis implies a risk of death even in patients whose prior episodes have been considered mild and managed easily. Anaphylaxis occurs in all age groups, from infants to the elderly, but most deaths occur in adults. Factors or circumstances associated with near-fatal or fatal anaphylaxis are reviewed from the following 10 perspectives: accidents and mishaps, adulterated products, age, allergens, atopy, comorbidities, Munchausen syndrome or contrived anaphylaxis, patient factors, route of administration, and treatment-related issues. There are no absolute contraindications to self-injectable epinephrine, and epinephrine can be administered for anaphylaxis to elderly patients or to those patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers.

One author (LH) revised and edited the stories based on the written feedback and amalgamated the five stories into three. In addition, evidence for the natural history (e.g. signs and symptoms, symptom progression) and medical management (e.g. timing and route of epinephrine and dexamethasone administration) of croup and additional health information (e.g. how and when to contact a healthcare professional, when to seek emergency care) were incorporated either into the story or as part of the booklet. Revising the stories was an iterative process with regular review and feedback by co-authors, including an English professor with expertise in creative non-fiction (TB). The three stories were reviewed for clinical accuracy by three ED physicians and a pediatric nurse.

### Burden of bronchiolitis post-COVID-19 pandemic in children less than 2 years old in 2021–2024: experience from a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia [^113tRQTe]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the management of bronchiolitis has been supportive, focusing on oxygen therapy and hydration to maintain respiratory and hemodynamic stability. However, despite international and national guidelines advocating for minimal medical intervention, we observed a relatively high use of bronchodilators (47.72% received salbutamol and 37.75% received racemic epinephrine) and antibiotics (25%); this is similar to a previous study where antibiotics were used in 45% of viral documented cases and steroids were used in 15%; similar discrepancy between guideline recommendations and actual clinical practice has been reported in multiple studies. This variation of practice may be attributed to a lack of conclusive evidence supporting the efficacy of bronchodilators in treating bronchiolitis, as physicians may use these treatments to manage acute respiratory distress or in response to parental pressure. Despite the viral etiology of bronchiolitis, the use of antibiotics in 25% of our cohort raises concerns about potential antibiotic overuse, which could contribute to antimicrobial resistance. This is particularly relevant in patients where bacterial co-infection has not been confirmed. The clinical decision to administer antibiotics may have been influenced by factors such as the presence of comorbidities, severity of illness, and concerns about bacterial superinfection. Steroids were not recommended for bronchiolitis management, as the guidelines advise against their routine use in these patients. Strategies to reduce inappropriate steroid and antibiotic use include enhancing clinician education on current evidence-based guidelines, implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs with regular audits and feedback, and utilizing decision-support tools within electronic medical records to promote adherence to recommended treatment protocols.

### National survey conducted among Italian pediatricians examining the therapeutic management of croup [^1164rnxy]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Practice-to-recommendations gaps exist in croup management and have not been critically investigated. This study examined the therapeutic management of croup among a national sample of Italian pediatric providers.

Methods

A survey was administered online to a sample of primary care and hospital-based pediatricians. Demographic data, perception regarding disease severity, treatment and knowledge of croup, choices of croup treatment medications, and knowledge of and adherence to treatment recommendations were compared between hospital and primary care pediatricians. Oral corticosteroids alone, oral corticosteroids with or without nebulized epinephrine and nebulized epinephrine plus oral or inhaled corticosteroids were considered the correct management in mild, moderate and severe croup, respectively. The determinants for correct management were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

Six hundred forty-nine pediatricians answered at least 50% of the survey questions and were included in the analysis. Providers reported extensive use of inhaled corticosteroids for mild and moderate croup. Recommended treatment for mild, moderate and severe croup was administered in 46/647 (7.1%), 181/645 (28.0%) and 263/643 (40.9%) participants, respectively. Provider's age and knowledge of Westley Croup Score were significant predictors for correct management of mild croup. Being a hospital pediatrician and perception of croup as a clinically relevant condition were significant for moderate croup.

Conclusions

Significant differences exist between recommended guidelines and clinical practice in croup management. This study suggests wide variability in both the treatment of croup and clinical decision making strategies among hospital and primary care pediatricians. Addressing this issue could lead to noteworthy clinical and economic benefits.

### Racemic epinephrine compared to salbutamol in hospitalized young children with bronchiolitis; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^117EMinQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Table 3
Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument scores by hospital day in children with bronchiolitis randomized to aerosolized racemic epinephrine or salbutamol.

The mean length of stay for children randomized to the racemic epinephrine group was 2.60 days (95% CI 2.00, 3.20) and 3.40 days for those randomized to salbutamol (95% CI 2.60, 4.20) (p > 0.05). No significant differences in length of stay or RDAI scores were seen when children confirmed as having RSV infection were compared to those without RSV.

There was no difference in wheezing score, total retraction score, total respiratory score oxygen saturation or duration of stay by study site.

Any adverse event (mild, moderate, severe) was reported in 45.20% (14/31) of children who received epinephrine compared to 51.60% (16/31) of those who received salbutamol (p > 0.05). There was one severe adverse event (fever greater than 39°C rectal), judged unrelated to study medication, which occurred in a child on salbutamol. Tremors and pallor were more common in children receiving racemic epinephrine than in those on salbutamol, but these differences were not statistically significant (19.40% (6/31) v. 9.70% (3/31) and 19.40% (6/31) v. 6.50% (2/31) respectively). Vomiting occurred in 19.4% (6/31) of those receiving epinephrine and 25.8% (8/31) of those on salbutamol; this difference was not statistically significant.

At the follow-up telephone call, one week after discharge over 60% of infants had at least one ongoing respiratory symptom (Table 4) and most were still not considered to be feeding normally by their parents. No statistically significant differences in outcomes at the follow-up phone call were identified.

### Management of croup in the emergency department: the role of multidose nebulized epinephrine [^115mFuTg]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Croup occasionally requires medical intervention for respiratory distress. Mainstays of treatment are corticosteroids and nebulized epinephrine. Diagnosis and assessment of severity remain clinical. Safety of discharge from an emergency department (ED) after treatment with corticosteroids and 1 nebulized epinephrine has been established. No evidence exists regarding risk associated with discharge after multidose nebulized epinephrine. Many patients requiring multidose nebulized epinephrine are reflexively admitted. The purpose of this study was to provide a descriptive analysis of the current management of croup, specifically patients requiring multidose nebulized epinephrine.

Methods

The Pediatric Health Information System was used to extract information on patients diagnosed with croup age 0 to 11 years, evaluated in pediatric EDs from 2004 to 2014, who received corticosteroids and at least 1 nebulized epinephrine. We retrospectively assessed patients requiring multidose nebulized epinephrine, evaluating risk of return for additional care associated with discharges and reviewing admissions for markers of disease severity.

Results

A total of 95,403 patients were identified. Those requiring corticosteroids and multidose nebulized epinephrine (N = 8084) were less likely to return for further care if discharged from the ED (5.4% return single dose, 0.8% return multidose: P < 0.0001) and were admitted at a higher rate (10.7% admission single dose, 70.5% admission multidose: P < 0.0001). Of those admitted, only 31.7% received more than 2 treatments.

Conclusions

Patients requiring single-dose nebulized epinephrine are managed differently than those requiring multidose nebulized epinephrine. There is likely a role for multidose nebulized epinephrine in the outpatient management of croup. A prospective study is needed.

We identified 5152 children with COVID-19–related croup (3329 [64.6%] boys; median [IQR] age, 17 [9–31] months) (Table). The proportion of children with COVID-19–related croup was significantly increased during Omicron (10.9%) compared with Alpha or other variant (4.1%) and Delta (3.6%) periods (P < .001) (Figure). Odds of hospitalization during Alpha or other variant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.97–1.70) or Delta (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74–1.15) periods were not significantly different compared with the period of Omicron predominance. Treatment with RE was less likely during the Delta period (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61–0.87) and did not differ in the Alpha or other variant periods (aOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.81–1.31) compared with the period of Omicron predominance. The frequency of ICU admission was not statistically different across time periods (Table).

### 2022 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway [^1158YtG1]. Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Follow-up care after a difficult airway — scope, evidence, and recommendations include the following: Follow-up care includes the topics of: (1) postextubation care (i.e., steroids, racemic epinephrine), (2) postextubation counseling (i.e., informing and advising the patient or responsible individual of the occurrence and potential complications associated with a difficult airway), (3) documentation of difficult airway and management in the medical record and to the patient, and (4) registration with a difficult airway notification service. Literature findings state that the literature is insufficient to evaluate the benefits of postextubation steroids or epinephrine, counseling, documentation in the medical record, or registration with a difficult airway notification service, with a case report noting unavailable prior difficult intubation records (Category B4-H evidence). Survey findings report that consultants and participating organizations strongly agree with the recommendation to inform the patient (or responsible person) and to document the presence and nature of the airway difficulty in the medical record to guide and facilitate future care. Recommendations for follow-up care are: Use postextubation steroids and/or racemic epinephrine when appropriate; inform the patient or a responsible person of the airway difficulty that was encountered, with the information conveyed potentially including the presence of a difficult airway, apparent reasons for difficulty, how the intubation was accomplished, and implications for future care; document the presence and nature of the airway difficulty in the medical record; instruct the patient to register with an emergency notification service when appropriate and feasible. Aspects of documentation include, but are not limited to, (1) a description of the airway difficulties encountered and (2) a description of the various airway management techniques that were used with their roles in management of the difficult airway.

### Comparison of nebulized epinephrine to albuterol in bronchiolitis [^113GULng]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effect of nebulized racemic epinephrine to nebulized racemic albuterol on successful discharge from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Children up to their 18th month of life presenting to two teaching hospital EDs with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis who were ill enough to warrant treatment but did not need immediate intubation were eligible for this double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients received either three doses of racemic albuterol or one dose of racemic epinephrine plus two saline nebulizers. Disposition was decided 2 hours after the first nebulizer. Successful discharge was defined as not requiring additional bronchodilators in the ED after study drug administration and not subsequently admitted within 72 hours. Adjusted relative risks (aRR) were estimated using the modified Poisson regression with successful discharge as the dependent variable and study drug and severity of illness as exposures. Secondary analysis was performed for patients aged less than 12 months and first presentation.

Results

The authors analyzed 703 patients; 352 patients were given albuterol and 351 epinephrine. A total of 173 in the albuterol group and 160 in the epinephrine group were successfully discharged (crude RR = 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 1.26). When adjusted for severity of illness, patients who received albuterol were significantly more likely than patients receiving epinephrine to be successfully discharged (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.36). This was also true among those with first presentation and in those less than 12 months of age.

Conclusions

In children up to the 18th month of life, ED treatment of bronchiolitis with nebulized racemic albuterol led to more successful discharges than nebulized epinephrine.

Anaphylaxis management during allergen immunotherapy (AIT) — epinephrine is 'universally recommended as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis administered intramuscularly into the vastus lateralis (antero-lateral thigh)'. Intramuscular dosing is '0.01 mg/kg of 1 mg/mL (1:1000), up to 0.5 mg in adults and 0.3 mg in children and teenagers', and 'Clinicians should administer additional doses of intramuscular epinephrine every 5 to 15 minutes if anaphylaxis signs or symptoms persist', with 'no absolute contraindications to its use for anaphylaxis'. Supportive care includes 'placing the patient in a supine position if their presentation is mainly cardiovascular, monitoring vital signs, and administration of oxygen for patients with respiratory distress and those receiving further doses of epinephrine', plus fluids where 'Intravenous fluids are to be administered early… and should be repeated if lack of response', and 'should also be given in severe anaphylaxis with a respiratory presentation if a second dose of intramuscular epinephrine is required', while patients with lower respiratory symptoms 'should receive inhaled beta-2 agonists following initial treatment with epinephrine'.

### Management of anaphylaxis [^114mjz4G]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The key to managing anaphylaxis is early epinephrine administration. This can improve outcomes and prevent progression to severe and fatal anaphylaxis. Delayed or lack of administration of epinephrine is associated with fatal reactions. Positioning in a recumbent supine position, airway management, and intravenous fluids are essential in its management. Antihistamines and glucocorticosteroids should not be prescribed in place of epinephrine. β-adrenergic agonists by inhalation are indicated for bronchospasm associated with anaphylaxis despite optimal epinephrine treatment. Long-term management of anaphylaxis includes the identification and avoidance of triggers; identification of cofactors, such as mast cell disorders; patient, parent, and caregiver education, and interventions to reduce allergen sensitivity, such as the use of venom immunotherapy for Hymenoptera hypersensitivity. Long-term management is covered in other articles. Consultation with an allergist/immunologist is recommended when necessary.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^114yXqEr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society anaphylaxis — epinephrine primary treatment and initial management: Epinephrine is the essential, primary treatment that should be given once anaphylaxis has been diagnosed (1A). Given its effectiveness and rapid administration, intramuscular (IM) epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. The preferred injection site is the anterolateral thigh, followed by the deltoid (1B). Over-the-counter, metered-dose inhalers of epinephrine have not been found to be a practical or effective treatment for anaphylaxis (1B). Delay in epinephrine administration has been repeatedly associated with fatal anaphylaxis. Epinephrine may be given intravenous (IV) as a continuous infusion or intermittent boluses when anaphylactic shock is refractory to repeated IM injections (see "Dosage" and "Refractory Anaphylaxis" sections). If possible, separating the patient from the inciting allergen is prudent, but vomiting should not be induced to eliminate a food-based allergen (1C).

### Is epinephrine truly lifesaving, and can we prove this? [^116pa23r]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Injectable intramuscular epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is touted as "life-saving", in particular because observational studies have identified lack of prompt epinephrine treatment as a critical risk factor associated with anaphylaxis fatality. Although association is not causal, few would argue that epinephrine is not the optimal treatment for anaphylaxis, and do we have sufficient proof to suggest that epinephrine is actually "life-saving"? Epinephrine indeed works swiftly to reverse such symptoms of an immediate allergic reaction. However, there are abundant observational data that many cases of anaphylaxis are inherently self-limited and may resolve within 1 to 2 hours in most cases with or without treatment. In this perspective, the intent is to address and reframe the reality of the evidence we do have for what epinephrine does and does not accomplish and provide a perspective regarding the common "dogma" regarding the drug. There is a danger in using terms such as "life-threatening" and "life-saving" for anaphylaxis and epinephrine treatment, especially under the caution of frequently cited rhetoric that subsequent reactions are likely to be progressively more severe or potentially fatal. Use of such descriptions risks negatively polarizing our patients and adversely affecting their quality of life, given these terms can potentiate unnecessary fear. Epinephrine is in fact a wonderful drug, but it is important to not lose sight of the evidence for what it actually does in anaphylaxis treatment and why it is important to use this drug in anaphylaxis, as opposed to an emphasis on what it does not do.

### Suspected anaphylactic reactions associated with anaesthesia [^113VYt9N]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Immediate management

These management guidelines presuppose that the patient is in the care of an appropriately-trained anaesthetist and full resuscitation facilities and appropriate vital signs monitors are available.

There is a wide spectrum of severity and combinations of clinical features. Although management should be tailored to the individual patient, there is consensus that adrenaline should be given as early as possible. In addition to having alpha-agonist activity, adrenaline is a valuable beta-agonist which is inotropic and a bronchodilator, and reduces further mediator release.

Other causes of hypotension or difficulty in ventilation should be excluded, for example a misplaced tracheal tube or equipment failure.

### Adrenaline (epinephrine) for the treatment of anaphylaxis with and without shock [^112JNwCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Anaphylaxis is a serious hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Adrenaline is recommended as the initial treatment of choice for anaphylaxis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of adrenaline (epinephrine) in the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), EMBASE (1966 to March 2007), CINAHL (1982 to March 2007), BIOSIS (to March 2007), ISI Web of Knowledge (to March 2007) and LILACS (to March 2007). We also searched websites listing ongoing trials: http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlledtrials.com and http://www.actr.org.au/; and contacted pharmaceutical companies and international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing adrenaline with no intervention, placebo or other adrenergic agonists were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion.

Main Results

We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this review, we are unable to make any new recommendations on the use of adrenaline for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Although there is a need for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of high methodological quality in order to define the true extent of benefits from the administration of adrenaline in anaphylaxis, such trials are unlikely to be performed in individuals with anaphylaxis. Indeed, they might be unethical because prompt treatment with adrenaline is deemed to be critically important for survival in anaphylaxis. Also, such studies would be difficult to conduct because anaphylactic episodes usually occur without warning, often in a non-medical setting, and differ in severity both among individuals and from one episode to another in the same individual. Consequently, obtaining baseline measurements and frequent timed measurements might be difficult, or impossible, to obtain. In the absence of appropriate trials, we recommend, albeit on the basis of less than optimal evidence, that adrenaline administration by intramuscular (i.m.) injection should still be regarded as first-line treatment for the management of anaphylaxis.

### Episnap epinephrine convenience kit [^111zUbBL]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION

Epinephrine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines, in patients with angle closure glaucoma, and patients in shock (nonanaphylactic). It should not be used in patients anesthetized with agents such as cyclopropane or halothane as these may sensitize the heart to the arrhythmic action of sympathomimetic drugs.

Addition of epinephrine to local anesthetics for injection of certain areas (e.g., fingers, toes, ears, etc.) is contraindicated because of danger that vasoconstriction may result in sloughing of tissue.

Except as diluted for admixture with local anesthetics to reduce absorption and prolong action, epinephrine should not ordinarily be used in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated, e.g., in thyrotoxicosis, diabetes, in obstetrics when maternal blood pressure is in excess of 130/80 and in hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.

### Decreasing racemic epinephrine for bronchiolitis in an academic children's hospital [^117DQxCW]. Hospital Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalizations in the United States. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against routine use of bronchodilators in bronchiolitis management, racemic epinephrine was persistently used for this purpose at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital. Our aim was to decrease racemic epinephrine use for bronchiolitis by 50% within 8 months.

Methods

Our multidisciplinary team used the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Model for Improvement to develop an aim statement, choose metrics, and perform plan-do-study-act cycles to reduce racemic epinephrine use. We used focused education through in-person and online methods and provided direct feedback to residents, respiratory therapists, and nurses primarily caring for these children. The percentage of all patients admitted for bronchiolitis receiving at least 1 dose of racemic epinephrine was collected from the medical record and recorded on statistical process control charts for distribution to their work areas. Albuterol use and length of stay were collected as balancing measures. We used statistical process control charts to establish special cause variation and identify statistically significant differences in our measures.

Results

During our intervention period, the percentage of bronchiolitis patients receiving at least 1 dose of racemic epinephrine to treat bronchiolitis decreased from an average of 26% to 5%, and similarly, albuterol use decreased from an average of 48% to 34%. There was no clinically significant difference in length of stay.

Conclusions

Using a multidisciplinary approach and focused education techniques may be an effective way to reduce racemic epinephrine use for children with bronchiolitis.

Mortality from COVID-19 in populations at high risk is substantial, and treatment options are limited. Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 with highly effective vaccines represents an important tool in efforts to control the pandemic. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor for adverse events, including anaphylaxis, after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines and will regularly assess the benefits and risks of vaccination in the context of the evolving epidemiology of the pandemic. Continued monitoring in VAERS and additional monitoring in population-based surveillance systems, such as the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink, will help to further characterize the risk for anaphylaxis after administration of COVID-19 vaccines. CDC guidance on use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and management of anaphylaxis is available. Specifically, vaccination locations should 1) ensure that necessary supplies are available to manage anaphylaxis, especially sufficient quantities of epinephrine in prefilled syringes or autoinjectors; 2) screen potential vaccine recipients to identify persons with contraindications and precautions; 3) implement recommended postvaccination observation periods, either 15 or 30 minutes depending on each patient's previous history of allergic reactions; 4) ensure that health care providers can recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis early; and 5) immediately treat suspected anaphylaxis with intramuscular epinephrine; because of the acute, life-threatening nature of anaphylaxis, there are no contraindications to epinephrine administration. Patients experiencing anaphylaxis should be transported to facilities where they can receive appropriate medical care. All patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction after their observation period ends and they have left the vaccination location. Health care providers can play an important role in vaccine safety by being vigilant in recognizing and reporting adverse events after immunization to VAERS at.

### Anaphylaxis in practice: a guide to the 2023 practice parameter update [^112GRPaw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation 26 — Post-epinephrine actions and home management: Clinicians should counsel patients always to activate emergency medical services after epinephrine administration when their anaphylaxis is severe, symptoms do not promptly resolve completely or nearly completely, and/or symptoms return or worsen after the first dose of epinephrine. Immediate activation of emergency medical services after epinephrine use may not be necessary if the patient experiences a prompt, complete or nearly complete, and durable response to treatment and has additional doses of epinephrine available; in such cases, home management of anaphylaxis may be considered. There is no evidence that preemptively administering epinephrine to asymptomatic patients prevents anaphylaxis after exposure to a potential trigger. Clinicians should discuss potential barriers to treatment adherence, regularly review the essentials of EAIs (epinephrine autoinjectors), encourage practice with trainer devices, counsel about common side effects and signs of rare serious adverse events, and note that the risk of serious adverse reactions to intramuscular epinephrine is low and should not pose barriers to EAI prescription or use. When developing a management plan, clinicians and patients should engage in SDM that considers risk factors for severe and biphasic anaphylaxis, access to epinephrine and medical services, and capacity to administer EAI effectively and gauge treatment response.

### Benefits of epinephrine for anaphylaxis outweigh potential harm – A safety review [^116q3NRv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can progress quickly, and although fatal anaphylaxis is very rare, treatment should be given as soon as possible. The recommended first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular (IM) epinephrine. Yet epinephrine for anaphylaxis is underused, which can have deleterious, or even tragic, consequences. Although fear of self-injection substantially affects adherence, hesitancy to use epinephrine for anaphylaxis may be linked to the common unsubstantiated perception that epinephrine is dangerous. Therefore, the objective of this narrative review is to describe the safety of epinephrine when administered for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) are the greatest safety concern with epinephrine because of its known effects on cardiac output and vasoconstriction. Cardiovascular events and overdose are significantly more likely to occur with accidental intravenous bolus administration than IM administration. Although serious AEs have been reported with IM epinephrine, and there are potential risk factors for cardiovascular AEs for some patients, there are no absolute contraindications for its use in a life-threatening situation. Appropriately dosed and administered epinephrine should engender no fear of use for anaphylaxis. The potential harm of delaying or withholding epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis far outweighs the potential risk of AEs.

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: an overview of current guidelines [^112uG9Ud]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

4 | Conclusions

The management of RA is likely to be improved by improving recognition of severe reactions early, and treating such reactions with appropriate therapy (Figure 2). Defining RA as when anaphylaxis does not respond to two doses of adrenaline and appropriate initial fluid therapy would be a pragmatic choice in flagging the potential for severe reactions, in particular in the perioperative setting, and thus the need to escalate and seek expert help and commence treatment with intravenous adrenaline infusion and additional resuscitative measures. There are limited clinical data to inform the optimal dose of adrenaline IV infusion, fluid therapy (type, timing and volume) and second-line treatment; however, sufficient data exist to inform guidelines in the absence of high-quality studies. Further clinical data are needed to help align current guidelines towards a consensus on how to manage RA.

Finally, the authors seem to have an impression that the regulatory process was abbreviated/expedited. ARS has conducted more than 20 studies with > 750 participants, over 8-years to address all of the FDA's requests and optimize neffy® dosing. Patients often fail to fill prescriptions or use injectable epinephrine in a timely manner due to a variety of reasons including and especially a fear of needles. It is hoped that neffy® will overcome this patients' hesitation offering a needle-free safe and effective therapeutic option for the management of anaphylaxis.

### Predictors of inpatient racemic epinephrine use in patients admitted with croup… [^114L2Mfw]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

Many patients hospitalized for croup receive no additional racemic epinephrine postadmission. We analyzed the association between inpatient racemic epinephrine use and demographic and emergency department parameters including timing between RE doses with a goal of identifying patients who may be low risk for ED discharge. Median length of hospitalization for patients receiving inpatient RE was significantly longer, whereas readmit rates were similar between groups. Fewer than 25% of admitted patients received inpatient RE. Age and tachypnea for age were associated with inpatient RE use. Reassessment of admission thresholds for multidose RE use may be warranted to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations. 13 thus signaling that some clinical heuristics for admission may lead to low-value care.

Furthermore, tachycardia and tachypnea on initial vital signs, as well as the receipt of ED radiographs, have been identified as predictive factors for postadmission interventions including RE, heliox, and pediatric intensive care unit transfers, 14 but only a subset of admitted patients typically receive such interventions. Our goal was to determine whether significant differences between characteristics could be used to identify low-risk patients and to decrease overall admissions for croup. Secondary outcomes included LOS, time of observation after last RE, and 7-day croup readmission and ED revisit rate. 14 and the percentage of patients receiving inpatient RE are decreased from both Rudinsky et al 13 and Narayanan and Funkhouser. 17 Neither the number of ED RE doses nor the time between these doses were predictive of subsequent inpatient RE. This indicates that the number of ED RE doses may not be ideal as an admit criteria.

However, age and tachypnea for age may be helpful factors in triaging a patient's overall need for admission. Furthermore, when patients received subsequent inpatient RE, they had significantly prolonged LOS compared to those who did not, despite no difference in revisit and readmission rates between groups. Revisit and readmission rates were also low. Our study suggests that the frequently used admission criteria of multidose ED RE treatments could be reevaluated, instead allowing for longer observation periods before decisions to admit. Age and tachypnea for age may be helpful factors in triaging such patients. Further prospective studies are needed focusing on providing appropriate and value-added care for patients with croup.

### Nebulized racemic epinephrine by IPPB for the treatment of croup… [^112pwhVs]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Racemic epinephrine has been advocated for the treatment of croup, but controlled studies have not proved it more effective than saline. Twenty patients hospitalized with acute croup and persistent inspiratory stridor at rest were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: saline or racemic epinephrine, both nebulized and delivered by intermittent positive pressure breathing. Clinical scores were significantly improved at ten and 30 minutes following the treatment with racemic epinephrine but not at 120 minutes. Racemic epinephrine was significantly more effective than saline at 10 and 30 minutes but not at 120 minutes after the treatment. We conclude that nebulized racemic epinephrine is effective treatment for the acute signs of croup. Westley CR, Cotton EK, Brooks JG.

### Inadvertent intravenous administration of racemic epinephrine… [^114r18Bt]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

NEBULIZED racemic epinephrine is used to relieve respiratory distress in patients with upper airway edema caused by prior endotracheal intubation or laryngotracheobronchitis. Although side effects are uncommon when the drug is used as recommended, a recent report discussed complications that arose when racemic epinephrine was accidentally administered orally to small infants. 1 Our report describes the consequences of an inadvertent intravenous administration of this medication and the potential hazard of withdrawing nonparenteral medications from their containers by syringe. Report of a Case A 13-month-old, 8. 6-kg infant was hospitalized with clinical and radiographic evidence of croup. Progressive respiratory distress prompted transfer to the intensive care unit the following day. When the infant developed cyanosis and bradycardia during a coughing episode, preparations for endotracheal intubation were begun. Nebulized racemic epinephrine had been administered with oxygen eight times during the. Kurachek SC, Rockoff MA. Inadvertent Intravenous Administration of Racemic Epinephrine.
