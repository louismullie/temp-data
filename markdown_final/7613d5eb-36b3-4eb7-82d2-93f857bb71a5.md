Paracentesis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about paracentesis, specifically the clinical indications, when to perform diagnostic versus therapeutic paracentesis, essential pre-procedure assessments such as ultrasound guidance and coagulation parameters, procedural technique, equipment, and safety landmarks. They also want to know about critical laboratory analyses and interpretation, including SBP thresholds and SAAG, post-procedure management like albumin use and monitoring, considerations for special populations and scenarios, and a summary of key principles and safety pearls with appropriate citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indications and when to perform diagnostic versus therapeutic paracentesis. Then, I should verify the essential pre-procedure assessments, including ultrasound guidance and coagulation parameters. Next, I will review the procedural technique, equipment, and safety landmarks. After that, I need to check the critical laboratory analyses and interpretation, including SBP thresholds and SAAG. Then, I will examine post-procedure management, especially albumin use and monitoring. I should also consider special populations and scenarios, and finally summarize key principles and safety pearls with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical indications, because missing the right indication can delay care. Diagnostic paracentesis is indicated in all patients with new-onset ascites, in those with worsening ascites or complications of cirrhosis, and urgently in any cirrhotic patient with infection risk features such as fever, encephalopathy, GI bleeding, shock, or declining liver or renal function, as well as on hospital admission to rule out SBP without delay [^1135CgdZ] [^114fDbhH] [^115rep35] [^115mAsPJ]. Therapeutic paracentesis is first-line for large-volume (grade 3) ascites, for refractory ascites when diuretics fail or are not tolerated, and in selected non-cirrhotic etiologies such as malignant or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome–related ascites when symptomatic, with the goal of complete drainage in a single session when feasible [^111NwMJZ] [^116TjvfG] [^112tpCHa] [^112vWWff].

> Wait, let me verify the pre-procedure assessment steps, because safety hinges on them. Ultrasound guidance is recommended to identify the optimal site, confirm adequate fluid, avoid organs and scars, and visualize abdominal wall vessels; both pre-procedure marking and real-time guidance improve success and reduce complications, and a two-probe technique may further reduce major bleeding risk, though evidence quality varies [^116ghThQ] [^116itrKM] [^114VmSnw] [^115tdm9a]. I should double-check coagulation testing: routine PT/INR and platelet checks are not required before paracentesis, and prophylactic transfusion is not recommended, even in many patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, given the low bleeding risk in experienced hands [^111WnsvB] [^112q425k]. Hold on, I should verify patient-specific risk factors: pregnancy, organomegaly, severe bowel or bladder distension, prior abdominal surgery, and very low platelets increase risk and should prompt ultrasound guidance and careful planning.

> Next, I should review the procedural technique and equipment, and I need to ensure I get the landmarks right. For site selection, the left lower quadrant is often preferred due to thinner abdominal wall and deeper fluid pockets; the puncture site should be at least 8 cm from the midline and 5 cm above the symphysis to avoid the inferior epigastric artery and lateral to avoid the liver and spleen, with ultrasound confirmation of a safe trajectory [^112vWWff]. Let me think about needles: for diagnostic taps, an 18–20 gauge needle or a 20 mL syringe suffices; for therapeutic drainage, a 15-gauge needle-cannula or a large-bore catheter system improves efficiency and reduces multiple punctures, and a fenestrated needle can increase flow during large-volume paracentesis [^114Qadwe] [^113tv8jY]. I should confirm that the patient remains in the same position between ultrasound marking and the procedure to maintain alignment, and that sterile technique is used throughout [^116ghThQ].

> I will now examine the essential laboratory analyses and interpretation, because diagnostic yield depends on getting the right tests. The initial studies should include ascitic fluid cell count with differential, total protein, albumin, and a simultaneous serum albumin to calculate the SAAG; a neutrophil count greater than 250 cells/mm³ establishes SBP and warrants immediate empiric antibiotics, ideally before culture results return [^1135CgdZ] [^1114zpPx]. Hold on, I should verify culture technique: bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles markedly increases culture yield compared with delayed processing, and this should precede antibiotics whenever possible [^114Qadwe] [^111QMCdv]. Let me consider SAAG interpretation: SAAG greater than 1.1 g/dL supports portal hypertension–related ascites, whereas SAAG less than 1.1 g/dL suggests peritoneal disease such as malignancy, infection, or pancreatitis; total protein less than 1.5 g/dL in cirrhosis increases SBP risk and may influence prophylaxis decisions [^113Brfv2] [^111KuzhC]. I should also remember to add targeted tests based on suspicion: amylase for pancreatic ascites, cytology and tumor markers for malignancy, ADA for TB, and BNP when cardiac ascites is suspected [^1115uioo] [^1137WuCd].

> But wait, what about post-procedure management, especially albumin use and monitoring for complications. For large-volume paracentesis exceeding 5 liters, albumin should be infused at 8 g per liter of ascites removed using 20–25% human albumin solution to prevent post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction; for less than 5 liters, albumin can be considered in patients at high risk such as those with acute-on-chronic liver failure or impaired renal function, though evidence is weaker [^112TSw1H] [^113snnRy]. I should double-check that we monitor for leakage, hemodynamic instability, and renal function after the procedure, and that we address persistent leaks with pressure dressings or a purse-string suture if needed [^112vWWff]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about volume and AKI: contemporary data suggest overall low AKI risk with paracentesis, with risk more tightly linked to baseline severity of liver disease and clinical decompensation rather than the exact volume removed, reinforcing the importance of careful selection and follow-up [^112pUAGs].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios, and I should confirm nuances. In ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, ultrasound-guided paracentesis is recommended for tense ascites causing pain, dyspnea, or oliguria, and can be performed abdominally or vaginally depending on anatomy and safety [^112tpCHa] [^113AKhFe]. In pediatrics, large-volume paracentesis is feasible and safe with appropriate equipment and monitoring, with fenestrated needles improving efficiency compared with intravascular catheters [^113tv8jY]. For refractory ascites, repeated large-volume paracentesis remains standard when TIPS is contraindicated or unavailable, and emerging devices for continuous low-volume drainage are promising but require careful patient selection and surveillance for complications such as AKI and hyponatremia [^112Ng1wK] [^116pU2DZ]. I should also remember that early diagnostic paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission is associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter length of stay, supporting prompt evaluation in hospitalized cirrhotics with ascites [^112mQfR9].

> I need to ensure I close with key safety principles and a concise synthesis. Paracentesis is generally safe with low overall complication rates when performed with ultrasound guidance and attention to landmarks, and routine correction of coagulopathy is unnecessary; however, major bleeding, though rare, can be catastrophic, so vessel mapping and adherence to safe insertion zones remain critical [^111WnsvB]. Early diagnostic paracentesis improves outcomes, ultrasound guidance improves success and reduces adverse events, and albumin after large-volume taps prevents circulatory dysfunction; these pillars align with major society guidance and should anchor practice [^112mQfR9] [^116ghThQ] [^112TSw1H]. Hold on, I should verify that I emphasized training and supervision: competence with ultrasound and procedural technique, including simulation-based practice, is essential to maintain low complication rates and high diagnostic yield across settings [^116ghThQ] [^112q425k].

Paracentesis is a bedside procedure to aspirate ascitic fluid for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, most commonly used in cirrhosis-related ascites [^111LFMS9] [^113MXKL3]. Ultrasound guidance is **strongly recommended** to reduce complications and improve success, especially in patients with coagulopathy, low-volume ascites, or prior abdominal surgery [^116ghThQ] [^114VmSnw]. Diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all patients with new-onset ascites or suspected infection, with fluid analyzed for cell count, albumin, total protein, and culture [^1135CgdZ] [^116LS8uH] [^111QMCdv]. Therapeutic paracentesis is indicated for tense or refractory ascites, with albumin infusion (8 g/L removed) recommended for volumes > 5 L to prevent circulatory dysfunction [^112vWWff] [^112TSw1H]. Complications are uncommon but include bleeding, infection, and leakage; ultrasound guidance and adherence to technique minimize risk [^111KK2qW] [^116ghThQ].

## Indications

### Diagnostic indications

- **New-onset ascites**: Perform diagnostic paracentesis in all patients with new-onset ascites to determine etiology [^1135CgdZ] [^114Ti4nD].
- **Suspected infection**: Evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with ascites and fever, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, or systemic infection [^115o9h96] [^116LS8uH].
- **Worsening ascites or complications**: Perform diagnostic paracentesis in hospitalized patients with worsening ascites or complications of cirrhosis [^114fDbhH] [^115rep35].

---

### Therapeutic indications

Therapeutic indications include **tense ascites**, for which large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is first-line therapy in patients with grade 3 ascites [^111NwMJZ] [^113rqwhy], and **refractory ascites**, for which repeated therapeutic paracentesis is indicated when ascites persists despite maximal medical therapy [^112Ng1wK] [^112vWWff].

---

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include **disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)** and acute abdomen requiring immediate surgery. Relative contraindications include severe coagulopathy (INR > 2.5), thrombocytopenia (< 50,000/µL), severe bowel distension, pregnancy, and previous abdominal surgery; ultrasound guidance and careful technique mitigate risks [^113MXKL3] [^116ghThQ].

---

## Pre-procedure preparation

- **Informed consent**: Obtain informed consent, explaining risks, benefits, and alternatives [^112vWWff].
- **Ultrasound guidance**: Use ultrasound to identify optimal insertion site, assess fluid volume, and avoid vessels and organs [^116ghThQ] [^114VmSnw].
- **Coagulation parameters**: Routine measurement of PT/INR and platelet count is not required; transfusion is generally unnecessary unless severe coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia is present [^111WnsvB] [^112q425k].

---

## Procedural technique

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Positioning | Supine or lateral decubitus; left lateral decubitus facilitates access to the left lower quadrant [^notfound] |
| Site selection | Left lower quadrant, 2–3 fingerbreadths superior and medial to the anterior superior iliac spine; avoid scars, veins, and organs [^112vWWff] |
| Sterile preparation | Chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine; sterile drapes [^notfound] |
| Local anesthesia | 1% lidocaine infiltration |
| Needle insertion | Z-track technique; advance slowly while aspirating [^notfound] |
| Fluid aspiration | Aspirate diagnostic sample first; then drain therapeutic volume slowly [^notfound] |
| Closure | Pressure dressing; consider purse-string suture if leakage occurs [^112vWWff] |

---

## Post-procedure care

Post-procedure care includes **monitoring** for signs of bleeding, infection, or leakage, and **albumin infusion** — 8 g per liter of ascites removed (typically 40 g for 5 L) — for LVP > 5 L to prevent circulatory dysfunction [^112TSw1H] [^113snnRy].

---

## Complications

- **Bleeding**: Rare but potentially serious; risk higher with coagulopathy, low platelets, or inexperienced operators [^111KK2qW] [^113MXKL3].
- **Infection**: Including SBP; strict aseptic technique reduces risk [^111KK2qW].
- **Ascitic fluid leakage**: Common; manage with pressure dressing or purse-string suture [^112vWWff].
- **Hypotension**: Especially after large-volume taps; albumin infusion mitigates risk [^112TSw1H].

---

## Diagnostic analysis of ascitic fluid

- **Cell count and differential**: Neutrophil count > 250 cells/mm³ indicates SBP [^1114zpPx].
- **Albumin and total protein**: Calculate serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG); SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL suggests portal hypertension [^notfound].
- **Culture**: Bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles improves yield [^114Qadwe].

---

## Special considerations

In **coagulopathy**, routine correction is not required; use ultrasound guidance and experienced operators [^111WnsvB] [^116ghThQ]. In **refractory ascites**, consider TIPS or liver transplantation; repeated paracenteses are palliative [^115o9h96] [^112vWWff]. In **malignant ascites**, cytology and tumor markers may aid diagnosis [^111KuzhC].

Large volume (therapeutic) paracentesis

Large volume paracentesis (LVP) is the standard of care for managing large volume ascites both in conjunction with diuresis to relieve symptoms of a tense abdomen, as well as in the management of refractory ascites, when diuretics become ineffective or the side effects preclude their continued use. Development of refractory ascites is of prognostic significance, therefore, at its onset, suitability of liver transplantation should be considered and assessed as a priority.

Performance standards

An efficient LVP service can be provided safely in a day case or outpatient setting and non-physician healthcare providers such as GI endoscopy assistantsand specialist nursescan be trained to perform therapeutic paracentesis and lead the service effectively. Exemplar training programmes indicate that 10 supervised procedures would be optimal for training to achieve competence in performing therapeutic paracentesis; mean duration of LVP was 97 ± 24 min, and the mean volume of ascitic fluid removed was 8.7 ± 2.8 L.

Patients should provide informed consent before the procedure. In 52 patients (15% obese) with ascites due to cirrhosis, ultrasound demonstrated that the left lower quadrant abdominal wall was thinner and depth of ascites greater, therefore, a suitable site for drain insertion. To minimise the risk of injury to the inferior epigastric artery (and avoid the liver and spleen) during paracentesis, point of puncture should be at least 8 cm from the midline and 5 cm above the symphysis(figure 4). All ascitic fluid should be drained to dryness in a single session as rapidly as possible over 1–4 hours assisted by gentle mobilisation of the cannula or turning the patient onto their side, if necessary. After the paracentesis, the patient should lie on the opposite side for 2 hours if there is leakage of any remaining ascitic fluid, and/or a suture (ideally purse-string) inserted around the site of drainage. These steps help to minimise the risk of ascitic fluid leakage.

### Abdominal paracentesis… [^113MXKL3]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Zeller JL, Burke AE, Glass RM. Abdominal Paracentesis. JAMA. 2008; 299:

1216. doi: 10.1001/jama.299.10.1216 Ascites is an abnormal increase in fluid within the peritoneal cavity. is the most common cause of ascites. Other causes of ascites include cancer, heart failure, kidney failure, tuberculosis, and pancreatic disease. An abdominal paracentesis involves the surgical puncture of the abdominal cavity with a needle and placement of a catheter line for the removal of excess fluid. The procedure can be diagnostic in helping identify the cause of ascites or may be used as a therapeutic measure if a large volume of fluid can be removed to lessen discomfort and improve breathing. The March 12. 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about paracentesis techniques. It identifies ways to decrease the risk of complications and to improve diagnostic accuracy.

Patients with new-onset ascites Patients with chronic ascites and at least one of the following symptoms: Fever Abdominal pain Increasing ascites volume — increasing abdominal girth. Unexplained encephalopathy Declining liver function Kidney failure With current techniques, diagnostic paracentesis is considered a safe procedure. Some coagulopathies may make the procedure too risky to perform. Pregnancy, organomegaly, severe bowel or bladder distention, and previous abdominal-pelvic surgery may increase the risk of the procedure. In those situations, an ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be considered. Procedural complications are rare but can include.

Persistent leakage of ascitic fluid Circulatory problems, such as lowered blood pressure Localized infection at the puncture site Abdominal wall blood clots or bruises Bleeding Injury to organs in the abdomen Tests of the removed fluid help to establish the cause of the ascites and to rule out infection. These tests include counts of the numbers and types of cells in the fluid. Testing for albumin should be done in cases of new ascites. Additional tests may be done depending on the patient's history and physical examination.

### The untapped potential of ascites in ovarian cancer research and treatment [^111hBTmD]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

A challenge to be overcome when considering further work with this sample type is the variable capturing of ascites in tumour biobanks and clinical databases. Ascites and its contents are not routinely stored for downstream analysis in biorepositories, and volumes are often inconsistently recorded. As such, the possibility of retrospective or large-scale analysis of ascites samples is, at this stage, limited. However, an increased awareness of the potential of this substrate for research might encourage more comprehensive documentation and cataloguing of this valuable sample, which will serve to enhance research possibilities as they advance. Another challenge when working with ascites is that sample transfer to researchers might be prone to delay, as the samples are retrieved secondary to a patient's therapeutic paracentesis. As such, it is crucial to consider how the integrity of the samples is affected by time, to ensure that valid research can be performed. A standardised protocol for handling this unique biospecimen is warranted. Meeting these challenges will allow us to harness the full potential of this ascites and might provide the key for improving outcomes for this devastating disease.

### Feasibility of sonographic localization of the inferior epigastric artery before ultrasound-guided paracentesis [^1132Y9so]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasound-guided paracentesis is commonly performed in the emergency department (ED) setting. Injury to the inferior epigastric artery (IEA) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of paracentesis. Use of anatomic landmarks has been recommended to avoid this structure. If feasible, sonographic localization of the IEA before ultrasound-guided paracentesis may provide the operator with anatomic mapping of this vascular structure.

Case Reports

We present 5 cases demonstrating the feasibility of identifying the IEA in ED patients with ascites. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Sonographic localization of the IEA before ultrasound-guided paracentesis may provide a more reliable means of avoiding iatrogenic injury to this vessel. Further study is warranted to determine whether routine IEA visualization before paracentesis results in a decreased complication rate.

The management of recurrent, symptomatic malignant ascites can be problematic for physicians and patients. The most common, low-risk method is large-volume paracentesis. Patient disease progression often leads to rapid reaccumulation of ascites, which requires frequent return visits to the hospital for symptom management. Other techniques have been developed to achieve palliation of symptoms, including tunneled external drainage catheters, peritoneal ports, and peritoneovenous

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

Peritoneal fluid — Evaluation for free or loculated peritoneal fluid should include documentation of the extent and location of any fluid identified, and assessment for ascites should include limited images of the pelvis as well as both lower quadrants/paracolic gutters; fluid localization for subsequent paracentesis can be performed by identifying an appropriate location. In the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, the objective of the abdominal portion is to screen the abdomen for free fluid, and longitudinal and transverse plane images should be obtained in the right upper quadrant through the area of the liver, left upper quadrant through the area of the spleen, along the bilateral paracolic gutters, and within the pelvis to assess for free fluid; analysis through a fluid-filled bladder (which may be filled through a catheter, when necessary) may help in evaluating the deep pelvis.

### A modified iris suture technique for in-the-bag intraocular lens dislocation [^1143ZVNK]. Retina (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 2.
Standard 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy is performed. A limbal paracentesis allows the anterior chamber to shallow, and flow from the infusion elevates the IOL. The vitrector or endolight pipe is used to stabilize the IOL behind the iris.

Fig. 3.
A. Cross-sectional illustration of sutures passing through the peripheral cornea and iris, capturing the IOL–capsular bag complex at the haptic–optic junction before exiting the peripheral cornea. Suture ends are tied by pulling both ends out through a limbal paracentesis incision with a hook. B. A photograph of a centered IOL after iris suture fixation. The sutures are apparent from 10 to 1 o'clock and 4 to 6 o'clock along the anterior iris.

Once the suture is passed, both ends are gently pulled to check for movement of the IOL, ensuring proper suture placement. The suture ends are then tied by pulling both ends out through a subsequent limbal paracentesis incision with a hook. Once the sutures are placed around both haptics, one may assess the stability of the lens by placing gentle downward pressure on it (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which demonstrates this surgical technique). Pars plana vitrectomy is then completed to ensure the absence of vitreous adhesion to the sutured lens, and to remove any potentially displaced cortical fragments or hemorrhage that can occur during the suturing steps. An iridectomy is created with the vitrectomy cutter, and any residual visoelastic is removed. Miosis is not required for optic capture because the IOL is within the capsular bag.

### Recommendations on the use of ultrasound guidance for adult abdominal paracentesis: a position statement of the Society of Hospital Medicine [^116ghThQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used for paracentesis to reduce the risk of serious complications, the most common being bleeding. 2. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used to avoid attempting paracentesis in patients with an insufficient volume of intraperitoneal free fluid to drain. 3. We recommend that ultrasound guidance should be used with paracentesis to improve the success rates of the overall procedure. 4. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to assess the volume and location of intraperitoneal free fluid to guide clinical decision making of where paracentesis can be safely performed. 5. We recommend that ultrasound should be used to identify a needle insertion site based on size of the fluid collection, thickness of the abdominal wall, and proximity to abdominal organs. 6. We recommend that the needle insertion site should be evaluated using color flow Doppler ultrasound to identify and avoid abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 7. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be evaluated in multiple planes to ensure clearance from underlying abdominal organs and detect any abdominal wall blood vessels along the anticipated needle trajectory. 8. We recommend that a needle insertion site should be marked with ultrasound immediately before performing the procedure, and the patient should remain in the same position between marking the site and performing the procedure. 9. We recommend that using real-time ultrasound guidance for paracentesis should be considered when the fluid collection is small or difficult to access. 10. We recommend that dedicated training sessions, including didactics, supervised practice on patients, and simulation-based practice, should be used to teach novices how to perform ultrasound-guided paracentesis. 11. We recommend that simulation-based practice should be used, when available, to facilitate acquisition of the required knowledge and skills to perform ultrasoundguided paracentesis. 12. We recommend that competence in performing ultrasound-guided paracentesis should be demonstrated prior to independently performing the procedure on patients.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

CONCLUSION

Bedside paracentesis still remains a relatively low‐risk procedure when utilizing ultrasound. However, when complications do occur, it is often associated with high morbidity. We found that post‐paracentesis AKI risk is not affected by the volume of ascites removed, but it is heightened in patients with higher MELD‐Na scores and when performed in patients already experiencing clinical deterioration. Additionally, the risk of hemorrhagic complications remained low in our cohort, but interestingly higher rates were seen in patients with elevated AST levels and those that had larger pockets of ascites pre‐procedure and larger volumes removed.

### Anterior chamber paracentesis after central retinal artery occlusion: a tenable therapy? [^112KSBLf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an ophthalmological emergency caused by closure of the central retinal artery by a thrombus or embolus. Clinically, the patient notices a sudden and painless unilateral loss of vision. Even if there is only a short closure of the central retinal artery, CRAO leads to permanent ischaemic damage of the retina. Therapy approaches described in the medical literature include systemic anticoagulation, systemic venous thrombolysis, catheter-guided intra-arterial fibrinolysis, ocular massage and reduction of intraocular pressure.

Despite the numerous therapeutic approaches there is no effective therapy to date that restores function of the retina to a satisfying extent. Reduction of intraocular pressure to improve intraocular blood flow is frequently discussed as a possible treatment option. Approaches toward lowering intraocular pressure include administration of systemic and local medications, ocular massage, and paracentesis.

Several studies have shown that the retina only has a very short tolerance for ischaemia, which was determined to be 105 minutes in animal experiments. If ischaemic conditions persist longer than this period, permanent retinal damage seems inevitable. Since the extent of retinal damage is a function of the duration of ischaemia, it is important that a countermeasure against CRAO be effective quickly and available at any time.

Paracentesis leads to a rapid reduction of intraocular pressure, and therefore is believed to promote retinal perfusion, especially in the first hours after CRAO. Advantages of paracentesis are that the implementation is quick and involves low costs and few resources. On the other hand, paracentesis poses a considerable risk of infection.

Most studies regarding the medical benefit of paracentesis examined only whether there is a gain in visual acuity for patients with CRAO after paracentesis, but did not consider the time between first symptoms and the initiation of therapy. In the present study we investigated whether paracentesis improves visual acuity after CRAO depending on the time between first symptoms of CRAO and the implementation of paracentesis. Furthermore, we analysed the predictive value that frequent risk factors for CRAO might have. These risk factors include arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, atherosclerosis, afflictions of the carotid arteries, cardiac arrhythmias, and diabetes mellitus. Overall, this study aims to address the question of whether the benefits of paracentesis justify the associated risks.

### Paracentesis is associated with reduced mortality in patients hospitalized with cirrhosis and ascites [^111aXzxq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis who are admitted to the hospital for ascites or encephalopathy. However, it is not known whether clinicians in the United States adhere to this recommendation; a relationship between paracentesis and clinical outcome has not been reported. We analyzed a U.S. database to determine the frequency of paracentesis and its association with mortality.

Methods

The 2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (which contains data from approximately 8 million hospital discharges each year) was used to identify patients with cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted with a primary diagnosis of ascites or encephalopathy. In-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges were compared for those who did and did not undergo paracentesis. Outcomes were compared for those who received an early paracentesis (within 1 day of admission) and those who received one later.

Results

Of 17,711 eligible admissions, only 61% underwent paracentesis. In-hospital mortality was reduced by 24% among patients who underwent paracentesis (6.5% vs 8.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.74). Most paracenteses (66%) occurred ≤ 1 day after admission. In-hospital mortality was lower among patients who received early paracentesis than those who received it later (5.7% vs 8.1%, P = 0.049), although this difference was not significant after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–2.02). Among patients who underwent paracentesis, the mean hospital stay was 14% longer and hospital charges were 29% greater than for patients who did not receive the procedure.

Conclusions

Paracentesis is underused for patients admitted to the hospital with ascites; the procedure is associated with increased short-term survival. These data support practice guidelines derived from expert opinion. Studies are needed to identify barriers to guideline adherence.

### Risk of procedural hemorrhage [^113Uz1HV]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who are critically ill and hospitalized often require invasive procedures as a part of their medical care. Each procedure carries a unique set of risks and associated complications, but common to all of them is the risk of hemorrhage. Central venous catheterization, arterial catheterization, paracentesis, thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, and lumbar puncture constitute a majority of the procedures performed in patients who are hospitalized. In this article, the authors will discuss the risk factors for bleeding complications from each of these procedures and methods to minimize risk. Physicians often correct coagulopathy prior to procedures to decrease bleeding risk, but there is minimal evidence to support this practice.

### Anterior chamber paracentesis after central retinal artery occlusion: a tenable therapy? [^112Rp772]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with CRAO treated between 2000 and 2012 with standard in-patient therapy with or without paracentesis. All patients received the same conservative therapy and the group of patients with paracentesis received additionally a paracentesis that was conducted in addition to the conservative treatment after the diagnosis was found. Diagnosis was based on funduscopic evaluation by the treating ophthalmologist and positive identification of typical CRAO characteristics such as a cherry-red spot in the macula and a reduction in arterial blood flow (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Typical central retinal artery occlusion with cherry-red spot, retinal oedema and narrowing of the vessels.

Arteritic aetiology was excluded by the absence of elevated inflammatory parameters and verification of the typical clinical presentation of CRAO. In the present study we only included patients with non-arteritic CRAO with thromboembolic origin. Arteritic, transient ischaemia and CRAO with a preserved cilioretinal vessel were excluded. Additionally, the time between first symptoms and implementation of the paracentesis had to be traceable. All patients were treated in an in-patient setting. Standard treatment consisted of routine anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin adjusted to patient body weight twice daily, bloodletting for hematocrit ≥ 40%, and paracentesis in certain cases.

Paracentesis included local anaesthesia with proxymetacaine hydrochloride, application of prophylactic antibiotic eye drops, and a brief puncture of the cornea with a paracentesis blade to drain a few drops of aqueous fluid. Successful execution was verified with an applanatory intraocular pressure measurement that had to be under 5 mmHg. In case of contraindications or a decline by the patient, paracentesis was waived.

Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured at the beginning of treatment and after 3 days. In addition, we recorded current medication, demographic data, the onset of initial CRAO symptoms, and the time of paracentesis. Furthermore, an analysis of cardiovascular risk factors was performed and the test results were documented. In particular, blood pressure was measured routinely four times during the first 24 hours. The average of these measurements was used for the statistical analysis of the blood pressure at the beginning of therapy. Finally, any complications associated with paracentesis were documented.

The data collection in this study has been performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Because of the retrospectivity of the study and complete anonymisation of patient data, ethics committee approval was not required. The data collection complied with all applicable institutional, national and international guidelines.

### Vascular ultrasonography: a novel method to reduce paracentesis related major bleeding [^115tdm9a]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Paracentesis is a core competency for hospitalists. Using ultrasound for fluid localization is standard practice and involves a low-frequency probe. Experts recommend a "2-probe technique, " which incorporates a high-frequency ultrasound probe in addition to the low-frequency probe to identify blood vessels within the intended needle path. Evidence is currently lacking to support this 2-probe technique, so we performed a pre- to postintervention study to evaluate its effect on paracentesis-related bleeding complications. From February 2010 to August 2011, procedures were performed using only low-frequency probes (preintervention group), while the 2-probe technique was used from September 2011 to February 2016 (postintervention group). A total of 5777 procedures were performed. Paracentesis-related minor bleeding was similar between groups. Major bleeding was lower in the postintervention group (3 [0.3%], n = 1000 vs 4 [0.08%], n = 4777; P = 0.07). This clinically meaningful trend suggests that using the 2-probe technique might prevent paracentesis-related major bleeding.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of small versus large volume paracentesis.

The second analysis, aimed to identify predictors of a drop in HGB after paracentesis, used similar statistical methods. Baseline characteristics were summarized, stratified by HGB drop versus no HGB drop, and tested for statistical difference between the groups using the same methods. The same multivariable backwards stepwise method to create a mixed effects regression model was used to identify significant predictors of HGB drop, however a linear regression model was used as opposed to a logistic regression model, so the outcome was defined as drop in HGB g/dl as a continuous variable. Extreme values of change in HGB (> 10 g/dL) were excluded from linear regression as outliers. Linear regression was chosen instead of logistic regression because only 117 (5.8%) of patients had a significant HGB drop to avoid biasing the results in a logistic regression. Volume of fluid removed was also added to the multivariable regression to determine its effect on HGB drop.

### Large-volume paracentesis: a fast, convenient, and safe technique [^1155xW6T]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ascites is a common complication of liver cirrhosis, malignancy, cardiac failure, pancreatitis, and tuberculosis, with cirrhosis of the liver being the most common cause. Onset of ascites in cirrhosis of the liver is associated with worsened quality of life, increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and renal failure. Management of ascites caused by cirrhosis requires sodium restriction in diet, sodium excretion with diuretics and, in refractory cases, large volume paracentesis.

Technique

We describe a simple adjustment to the standard paracentesis technique that does not require additional equipment or manpower.

Conclusion

Removing over 5 L of ascitic fluid can become a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. We describe a setup that makes this commonly performed procedure fast, convenient, and safe.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116sj21P]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

Large-volume paracentesis has been evaluated for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes in the management of ascites in cirrhotic adults. There are no published data relating to the safety, efficacy, or methods of this procedure in children. The objective of this study was to characterize the authors' initial experience with large-volume paracentesis (> 50 ml/kg of ascites) for removal of tense abdominal ascites in the pediatric population.

Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed of 21 large-volume paracentesis sessions in seven children (ages 6 months-18 years) with tense ascites that did not respond to other measures.

Results

Mean volume removed was 3,129 ± 2,966 mL (mean ± standard deviation) or 118 ± 56 ml/kg over 2.9 ± 3.7 hours by a 16-gauge intravascular catheter in 6 sessions, by an 18-gauge intravascular catheter in three sessions, and by a 15-gauge fenestrated, stainless-steel paracentesis needle in 12 sessions. Large-volume paracenteses performed with the paracentesis needle had significantly shorter duration of drainage and faster flow rates than those performed with the intravascular catheter. The only complication encountered was decreased urine output in one session.

Conclusions

Large-volume paracentesis is a safe and effective therapeutic method for managing tense abdominal ascites in children. The use of the paracentesis needle significantly improved the speed and efficiency of large-volume paracentesis compared with the intravascular catheter.

Ultrasound guidance

Use of ultrasound guidance may reduce the adverse events related to LVP. In a study involving 1297 procedures, 723 (56%) with ultrasound guidance and 574 (44%) without where the indications for paracentesis were similar between the two groups, the incidence of adverse events was lower in the ultrasound-guided procedures. In another retrospective cohort study, 0.8% of 565 patients undergoing paracentesis experienced bleeding complications. After adjustment, ultrasound guidance was associated with lower risk of bleeding complications by 68%.

Recommendations

Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate and Recommendation: strong)

### Anterior chamber paracentesis after central retinal artery occlusion: a tenable therapy? [^117LBHX3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this study was to investigate the visual outcome of acute central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) after current standard therapy with and without paracentesis. In addition, we investigated whether there was a dependence of the resulting visual acuity on the time between first symptoms and implementation of paracentesis. Finally, we analysed risk factors for CRAO.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients with CRAO who received standard in-patient therapy with and without paracentesis at the Dr. Horst Schmidt Clinics in Wiesbaden, Germany between 2000 and 2012. The primary endpoint was the change of visual acuity 3 days after the initiation of intervention.

Results

Data from 74 patients with CRAO were included in the study. Fifteen patients were treated conservatively and 59 patients received additional paracentesis. Clinically significant improvement of BCVA (logMAR ≥ 0.3) after 3 days was observed in 26.7% of patients without paracentesis, 36.4% of patients with paracentesis within 6 hours, 20% of patients with paracentesis within 7–24 hours, and 23.1% of patients with paracentesis more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. There was no significant difference in the outcome between patients with (BCVA 1.9 ± 0.31) and without paracentesis (BCVA 1.75 ± 0.32) (p = 0.9), nor among the groups with paracentesis (p = 0.8). One patient suffered a lens injury due to the paracentesis, with subsequent need for cataract surgery.

Conclusions

There was no added gain in visual acuity by performing a paracentesis, independent of the time elapsed between first symptoms and the implementation of paracentesis. In the absence of any tangible effectiveness of paracentesis and the inherent risks of paracentesis such as intraocular infection and injury, paracentesis does not appear to be warranted as a treatment of CRAO.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^111LFMS9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bedside paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure across various patient care settings. Overall, this is considered a safe procedure with a low likelihood of complication rates, estimated to be less than 2%. Given the low prevalence of complications, outcomes data from different settings is often combined to reach statistical power to detect factors contributing to adverse outcomes or complications. This could miss certain clinical factors unique to hospitalized patients.

Additionally, some outcomes data from older studies were published before current standards regarding IV albumin infusion or point‐of‐care ultrasound coalesced. Few studies investigate the experience of primary operator, which could also have an effect on procedural risk. Furthermore, outcomes data also precede the adoption of medicine procedure services (MPS).

While complication rates from paracenteses are low, it can be fatal or life‐threatening, requiring additional procedures. A systematic review noted 40% of hemorrhagic complications required a surgical (35%) or IR (65%) intervention, with mortality rates as high as 43% from paracentesis‐associated hemorrhage. Additionally, some complications can be days to a week after paracentesis in rare instances, which may lead to missed detection and underestimate true complication rates.

We aimed to evaluate complication rates and outcomes of paracentesis in patients in the inpatient setting of a large tertiary transplantation center. We included patients with decompensated cirrhosis with high MELD scores that are at a perceived higher risk of procedural complications. We also included patients with other reasons for ascites, including cardiogenic ascites, which is not captured in prior literature. Additionally, we evaluated operator outcomes data from our MPS, consisting of residents and a supervising hospitalist attending, who perform bedside procedures utilizing a standardized technique.

### Performance standards for therapeutic abdominal paracentesis [^112q425k]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Large-volume paracentesis, the preferred treatment for patients with symptomatic tense ascites due to cirrhosis, has traditionally been performed by physicians as an inpatient procedure. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether large-volume paracentesis could be performed safely and effectively by gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants and as an outpatient procedure, (2) whether the risk of bleeding was associated with either thrombocytopenia or prolongation of the prothrombin time, and (3) the resources used for large-volume paracentesis. Gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants performed 1,100 large-volume paracenteses in 628 patients, 513 of whom had cirrhosis of the liver. The preprocedure mean international normalized ratio for prothrombin time was 1.7 ± 0.46 (range, 0.9–8.7; interquartile range, 1.4–2.2), and the mean platelet count was 50.4 × 10³/µL, (range, 19 × 10³/µL - 341 × 10³/µL; interquartile range, 42–56 × 10³/µL). Performance of 3 to 7 supervised paracenteses was required before competence was achieved. There were no significant procedure-related complications, even in patients with marked thrombocytopenia or prolongation in the prothrombin time. The mean duration of large-volume paracentesis was 97 ± 24 minutes, and the mean volume of ascitic fluid removed was 8.7 ± 2.8 L. In conclusion, large-volume paracentesis can be performed safely as an outpatient procedure by trained gastrointestinal endoscopy assistants. Ten supervised paracenteses would be optimal for training the operators carrying out the procedure. The practice guideline of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases which states that routine correction of prolonged prothrombin time or thrombocytopenia is not required is appropriate when experienced personnel carry out paracentesis.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new-onset ascites

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate total protein level in ascites fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be estimated routinely. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario (table 1).

Table 1
Grouping of aetiology of ascites based on serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG)

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity and therefore, total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such a situation, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from 0% to 96.7%, in part determined by the site of the tumour. Combining cytology with tumour markers in the ascitic fluid may increase the positive predictive value (PPV), specifically the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CA 15–3 and CA 19–9. However, CA 125 in the serum or ascites has no role as a discriminator and will commonly be elevated by the presence of ascites from any cause.

### Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension? How do I perform a paracentesis and analyze the results? [^114Qadwe]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

Objectives

To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Sources

Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

Study Selection

Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of preprocedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Extraction

For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (ie, ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

Data Synthesis

Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 2 showed that obtaining preprocedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; 1 showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal punctures [P = 0.05] and termination due to poor fluid return [P = 0.02] vs a 14-gauge needle in therapeutic paracentesis; 1 showed immediate inoculation of culture bottles improves diagnostic yield vs delayed (from 77% to 100% [95% CI for the difference, 5.3%-40.0%]); 9 evaluated therapeutic paracentesis, performed with or without albumin or nonalbumin plasma expanders, and found no consistent effect on morbidity or mortality; 16 showed the accuracy of biochemical analysis of ascitic fluid in patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to increase the likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (PMN count > 250 cells/microL [summary likelihood ratio {LR}, 6.4] 95% CI, 4.6–8.8; ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 1000 cells/microL [summary LR, 9.1] 95% CI, 5.5–15.1; pH < 7.35 [summary LR, 9.0] 95% CI, 2.0–40.6; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient ≥ 0.10 [LR, 11.3] 95% CI, 4.3–29.9) and other levels lowered the likelihood (PMN count ≤ 250 cells/microL [summary LR, 0.2] 95% CI, 0.11–0.37; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient < 0.10 [summary LR, 0.12] 95% CI, 0.02–0.77); and 4 showed the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient lowers the likelihood of portal hypertension (< 1.1 g/dL [summary LR, 0.06] 95% CI, 0.02–0.20).

Conclusions

Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is more likely at predescribed parameters of ascitic PMN count or blood-ascitic fluid pH, and portal hypertension is less likely below a predescribed serum-ascites albumin gradient.

### Intravitreal injections – 2025 [^114zzQ7e]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

Intravitreal injections — technique and intra-procedural risks specify that "The needle should be inserted perpendicularly through the sclera with the tip aimed toward the center of the globe to avoid the posterior lens", and "Injections are generally performed inferotemporally or superotemporally to optimize exposure and to avoid damage to the retina and other eye structures". Iatrogenic injuries described include that "the lens capsule can become damaged during the injection and a traumatic cataract can result, requiring subsequent cataract surgery", with possible "complications during cataract surgery caused by posterior capsule rupture", as well as "The retina may also be damaged, resulting in tears or even a detachment that requires surgical repair", and "corneal abrasions and intraocular hemorrhages". During the procedure, intraocular pressure (IOP) considerations are that "IOP can increase transiently, and the ophthalmologist may need to reduce IOP", which "may require an anterior chamber paracentesis", wherein "the surgeon must insert a needle into the anterior chamber of the eye to remove fluid and reduce the pressure", and this "procedure carries many of the same risks of the first injection".

### Risk of complications after abdominal paracentesis in cirrhotic patients: a prospective study [^111KK2qW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Complications and technical problems of paracentesis in cirrhotic patients are infrequent. However, the severity and the incidence of these events and their risk factors have not been assessed prospectively.

Methods

Cirrhotic patients (n = 171) undergoing paracentesis were included. Of the 515 paracenteses, 8.8% were diagnostic, and 91.2% were therapeutic. Technical features, demographic data, and adverse events during a period of 72 hours after the procedure were examined.

Results

Major complications occurred in 1.6% of procedures and included 5 bleedings and 3 infections, resulting in death in 2 cases. Major complications were associated with therapeutic but not diagnostic procedures and tended to be more prevalent in patients with low platelet count (< 50 × 10⁹/L), Child-Pugh stage C, and in alcoholic cirrhosis patients. Technical problems occurred in 5.6%. The most frequent complication was a leak of ascites at the puncture site (5.0%), and in 89.5% there were no complications.

Conclusions

The safety of paracentesis in cirrhotic patients might be decreased if risk factors, which depend on the characteristics of the patient and of the procedure itself, are present.

### Supervising the supervisors – procedural training and supervision in internal medicine residency [^116FWEH6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

At teaching hospitals, bedside procedures (paracentesis, thoracentesis, lumbar puncture, arthrocentesis and central venous catheter insertion) are performed by junior residents and supervised by senior peers. Residents' perceptions about supervision or how often peer supervision produces unsafe clinical situations are unknown.

Objective

To examine the experience and practice patterns of residents performing bedside procedures.

Design and Participants

Cross-sectional e-mail survey of 653 internal medicine (IM) residents at seven California teaching hospitals.

Measurements

Surveys asked questions in three areas: (1) resident experience performing procedures: numbers of procedures performed and whether they received other (e.g., simulator) training; (2) resident comfort performing and supervising procedures; (3) resident reports of their current level of supervision doing procedures, experience with complications as well as perceptions of factors that may have contributed to complications.

Results

Three hundred sixty-seven (56%) of the residents responded. Most PGY1 residents had performed fewer than five of any of the procedures, but most PGY-3 residents had performed at least ten by the end of their training. Resident comfort for each procedure increased with the number of procedures performed (p < 0.001). Although residents reported that peer supervision happened often, they also reported high rates of supervising a procedure before feeling comfortable with proper technique. The majority of residents (64%) reported at least one complication and did not feel supervision would have prevented complications, even though many reported complications represented technique- or preparation-related problems.

Conclusions

Residents report low levels of comfort and experience with procedures, and frequently report supervising prior to feeling comfortable. Our findings suggest a need to examine best practices for procedural supervision of trainees.

### Modified trisection technique: one-trip explantation for foldable intraocular lens [^112o2QR7]. Retina (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We present a new technique that allows an intraocular lens to be explanted through the small incisions used in modern cataract surgery.

Methods and Results

The intraocular lens optic is cut into three connected pieces at the 1-mm-wide end with scissors. Then, with the stabilizing counterforce provided by a pair of vitreoretinal forceps through a paracentesis, the middle piece is removed first, followed by the two side pieces connected with haptics flipped over at the connected part. These two parts overlap each other when passing through the incision, eventually resulting in the explantation of the intraocular lens, as an intact piece.

Conclusion

We believe this method provides a simple and effective way to remove intraocular lens through very small incisions, which could also reduce complications and hasten patient's recovery.

### The practice and implications of finding fluid during point-of-care ultrasonography: a review [^112h38if]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is an increasingly affordable and portable technology that is an important part of 21st-century medicine. When appropriately used, POCUS has the potential to expedite diagnosis and improve procedural success and safety. POCUS is now being adopted in medical education as early as the first year of medical school. While potentially powerful and versatile, POCUS is a user-dependent technology that has not been formalized or standardized yet within internal medicine residency training programs. Physicians and residency directors are trying to determine whether to incorporate POCUS, and if so, how. In this systematic review, basic concepts and applications of POCUS are examined, as are issues surrounding training and implementation.

Observations

A key use of POCUS is to detect fluid, and this is a cornerstone of POCUS teaching. Even in inexperienced hands, POCUS has shown to be more sensitive and specific than physical examination for conditions such as ascites, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Detecting fluid requires a basic understanding of ultrasonography operation, sonographic anatomy, and probe orientation. Once fluid is localized, ultrasonographic guidance can increase success and decrease complications of common procedures such as thoracentesis or paracentesis.

Conclusions and Relevance

POCUS can augment physical examination and procedural efficacy but requires appropriate education and program setup. As POCUS continues to spread, internal medicine physicians need to clarify how they intend to use this technology. Equipment is now increasingly accessible, but programs need to determine how to allocate time and resources to training, clinical use, and quality assurance. Programs that develop robust implementation processes that establish proper scope of practice and include quality assurance that use image archival and feedback can ensure POCUS will positively impact patient care across hospital systems.

### Plasma expanders for people with cirrhosis and large ascites treated with abdominal paracentesis [^115PJ6BY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Plasma volume expanders are used in connection to paracentesis in people with cirrhosis to prevent reduction of effective plasma volume, which may trigger deleterious effect on haemodynamic balance, and increase morbidity and mortality. Albumin is considered the standard product against which no plasma expansion or other plasma expanders, e.g. other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol have been compared. However, the benefits and harms of these plasma expanders are not fully clear.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of any plasma volume expanders such as albumin, other colloids (polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch solutions, fresh frozen plasma), intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus no plasma volume expander or versus another plasma volume expander for paracentesis in people with cirrhosis and large ascites.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index until January 2019. Furthermore, we searched FDA, EMA, WHO (last search January 2019), www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and www.controlled-trials.com/ for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials, no matter their design or year of publication, publication status, and language, assessing the use of any type of plasma expander versus placebo, no intervention, or a different plasma expander in connection with paracentesis for ascites in people with cirrhosis. We considered quasi-randomised, retrieved with the searches for randomised clinical trials only, for reports on harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) using the fixed-effect model and the random-effects model meta-analyses, based on the intention-to-treat principle, whenever possible. If the fixed-effect and random-effects models showed different results, then we made our conclusions based on the analysis with the highest P value (the more conservative result). We assessed risks of bias of the individual trials using predefined bias risk domains. We assessed the certainty of the evidence at an outcome level, using GRADE, and constructed 'Summary of Findings' tables for seven of our review outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 27 randomised clinical trials for inclusion in this review (24 published as full-text articles and 3 as abstracts). Five of the trials, with 271 participants, assessed plasma expanders (albumin in four trials and ascitic fluid in one trial) versus no plasma expander. The remaining 22 trials, with 1321 participants, assessed one type of plasma expander, i.e. dextran, hydroxyethyl starch, polygeline, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus another type of plasma expander, i.e. albumin in 20 of these trials and polygeline in one trial. Twenty-five trials provided data for quantitative meta-analysis. According to the Child-Pugh classification, most participants were at an intermediate to advanced stage of liver disease in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and hepatic encephalopathy. All trials were assessed as at overall high risk of bias. Ten trials seemed not to have been funded by industry; twelve trials were considered unclear about funding; and five trials were considered funded by industry or a for-profit institution. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion on mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.06 to 4.83; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.02 to 5.88; 181 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.27; 248 participants; 4 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.40; 158 participants; 3 trials; very low certainty). Two of the trials stated that no serious adverse events occurred while the remaining trials did not report on this outcome. No trial reported data on health-related quality of life. We found no evidence of a difference in effect between experimental plasma expanders versus albumin on mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; 1014 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty); serious adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.10 to 8.30; 118 participants; 2 trials; very low certainty); renal impairment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.91; 1107 participants; 17 trials; very low certainty); other liver-related complications (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.48; 1083 participants; 16 trials; very low certainty); and non-serious adverse events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.85; 977 participants; 14 trials; very low certainty). We found no data on heath-related quality of life and refractory ascites.

Authors' Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not find any benefits or harms of plasma expanders versus no plasma expander or of one plasma expander such as polygeline, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starch, intravenous infusion of ascitic fluid, crystalloids, or mannitol versus albumin on primary or secondary outcomes. The data originated from few, small, mostly short-term trials at high risks of systematic errors (bias) and high risks of random errors (play of chance). GRADE assessments concluded that the evidence was of very low certainty. Therefore, we can neither demonstrate or discard any benefit of plasma expansion versus no plasma expansion, and differences between one plasma expander versus another plasma expander. Larger trials at low risks of bias are needed to assess the role of plasma expanders in connection with paracentesis. Such trials should be conducted according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines.

### Ultrasound-assisted paracentesis performed by emergency physicians vs the traditional technique: a prospective, randomized study [^114FqKKe]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine if emergency center ultrasound (ECUS) can be of value to emergency physicians in the evaluation of possible ascites and accompanying decisions to perform emergent paracentesis.

Methods

During a 7-month period, patients suspected of having ascites and potentially requiring paracentesis were prospectively entered into a randomized study in an urban public hospital emergency center (> 140 000 annual visits). Patients were randomized to receive paracentesis using the traditional or the bedside ECUS-assisted technique. Indications for paracentesis included known liver disease and obvious ascites as well as suspected ascites or suspected subacute bacterial peritonitis. Participating physicians had received a minimum of 1 hour of formal didactic ultrasound training that included gallbladder, renal, vascular, and bladder studies as well as the focused abdominal sonography for trauma examination for trauma and the detection of ascites. A portable Terason 2000 laptop ultrasound machine with a 5-MHz probe was used to scan the patients. Data collected included the patients' characteristics, estimation of ascitic fluid volume, number of attempts made to obtain fluid, speed of paracentesis, and the operator's overall evaluation of the ECUS-assisted technique, if used.

Results

Of 100 enrolled patients, 56 received the ECUS-assisted technique. Of 42 patients with ascites, 40 (95%) were successfully aspirated and 14 (25%) did not receive paracentesis because no ascites or insignificant amount of ascites was visualized. One patient was noted to have a large cystic mass in the left lower quadrant and another patient had a ventral hernia. Of the 44 patients randomized to the traditional technique, 27 (61%) were successfully aspirated. In 17 (39%) of these patients, fluid could not be obtained using traditional methods. Of these 17 failed attempts by traditional methods, 15 patients received ECUS in a "break" from the study protocol. Ascitic fluid was obtained in 13 of these 15 patients; of the 2 remaining patients, 1 did not have enough fluid to be sampled and the other had no fluid visualized.

Conclusion

Ninety-five percent (P = 0.0003) of the patients who were randomized in the ECUS group and in whom a needle paracentesis was performed had ascitic fluid successfully obtained, as compared with the traditional method group.

### Daily low-volume paracentesis and clinical complications in patients with refractory ascites [^116pU2DZ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis is the result of chronic liver disease and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cirrhosis can be further divided into different stages according to the presence or absence of clinical significant portal hypertension and the occurrence of complications, such as variceal bleeding or ascites. Development of refractory ascites (RA) is a hallmark in end-stage liver cirrhosis, and treatment options are limited. When liver transplantation is not available, implantation of a transjugular-intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) remains the therapy of choice. Unfortunately, there can be contraindications, such as recurrent hepatic encephalopathy or heart failure, that prohibit TIPS implantation in some patients. To date, repeated large-volume paracentesis (LVP) with albumin infusion is widely considered as standard of care (SOC) in this population that can be difficult to treat, but it is time-consuming, often poorly accepted by patients, and linked to an ongoing risk of paracentesis-associated complications, such as bleeding or infections.

Recently, different devices like the Alfapump or tunneled-intraperitoneal catheters (PeCa) have been introduced to enable a home-based treatment for patients with RA. Studies showed that these devices decrease the need for paracentesis and can even improve quality of life. However, other studies report a higher incidence of adverse events, such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or hyponatremia. Hence, rehospitalization rates were increased compared with SOC. Besides presence of a device in the peritoneal cavity, daily low-volume taps without albumin substitution is the most eminent difference in contrast to patients receiving SOC. Prior studies, demonstrated that LVP without albumin substitution leads to AKI or hyponatremia. However, if this is the case in those undergoing low-volume paracentesis (ie, less than 5 L per drain) remains a matter of debate.,

Importantly, patients using devices to perform daily low-volume drainage pose a completely new entity of patients with end-stage cirrhosis, and data about modifiable factors on the clinical course of this group are scarce. Previous studies documented large differences regarding the volume of ascites removed per day in patients with devices, ranging from 0.5 L/d to 2.5 L/d in some cases. Hence, the total volume drained over time differs drastically. It is currently unknown if this is associated with a different clinical course. This study investigated the association between daily low-volume drainage and clinical complications in patients with liver cirrhosis and RA with a particular focus on the amount of ascites removed per day.

### Early diagnostic paracentesis improves outcomes of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mQfR9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic paracentesis is recommended for patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital, but adherence is suboptimal with unclear impact on clinical outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the outcomes of early vs delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies comparing early vs delayed diagnostic paracentesis among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and mean difference with confidence intervals (CIs) for proportional and continuous variables were calculated using the random-effects model. Early diagnostic paracentesis was defined as receiving diagnostic paracentesis within 12–24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, acute kidney injury, and 30-day readmission.

Results

Seven studies (n = 78,744) (n = 45,533 early vs n = 33,211 delayed diagnostic paracentesis) were included. Early diagnostic paracentesis was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82, P = 0.001), length of hospital stay (mean difference -4.85 days; 95% CI -6.45 to -3.20; P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42–0.92, P = 0.02) compared with delayed diagnostic paracentesis, with similar 30-day readmission (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52–2.39, P = 0.79). Subgroup analysis revealed consistent results for in-hospital mortality whether early diagnostic paracentesis performed within 12 hours (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32–0.79, P = 0.003, I² = 0%) or within 24 hours of admission (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45–0.98, P = 0.04, I² = 82%). Notably, the mortality OR was numerically lower when diagnostic paracentesis was performed within 12 hours, and the results were precise and homogenous (I² = 0%).

Discussion

Findings from this meta-analysis suggest that early diagnostic paracentesis is associated with better patient outcomes. Early diagnostic paracentesis within 12 hours of admission may be associated with the greatest mortality benefit. Data from large-scale randomized trials are needed to validate our findings, especially if there is a greater mortality benefit for early diagnostic paracentesis within 12 hours.

### Does point-of-care ultrasound change the needle insertion location during routine bedside paracentesis? [^1148k3o4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Paracentesis is a bedside procedure to obtain ascitic fluid from the peritoneum. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) improves the safety of some medical procedures. However, the evidence supporting its utility in paracentesis is limited.

Objective

We aimed to assess if POCUS would yield a user-preferred site for needle insertion compared to conventional landmarking, defined as a ≥ 5 cm change in location.

Design

This was a prospective non-randomized trial comparing a POCUS-guided site to the conventional anatomic site in the same patient.

Participants

Adult patients at Kingston Health Sciences Centre undergoing paracentesis were included.

Interventions

Physicians landmarked using conventional technique and compared this to a POCUS-guided site. The paracentesis was performed at whatever site was deemed optimal, if safe to do so.

Main Measures

Data collected included the distance from the two sites, depth of fluid pockets, and anatomic considerations.

Key Results

Forty-five procedures were performed among 30 patients and by 24 physicians, who were primarily in their PGY 1 and 2 years of training (33% and 31% respectively). Patients' ascites was mostly due to cirrhosis (84%) predominantly due to alcohol (47%) and NAFLD (34%). Users preferred the POCUS-guided site which resulted in a change in needle insertion ≥ 5 cm from the conventional anatomic site in 69% of cases. The average depth of fluid was greater at the POCUS site vs. the anatomic site (5.4 ± 2.8 cm vs. 3.0 ± 2.5 cm, p < 0.005). POCUS deflected the needle insertion site superiorly and laterally to the anatomic site. The POCUS site was chosen (1) to avoid adjacent organs, (2) to optimize the fluid pocket, and (3) due to abdominal wall considerations, such as pannus. Six cases landmarked anatomically were aborted when POCUS revealed inadequate ascites.

Conclusions

POCUS changes the needle insertion site from the conventional anatomic site for most procedures, due to optimizing the fluid pocket and safety concerns, and helped avoid cases where an unsafe volume of ascites was present.

### Paracentesis outcomes from a medicine procedure service at a tertiary care transplant center [^112pUAGs]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure with overall low complication rates. There is a paucity of modern data investigating outcomes for inpatients using standardized point of care ultrasound.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate complication rates and outcomes of paracentesis in patients in the inpatient setting of a large tertiary transplantation center.

Methods

We identified patients with ascites of multiple etiologies undergoing paracentesis by a medicine procedure service at a university center. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify clinical and demographic factors associated with kidney injury (AKI) or significant HGB drop (≥ 2 g/dL).

Results

Of 1746 patients, 12% of patients receiving small volume (≤ 5 L) and 10% receiving large volume paracentesis (> 5 L) developed a post procedural AKI (OR 0.857, 95% CI: 0.633–1.154) with no significant difference between groups (p = .30). In multivariable analysis, Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD‐Na) score as a continuous variable had a more significant impact in the development of AKI (OR 1.15 CI 1.08–1.22, p < .001) as well as patients who were noted to be receiving paracentesis due to clinical deterioration (OR 2.48 CI 1.08–5.7, p < .03). Of 2034 patients, 94% of patients had no significant drop in hemoglobin (< 2 g/dL). There was no significant difference in BMI (12.73 vs. 16.68, p = .6), INR (1.6 vs. 1.6, p = .8), or platelet count (114 vs. 106, p > .9) between groups.

Conclusion

Regardless of volume of ascites removed, paracentesis is associated with a low risk of AKI, however there was an increased risk in the clinically decompensating patient. The bleeding risk was also found to be low when performed by experienced proceduralists on a procedure service.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^1137WuCd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis

Paracentesis is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic ascites and has a therapeutic effect on patients. The diagnostic criteria for pancreatic ascites include an amylase concentration > 1000 mg/dL, a protein level of > 3 g/dL, and a serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) < 1.1 g/dL. First proposed by Dr. John C. Hoefs in 1981, SAAG can help clinicians determine whether ascites is due to portal hypertension or to other causes. The SAAG is calculated by subtracting the ascitic albumin concentration from the serum concentration. SAAG > 1.1 g/dL is transudative in nature and indicates portal hypertension etiology, which may include cirrhosis, heart failure, portal vein occlusion, Budd-Chiari syndrome and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. In contrast, an SAAG < 1.1 g/dL is considered exudative, insidious, and often due to peritoneal disease. Common causes include infectious peritonitis, chylous ascites, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome and pancreatic ascites. However, SAAG < 1.1 g/dL alone is not diagnostic for either condition.

Similarly to amylase and albumin levels, lipase enzyme level tends to be elevated in pancreatic ascites. Lactate dehydrogenase is typically elevated in pancreatic ascites; however, it can also be elevated in malignant ascites and tuberculous peritonitis. Tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 125 help rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignancy. Fluid cytology and culture are usually negative in pancreatic ascites, particularly in the absence of abscesses or infected pseudocysts. Pancreatic ascites is typically straw-colored in appearance, although isolated cases of black or bloody ascites have also been reported.
