## Question

What is the recommended duration of treatment with otic ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of treatment with otic ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence from randomized trials and regulatory labeling. Then, I should verify guideline recommendations and how they align with trial designs. Next, I will check for any exceptions or modifiers such as tympanic membrane status, severity, or age. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats for reassessment if symptoms persist.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory labeling, because that anchors standard dosing. Multiple FDA labels consistently specify ciprofloxacin otic solution 0.2% or ciprofloxacin 0.3% with dexamethasone 0.1% as 4 drops into the affected ear twice daily for 7 days, with instructions to warm the bottle, position the ear upward, and maintain position for about 60 seconds to facilitate penetration, which directly answers the duration question as 7 days [^b06a1bf8] [^cb9fffef] [^4b1146b9].

> Wait, let me verify that this 7-day regimen is supported by clinical trials and not just labeling language. In a phase 3 randomized trial of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone versus comparators, all treatment arms used twice-daily therapy for 7 days, with end-of-treatment assessments around days 8–10 and test-of-cure around days 15–17, which operationalizes a 7-day treatment course in practice [^020ef296] [^aa717de0]. Similarly, pooled randomized trials comparing ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone to neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone used 7-day courses and showed high cure rates, reinforcing that 7 days is effective in typical AOE presentations [^420be4bb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether guidelines endorse this duration. The AAO-HNSF guideline emphasizes topical therapy as first-line for uncomplicated diffuse AOE and advises reassessment at 48–72 hours if not improving, but it intentionally does not specify a precise duration, reflecting heterogeneity in trials and practice; however, it notes that most patients improve within 48–72 hours and many are symptom-free by about 7 days, which aligns with using a 7-day course in routine cases [^fa106e16] [^8bc30361]. A rapid evidence review for primary care likewise states that topical treatment is usually 7–10 days, again supporting 7 days as within the evidence-based range [^27e2548e].

> I need to check for modifiers that could extend therapy. If symptoms persist beyond a week, extending drops for up to an additional 7 days (total 10–14 days) is reasonable in some cases, but persistent symptoms beyond 2 weeks warrant reassessment for obstruction, adherence, misdiagnosis, or resistant organisms rather than simply prolonging drops indefinitely [^2086b726] [^ea24514f]. But wait, what if the tympanic membrane is perforated or there is a tympanostomy tube? In that scenario, I should confirm that only non-ototoxic preparations are used, and quinolone drops are preferred; the duration still generally follows the 7-day framework, with careful follow-up if symptoms persist [^7cd32554] [^e999f581].

> Let me consider age, because I initially thought pediatric patients might need longer courses. Hmm, wait a minute, that would conflate AOE with acute otitis media; AOE treatment duration is not age-stratified like AOM, and the same 7-day topical ciprofloxacin regimens are used in children 6 months and older per FDA labeling, so pediatric patients generally receive the same 7-day course unless clinical factors dictate otherwise [^b06a1bf8] [^cb9fffef].

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any competing 10-day regimens. Some older or non-quinolone topical protocols used 10 days, and a few studies explored 10-day ofloxacin regimens, but contemporary ciprofloxacin otic formulations and pivotal trials consistently use 7 days, and comparative data do not show superiority of longer quinolone courses for AOE, so extending beyond 7 days should be reserved for selected nonresponders rather than routine use [^2086b726] [^0045658b] [^020ef296].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. The recommended duration of otic ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa is 7 days at standard twice-daily dosing, with reassessment at 48–72 hours if not improving and consideration of extending therapy to a total of 10–14 days only if symptoms persist and the diagnosis is confirmed, with attention to canal obstruction, adherence, and tympanic membrane status [^b06a1bf8] [^cb9fffef] [^fa106e16] [^2086b726].

---

The recommended duration of otic ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa is **7 days** [^b06a1bf8] of twice-daily dosing (4 drops per dose) [^cb9fffef]. This regimen is supported by FDA labeling [^b06a1bf8] and clinical trials showing high cure rates and favorable safety profiles [^0431479b] [^020ef296]. If symptoms persist beyond 7 days, **extend therapy to 10 days** [^2086b726] if clinically indicated, and reassess if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^8bc30361].

---

## Recommended duration of otic ciprofloxacin treatment

- **Standard duration**: 7 days of twice-daily dosing (4 drops per dose) [^b06a1bf8] [^cb9fffef].
- **Extension**: If symptoms persist, extend to 10 days [^2086b726] if clinically indicated.
- **Reassessment**: If no improvement within 48–72 hours, reassess the diagnosis, adherence, and delivery method [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 7-day duration

- **FDA approval**: Based on randomized trials showing high clinical cure rates with 7 days of ciprofloxacin otic [^0431479b] [^e25fd12f].
- **Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone trials**: 7-day BID regimens achieved 87–94% cure vs 84–89% with neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone [^0431479b].
- **Ciprofloxacin/fluocinolone trial**: 7-day BID therapy was effective and safe, with faster pain resolution than monotherapy [^020ef296] [^3d18c8f4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) recommend topical therapy as first-line treatment for uncomplicated AOE [^fa106e16], with a **typical duration of 7–10 days** [^27e2548e]. They also advise reassessment if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a].

---

## Factors influencing treatment duration

Several factors may influence the **duration of otic ciprofloxacin treatment**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** |
|-|-|
| Severity of infection | More severe cases may require 10 days [^notfound] |
| Patient adherence | Poor adherence may necessitate longer treatment or alternative strategies [^b337486a] |
| Presence of comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, immunocompromise) | May require longer treatment or additional interventions [^notfound] |
| Tympanic membrane perforation or tympanostomy tubes | Non-ototoxic preparations (e.g. fluoroquinolones) are preferred; duration remains 7–10 days [^7cd32554] [^27e2548e] |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different treatment durations

Clinical trials show that **7-day ciprofloxacin otic achieves high cure rates** (approximately 70–94%) [^0431479b] and rapid symptom resolution [^3d18c8f4]. Extending therapy to 10 days may benefit persistent cases, but evidence is limited and extension should be individualized [^2086b726].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Otic ciprofloxacin is **generally well tolerated**; adverse effects are usually mild and include local irritation, pruritus, and discomfort [^e3f637be]. Prolonged use (> 10 days) may increase the risk of secondary fungal infections or antibiotic resistance, so therapy should be limited to the shortest effective course [^1e9c0ecf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 7 days of twice-daily ciprofloxacin otic (4 drops per dose) [^b06a1bf8] [^cb9fffef].
- **Extension**: Extend to 10 days if symptoms persist and clinically indicated [^2086b726].
- **Reassessment**: Reassess if no improvement within 48–72 hours [^8bc30361] [^7013c02a].
- **Individualization**: Tailor duration to severity, adherence, and comorbidities [^8bde4d29].

---

The recommended duration of otic ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa is **7 days** [^b06a1bf8], with extension to 10 days if needed and reassessment if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^8bc30361].

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^020ef296]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution seems to be efficacious and safe in treating acute otitis externa (AOE) compared with ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone.

Objective

To evaluate the superiority of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution compared with ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in treating AOE.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted between August 1, 2017, and September 14, 2018, at 36 centers in the US. The study population comprised 493 patients aged 6 months or older with AOE of less than 21 days' duration with otorrhea, moderate or severe otalgia, and edema, as well as a Brighton grading of II or III (tympanic membrane obscure but without systemic illness). Statistical analysis was performed from November 14, 2018, to February 14, 2019.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin, or fluocinolone twice daily for 7 days and were evaluated on day 1 (visit 1; baseline), days 3 to 4 (visit 2; conducted via telephone), days 8 to 10 (visit 3; end of treatment), and days 15 to 17 (visit 4; test of cure).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was therapeutic cure (clinical and microbiological) at the end of the treatment period. The principal secondary end point was the time to end of ear pain. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the microbiological intent-to-treat population, clinical intent-to-treat population, and microbiological intent-to-treat population with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

Results

A total of 493 patients (254 female patients [51.5%]; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [23.1] years) were randomized (197 to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, 196 to receive ciprofloxacin, and 100 to receive fluocinolone). Therapeutic cure in the modified intent-to-treat population with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (63 of 103 [61.2%]) was statistically comparable to that of ciprofloxacin (49 of 91 [53.8%]; difference in response rate, 7.3%; 95% CI, -6.6% to 21.2%; P = 0.30) and fluocinolone (20 of 45 [44.4%]; difference in response rate, 16.7%; 95% CI, -0.6% to 34.0%; P = 0.06) at visit 3 and significantly superior to ciprofloxacin at visit 4 (90 of 103 [87.4%] vs 69 of 91 [75.8%]; difference in response rate, 11.6%; 95% CI, 0.7%-22.4%; P = 0.04). A statistically faster resolution of otalgia was achieved among patients treated with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (median, 5.0 days [range, 4.2–6.3 days]) vs ciprofloxacin (median, 5.9 days [range, 4.3–7.3 days]; 95% CI, 4.3–7.3 days; P = 0.002) or fluocinolone (median, 7.7 days [range, 6.7–9.0 days]; 95% CI, 6.7–9.0 days; P < .001). Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone demonstrated statistical superiority in sustained microbiological response vs ciprofloxacin (94 of 103 [91.3%] vs 74 of 91 [81.3%]; difference in response rate, 9.9%; 95% CI, 0.3%-19.6%; P = 0.04) and fluocinolone (34 of 45 [75.6%]; difference in response rate, 15.7%; 95% CI, 2.0%-29.4%; P = 0.01) and in the microbiological outcome vs fluocinolone by visit 3 (99 of 103 [96.1%] vs 37 of 45 [82.2%]; difference in response rate, 13.9%; 95% CI, 2.1%-25.7%; P = 0.01) and ciprofloxacin by visit 4 (97 of 103 [94.2%] vs 77 of 91 [84.6%]; difference in response rate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 0.9%-18.2%; P = 0.02). Fifteen adverse events related to study medications were registered, all of which were mild or moderate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^e46b04c4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — topical therapy efficacy and bacteriologic outcomes — shows high clinical resolution across agents, as about 65% to 90% of patients had clinical resolution within 7 to 10 days, while a network meta-analysis reported superior clinical cure for topical quinolones versus antibiotic-steroid combinations (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06–1.57) but the superiority of quinolones was no longer significant in the direct comparisons. For bacteriologic endpoints, nonquinolone therapy achieved 87% cure with an 8% absolute increase when a quinolone antibiotic is used, and the clinical significance of this modest effect (NNT of 12 patients) is noted; another meta-analysis reported higher bacteriologic cure with quinolones (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02).

Acute otitis media (AOM) duration of therapy by age and severity: The optimal duration is uncertain, but for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course appears equally effective in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild or moderate AOM, and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms, a 5- to 7-day course is adequate treatment.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In a randomized, multi-center, evaluator-blinded study of patients with acute otitis externa, patients were treated with either ciprofloxacin otic solution, 0.2% twice daily or neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and hydrocortisone otic solution (PNH) three times daily for 7 days.

In the per protocol population, clinical cure was achieved at the end of a 7-day treatment in 70% (173/247) for the ciprofloxacin otic solution, 0.2% treated group versus 60% (147/243) for the control treated group.

### Pooled analysis of two clinical trials comparing the clinical outcomes of topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone otic suspension and polymyxin B / neomycin / hydrocortisone otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa in adults and children [^420be4bb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcome of patients receiving topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (CD) otic suspension with that of those receiving polymyxin B/neomycin/ hydrocortisone (PNH) otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Methods

Data from 2 institutional review board-approved, multicenter, observer-masked, parallel-group, randomized, noninferiority clinical trials conducted at 76 institutions across the United States between April 1998 and July 1999 were pooled together for this analysis. Patients ≥ 1 year of age diagnosed with AOE were considered for inclusion in the studies. Patients with AOE > 4 weeks' duration, a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic suppurative otitis media, or use of either antibiotics or steroids within the previous 7 days were excluded from the studies. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CD or PNH for 7 days. CD was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients ≥ 12 years of age BID. PNH was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients ≥ 12 years of age TID. The clinical investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. Due to the different dosing regimens, patients were not blinded, but they also were not directly informed of their treatment assignments. Otic inflammation, tenderness, edema, and discharge were clinically assessed on days 3, 8, and 18 of the studies. Otic inflammation and edema were evaluated using a 4-point scale (none = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3). Otic tenderness and discharge were rated on a binomial scale (absent = 0 and present = 1). The clinical assessments were aggregated into a 9-point composite clinical scale (range, 0–8) to compare baseline severity between groups. For the final outcomes assessment in this study, the aggregated clinical scores were dichotomized into cured (0) versus noncured (> 0) and analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier survival technique. A log-rank test was used to compare the cure curves between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier summary statistics provide the mean and median times to cure, and the mean times to cure for the 25th and 75th patient quartiles. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring patients for adverse events at each visit.

Results

Data from 1072 patients (1242 ears) were included in the analysis (CD, 537 patients; PNH, 535 patients). Baseline AOE severity and demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The mean patient age was 21.7 and 22.0 years in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. Both groups were similar with respect to sex, with 50.7% and 53.5% females in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. The racial composition was predominately white (88.6% vs 84.9% in the CD and PNH groups, respectively). The log-rank test revealed a significant difference in the AOE cure curves between the CD and PNH groups (P = 0.038). The proportions cured in the AOE at-risk groups at the day-3, -8, and -18 assessments in the CD and PNH treatment groups were 0.14 and 0.10, 0.75 and 0.72, and 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier summary statistics indicated that the mean time to cure was 0.6 day less with CD compared with PNH (9.7 vs 10.3 days). Treatment-related adverse event rates were similar between the 2 groups and occurred in 3.8% of the patients. The most common adverse events included otic pruritus (2.1%), otic congestion (0.6%), otic debris (0.5%), otic pain (0.3%), superimposed ear infection (0.3%), and erythema (0.1%).

Conclusion

These data from 2 previous studies suggest that time to cure was significantly less with CD compared with PNH in patients with AOE.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^8c7c6078]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, superior to ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone in treating acute otitis externa?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 493 patients, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was not superior to either agent alone for the primary outcome of therapeutic cure. A faster resolution of otalgia, superiority in sustained microbiological response, and superiority in the microbiological outcome were noted with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with fluocinolone or ciprofloxacin alone.

Meaning

Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone otic solution did not show statistical superiority compared with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for the primary end point, although the combination showed statistical superiority in many secondary efficacy end points and a good safety profile.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^872afadc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Population

Included in the study were patients older than 6 months with AOE of less than 21 days' duration in at least 1 ear, who presented with otorrhea, moderate or severe otalgia, and edema with a Brighton grading of II or III. The Brighton grading system is an algorithm to grade the severity of otitis externa, in which grade II corresponds to the presence of debris in the ear canal and tympanic membrane often obscured by debris and grade III corresponds to a tympanic membrane obscured by edematous ear canal but without systemic illness.

Exclusion criteria included a previous episode of AOE within 4 weeks or more than 1 episode of AOE within 6 months prior to enrollment; existing tympanic membrane perforation; current diagnosis of diabetes, otitis media, or malignant otitis externa; suspected viral or fungal ear infection; unknown or suspected fluoroquinolone and/or corticosteroid hypersensitivity; use of topical or systemic antimicrobial, antifungal, or corticosteroid agents within 1 week preceding study entry; and concurrent use of anti-inflammatory agents.

Treatments

The investigational product was ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%. Comparator drugs were ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%. All treatments were sterile otic solutions supplied in blue translucent single-use vials (0.25 mL) with the same characteristics.

Patients were randomized via an interactive web response system to one of the following treatment groups: ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin, or fluocinolone, in a 2:2:1 ratio. A block randomization algorithm was used. To ensure homogeneous representation of age groups, patients were stratified by age at enrollment (< 18 or ≥ 18 years).

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^3d18c8f4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

At visit 4, the therapeutic response was significantly superior in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group compared with the ciprofloxacin group (90 of 103 [87.4%] vs 69 of 91 [75.8%]; difference in response rate, 11.6%; 95% CI, 0.7%-22.4%; P = 0.04) but not with the fluocinolone group (36 of 45 [80.0%]; difference in response rate, 7.4%; 95% CI, –6.0% to 20.7%; P = 0.25) (Table 2). Similar results were observed in the CITT population, and no statistically significant difference was reached in the MITT-PA/SA population.

Otalgia disappeared significantly faster in patients treated with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (median, 5.0 days [range, 4.2–6.3 days]) compared with those treated with ciprofloxacin (median, 5.9 days [range, 4.3–7.3 days]; 95% CI, 4.3–7.3 days; P = 0.002) or fluocinolone (median, 7.7 days [range, 6.7–9.0 days]; 95% CI, 6.7–9.0 days; P < .001) in the MITT population (Figure 2). The median time to end of ear pain was 5.0 days (range, 4.2–6.3 days) in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group, 5.9 days (range, 4.3–7.3 days) in the ciprofloxacin group, and 7.7 days (range, 6.7–9.0 days) in the fluocinolone group (Figure 2). A significantly lower median time to end of ear pain was also observed in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group (5.9 days; range, 4.9–6.4 days) vs the ciprofloxacin (6.9 days; range, 5.9–7.9 days; P < .001) and fluocinolone (7.6 days; range, 6.0–8.5 days; P = 0.01) groups in the CITT population and vs the fluocinolone group (7.5 days; range, 4.5–11.5 days; P = 0.01) in the MITT-PA/SA population.

Methods

Study Design

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted at 36 centers in the US between August 1, 2017, and September 14, 2018. The protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the Advarra institutional review board. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidance and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study results followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1. Each patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) provided written informed consent before study initiation.

The study was scheduled across 4 visits: visit 1 (baseline; day 1), visit 2 (telephone visit; days 3–4), visit 3 (end of treatment; days 8–10 or within 2 days of early termination), and visit 4 (test of cure; days 15–17). At visit 1, eligible patients who signed the informed consent form were randomly assigned to the investigational or comparator treatment groups. Demographic information was collected in the case report form at visit 1 for each patient. Medical history, concurrent symptoms and conditions, and concomitant medications were recorded; vital signs were assessed; a sample of ear discharge was collected for microbiological culture; and signs and symptoms of AOE were evaluated. The study medication was supplied, and a staff member instructed patients or caregivers on how to administer it. A diary was provided to the patient or caregiver to record concomitant medications, compliance, and pain severity twice daily (prior to dosing). At visit 2, patients were inquired by telephone about AOE symptoms and, if no improvement was reported, were asked for an onsite visit. At visits 3 and 4, vital signs were assessed, clinical response was evaluated, and, if ear discharge was present, a sample was collected for microbiological evaluation. Used and unused medication was collected at visit 3, and patient diaries were collected at visit 4.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^45aa076f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that "Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE," and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^27e2548e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

### Comparison of safety and efficacy of foam-based versus solution-based ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa [^5719fca4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of a foam-based antibiotic formulation in the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE) with the more conventional solution-based formulation.

Study Design

Phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Multicenter.

Subjects and Methods

Sixty-three eligible adult patients with unilateral AOE were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: an experimental 0.3 percent foam-based ciprofloxacin, (FoamOtic Cipro) or 0.3 percent solution-based ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan). All patients received the same dose regime (twice daily for 7 days). The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy (cure) in the test-of-cure visit. Secondary variables included improvement of the disease symptoms otalgia, tenderness, edema, and otorrhea.

Results

Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study. Seven patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis due to major deviations from the protocol. Per-protocol analysis (n = 57) showed that cure was achieved in all the patients (P = 1.000). No significant differences were found between groups for symptomatic relief, resolution of otic discharge, or onset of pain reduction. Both treatments were found to be highly efficacious and safe, demonstrating the noninferiority of the experimental drug.

Conclusion

Foam-based ciprofloxacin is a safe and an effective new treatment for AOE.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution once daily for 7 days in the treatment of otitis externa: a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial [^0045658b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis externa (OE) is an infection of the external auditory canal that is typically treated with topically applied broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twice-daily topical treatment with ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution for 10 days has been reported to be as effective and well tolerated as the standard of care, neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone solution administered 4 times daily for 10 days.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 7 days of a once-daily regimen of ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution in the treatment of OE.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, Phase III study was conducted from June 12, 2002, to October 14, 2002. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 6 months and had OE of < 2 weeks' duration with moderate to severe edema and tenderness involving 1 or both ears and sufficient exudate for microbiologic culture. Ofloxacin otic solution was instilled once daily for 7 days (5 drops for children aged 6 months to < 13 years, 10 drops for adolescents/adults aged ≥ 13 years). Assessments were conducted at the end-of-treatment visit and 7 to 10 days later (the test-of-cure visit). Medication was supplied free of charge to study participants who incurred no costs for physician visits.

Results

Of 489 patients enrolled at 58 sites in 3 countries, 439 were clinically evaluable (173 children, 266 adolescents/adults; 52% males, 48% females; 47% Hispanic, 45% white; 5% black, and 3% other). The cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 91% (95% of children, 88% of adolescents/adults); 68% of patients were cured within 7 days. Forty-three potentially pathogenic strains were isolated from 253 microbiologically evaluable patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 158 (62%) microbiologically evaluable patients and Staphylococcus aureus from 32 (13%). Eradication rates were 96% overall. No serious adverse events were observed. Minor adverse events were experienced by 15 (3%) of 489 patients included in the safety population. The most common adverse events were pruritus (5 patients), increased earache (4 patients), and application-site reactions (3 patients). Overall mean (SD) adherence to therapy was 98% (11.9).

Conclusions

Ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution administered once daily for 7 days was well tolerated and effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure of OE. The compliance rates in this study suggests that this regimen may be better accepted by patients than longer, more repetitive regimens.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1e9c0ecf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

### Topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone is superior to ciprofloxacin alone in pediatric patients with acute otitis media and otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^8bd5e9e1]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether topical administration of a corticosteroid improves resolution of acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea when combined with topical antibiotic drops.

Study Design

Randomized, patient-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial of topical otic ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone versus topical ciprofloxacin alone in 201 children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) of less than or equal to 3 weeks' duration and visible otorrhea.

Methods

Eligible patients were randomized to receive three drops of either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% or ciprofloxacin 0.3% into the affected ear or ears twice daily for 7 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3, 8 (end-of-therapy), and 14 (test-of-cure), and twice-daily assessments of otorrhea were recorded in patient diaries.

Results

The mean time to cessation of otorrhea in the microbiologically culture-positive patient population (n = 167) was significantly shorter with topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone than with ciprofloxacin alone (4.22 vs. 5.31 days; P = 0.004). This resulted in significantly better clinical responses on days 3 and 8 (P < .0001 and P = 0.0499, respectively). However, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in either the clinical response or the microbial eradication rate by day 14.

Conclusions

Topical otic treatment with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to treatment with ciprofloxacin alone and results in a faster clinical resolution in children with AOMT. The contribution of the corticosteroid in achieving a 20% reduction (1.1 day) in time to cessation of otorrhea is clinically meaningful and represents an important advance over single-agent antibiotic therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^450857f2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical study, ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure. However, the findings suggest the benefits of combining the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide to better manage patients with AOE, with regard to both the bacterial infection and the typical disease signs and symptoms.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment — STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for otitis externa [^fcc711ce]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Ofloxacin otic is as effective in curing otitis externa in children (< 12 years of age) as is the preparation combining polymyxin/neomycin plus hydrocortisone and as ciprofloxacin otic. Furthermore ofloxacin otic, as it requires less frequent dosing, is likely to encourage greater patient adherence and consequently to achieve a better cure rate than both of these treatment options. Because a number of cases of otitis externa are complicated by an undiagnosed tympanic membrane perforation, the lack of ototoxicity associated with ofloxacin otic makes it a particularly safe option for use in these patients.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^3af51e0b]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The study Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) was published by Laurence Chu and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute otitis externa. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the trial question was: is the combination of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide superior to fluocinolone acetonide in patients with acute otitis externa? In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the population was: 297 patients (153 female, 144 male). The inclusion criteria were adult and pediatric patients aged > 6 months with acute otitis externa. The key exclusion criteria were previous episode of acute otitis externa within 4 weeks or > 1 episode of acute otitis externa within 6 months; tympanic membrane perforation; otitis media; malignant otitis externa. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the interventions were: n = 197 ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide (ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution BID for 7 days) n = 100 fluocinolone acetonide alone (fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution BID for 7 days). In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinical and microbiological cure at day 8–10 (61.2% vs. 44.4%; AD 16.7%, 95% CI -0.6 to 34). In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in median number of days until cessation of ear pain (5 days vs. 7.7 days; AD -2.7 days, 95% CI -6.7 to 9) Significant increase in sustained microbiological response (91.3% vs. 75.6%; AD 15.7%, 95% CI 2 to 29.4) No significant difference in clinical and microbiological cure at day 15–17 (87.4% vs. 80%; AD 7.4%, 95% CI -6 to 20.7). In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone) study, the conclusion was: in adult and pediatric patients aged > 6 months with acute otitis externa, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide was not superior to fluocinolone acetonide alone with respect to clinical and microbiological cure at day 8–10.

Introduction

Otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external auditory canalthat can be acute (most common) or chronic. The estimated incidence of acute otitis externa (AOE) is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 250 of the general population, and it is a common infection treated by health care professionals.

Historically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were identified as common causative pathogens. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, with water exposure in the ear canal commonly noted. Patients with AOE present with otalgia, tenderness, diffuse ear canal edema, and otorrhea. In severe cases, symptoms may result in sleep disturbance and severe discomfort, leading to many health care visits.

In uncomplicated AOE, current guidelines recommend treatment with topical antimicrobial agents with or without anti-inflammatory drugs, risk factor avoidance, and pain management, when required. Topical antibiotics are the preferred first-line treatment because they can reach high local concentrations in the infected area, demonstrate a low risk of adverse events (AEs), and minimize the development of antibiotic resistance.

Topical antibiotics include aminoglycosides (neomycin and gentamicin) or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin), with cure rates ranging from 65% to 90%. Topical fluoroquinolones are not associated with ototoxic effects and are effective in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation. Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria (including P aeruginosa).

In AOE, the addition of corticosteroids to ototopical antibiotic treatment is believed to enhance the resolution of the inflammatory response and improve associated symptoms. Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, has already shown superiority vs ciprofloxacin alone for the treatment of diffuse otitis externaand vs ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone for children with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMTs). This combination is currently approved to treat AOE and AOMTs in more than 50 countries outside the US and for AOMTs in the US and Canada. The present study was conducted to evaluate the superiority of the combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, vs ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide alone to treat AOE.

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention… [^322dfc68]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is an inflammatory process of the external auditory canal. In one recent study, 1 otitis externa was found to be disabling enough to cause 36 percent of patients to interrupt their daily activities for a median duration of four days, with 21 percent requiring bed rest. It is typically a localized process that can be easily controlled with topical agents, yet physicians use systemic medications to treat this condition 65 percent of the time. 2 If otitis externa is not optimally treated, especially in immunocompromised patients, the potentially life-threatening infection can spread to the surrounding tissues. 26 In severe cases, a prolonged course of parenteral antibiotics may be needed, but the excellent gastrointestinal absorption of the fluoroquinolones allows milder infections to be treated with a two-week course of oral therapy. Treatment should also include surgical debridement of any granulation or osteitic bone.

4, 7, 25 Thus, an otolaryngologist should usually be involved early in the course, especially if the patient does not respond quickly to appropriate treatment. Treatment Cleansing of the ear canal by suctioning is a principal treatment. Acidifying drops, given three or four times daily for five to seven days, are usually adequate to complete treatment. Because the infection can persist asymptomatically, the patient should be reevaluated at the end of the course of treatment. At this time any further cleansing can be performed as needed. If the infection is not resolving, over-the-counter clotrimazole 1 percent solution, which also has some antibacterial activity, can be used. In vitro studies show that topical solutions of thimerosal and M-cresyl acetate are more effective agents but are messier. The most important treatment is identifying and removing the irritant or allergen.

Topical steroids are beneficial, including a cream for the pinna when it is involved. An acidifying agent, usually Burow's otic solution with 2 percent acetic acid, is often added to prevent secondary infections, reacidify the skin, dry weeping lesions and remove crusts. Three to five days of use, three or four times daily, is usually sufficient for topical therapy. Systemic steroids and antihistamines may be needed for severe allergic reactions. 4, 6, 10, 27 Clinical characteristics helpful in differentiating the noninfectious causes of otitis externa are summarized in Table 5.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d03dbb21]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative otorrhea prevention in children with tympanostomy tubes — saline washout versus antibiotic ear drops: The recommendation against prescribing relates to continuing use of antibiotic ear drops that may be prescribed for up to 10 days after surgery. Based on 2 low‑risk randomized controlled trials (RCTs), saline washouts reduced otorrhea incidence from 30% to 16% (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.00) with a number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) of 7 children, while a single application of antibiotic‑steroid ear drops reduced otorrhea from 9% to 1% (relative risk, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.57) with an NNTB of 13. In a trial of 291 children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) whose ears (N = 560) were randomized to four interventions — saline washout, oral amoxicillin for 7 days, oral amoxicillin for 7 days plus ciprofloxacin ear drops for 3 days, or observation — no significant differences in postoperative otorrhea were found, with rates ranging from 1.1% to 12.3%, supporting no added benefit from continuing antibiotic ear drops after surgery when compared with saline washout. A more recent RCT showed no benefit of routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops as compared with saline solution: Children (N = 174) were randomized to intraoperative ciprofloxacin or normal saline ear drops continued for 5 days after surgery; of the remaining 128 children, about 62% had recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), 21% chronic OME, and 48% mucoid effusions, and there were no differences at 4 or 6 weeks in the incidence, duration, and QOL impact of early tympanostomy tube otorrhea or tube patency between groups.

The tragus should then be pumped 5 times by pushing inward to facilitate penetration of the drops into the middle ear.
This position should be maintained for 60 seconds. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.
Discard unused portion after therapy is completed.

For the Treatment of Acute Otitis Externa (age 6 months and older)

The recommended dosage regimen is as follows:

Four drops [equivalent to 0.14 mL of CIPRODEX, (consisting of 0.42 mg ciprofloxacin and 0.14 mg dexamethasone)] instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.
The suspension should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness, which may result from the instillation of a cold suspension.
The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the drops should be instilled.
This position should be maintained for 60 seconds to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.
Discard unused portion after therapy is completed.

### Topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^20960271]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged ≥ 6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of ≤ 3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%).

Results

Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. No change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen.

Conclusion

Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of AOMT.

Antibiotic management strategies

There were heterogeneous management strategies depending on the work setting. The majority of GPs and emergency care staff used oral amoxicillin, compared with ENT specialists who use predominantly topical ciprofloxacin. Oral amoxicillin was favoured most frequently for a treatment duration of 5 days. ' We always get confused about what to do, it's only been a few weeks back, I was looking at the guidance to see if you give them antibiotics' (medical professional 27).

All GPs referred to NICE guidance to support their management decisions. ' There is the NICE guideline that you can, that you can kind of lean on' (medical professional 21). Emergency care doctors used local antimicrobial guidelines. ENT doctors had no guidelines to support their management.

Non-antibiotic management strategies

All medical professionals agreed that water avoidance was required to prevent repeat infections. There was no consensus on the duration of avoidance required. One GP would see the patient back in 4–6 weeks to check tympanic membrane patency before advising normal activities. Some clinicians advised avoiding using cotton buds in the external auditory canal. The use of topical swabs was varied. Most secondary care professionals would take a swab if not yet taken in primary care.

Treatment expectations

Clinical improvement was expected from 5 to 14 days post-treatment commencement. The majority of medical professionals defined treatment success as a reduction or complete cessation of discharge; others used pain reduction as an indicator. ' I'll be aiming for total resolution. I think if there was still discharging after a week of antibiotics, I want to probably take a look at them again and reassess things' (medical professional 6).

Future trial factors

All medical professionals described that they would not recruit CYP with AOMd into a trial with a placebo arm. ' I think you'd be hard pressed to justify a placebo in that situation' (medical professional 18). They would also be against recruiting CYP who are systemically unwell to any trial. There was a strong opinion that a trial design should mirror current practice and clear patient information is important to help parents understand the trial.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone in otitis media with tympanostomy tubes in pediatric patients: a randomized clinical trial [^43573453]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in children commonly presents with otorrhea and negatively affects their daily activities.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution relative to ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, otic solution alone and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution alone in the treatment of AOMT in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two twin multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials with identical designs were conducted from June 24, 2011, through June 23, 2014, at ear, nose, and throat pediatric practices, general practices, hospitals, and clinical research centers. The study population comprised 662 children (331 in each trial) with AOMT in at least 1 ear who presented with moderate or severe purulent otorrhea for 3 weeks or less. Data analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin alone, or fluocinolone alone twice daily for 7 days and were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3 to 5 (undergoing therapy), 8 to 10 (end of therapy), and 18 to 22 (test of cure).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy measure was time to cessation of otorrhea. The principal secondary end point was sustained microbiological cure, defined as eradication or presumed eradication at end-of-therapy and test-of-cure visits.

Results

A total of 662 children participating in the 2 studies were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (n = 223), ciprofloxacin alone (n = 221), or fluocinolone alone (n = 218). The median age was 2.5 years (range, 0.6–12.7 years). The median time to cessation of otorrhea was 4.23 days (95% CI, 3.65–4.95 days) in patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with 6.95 days (95% CI, 5.66–8.20 days) in those receiving ciprofloxacin and not estimable findings in those receiving fluocinolone alone (P < .001). The clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure visit was 80.6% in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group, 67.4% in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 13.2%; 95% CI, 5.0%-21.4%; P = 0.002), and 47.6% in the fluocinolone group (difference, 33.0%; 95% CI, 24.0%-42.0%; P < .001). The sustained microbiological cure rate was 79.7% in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group vs 67.7% in the ciprofloxacin group (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, 0.8%-23.0%; P = 0.04) and 37.6% in the fluocinolone group (difference, 42.1%; 95% CI, 29.3%-54.8%; P < .001). Only 7 (3.1%) of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, 8 (3.6%) of the patients receiving ciprofloxacin, and 10 (4.7%) of the patients receiving fluocinolone presented with adverse events related to study medication.

Conclusions and Relevance

The combination of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone is more effective than treatment with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for AOMT, and it is safe and well tolerated in children.

### Ciprofloxacin 0.3% / dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension for the topical treatment of ear infections: a review of the literature [^5445a748]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the literature related to ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension. A systematic literature search utilizing Medline was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles related to safety and efficacy. A total of 47 publications were identified and reviewed herein. The literature supports the use of antibiotic/antiiflammatory combination ear drops in the treatment of both acute otitis externa and acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone has been demonstrated as safe and effective with regard to clinical cures and microbiological eradication of pathogens in either disease with low treatment failure rates. Additionally, the literature also provides clear evidence for the contribution of dexamethasone when added to ciprofloxacin for the topical treatment of ear infections.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^3778a472]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Outcomes

The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the superiority of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone relative to ciprofloxacin alone and fluocinolone alone by means of the therapeutic cure rate (clinical and microbiological cure) at the end of treatment. Clinical cure was considered achieved if edema, otalgia, and otorrhea were fully resolved (with total signs and symptoms score of 0), with no further requirement of antimicrobial therapy. The total signs and symptoms score is the sum of otalgia, edema, and otorrhea scores, with each of them rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (where 0 indicates absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe). Patients reported their level of pain before the ear was examined and recorded the intensity of pain twice daily in their diary. Edema and otorrhea were assessed by the investigator through otoscopic examination. Microbiological cure was established when the bacteriologic response was eradication (ie, repeated culture did not show growth of any pathogen) or presumed eradication (ie, no material to culture and an overall clinical outcome of clinical cure or clinical improvement). Microbiological samples were submitted to a central laboratory for analysis. Patients who received rescue medication during the study were considered to have experienced a lack of efficacy.

The principal secondary objective was to show the superiority of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone relative to ciprofloxacin alone and fluocinolone alone with respect to the time to end of ear pain, defined as the interval (in days) between the first dose of study medication and the first day (morning or evening) on which the ear pain in the evaluable ear was absent and remained absent until the end of the study without use of analgesics. This time was calculated on the basis of the patient's diary entries using an age-adjusted pain scale (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scalefor patients younger than 7 years, Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scalefor patients aged 7–13 years, and visual analogue scale for patients aged ≥ 13 years) and the investigator's assessment of otalgia at each visit.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^2086b726]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^38ce79e0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^a65f1e62]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^e999f581]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evidence synthesis for topical therapy: The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of topical therapy, without systemic antibiotics, for initial management of uncomplicated AOE, and most topical preparations provide antimicrobial activity through (1) an antibiotic, which may be an aminoglycoside, polymyxin B, a quinolone, or a combination of these agents; (2) a steroid, such as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone; or (3) a low-pH antiseptic. Randomized trials used in the 3 AOE meta-analyses are summarized in Table 7, with 31 listed trials, of which 3 were included in all of the meta-analyses, 14 in 2, and 5 in only 1, and multiple analyses report no meaningful differences in clinical outcomes by class or combination, including that Rosenfeld and colleagues found no significant differences for antiseptic versus antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic versus nonquinolone antibiotic(s), or steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial alone.

### Topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone superior to oral amoxicillin / clavulanic acid in acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^c1b97999]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was a comparison of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension to oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.

Methods

This was a randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension versus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in 80 children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes of ≤ 3 weeks' duration and visible otorrhea. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 4 drops of topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (Ciprodex Sterile Otic Suspension) into the affected ear(s) twice daily for 7 days or 600 mg of amoxicillin/42.9 mg of clavulanic acid oral suspension (Augmentin ES-600 Oral Suspension) every 12 hours for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3, 11 (end-of-therapy), and 18 (test-of-cure), and twice-daily assessments of otorrhea were recorded in patient diaries.

Results

The median time to cessation of otorrhea was significantly shorter with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension than with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension (4.0 vs 7.0 days; n = 79). This resulted in significantly more clinical cures at the test-of-cure visit (85% vs 59%, respectively). Frequent adverse events (> 3%) related to ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension included ear pain (5.1%) and related to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension included diarrhea (19.5%), dermatitis (7.3%), and gastroenteritis (4.9%).

Conclusions

Topical otic treatment with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to treatment with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension and results in more clinical cures and earlier cessation of otorrhea with fewer adverse effects in children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.

In the MITT population, significantly higher rates of sustained microbiological cure were achieved in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group (94 of 103 [91.3%]) vs the ciprofloxacin group (74 of 91 [81.3%]; difference in response rate, 9.9%; 95% CI, 0.3%-19.6%; P = 0.04) and the fluocinolone group (34 of 45 [75.6%]; difference in response rate, 15.7%; 95% CI, 2.0%-29.4%; P = 0.01) (Table 2). The proportion of patients with a favorable microbiological outcome was significantly higher in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group vs the fluocinolone group at visit 3 (99 of 103 [96.1%] vs 37 of 45 [82.2%]; difference in response rate, 13.9%; 95% CI, 2.1%-25.7%; P = 0.01) and vs the ciprofloxacin group at visit 4 (97 of 103 [94.2%] vs 77 of 91 [84.6%]; difference in response rate, 9.6%; 95% CI, 0.9%-18.2%; P = 0.02).

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^476190ee]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

No significant differences between study groups were observed for the clinical cure at visit 3 in the MITT population (63 of 103 [61.2%] for the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group, 50 of 91 [54.9%] for the ciprofloxacin group, and 20 of 45 [44.4%] for the fluocinolone group). At visit 4, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was statistically comparable to ciprofloxacin alone (90 of 103 [87.4%] vs 70 of 91 [76.9%]; difference in response rate, 10.5%; 95% CI, –0.3% to 21.2%; P = 0.06) and fluocinolone alone (36 of 45 [80.0%]; difference in response rate, 7.4%; 95% CI, –6.0% to 20.7%; P = 0.25). The combination of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was statistically superior to ciprofloxacin alone at visit 4 in the CITT population (176 of 197 [89.3%] vs 156 of 196 [79.6%]; difference in response rate, 9.7%; 95% CI, 2.6%-16.8%; P = 0.008).

The proportion of patients whose otorrhea resolved was significantly higher in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group compared with the ciprofloxacin group at visit 3 in the MITT and CITT populations. The changes in otalgia, when assessed by the investigator, were significantly better in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group compared with the fluocinolone group at visit 3. For the change in otalgia scores, the patients treated with the combination of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone had significantly higher scores than patients in both comparator groups at visit 3 and patients who received ciprofloxacin at visit 4 in the MITT population (eTable in Supplement 2). In the CITT population, all comparisons between groups with regard to otalgia were significantly better with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone. No significant changes between groups were seen for edema at either visit in the populations assessed.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^82ed433d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### A single topical agent is clinically equivalent to the combination of topical and oral antibiotic treatment for otitis externa [^3e07dd91]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate clinical equivalence (statistical noninferiority) of topical ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone (CHC, Cipro HC) and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone (NPH, Cortisporin) with systemic amoxicillin (AMX, Amoxil), for treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Design

Randomized, active-control, observer-blind, multicenter trial.

Patients

Altogether, 206 patients were enrolled (CHC, 106; NPH + AMX, 100). Patients were ≥ 1 year of age, had AOE > 2 days with at least mild symptoms, and gave informed consent. All were evaluable for safety, and 151 were evaluable for efficacy.

Interventions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone 3 drops twice daily for 7 days (adults and children) or NPH 4 drops (adults) or 2 drops (children) with AMX 250 mg (adults and children) 3 times daily for 10 days, as directed in approved product labeling.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy 7 days after treatment ended (test of cure). Secondary variables included time to end of pain, symptom scores (otalgia and tenderness) and microbiological eradication. Noninferiority was declared if the lower confidence limit around the measurement difference was above -10 (nearer zero).

Results

Response to therapy was higher for CHC (95.71% vs 89.83%) but was statistically noninferior (lower confidence limit, -4.98) to NPH + AMX. Median time to end of pain was 6 days for both groups. Noninferiority was declared for symptom scores at all measurement periods and for microbiological eradication. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported.

Conclusions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone is clinically equivalent to NPH + AMX for the treatment of AOE in adults and children. However, low systemic exposure, absence of ototoxicity, and less frequent dosing clearly favor Cipro HC.

### Topical ofloxacin for chronic suppurative otitis media and acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media: optimum duration of treatment [^e7ac58d2]. Otology & Neurotology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the optimum duration of topical ofloxacin therapy for chronic otitis media and to compare the response between patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media (AE).

Study Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Five university hospitals and 30 affiliated institutions.

Patients

A total of 294 patients who presented to the participating institutions with CSOM were enrolled. Among them, 268 patients were evaluable for safety and 237 were evaluable for efficacy (64 with CSOM and 173 with AE.

Intervention

Ofloxacin otic solution was administered for as long as 4 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical and bacteriologic assessment was done weekly during the treatment period. The clinical response was assessed on the basis of the symptom scores.

Results

There were no differences between CSOM and AE patients with respect to sex, age, and severity. The most common bacterial isolate from middle ear discharge was Staphylococcus aureus. The clinical response rates in patients with CSOM and AE were 39.1% and 61.3% after 2 weeks of treatment and 57.8% and 75.1% after 4 weeks, respectively, and the bacterial eradication rate was 91.0% at 2 weeks and 94.6% at 4 weeks. Detection of new fungal infection did not increase as the duration of therapy was prolonged. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

The duration of treatment was shorter and the clinical response was higher in AE patients than in CSOM patients. The standard topical ofloxacin regimen for chronic otitis media should consist of a 2-week course from the aspect of bacteriologic efficacy, although patients showing insufficient symptomatic improvement after 2 weeks may benefit from another 1 or 2 weeks of therapy. Administration of this drug for as long as 4 weeks can increase the clinical efficacy without causing safety problems.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1920969b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — overuse and harms of oral antibiotics: Despite the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy of topical preparations, about 20% to 40% of subjects with AOE nonetheless receive oral antibiotics, often in addition to topical antimicrobials, and despite a strong recommendation against systemic antibiotics clinicians actually prescribed more systemic antibiotics postpublication (31% vs 22%). Many of the oral antibiotics selected are inactive against P aeruginosa and S aureus, and treatment with penicillins, macrolides, or cephalosporins increases disease persistence (rate ratios 1.56 to 1.91) and treatment with cephalosporins also increases recurrence (rate ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.58). Orally administered antibiotics have systemic adverse effects that include rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, altered nasopharyngeal flora, and development of bacterial resistance.

### The evolution of ototopical therapy: from cumin to quinolones [^8d92aba8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

A radical change has occurred in the management of otorrhea over the past decade. Multiple studies have supported the efficacy of topical quinolones in the management of acute otitis media, acute otitis externa, and CSOM. For the first time, otolaryngologists have a scientific foundation on which to base our treatment protocols for these conditions. We no longer must rely solely on our clinical experience and prejudices. The quinolone drops have a superior safety profile and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, their overall cost is lower than the alternatives, and their convenient dosing schedule is tolerated well by most patients. When one takes all these factors into consideration, it becomes clear that topical quinolone therapy, with or without a steroid additive, is the treatment of choice for otorrhea in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation or ventilating tube. The development of ototopical medications has followed along the lines of Darwinian evolution, and the quinolone drops have clearly demonstrated the concept of "survival of the fittest".

Objective

Comparison of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension (CIP/DEX) to ofloxacin otic solution (OFL) for treatment of granulation tissue in children with AOMT.

Study Design

599 children aged ≥ 6 months to 12 years with AOMT of up to 3 weeks' duration were enrolled. Patients received either CIP/DEX 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or OFL 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Granulation tissue severity was graded at clinic visits on days 1, 3, 11, and 18.

Results

Granulation tissue was present in 90 of 599 AOMT patients (15.0%) at baseline. CIP/DEX treatment was superior to OFL for reduction of granulation tissue at the day 11 visit (81.3% compared with 56.1%, P = 0.0067) and the day 18 visit (91.7% compared with 73.2%, P = 0.0223). Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients.

Conclusion

CIP/DEX was superior to OFL in the treatment of granulation tissue in children with AOMT.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — follow-up and treatment failure notes that follow-up is warranted if symptoms fail to resolve completely by 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Initial treatment failure of diffuse AOE may be caused by an obstructed ear canal, poor adherence to therapy, misdiagnosis, microbiologic factors, host factors, or contact sensitivity to eardrops. If topical antimicrobial therapy was prescribed, the clinician should reassess the patency of the ear canal to ensure that edema or debris are not impeding drug delivery. Any obstruction should be addressed with aural toilet, wick placement, or both, or if the obstruction cannot be relieved, systemic therapy is begun with an oral antibiotic that covers P aeruginosa and S aureus.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^317c4b07]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat, fueled by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to adverse drug events such as rash, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and contributes to almost 70 000 emergency department visits in children annually. Each excess day of antibiotic prescribed has been associated with a 5% increase in the odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events.

Acute otitis media (AOM) affects approximately 5 million children in the United States annually and accounts for roughly 25% of all antibiotics prescribed to children each year. Therefore, understanding prescribing habits for AOM is essential to developing effective strategies to reduce overall pediatric antibiotic use. Studies suggest that for most children with uncomplicated AOM (defined as AOM without otorrhea), the risk of treatment failure does not differ between those who receive 5 days of therapy and those who receive 7 or more days of therapy. Additionally, 5-day regimens provide similar rates of clinical cure and bacterial eradication for children ages 2 years and older compared to traditional 10-day regimens. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) AOM guidelines published in 2013 recommend short (5–7 day) durations for children ages 2 years and older with nonsevere and uncomplicated AOM. Despite these recommendations, most children with AOM receive longer (10 day) antibiotic durations. These prior studies were either performed in single centers and may not be generalizable or using large insurance claims databases and unable to provide a granular level of detail to identify potential interventions to promote more widespread use of short treatment durations and first-line antibiotics.

The aims of this study were to evaluate durations of therapy prescribed for children 2 years and older with uncomplicated AOM across the ambulatory care systems of two, large pediatric academic health systems and to assess the variability in prescribed durations between and within the systems, from the individual to the institutional level. We additionally evaluated proportions of nonfirst-line antibiotic use and clinical outcomes such as treatment failure, AOM recurrence, and mastoiditis.

### Safety and efficacy of intratympanic ciprofloxacin otic suspension in children with middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement: two randomized clinical trials [^3b76cce5]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Otorrhea after tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) in children is common. Although not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, antibiotic ear drops are routinely used intraoperatively and prescribed for multidose, multiday postoperative administration by caregivers.

Objective

To investigate the safety and efficacy of a single-dose intratympanic, intraoperative, thermosensitive, otic suspension of ciprofloxacin (OTO-201) in children requiring TTP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Two identically designed, prospective, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter phase 3 randomized clinical trials included 532 patients aged 6 months to 17 years with middle ear effusions. Patients with confirmed bilateral effusions on the day of TTP were randomized to TTP alone or to TTP with OTO-201 injection. Children underwent a 28-day observation period. Data were collected from November 14, 2013, to June 3, 2014. Final follow-up was completed on June 16, 2014, and intent-to-treat data were analyzed from June 10 to August 27, 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Efficacy was assessed as treatment failure, including the presence of otorrhea, use of otic or systemic antibiotics, loss to follow-up, or missed visits. Safety was assessed for serious adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events using audiometry, otoscopy, and tympanometry.

Results

Among the 532 patients included in the trials, 175 were randomized to TTP only and 357 to OTO-201 treatment (304 boys [57.1%]; 228 girls [42.9%]; mean [SD] age, 2.4 [2.1]). At day 15, the cumulative proportion of treatment failures (primary end point) was 24.6% (44 of 179 patients) in trial 1 and 21.3% (38 of 178 patients) in trial 2 in the OTO-201 groups vs 44.8% (39 of 87 patients) in trial 1 and 45.5% (40 of 88 patients) in trial 2 in the TTP-alone groups. At day 15 otorrhea-only treatment failures in trial 1 included 21 of 179 (11.7%) in the OTO-201 group vs 22 of 87 (25.3%) in the TTP-only group; in trial 2, 17 of 178 (9.6%) in the OTO-201 group vs 29 of 88 (33.0%) in the TTP-only group. The odds of otorrhea-only failure were significantly reduced in the OTO-201 groups compared with the TTP-only groups in both trials (age-adjusted odds ratios, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.19–0.75] and 0.19 [95% CI, 0.09–0.38]; P < .001 for both trials, post hoc analysis). No drug-related serious adverse events were seen, and most adverse events were mild or moderate. No evidence of increased tube occlusion and no negative effect on results of audiometry, tympanometry, or otoscopy were noted with OTO-201 administration.

Conclusions and Relevance

Two large phase 3 randomized clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a single intraoperative administration of OTO-201 for middle ear effusion at the time of TTP.

### Ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone [^0431479b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In 2 randomized multicenter, controlled clinical trials, ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension dosed 2 times per day for 7 days demonstrated clinical cures in 87% and 94% of per protocol evaluable AOE patients, respectively, compared to 84% and 89%, respectively, for otic suspension containing neomycin 0.35%, polymyxin B 10,000 units/mL, and hydrocortisone 1.0% (neo/poly/HC). Among culture positive patients clinical cures were 86% and 92% for ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension compared to 84% and 89%, respectively, for neo/poly/HC. Microbiological eradication rates for these patients in the same clinical trials were 86% and 92% for ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension compared to 85% and 85%, respectively, for neo/poly/HC.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^e16bff34]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Clinical cure, restrictively defined as the full disappearance of all assessed symptoms (otorrhea, otalgia, and edema) only achieved statistical significance in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group compared with ciprofloxacin in the CITT population at visit 4. Although otorrhea and otalgia had a higher rate of resolution in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group, no significant change in edema was seen between groups at either visit in the populations assessed. Edema is the most subjective symptom to be measured by the physician and also shows a slow resolution process in AOE owing to the anatomical structure of the external auditory canal. Therefore, the contribution of edema resolution to the clinical outcome could have had a negative effect when the combined clinical variable was assessed. An exploratory analysis of the clinical data without considering edema showed statistical differences in therapeutic response in favor of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone (at visit 3: 76 of 103 [73.8%] with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs 54 of 91 [59.3%] with ciprofloxacin; P = 0.03; and vs 24 of 45 [53.3%] with fluocinolone; P = 0.01).

Overall, the results in the CITT population were similar to those in the MITT population but with a higher level of significance. The MITT and CITT populations more closely resemble the situation in daily clinical practice, demonstrating the efficacy of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone in a realistic treatment setting. The higher efficacy of the combination was also evident by the lower use of rescue medication in the ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone group (1.5%) compared with the ciprofloxacin group (8.2%) or the fluocinolone groups (4%). Efficacy results are in line with those of previous studies in which the addition of corticosteroids to ototopical antibiotics was efficacious. Few AEs were reported in all study groups, generally mild or moderate, and not related to study medication, supporting the favorable safety profile of the combination of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide, as previously shown.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. The lower than anticipated number of patients with a positive microbiological culture at baseline resulted in fewer evaluable patients in the MITT and MITT-PA/SA populations. However, the CITT population still included a high number of patients, which is the population most representative of daily practice.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^50b86c32]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Efficacy assessments

The primary efficacy end point in both trials was assessed by the cumulative proportion of treatment failures (days 4–15), defined as one of the following, which ever occurred first: (1) otorrhea treatment failure — the presence of TT otorrhea in one or both ears, as noted by a blinded assessor (a medical professional who was not present during surgery nor involved in the preparation of the study drug) during the visual external ear examination on or after 3 days postsurgery (day 4); (2) otic treatment failure — patient received otic antibiotic drops any time postsurgery through day 15 prior to otorrhea confirmation by the blinded assessor; (3) systemic antibiotic treatment failure — patient received a systemic antibiotic any time postsurgery through day 15 prior to otorrhea confirmation by the blinded assessor; (4) loss to follow-up; or (5) missed visit treatment failure — patient not lost to follow-up who had a missing treatment failure status at a visit through day 15.

An effusion sample taken at the time of surgery was taken for microbiologic culture, sensitivity, and exploratory microbiologic testing. In addition to the otoscopic examination performed by the unblinded investigator, the assessment of TT otorrhea (a visual external ear examination) for the efficacy end point occurred on days 4, 8, 15, and 29 by the blinded assessor.

If the blinded assessor confirmed otorrhea in either ear on or after 3 days postsurgery (day 4), a specimen for culture was obtained, and the patient was eligible to receive ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone,4 drops twice a day in both ears for 7 days. All patients were asked to continue all trial assessments, regardless of otorrhea status, including continued assessment by the blinded assessor. Effusion type for each ear was categorized as absent, serous, purulent, sanguineous, or mucoid. Positive microbiology cultures were analyzed by the number of ears positive overall and the number of ears positive for each of the 5 organisms.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^a61e0238]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

External otitis and tympanostomy tube–associated otorrhea — topical versus systemic therapy evidence: A review of "19 randomized controlled trials, including 2 from a primary care setting, yielding 3382 participants" found that "Topical antibiotic agents containing corticosteroids appeared to be more effective than acetic acid solutions." Safety considerations include that "Aminoglycoside-containing otic preparations were reported to cause ototoxicity if the tympanic membrane was not intact; fluoroquinolone-containing preparations represent a safer alternative" for otorrhea in tympanic membrane perforation and tympanostomy tubes, and "Eleven trials included aural toilet… but the authors acknowledged that this treatment is not likely to be available in a typical primary care office setting." In severe disease, "systemically administered antimicrobial agents should be considered in addition to topical therapy," though "Which topical antibiotic agent is best for external otitis is unclear." Comparative evidence is mixed: "High-quality studies that evaluated quinolone versus nonquinolone topical solutions are limited," one systematic review of "13 metaanalyses" showed a significant advantage for quinolones in microbiologic cure "(P = 0.035)," and another review of "12 relevant randomized controlled clinical studies involving 2682 patients" reported higher cure "(P = 0.01)" and eradication "(P = 0.03)" versus a non–fluoroquinolone antibiotic-steroid combination; however, "a study in more than 200 children, 90 of whom were evaluated for microbiologic response" concluded quinolone and nonquinolone agents were similar in both microbiologic and clinical cure rates.

### The use of otic powder in the treatment of acute external otitis [^928983f3]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Acute external otitis (AEO) is a painful condition that results as a secondary infection of macerated skin and subcutaneous tissues of the external auditory canal. The most commonly causative microorganisms are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Classic management strategies include moisture prevention, cleansing of the canal and administration of topical antimicrobial agents in drop form, such as aminoglycosides and quinolones, at times in combination with steroid solutions. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of topical otic powder, tobramycin drops and ciprofloxacin drops in patients suffering from AEO. MATERIALS AND MEASURES: A randomized prospective trial was performed to determine the efficacy of Auricularum powder (dexamethasone 10 mg, oxytetracycline HCl 90,000 U, polymyxin B Sulfate 100,000 U, nystatin 1,000,000 U; Trima, Serolam Laboratories, Germany) compared with ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan, Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) and tobramycin (Tobrex, Alcon Laboratories) drops for the treatment of AEO. One hundred twenty patients who presented with signs and symptoms of AEO were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: AEO diagnosed by an otolaryngologist, patient age 18 years, no prior treatment with other drops or systemic antibiotics, no sensitivity to any of the drugs used or their contents, and no perforation of the tympanic membrane. All patients were instructed to avoid moisture and wetness of the ear during the course of their treatment. After we received informed consent, a swab culture was taken, and the patient was randomly assigned topical treatment for 14 days.

Results

Eighty-six percent of those treated with Auricularum powder were cured at day 3–4 after initial treatment. Seventy-seven percent of those treated with ciprofloxacin drops, and fifty-six percent of those treated with tobramycin were cured at that time. All 120 patients were cured by day 14.

Conclusion

The results show that topical treatment with Auricularum powder is an effective and rapid method for the treatment of AEO. Ciloxan also was effective in the treatment of AEO and relieved symptoms quickly and efficiently in a short period of time. Tobrex was effective in treating AEO, but our results show that relief of symptoms was slower than with the other drugs.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^3224710b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy, safety, and microbiology of a thermosensitive otic suspension of ciprofloxacin (OTO-201) in children with bilateral middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement.

Study Design

Two randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled phase 3 trials. Patients were randomized to intratympanic OTO-201 or sham.

Setting

Children with bilateral middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement.

Subjects/Methods

Studies evaluated 532 patients (6 months to 17 years old) in a combined analysis of efficacy (treatment failure: presence of otorrhea, otic or systemic antibiotic use, lost to follow-up, missed visits), safety (audiometry, otoscopy, tympanometry), and microbiology.

Results

There was a lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures in patients receiving OTO-201 vs tympanostomy tubes alone (1) on days 4, 8, 15, and 29; (2) on day 15, primary end point (23.0% vs 45.1%; age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.341; P < .001; reduction in relative risk, 49%); and (3) on day 15, blinded-assessor otorrhea treatment failure (7.0% vs 19.4%; age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.303; P < .001; reduction in relative risk, 64%). Per-protocol and subgroup analyses (baseline demographics, pathogen type, culture status, effusion type, microbiologic response) supported these findings. There were no drug-related serious adverse events; the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in both groups were pyrexia, postoperative pain, nasopharyngitis, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection. OTO-201 administration had no evidence of increased tube occlusion and no negative effect on audiometry, tympanometry, or otoscopy.

Conclusions

Combined analysis of 2 phase 3 trials demonstrated a lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures through day 15 compared with TT alone when OTO-201 was administered intratympanically for otitis media with bilateral middle ear effusion at time of tympanostomy tube placement.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^e3f637be]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Safety Assessment

A total of 15 AEs related to study treatments were registered in the overall population: 6 AEs among 6 patients treated with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone and 9 AEs among 5 patients treated with ciprofloxacin. All AEs were considered mild or moderate and resolved before the end of the study (Table 3). Only 1 serious AE occurred during the study (an acute psychotic episode), and it was considered unrelated to the study medication.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^8bde4d29]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.
