## Question

Do I need imaging for pyelonephritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether imaging is needed for pyelonephritis and, if so, when and how to image. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing uncomplicated from complicated pyelonephritis. Then, I should verify guideline-based indications for imaging in adults. Next, I will examine special populations such as pregnancy, pediatrics, and immunocompromised hosts. After that, I need to choose the appropriate imaging modality based on clinical context. Finally, I should integrate this into a practical decision algorithm and double-check for exceptions that mandate urgent imaging or intervention.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework, because imaging decisions hinge on whether the presentation is uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated pyelonephritis typically occurs in immunocompetent, nonpregnant adults without structural urinary tract disease, whereas complicated pyelonephritis includes patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, obstruction, urolithiasis, pregnancy, renal transplant, or other host or anatomic risk factors, and these distinctions directly influence the need for early imaging and escalation of care [^113GGCdL].

> Now, I should verify the adult imaging indications. For uncomplicated pyelonephritis, routine imaging is not recommended; diagnosis is clinical and supported by urinalysis and culture, with imaging reserved for treatment failure or diagnostic uncertainty. Wait, let me verify the timing of "treatment failure". Most guidelines advise reassessment at 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement or deterioration, then imaging is indicated to evaluate for abscess, obstruction, emphysematous change, or other complications. For complicated presentations or high-risk patients, early imaging is appropriate to detect complications and guide management. I initially thought "immediate imaging" was required for all complicated cases, but hold on, I should be precise: guidelines emphasize early imaging rather than a universal mandate for immediate imaging, with urgency dictated by severity and suspected complications such as obstruction or sepsis [^113GGCdL] [^116VBMuJ].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, because the modality matters. In pregnant patients with suspected pyelonephritis, ultrasound is the first-line modality to assess for hydronephrosis or obstruction, given safety and the need to exclude obstructive uropathy that may require urgent decompression. I need to ensure I avoid ionizing radiation; contrast-enhanced CT is generally avoided in pregnancy unless the maternal-fetal risk clearly justifies it, in which case MRI without gadolinium or carefully selected CT may be considered after multidisciplinary discussion. Let me double-check: ACR and obstetric guidance align on ultrasound first in pregnancy with pyelonephritis, escalating only if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and the clinical course demands it [^113GGCdL].

> I will now examine pediatrics, where imaging strategy differs by age and risk. For children with a first febrile UTI, many guidelines recommend renal ultrasound to detect hydronephrosis or structural abnormalities, with DMSA scintigraphy reserved for atypical or recurrent disease to assess cortical involvement or scarring. Hold on, I should verify the evolving consensus: recent pediatric guidance supports a more selective approach, prioritizing ultrasound acutely and avoiding routine VCUG unless abnormalities are detected or infections recur, reflecting the shift toward risk-stratified imaging rather than blanket studies. So, ultrasound first in young children with febrile UTI, then DMSA or VCUG selectively based on recurrence, severity, or abnormal ultrasound, is reasonable [^111G7rMD] [^116SCarT] [^114JeGcW].

> Let me consider immunocompromised hosts and diabetics, because they are high risk for occult complications. Early imaging is prudent in these populations to detect abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis, or obstruction that may alter management. I should confirm that CT is the most sensitive modality for these complications, while ultrasound can be a rapid screen for hydronephrosis when CT is not immediately available. Yes, both radiology and infectious disease sources support early cross-sectional imaging in high-risk adults to identify complications and guide source control when needed [^113GGCdL] [^116VBMuJ] [^111Wbwm9].

> Next, I should review modality selection. Ultrasound is first-line when obstruction is suspected or in pregnancy, given its safety and ability to detect hydronephrosis. Noncontrast CT is preferred for suspected urolithiasis causing obstruction. Contrast-enhanced CT is the gold standard for detecting parenchymal inflammation, abscess, emphysematous change, and perinephric extension. MRI is a radiation-free alternative when CT is contraindicated or in younger patients, with diffusion-weighted sequences offering high diagnostic agreement for uncomplicated APN in some series, though access and motion artifacts can limit use. Let me verify: multiple radiology sources consistently position CT as the most comprehensive modality for complicated pyelonephritis, with MRI as a strong second when iodinated contrast or radiation is a concern [^114sk6Tz] [^116VBMuJ] [^112n9q4i] [^112au8Y3].

> I should double-check the urgency signals that mandate expedited imaging and intervention. Suspected obstructive pyonephrosis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, sepsis with suspected urologic source, and failure to improve after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy are clear triggers for urgent imaging and potential source control. Point-of-care ultrasound can rapidly identify hydronephrosis and expedite urology consultation for drainage in the ED, which can be lifesaving in obstructed, infected systems. The ACR obstruction criteria and emergency radiology literature reinforce this time-sensitive pathway [^1158HaP2] [^114mM6SD] [^116VBMuJ].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the diagnosis is uncertain? Imaging can help differentiate pyelonephritis from mimics such as renal infarct, tumor, or interstitial nephritis, and it can clarify the extent of parenchymal involvement when clinical and laboratory findings are equivocal. I need to ensure I do not overcall imaging in straightforward cases, yet remain vigilant for red flags that warrant early cross-sectional imaging to avoid missing complications that delay recovery or increase morbidity [^116VBMuJ] [^111Wbwm9].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. For uncomplicated pyelonephritis in immunocompetent, nonpregnant adults, treat clinically with urinalysis and culture, and reserve imaging for nonresponse at 48–72 hours or clinical deterioration. For complicated pyelonephritis or high-risk hosts, obtain early imaging, typically with contrast-enhanced CT if renal function and contrast risk allow, or MRI if CT is contraindicated. In pregnancy, start with ultrasound and escalate thoughtfully if obstruction or abscess is suspected. In children, use ultrasound first for febrile UTI and add DMSA or VCUG selectively based on recurrence, severity, or abnormal ultrasound. I should confirm that this aligns with major guidelines, and yes, EAU, ACR, and IDSA-aligned sources support this risk-stratified, complication-driven approach [^113GGCdL] [^111G7rMD].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the bottom line. Imaging is not routinely required for uncomplicated pyelonephritis, but it becomes essential when the course is atypical, the patient is high risk, or there is treatment failure, because it detects abscess, obstruction, emphysematous change, or alternative diagnoses that change management. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while some single-center series suggest high rates of occult abscess even in "noncomplicated" patients, these findings have not overturned guideline-based selective imaging in general practice; they do underscore the importance of reassessment and imaging when the clinical trajectory is unfavorable [^116bBMxH] [^113GGCdL].

Routine imaging is **not required** for uncomplicated pyelonephritis [^113GGCdL]; obtain imaging if there is no clinical improvement within 48–72 hours [^112LEQSX], if the patient is immunocompromised [^115fxkfK], has diabetes, is pregnant, or has a history of stones or obstruction [^113GGCdL]. Ultrasound is **first-line** to assess for obstruction or abscess; use contrast-enhanced CT if complications are suspected or if ultrasound is inconclusive [^116VBMuJ]. MRI is an alternative when radiation or contrast is a concern [^112n9q4i]. Early imaging is indicated for **severe cases, sepsis, or suspected obstruction** to guide urgent intervention [^113Hqkrc].

## Indications for imaging in pyelonephritis

Imaging is **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated pyelonephritis [^113GGCdL]; however, certain clinical scenarios necessitate imaging to identify complications or underlying abnormalities:

- **Lack of clinical improvement**: No improvement within 48–72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Including diabetic patients, those with HIV, or those on immunosuppressive therapy [^113GGCdL].
- **Pregnancy**: Due to potential complications and the need to avoid radiation exposure [^113GGCdL].
- **History of urinary tract abnormalities**: Such as stones, obstruction, or prior renal surgery [^113GGCdL].
- **Severe presentation**: Sepsis, renal failure, or suspected obstruction [^1158HaP2].

## Recommended imaging modalities

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | - First-line imaging <br/> - Especially in pregnancy <br/> - And to assess for obstruction or abscess [^112n9q4i] | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Widely available | - Limited sensitivity for small abscesses or subtle parenchymal changes [^116bBMxH] |
| Computed tomography (CT) | - Suspected complications (abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis, obstruction) <br/> - Or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^116VBMuJ] | - High sensitivity and specificity <br/> - Detailed anatomical information | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast-related risks [^117YGtKm] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - Alternative to CT when radiation or contrast is a concern <br/> - Particularly in pregnancy or contrast allergies [^112n9q4i] | - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue contrast | - Limited availability <br/> - Higher cost <br/> - Contraindications (e.g. pacemakers) |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **EAU guidelines**: Recommend imaging to exclude urgent urological disorders, particularly in complicated cases or when there is no clinical improvement [^113gYepa].
- **ACR guidelines**: Emphasize selective imaging based on clinical judgment, patient risk factors, and response to therapy [^113GGCdL].
- **IDSA guidelines**: Focus on clinical assessment and culture-guided therapy, with imaging reserved for specific indications such as treatment failure or suspected complications [^112gtP1T].

## Potential risks and benefits of imaging

### Benefits

Imaging enables **early detection of complications** — such as abscess, obstruction, or emphysematous pyelonephritis — and guides appropriate management [^111Wbwm9]. It also identifies underlying structural abnormalities that may predispose to recurrent infections [^111Wh21Z].

---

### Risks

CT carries **radiation exposure**, particularly concerning in pregnant patients and children [^117YGtKm]. Contrast agents also carry risks, including allergic reactions and nephrotoxicity [^117YGtKm]. MRI has limited availability and higher cost, and certain contraindications may apply [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uncomplicated pyelonephritis**: No routine imaging required; clinical assessment and urine culture suffice [^116N2vgn].
- **Complicated pyelonephritis or treatment failure**: Imaging indicated, starting with ultrasound, followed by CT or MRI if necessary [^112n9q4i].
- **Pregnancy**: Ultrasound first-line; MRI as alternative to avoid radiation [^notfound].
- **Severe cases or suspected obstruction**: Immediate imaging with CT or ultrasound to guide urgent intervention [^114mM6SD].

---

Imaging for pyelonephritis is **selective**, guided by clinical course, host factors, and complications. Ultrasound is first-line, with CT or MRI reserved for complicated cases or when ultrasound is inconclusive.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^116EH9qJ]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is an extensively described, well-known disease. The first descriptions date to ancient Egypt, underlining its severity and its potential to lead to sepsis, kidney abscesses and destruction of the kidney parenchyma. In spite of this long history, the nomenclature of acute pyelonephritis is still controversial and the semantic ambiguities can still cause confusion.

A general consensus is reached only for the definition of complicated versus non-complicated pyelonephritis: the former term refers to the presence of systemic (such as HIV positivity, diabetes, neoplasia or collagen disease) or anatomical (such as active stone disease, obstruction, reflux nephropathy) predisposing factors, the latter term to their absence.

As Talner and co-workers underlined over 15 years ago, there is no agreement on the terminology of acute pyelonephritis and, as a consequence, on diagnostic definitions. Indeed there are two distinct and legitimate definitions, involving different diagnostic approaches. According to the "classical" one, reported in almost all textbooks of medicine, the definition is pathological, requiring the demonstration by imaging techniques or renal biopsy involvement (only rarely performed, limited to kidney transplants) of the renal parenchyma. According to this definition, upper urinary tract infections (UTI) can be classified as pyelonephritis (with evidence of parenchymal involvement) or pyelitis (without evidence of parenchymal involvement at imaging). Only the pathological approach, based on imaging techniques, is apt to identify the presence of kidney scars. This approach is often followed in children, as the pediatric literature usually underlines the importance of renal scars as a potential cause of progressive kidney damage and hypertension or of pre-eclampsia later in life. Nevertheless the issue is controversial and long-term effects of kidney scars have yet to be fully demonstrated.

### Clinical utility of FDG PET / CT in acute complicated pyelonephritis-results from an observational study [^1133WBSj]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute complicated pyelonephritis (ACP) is an upper urinary tract infection associated with coexisting urinary tract abnormalities or medical conditions that could predispose to serious outcomes or treatment failures. Although CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are frequently used in patients with ACP, the clinical value of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) has not been systematically investigated. This single-center retrospective study was designed to evaluate the potential usefulness of FDG PET/CT in patients with ACP.

Methods

Thirty-one adult patients with ACP who underwent FDG PET/CT were examined. FDG PET/CT imaging characteristics, including tracer uptake patterns, kidney volumes, and extrarenal imaging findings, were reviewed in combination with clinical data and conventional imaging results.

Results

Of the 31 patients, 19 (61%) showed focal FDG uptake. The remaining 12 study participants showed a diffuse FDG uptake pattern. After volumetric approximation, the affected kidneys were found to be significantly enlarged. Patients who showed a focal uptake pattern had a higher frequency of abscess formation requiring drainage. ACP patients showing diffuse tracer uptake patterns had a more benign clinical course. Seven patients had suspected extrarenal coinfections, and FDG PET/CT successfully confirmed the clinical suspicion in five cases. FDG PET/CT was as sensitive as CT in identifying the six patients (19%) who developed abscesses. Notably, FDG PET/CT findings caused a modification to the initial antibiotic regimen in nine patients (29%).

Conclusions

FDG PET/CT may be clinically useful in the assessment of patients with ACP who have a progressive disease course.

### Acute pyelonephritis in adults: a case series of 223 patients [^116bBMxH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a common disease which rarely evolves into abscesses.

Methods

We prospectively collected clinical, biochemical and radiological data of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of APN from 2000 to 2008.

Results

Urinary culture was positive in 64/208 patients (30.7%) and blood cultures in 39/182 cases (21.4%). Two hundred and thirteen patients were submitted to computed tomography (CT) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR): confirmation of APN was obtained in 196 patients (92%). Among these, 46 (23.5%) had positive urine culture, 31 (15.8%) had positive blood culture and 15 (7.6%) had positive cultures of both urine and blood. In 98 patients, either urine or blood cultures were negative, but CT/NMR were positive for APN. Fifty of the 213 patients submitted to CT/NMR (23.5%) had intrarenal abscesses: only 2 were evidenced by ultrasound examination. No differences were found between patients with positive or negative CT with regards to fever, leucocytosis, C-reactive protein, pyuria, urine cultures and duration of symptoms before hospitalization. No differences were found between patients with or without abscesses with regards to these parameters and risk factors. Patients with abscesses had a longer duration of treatment and hospitalization.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that in APN it is not always possible to routinely document urinary infection in a clinical setting. This finding could be explained by previous antibiotic treatment, low bacterial growth or atypical pathogens. Systematic CT or NMR is necessary to exclude evolution into abscesses, which cannot be suspected on clinical grounds or by ultrasound examination and may also develop in the absence of risk factors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute pyelonephritis in women [^116N2vgn]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a common bacterial infection of the renal pelvis and kidney most often seen in young adult women. History and physical examination are the most useful tools for diagnosis. Most patients have fever, although it may be absent early in the illness. Flank pain is nearly universal, and its absence should raise suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A positive urinalysis confirms the diagnosis in patients with a compatible history and physical examination. Urine culture should be obtained in all patients to guide antibiotic therapy if the patient does not respond to initial empiric antibiotic regimens. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen in acute pyelonephritis, and in the past decade, there has been an increasing rate of E. coli resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. Imaging, usually with contrast-enhanced computed tomography, is not necessary unless there is no improvement in the patient's symptoms or if there is symptom recurrence after initial improvement. Outpatient treatment is appropriate for most patients. Inpatient therapy is recommended for patients who have severe illness or in whom a complication is suspected. Practice guidelines recommend oral fluoroquinolones as initial outpatient therapy if the rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in the community is 10 percent or less. If the resistance rate exceeds 10 percent, an initial intravenous dose of ceftriaxone or gentamicin should be given, followed by an oral fluoroquinolone regimen. Oral beta-lactam antibiotics and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are generally inappropriate for outpatient therapy because of high resistance rates. Several antibiotic regimens can be used for inpatient treatment, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins.

### Different imaging strategies in febrile urinary tract infection in childhood. what, when, why? [^116JmvtG]. Pediatric Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem in childhood. During the last decade, published papers led to a deep revision in the use and usefulness of imaging tools in children with febrile UTIs. This new body of knowledge was partially endorsed by the guidelines published in 2007 by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and in 2011 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nevertheless, new data continuously arise and the scientific debate always revives. Recommendations of published guidelines and strengths and weaknesses of the available biochemical and imaging tools are here critically analysed for giving to the reader a complete, up-to-date and flexible overview on this hot topic.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111P5jJJ]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion), supported by low diagnostic yield data: in a single-institutional cohort of 163 women, cystoscopy identified only 9 clinically significant cases and only five were uniquely identified, and intravenous urography (IVU) was normal in 91.7% with only 5.5% positive IVUs among 164 female patients without management change; cystoscopy is not necessary for gross hematuria with a positive urine culture and no risk factors for urothelial malignancy, but if any risk factors are present cystoscopy should be performed, and further evaluation for bladder cancer should be performed with gross hematuria without documented infection; higher yield may occur in "high-risk" presentations (gross or persistent microscopic hematuria, pyelonephritis, atypical presentation), and for any patient with suspicion for pyelonephritis, or history of hematuria or renal calculi, upper tract imaging is recommended.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^116YpF2W]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — relationships of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), imaging, and scarring highlight that the role of VUR (and therefore of VCUG) is incompletely understood. Pyelonephritis (defined through cortical scintigraphy) can occur without VUR (defined through VCUG), and progressive renal scarring (defined through cortical scintigraphy) can occur without demonstrated VUR. The presumption that antimicrobial prophylaxis benefits individuals with VUR to prevent recurrences of UTI or development of renal scars is not supported by the aggregate of recent studies and is being examined in the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux study.

### Ultrasound detection of obstructive pyelonephritis due to urolithiasis in the ED [^113XChNi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Identifying acute pyelonephritis (APN) with early obstructive uropathy is clinically important in the emergency department (ED) because obstructive urolithiasis is an independent risk factor for inpatient death, prolonged hospitalization, and failure of outpatient APN therapy. Furthermore, diagnosis of an early obstructive uropathy can be difficult when based solely on clinical findings. Clinicians may assume the cause of the patient's symptoms to be APN alone, without considering the concurrent presence of an obstructing stone. A feasible screening test to detect early obstructive uropathy in cases of APN has not been previously identified. Plain film radiographs are insensitive in locating a suspected calcified stone. Computed tomography is readily available in most EDs and clearly defines urologic anatomy, but delivers unnecessary ionizing radiation, can prolong ED length of stay, and is not cost-effective as a screening test for all patients diagnosed with APN. We report a case in which a bedside ultrasound identifying hydronephrosis prompted confirmatory computed tomography imaging and emergency consultation of a patient with APN. In this case, hydronephrosis on bedside ultrasound examination was an indirect marker of a distal ureteral obstruction. By detecting the presence of hydronephrosis in patients with APN, emergency physicians may dramatically increase their ability to identify those patients that need further radiographic investigation and ultimately decrease the rate of outpatient treatment failure. Further surveillance data are needed to determine the statistical characteristics of this novel screening test and if routine renal evaluation of all patients with APN is warranted.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a complicated febrile urinary tract infection detected by point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department [^114mM6SD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) include a spectrum of pathologies from uncomplicated pyelonephritis to urosepsis, including xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Most febrile UTIs are treated with antibiotics alone, but studies indicate nearly 12% of cases of presumed simple pyelonephritis require emergent urologic intervention. How to identify these individuals, while limiting unnecessary advanced imaging and delays in diagnosis, challenges all emergency providers. We review the diagnosis and management of XGP, as well as the evidence regarding the role of renal ultrasound in the identification of complicated presentations of febrile UTIs.

Case Report

We present a case of XGP, a complicated febrile UTI requiring immediate urologic intervention, diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasound. A 40-year-old female presented in severe sepsis and complaining of flank pain. Prompt bedside ultrasound demonstrated hydronephrosis, expediting definitive urologic treatment via percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With a mortality rate exceeding 40%, obstructed pyonephrosis requires prompt decompression. Given its exceptional sensitivity for identifying hydronephrosis and ability to detect abscesses and emphysematous changes, we advocate a point-of-care ultrasound-first approach to screen for cases of complicated febrile UTIs in order to expedite treatment and limit radiation in uncomplicated presentations.

### Risk factors for imaging abnormalities after the first febrile urinary tract infection in infants ≤ 3 months old: a retrospective cohort study [^113QzyVn]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, this is a pilot study in our institution to identify clinical and laboratory risk factors associated with imaging abnormalities after the first febrile UTI in infants ≤ 3 months old. Non- E. coli UTI was independently associated with imaging abnormalities, while bacteraemia and non- E. coli UTI were independently associated with recurrent UTI. Future studies are required to build a robust prediction model to aid physicians in risk stratifying infants after the first episode of pyelonephritis and therefore avoiding unnecessary investigations and follow-up.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: case report [^114tkX4R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the emergency department (ED), pyelonephritis is a fairly common diagnosis, especially in patients with unilateral flank pain. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare type of pyelonephritis that is associated with unique features, which may lead to its diagnosis.

Case Report

A 30-year-old male patient presented to the ED for evaluation of right-sided abdominal pain that has been ongoing for the past 24 hours. He noted the pain was located predominantly in the right flank and described it as sharp in nature. The pain was nonradiating and was associated with scant hematuria. He stated that he had similar pains approximately 1 month earlier that resolved after a few days. The patient underwent a bedside ultrasound and a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed an enlarged, multiloculated right kidney with dilated calyces and a large staghorn calculus, findings that represent XGP. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report highlights an unusual variant of pyelonephritis, a relatively common ED diagnosis. XGP should be considered in patients with recurrent pyelonephritis, as treatment for XGP may require surgical intervention in addition to traditional antibiotic management.

### Imaging in urinary tract infections: current strategies and new trends [^112Gh2k2]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in a child with urinary tract infection (UTI) is to detect abnormalities that require appropriate treatment or findings that can be acted on to prevent development of complications (hypertension, chronic renal failure or pregnancy-related complications). Imaging protocols in pediatric urinary tract infections are evolving. From strategies based on extensive investigations in all children younger than 7 years of age, we are slowly moving to imaging strategies focused on children at risk of developing renal damage and possibly long-term complications. The article provides an overview on urinary tract infections, their complications and the use of imaging in their management. The different imaging strategies in children with UTIs (including the recommendation of excluding from imaging certain groups of patients) still needs full evaluation. It is interesting to note, however, a slow move from wide use of cystography in all children with UTI, which has been standard practice for many years but was probably not based on solid scientific evidence, toward a more focused use of cystograms in specific groups of children.

### Pyelonephritis: radiologic-pathologic review [^116JWHpo]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common urologic disease in the United States and annually account for over 7 million office and 1 million emergency department visits. In adults, diagnosis of urinary tract infection is typically based on characteristic clinical features and abnormal laboratory values. Imaging is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to therapy and for those whose clinical presentation is either atypical or potentially life threatening. Urinary tract infection typically originates in the urinary bladder; when it migrates to the kidney or is seeded there hematogenously, a tubulointerstitial inflammatory reaction ensues, involving the renal pelvis and parenchyma. The condition is characterized as pyelonephritis. Complicated and uncomplicated pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, and tuberculosis are all urinary tract infections for which imaging evaluation adds diagnostic information important for patient care. Computed tomography (CT), when performed before, immediately after, and at delayed intervals from contrast material injection, is the preferred modality for evaluating acute bacterial pyelonephritis. CT is also preferred over conventional radiography and ultrasonography (US) for assessing emphysematous pyelonephritis. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a chronic granulomatous process, induced by recurrent bacterial urinary tract infection. Although US is useful in the diagnosis of this condition, CT is the main imaging tool, as it provides highly specific findings and accurate assessment of the extrarenal extent of disease, which is essential for surgical planning. The increasing prevalence of tuberculosis and continued emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains have significance for genitourinary radiologists, as the urinary tract is the most common extrapulmonary site of tuberculosis. Familiarity with the renal manifestations of the disease — pelvoinfundibular strictures, papillary necrosis, cortical low-attenuation masses, scarring, and calcification — will help in the diagnosis, even in the absence of documented pulmonary disease.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (evaluation), ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend to suspect pyelonephritis in pregnant patients with fever (≥ 38.0 °C) and urine tests suggesting UTI, with additional symptoms of upper genitourinary tract infection (such as flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness) supporting the diagnosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^117W3So1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Imaging of renal infections and inflammatory disease [^111Wbwm9]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma and collecting system. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings of fever, flank pain, and urinary tract infection. Computed tomography findings include renal enlargement with wedge-shaped heterogeneous areas of decreased enhancement, known as a "striated nephrogram". Imaging is primarily used to diagnose complications such as emphysematous pyelonephritis, renal abscess, and pyonephrosis. Chronic pyelonephritis can have varying appearances on imaging ranging from xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis or, in extreme cases, renal replacement lipomatosis.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^112LEQSX]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — imaging and endoscopy: There are currently no specific guidelines for imaging studies for women with rUTI; indications for imaging in women with UTI include persistent symptoms, including persistent fever after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy, rapid recurrence after appropriate treatment, suspected stone or obstruction, and higher-risk diabetes. Cystourethroscopy should be considered if a woman is at risk for suspected foreign body, although the utility of cystoscopy in evaluation of rUTI has not been well studied; one retrospective study reported that 3.8% of the 163 participants had specific findings on cystoscopy that imaging would not detect. Cystoscopy with cytology should be performed when there is clinical suspicion for premalignancy or malignancy. For suspected stones, assessment can be initiated with plain abdominal radiographs, and when a more complete assessment of the upper tracts is warranted, renal ultrasound or computed tomographic urogram should be used; in general, a computed tomographic urogram, which is with and without intravenous contrast, is the imaging modality of choice in suspected pyelonephritis and renal and perirenal abscess, and it can also identify a possible source of infection such as renal or ureteric stones.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^11475eQo]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

In spite of the severity of the lesions we found a high prevalence of incomplete clinical presentations, lacking the full-blown syndrome classically described as high fever, signs or history of recent lower UTI, costovertebral flank pain or tenderness and positive urinary cultures (table 2). The three symptoms were present at hospitalization in about one third of cases and lower urinary tract symptoms were present in about half of the patients (47%). These clinical hallmarks are usually included in the enrollment criteria for clinical trials for APN, together with positive urinary cultures and no recent antibiotic therapy. According to these criteria, only about 10% of our patients would have been eligible for a recent clinical trial on APN (table 2).

The frequent negativity of the urinary cultures deserves further comment. About half of the cases were treated with antibiotics but the difference between cases with positive and negative cultures was only marginally significant (p = 0.051). The relatively long interval between onset of symptoms and hospitalization and the frequent lack of lower urinary tract symptoms suggest alternative and adjunctive explanations.

Interestingly, a similar prevalence was found in a previous study, performed in a different setting (the largest University Hospital of the Region) in 2004–2006, in which the prevalence of positive urinary cultures was even lower (20.7%), albeit with a higher recall of antibiotic therapy (95%). This observation may indicate a "referral" bias (patients are usually referred to the emergency room after a few days of empirical therapy), more than a laboratory bias.

To further assess this point, we planned an analysis in the Emergency room to test the hypothesis that, in some cases, cultures may have been performed after the first dose of intravenous antibiotics (as may occur overnight or during the weekend, when urine sampling may be erroneously postponed in a crowded ER). The analysis is still ongoing; however even if the sampling may have been biased in some cases, this finding draws attention to the fact that urinary cultures can become negative after a single antibiotic dose, even in the presence of renal abscesses or multiple lesions.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^112b25vP]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Data collection and analysis

The following general data were collected: age, sex, parity, country of origin, previous UTI, previous history of pyelonephritis, previous stone disease. By definition, patients with kidney stones were not included. At referral, the following clinical data were collected: fever (presence, considered as > 37°C; maximum level on the day of hospitalization), costovertebral angle-tenderness, lower UTI symptoms, other symptoms; antibiotic therapy within the last 72 hours; other therapies.

Laboratory data were obtained by standard laboratory methods. The following data, obtained in the Emergency Room at hospitalization, were considered: serum creatinine, CRP, blood cell counts, urinary culture (available in all cases), hemocultures and results of dipstick urinalysis were also recorded when available.

On the basis of their radiological appearance, the lesions were dichotomized in "simple" versus abscessed (at least one abscessed lesion) and in single versus multiple. Further imaging parameters were unilateral versus bilateral involvement and presence of kidney scars at diagnosis.

Informed consent for publication of the clinical data in anonymous form was obtained from all patients at the first nephrological control. Further specific informed consent was obtained from the patient whose images are depicted in Figures 1 and 2.

Figure 1
Large simple lesion: a) T1 weighted sequence showing a large pyelonephritis focus in the right kidney; b) same area in diffusion: the large cuneiform lesion is clearly evident due to the intense edema.

Figure 2
(same patient as in figure 1)large abscessed lesion: a9 T1 weighted late contrast sequence showing a large abscessed focus in the right kidney; b) same area at diffusion. The round shape is clearly evident in both sequences.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analysis was performed as appropriate (mean and standard deviation for parametric data and median and range for non-parametric data). Student's t-test, chi-square test and ANOVA were used for comparisons between groups. Significance was set at < 0.05.

Univariate odds ratios and multivariate regressions were calculated in SPSS (version 17.0). Logistic regression was performed considering the type of lesion (abscessed lesion) or the number of lesions (multiple lesions) as outcomes, with respect to the main clinical data (age, fever, costovertebral tenderness, lower urinary tract symptoms, duration of symptoms and their combination), presence of renal scars and C-reactive protein as a marker of inflammation. Continuous data were dichotomized at the median.

Methods

Study setting and main diagnostic pathway

All consecutive patients hospitalized for acute pyelonephritis in the Urology and Nephrology, Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine wards of the hospital san Luigi Gonzaga in the period June 2005-December 2009 were included in the study. All patients were referred to the Nephrology Unit during hospitalization for the planning of subsequent follow-up and were followed in the Nephrology Unit at least until clinical and radiological healing.

Data were gathered prospectively, starting from the first clinical visit to the Nephrology Unit.

The san Luigi Gonzaga Hospital is a 300-bed university hospital (350, including day-hospital beds); the geographic area covers approximately 100,000 inhabitants. All patients were hospitalized from the hospital Emergency Room (ER); the ER performed over 41,000 visits per year in the first period (May 2005-May 2006) and over 55,000 per year in the last one (January 2009-December 2009).

Clinical definitions

The diagnosis of APN was made by the ER physicians; diagnosis was based on the presence of at least one of the three main symptoms (fever, costovertebral angle tenderness or pain, recent or present UTI) and at least one sign of systemic infection (high WBC or C-reactive protein). The presence of leukocytes or nitrites was an ancillary criterion supporting the presence of UTI. The presence of shivers, routinely evaluated in the Emergency Room as part of the patients' work-up, was not uniformly recorded and was not considered as sensitive enough to be added to the selection criteria.

The diagnosis of present or recent UTI was mainly based on the clinical history and on the clinical symptoms; in fact, in our setting, patients usually start an empirical therapy (either prescribed by the family physician or self-prescribed) before undergoing urinary tests, in particular if they are prone to develop UTI. This is also the reason why, in our opinion, the prevalence of positive urinary cultures was relatively low.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to definitive therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available in patients with confirmed complicated UTI, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^115J4v2T]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

It is difficult to explain the higher prevalence of positive cultures in non-abscessed lesions. Our hypothesis is that this may be due to the fact that the bacteria are "sequestered" in abscessed lesions. However further analysis on larger cohorts is needed to confirm this apparent paradox.

The difficulty in diagnosing APN is further underlined by the fact that over 15% of the patients displayed renal scars at the first imaging test, presumably as a result of previous APN episodes; APN had been previously diagnosed in only a minority of them (3/18).

In this context and within these limits, the major finding of our study is the lack of correlation between the severity of the renal lesions and the clinical and biochemical data at presentation (table 1, table 2, table 3 table 4). In fact oligosymptomatic presentation may coexist with abscessed or multifocal lesions and none of the tested parameters discriminated the severity of parenchymal involvement. This is of particular relevance for abscessed lesions which require long-term antibiotic therapy and are at high risk for the development of kidney scars.

Like all clinical studies, ours has strengths and weaknesses. The main strengths are the novelty and the systematic referral pattern with a diagnostic use of second-line imaging techniques. To our knowledge, this is the largest series of adults published in the last 10 years, combining a clinical and imaging work-up of all cases of suspected APN referred to the ER of a relatively large hospital in a short time span.

The limitations are partly shared by single-center observational studies. In the absence of a control group and of epidemiological data on the world-wide incidence of "non-complicated" APN, our data are hardly comparable with the literature. The suggestion that we may be dealing with negative selection of the cases, possibly due to the extensive filter of family physicians, needs further confirmation on a larger scale and in different settings. A potential confounder is the high prevalence of negative urinary cultures, possibly reflecting the policy of empirical antibiotic treatment before hospital referral and the lack of lower urinary symptoms but also perhaps related to late testing. This issue needs further analysis, also in view of the lack of recent epidemiological data on the prevalence of negative urinary cultures in APN.

These limitations may become suggestions for further studies on the prevalence and type of parenchymal involvement and on the clinical presentation in settings with different incidence and referral patterns.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^1138GJZn]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Imaging criteria

The diagnosis of pyelonephritis required demonstration of involvement of the kidney parenchyma. In cases with clinical suspicion of APN, in which no predisposing condition was found at ultrasounds, a "second-line" imaging test was performed. Since patients with non-complicated APN are mostly women of childbearing age, MR was chosen as the preferred imaging technique and CT scan or scintigraphy was performed only in the case of contraindications or logistical problems (long wait before availability of MR scan). As a rule, imaging data were obtained within 3 days after hospitalization.

In view of the low sensitivity of ultrasounds for the presence of parenchymal lesions and the high sensitivity for obstructive lesions, the ultrasound imaging was used to identify the presence of anatomical predisposing factors.

At the MR scan, the diagnosis of APN requires the demonstration of the following: in the basal imaging test, the presence of minor alteration with non-homogeneous hypointensity in T1-weighted sequences and hyperintensity in T2-weighted sequences. After the injection of contrast medium (Gadolinium), in T1-weighted sequences, reduction of parenchymal contrast enhancement in the affected area is observed. Abscessed areas are defined by a peripheral halo enhancement after contrast medium.

Diffusion (DWI) sequences were also studied. APN is characterized by areas of reduction of the diffusivity of the water molecules (hyperintense in sequences b = 600); however the finding is less specific.

At the CT scan, the diagnosis of APN requires the demonstration of the following alterations after contrast medium: decreased enhancement with a "striped" effect of the renal parenchyma; the triangular shape originally described (lobar nephronia) in the area of decreased perfusion is typical, but not required for diagnosis.

Kidney abscesses are defined by the presence of a hyperintense peripheral border, with a marked hypodensity of the lesion (necrosis), after contrast medium.

Ancillary signs of APN, both at CT and MR scans, are: kidney swelling, perinephric inflammatory fluid and stranding of the perinephric fat and occasionally a minimal dilation of the urinary tract.

At DMSA-scintigraphy, the diagnosis of APN requires the demonstration of areas of altered perfusion; the definition of kidney abscesses is not possible by this technique.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^1152JPfg]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is differently defined according to imaging or clinical criteria. In adults information on the relationship between imaging and clinical data is lacking. Our study was aimed at analysing the relationship between the clinical and imaging presentation of APN, defined according to imaging criteria (parenchymal involvement at MR or CT scan).

Methods

All consecutive patients hospitalized for "non-complicated" APN were considered (June 2005-December 2009). Clinical, biochemical and imaging data at hospitalization were analyzed by univariate and logistic regression analysis.

Results

There were 119 patients, all females, median age 32 years (15–72). At hospitalization, inflammatory markers were elevated (CRP median: 12.1 mg/dL, normal < 0.8). Incomplete presentations were frequent: fever was absent in 6.7%, pain in 17.8%, lower urinary tract symptoms in 52.9%. At CT or MR scan the lesions were bilateral in 12.6%, multiple in 79.8%; abscesses were present in 39.5%. Renal scars were found in 15.1%. Positive cultures were correlated with multiple foci (multivariate OR 4.2; CI 1.139–15.515). No other sign/symptom discriminated between small lesions, abscesses or multifocal involvement.

Conclusions

APN is a protean disease. In the absence of strict correlation with clinical or biochemical markers, imaging studies are required to assess the severity of kidney involvement.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections due to bacterial persistence or reinfection in women-does this factor impact upper tract imaging findings? [^113rCkwA]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared the rates of upper tract imaging abnormalities of recurrent urinary tract infections due to bacterial persistence or reinfection.

Materials and Methods

Following institutional review board approval we reviewed a prospectively maintained database of women with documented recurrent urinary tract infections (3 or more per year) and trigonitis. We searched for demographic data, urine culture findings and findings on radiology interpreted upper tract imaging, including renal ultrasound, computerized tomography or excretory urogram. Patients with irretrievable images, absent or incomplete urine culture results for review, no imaging performed, an obvious source of recurrent urinary tract infections or a history of pyelonephritis were excluded from analysis.

Results

Of 289 women from 2006 to 2014 with symptomatic recurrent urinary tract infections 116 met study inclusion criteria. Mean ± SD age was 65.0 ± 14.4 years. Of the women 95% were white and 81% were postmenopausal. Almost a third were sexually active and none had prolapse stage 2 or greater. Of the 116 women 48 (41%) had persistent and 68 (59%) had reinfection recurrent urinary tract infection. Imaging included ultrasound in 52 patients, computerized tomography in 26, ultrasound and computerized tomography in 31, and excretory urogram with ultrasound/computerized tomography in 7. Of the total of 58 imaging findings in 55 women 57 (98%) were noncontributory. One case (0.9%) of mild hydronephrosis was noted in the persistent recurrent urinary tract infection group but it was not related to any clinical parameters. Escherichia coli was the dominant bacteria in 71% of persistent and 47% of reinfection recurrent urinary tract infections in the most recently reported urine culture.

Conclusions

This study reaffirms that upper tract imaging is not indicated for bacterial reinfection, recurrent urinary tract infections. However, the same conclusion can be extended to recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to bacterial persistence, thus, questioning the routine practice of upper tract studies in white postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections and trigonitis.

Urinary infections are common. Typically, infections of the upper and lower urinary tract do not require imaging. However, in the presence of confirmed or suspected complicated urinary tract infections, imaging to assess for underlying causes and complications is required. Computed tomography imaging is useful in identifying predisposing structural abnormalities of the urinary tracts and complications of urologic infection. Ultrasonography can be used to identify hydronephrosis and may be used to guide percutaneous intervention. Recurrent chronic infections can lead to end organ damage or chronic granulomatous processes. Rarely, systemic inflammatory disorders can involve the upper and lower urinary tracts.

### Clinically unsuspected pyelonephritis in children younger than 7 years [^116XiH2k]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pyelonephritis is the most common serious bacterial infection in children and is a common cause for admission of children with fever of unknown origin to the ED. Most children with urinary tract infection (UTI) and fever have pyelonephritis. The diagnosis in most children is typically based upon clinical evaluation, positive urinalysis, and urine cultures. But diagnosing young children can be challenging due to limited verbal communication and non-specific symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting.

CT is a sensitive imaging technique for evaluation of acute abdominal pathologies, most commonly appendicitis. CT is typically performed after an equivocal or negative US in children with acute abdominal pain. CT is sensitive for evaluation of renal pathologies, and an animal study demonstrated that CT is equally sensitive and reliable for the detection of acute pyelonephritis compared with 99mTc-DMSA. A study in 36 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis suggested higher accuracy of CT as compared with 99mTc-DMSA. In children with a clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis, CT has the advantage of evaluating for a renal abscess and alternative diagnoses. The findings of pyelonephritis in CT include striated enhancement, hypodensity, perirenal stranding, and uroepithelial enhancement.

There are only a few studies of children diagnosed with pyelonephritis based on CT. Given that the clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis in young children can be challenging, we wanted to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of CT-diagnosed pyelonephritis that was not clinically suspected in children under 7 years of age.

### The role of gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for children with suspected acute pyelonephritis [^112C4MnP]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The diagnosis of pyelonephritis is primarily clinical. However, the history and physical findings can be confusing in children, leading to adjunctive nuclear renal cortical scintigraphic studies (99mtechnetium dimercapto-succinic acid [DMSA]) to confirm the diagnosis. Nonetheless, ambiguity occurs when differentiating between acute pyelonephritis and chronic scarring. We report our initial experience with gadolinium enhanced inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose acute pyelonephritis.

Materials and Methods

Nine patients 7 months to 18 years old (mean age 81 months) underwent MRI to confirm radiographically a clinical suspicion of acute pyelonephritis. All patients had at least 1 prior episode of clinical pyelonephritis. Data were collected to determine whether acute pyelonephritic changes could be differentiated from chronic pyelonephritis on the basis of MRI characteristics.

Results

Of the 9 patients 4 were identified as having acute pyelonephritis on MRI (persistently high signal intensity after gadolinium), 2 demonstrated evidence of postpyelonephritic scar (parenchymal loss without change in signal intensity), 1 had evidence of acute pyelonephritis and chronic changes, and 2 had a completely normal examination (decreased signal intensity after gadolinium). At our institution the billable cost of MRI to the patient is $1,329, while the billable cost of 99mtechnetium DMSA is $1,459. All patients younger than 6 years required intravenous sedation for MRI, whereas 70% of those younger than 6 years require intravenous sedation for DMSA scanning at our institution. MRI provided greater anatomical detail regarding the renal architecture without radiation exposure, and allowed the unambiguous diagnosis of acute versus chronic pyelonephritis scar in a 1-time (versus often multipart for DMSA) imaging study.

Conclusions

In cases where adjunctive imaging studies are useful to make a diagnosis gadolinium enhanced inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging allows the detection of acute pyelonephritis rapidly, cost-effectively and safely in the pediatric population.

### Infectious and inflammatory diseases of the urinary tract: role of MR imaging [^112n9q4i]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common of bacterial infections. Imaging studies are only required in cases of complicated UTIs. Ultrasound remains the first-line imaging method; however, CT is the gold standard for evaluation of UTIs. MR imaging's improved contrast resolution and absence of ionizing radiation may recommend its use for assessment of lower UTIs. Furthermore, MR imaging performs with diagnostic accuracy at least similar to CT in complicated UTIs, except for the identification of calculi and emphysematous pyelonephritis. In this article, the role of MR imaging for the evaluation of infectious and inflammatory disease processes of the urinary tract is reviewed.

### Excluding confusable diseases in patients with presumptive diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: a large patient cohort study [^115hy7ty]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Most IC guidelines list urinary tuberculosis and genitourinary cancer as confusable diseases; therefore, they must be excluded from IC during the diagnosis process. The American Urological Association guidelines, do not mention the need for imaging studies. In the earlier East Asian guidelines, urine cytology and cystoscopy were included as basic tests, whereas pelvic imaging studies and bladder biopsy were optional. In the most recent East Asian guidelines, ultrasonography was included as a basic test. The 2008 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines did not include urine cytology and imaging studies as basic diagnostic tests. However, ultrasound has been included in recent diagnostic guidelines for the urologic phenotyping of pelvic pain, Most of these guidelines are based on the predominant disease patterns in high‐income countries. Therefore, special care should be taken to exclude confusable conditions in areas where certain diseases, such as tuberculosis, are rare.

Of the seven patients finally treated with anti‐tuberculosis medication, 5 (71.4%) had positive urine tuberculosis test results. The percentage of patients suspected of having urinary tuberculosis on imaging examination was 0.9% (n = 6). One patient showed acute pyelonephritis on CT. In total, five patients showed tuberculosis in both urine tuberculosis tests and imaging examinations. Urinary bladder tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose but appears in imaging studies as caliectasis, hydronephrosis, ureteral stricture, and contracted bladder. Although there were very few cases of urinary tuberculosis, this study reminds us of the importance of imaging studies in the screening phase in areas where tuberculosis is commonly found. As the detection rate of urine AFB smears and cultures in the diagnosis of tuberculosis is poor, methods with increased sensitivity have been developed, such as urine AFB fluorescence staining and MTB and NTM PCR. It is noteworthy that a 43.8‐year‐old female patient (case 7 in Table 2) was not suspected of having tuberculosis in either the imaging study or urine tuberculosis test; however, a granuloma consistent with tuberculosis was found in the bladder specimen after cystectomy.

Multidetector CT technique

Indwelling bladder catheters should be closed before performing CT, although in most patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction, bladder distension is poorly tolerated. A preliminary unenhanced acquisition is useful for detecting calcific urolithiasis, which may require specific treatment. Unless contraindicated by history of allergy or impaired renal function, administration of 110 to 130 mL of non-ionic low- or iso-osmolar iodinated contrast medium (CM) such as 350 mgI/mL iomeprol, 320 mgI/ml iodixanol, or 370 mgI/mL iopromide is generally beneficial. According to the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines, special care in ensuring adequate hydration before and after CT is recommended to improve urinary tract opacification and to prevent CM nephrotoxicity in septic or dehydrated patients with limited urine output.

In patients with clinically suspected or confirmed UTI, a single breath-hold nephrographic CT acquisition encompassing the abdomen, pelvis and perineum is obtained after intravenous CM injection. On our 64-slice CT scanner, the usual acquisition parameters include 80–140 KV according to body size and weight, automated tube current modulation, 0.75 s rotation time, and 64 × 0.625 mm collimation. Additional excretory phase imaging acquired 5–20 min after CM injection visualises the opacified urinary collecting systems, ureter and bladder. In contrast to classical multiphasic CT studies, modern split-bolus CT urography protocols provide combined corticomedullary, nephrographic and excretory imaging with a reduced effective radiation dose in a single volumetric acquisition. Multidetector CT studies tailored to the urinary tract should be routinely reconstructed along axial, coronal and sagittal planes, and may be reviewed interactively at the workstation and complemented by additional focused reconstructions such as coronal maximum-intensity projection (MIP) pyelographic images.

CT is very appealing to clinicians and radiologists, since it provides a comprehensive anatomic and functional assessment of the entire urogenital tract, including information on renal perfusion and opacification of the urinary cavities. However, it should be used with caution, given its key intrinsic disadvantage of irradiation risk, particularly in young patients and women of reproductive age. With the above-described protocol, the estimated radiation exposure from each phase of acquisition generally falls in the range of 8 to 12 mGy. Strategies for dose reduction, such as automated tube current modulation or, if available, iterative reconstruction from raw CT data, are recommended.

### Emphysematous pyelonephritis: clues to rapid diagnosis in the emergency department [^116c7w9X]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is an acute life-threatening bacterial infection. EPN leads to rapid necrotizing destruction of the renal parenchyma and peri-renal tissue, requiring early and aggressive care to reduce morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have described the use of computed tomography scan and radiology-performed ultrasound to make the diagnosis of EPN We report a case of EPN diagnosed by bedside Emergency Department (ED) ultrasound performed by emergency physicians, allowing a more rapid diagnosis and subsequent treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pyelonephritis: 2022 update [^113GGCdL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) that has the potential to cause sepsis, shock, and death. In the majority of patients, uncomplicated APN is diagnosed clinically and is responsive to treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In patients who are high risk or when treatment is delayed, microabscesses may coalesce to form an acute renal abscess. High-risk patients include those with a prior history of pyelonephritis, lack of response to therapy for lower UTI or for APN, diabetes, anatomic or congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, infections by treatment-resistant organisms, nosocomial infection, urolithiasis, renal obstruction, prior renal surgery, advanced age, pregnancy, renal transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients and patients with renal transplants on immunosuppression are at an elevated risk of severe complications. Imaging studies are often requested to aid with the diagnosis, identify precipitating factors, and differentiate lower UTI from renal parenchymal involvement, particularly in high-risk individuals. Imaging is usually not appropriate for the first-time presentation of suspected APN in an uncomplicated patient. The primary imaging modalities used in high-risk patients with suspected APN are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, although CT was usually not appropriate for initial imaging in a pregnant patient with no other complications. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Current status of radionuclide renal cortical imaging in pyelonephritis [^113X4BUJ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pyelonephritis is an infection of the kidneys that is seen more commonly in children than the adults. 99m Tc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (99m Tc-DMSA) scanning is a radionuclide imaging study to detect renal scarring after acute pyelonephritis (a late 99m Tc-DMSA scan) and also helps to diagnose acute pyelonephritis in febrile urinary tract infections (an acute 99m Tc-DMSA scan). Planar imaging in multiple views (posterior and bilateral posterior oblique) is generally used. Pinhole imaging with a high-resolution-collimator magnification of each kidney allows detection of smaller cortical defects. SPECT is optional. SPECT/CT is not recommended in children because it has a higher radiation exposure than routine 99m Tc-DMSA scans. The main limitations of 99m Tc-DMSA scanning include a relatively long waiting time after radiotracer injection, a long acquisition time, and a high radiation dose, which is particularly important in repeated studies on children and with the limited spatial resolution of γ-cameras. 99m Tc-glucoheptonate is an alternative radiotracer when 99m Tc-DMSA is not available. Radiotracers for dynamic renal functional imaging can grossly assess the renal cortex in the first few minutes of imaging. 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (68 Ga-PSMA ligand) PET has the ability to provide images of normal renal cortex and demonstrate renal cortical defects from cysts. In this article, we assess the current status of renal cortical imaging and present 68 Ga-PSMA ligand PET images. 68 Ga-PSMA ligand provides excellent renal cortical images, and studies should be done to compare 68 Ga-PSMA ligand PET with 99m Tc-DMSA scanning in renal diseases, particularly in pyelonephritis.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^112mR31R]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is differently defined according to imaging or clinical criteria. In adults information on the relationship between imaging and clinical data is lacking.

Our study was aimed at analysing the relationship between the clinical and imaging presentation of APN, defined according to imaging criteria (parenchymal involvement at MR or CT scan).

Methods

All consecutive patients hospitalized for "non-complicated" APN were considered (June 2005-December 2009). Clinical, biochemical and imaging data at hospitalization were analyzed by univariate and logistic regression analysis.

Results

There were 119 patients, all females, median age 32 years (15–72). At hospitalization, inflammatory markers were elevated (CRP median: 12.1 mg/dL, normal < 0.8). Incomplete presentations were frequent: fever was absent in 6.7%, pain in 17.8%, lower urinary tract symptoms in 52.9%. At CT or MR scan the lesions were bilateral in 12.6%, multiple in 79.8%; abscesses were present in 39.5%. Renal scars were found in 15.1%. Positive cultures were correlated with multiple foci (multivariate OR 4.2; CI 1.139–15.515). No other sign/symptom discriminated between small lesions, abscesses or multifocal involvement.

Conclusions

APN is a protean disease. In the absence of strict correlation with clinical or biochemical markers, imaging studies are required to assess the severity of kidney involvement.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of urinary tract obstruction [^1158HaP2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute obstructive uropathy is a medical emergency, which often is accompanied by acute renal failure or sepsis. Treatment options to resolve the acute obstructive process include conservative medical management, retrograde ureteral stenting, or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy or nephroureteral catheters. It is important to understand the various treatment options in differing clinical scenarios in order to guide appropriate consultation. Prompt attention to the underlying obstructive process is often imperative to avoid further deterioration of the patient's clinical status. A summary of the data and most up-to-date clinical trials regarding treatment options for urinary tract obstruction is outlined in this publication. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

Conclusion

Ultrasound can achieve a high sensitivity and specificity for the depiction of ureteral calculi and acute obstruction and has several advantages including its availability, lower cost and absence of radiation. Thus, it should be considered the first imaging modality in patients with renal colic. No more complications, serious adverse events, return emergency department visits or hospitalisations are expected using US first instead of CT. CT should be reserved for patients in whom US does not obtain a diagnosis, if symptoms do not resolve or there is a suspicion of alternative diagnoses.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Over the last 5 years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI, but either do not address or differ in definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children that addresses its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent and comorbidities. This guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. The guideline presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. It also reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management. Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from recurrent UTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI, and its relatively small benefits in specific subgroups need to be weighed against the risk of resistance, with at least 6-monthly reevaluation for its requirement. Longer-term follow-up should aim to assess the need for surgical intervention to reduce the risk of renal damage.

Despite cUTI being common in children, differences in definition and focus on uncomplicated infection have led to scarce high-grade evidence for management, that is also difficult to synthesize. Apart from RCT-based recommendations for CAP in children with urological abnormality, these guidelines are largely based on retrospective studies and expert consensus in areas where high-quality evidence is currently lacking. In addition, available evidence mostly comes from resource-rich settings, and in resource-limited settings there may be some barriers to accessing some investigations and treatments, for example, nuclear medicine imaging and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, most first-line investigations in the guideline are broadly available and most antibiotic recommendations are from the World Health Organization Access list which should be available in most countries. Therefore, these guidelines can be effectively implemented in most healthcare settings, even in resource-limited environments.

### Imaging of vesicoureteral reflux: expert panel narrative review [^115egini]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common congenital anomaly of the urinary tract that can present with collecting system dilation or as a febrile infection. VUR can lead to permanent renal sequelae requiring surgery but can also spontaneously resolve without complication. Therefore, recognizing patient populations who warrant imaging for screening, confirmation, or ongoing surveillance for VUR is important, as is avoiding overdiagnosis. In the appropriate patient populations, an accurate diagnosis of VUR allows early treatment and prevention of pyelonephritis and scarring. Various imaging modalities are available to diagnose and grade VUR, including voiding cystourethrography, radionucleotide cystography, and contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS). The objective of this article is to summarize the current understanding of VUR diagnosis and management and to discuss these imaging modalities' strengths and pitfalls. Considerations include indications for VUR imaging, patient preparation, conduct of the examination, issues related to radiologic reporting, and cost-effectiveness. An emphasis is placed on ceVUS, which is the most recently introduced of the three imaging modalities and is receiving growing support among pediatric radiologists.

### Imaging of acute pyelonephritis in the adult [^117JX8Lv]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in adults is predominantly made by a combination of typical clinical features of flank pain, high temperature and dysuria combined with urinalysis findings of bacteruria and pyuria. Imaging is generally reserved for patients who have atypical presenting features or in those who fail to respond to conventional therapy. In addition, early imaging may be useful in diabetics or immunocompromised patients. In such patients, imaging may not only aid in making the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, but more importantly, it may help identify complications such as abscess formation. In this pictorial review, we discuss the role of modern imaging in acute pyelonephritis and its complications. We discuss the growing role of cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) and novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that may be used to demonstrate both typical as well as unusual manifestations of acute pyelonephritis and its complications. In addition, conditions such as emphysematous and fungal pyelonephritis are discussed.

Results

Baseline data

In the period June 2005-December 2009, 119 patients with an imaging-confirmed diagnosis of acute non-complicated APN were hospitalized in our setting. The incidence was stable throughout the period: overall 2.2 cases/month (2.3 in 2005 and 2.6 in 2009). The referral area of the university hospital includes approximately 100,000 inhabitants; thus, the incidence corresponds to roughly 265 cases per year per million population (or 2.65 per 10,000 inhabitants, as the incidence of APN is often reported). The prevalence of the different types of upper UTI was assessed in a sample of 85 cases hospitalized in the Emergency department in 2008–2009 with the diagnosis of "upper UTI". In 6 cases the final diagnosis was of a different infection. In the other 79 cases, there were 33 non-complicated APN (42%), 32 complicated APN (with predisposing factors) (40%), and 14 upper UTI without radiological signs of parenchymal involvement (18%).

In keeping with the diagnosis of non-complicated (or uncomplicated) APN, all patients were females with normal genitourinary tract, with a median age of 32 years and a wide age range (15–72 years). A history of kidney stones was present in 19/119 patients (16%); none had active stone disease according to the definition of "non-complicated" pyelonephritis. Forty-nine patients had had at last one pregnancy (41%); 21 (17.7%) were taking anti-progestagens; a history of frequent urinary tract infections was reported by about half of the cases (table 1).

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults [^116DKHYK]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There are approximately 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis each year, resulting in more than 100,000 hospitalizations. The most common etiologic cause is infection with Escherichia coli. The combination of the leukocyte esterase test and the nitrite test (with either test proving positive) has a sensitivity of 75 to 84 percent and a specificity of 82 to 98 percent for urinary tract infection. Urine cultures are positive in 90 percent of patients with acute pyelonephritis, and cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. The use of blood cultures should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are suspected of having hematogenous infections. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone is successful in most patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other effective alternatives include extended-spectrum penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Indications for inpatient treatment include complicated infections, sepsis, persistent vomiting, failed outpatient treatment, or extremes of age. In hospitalized patients, intravenous treatment is recommended with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. The standard duration of therapy is seven to 14 days. Urine culture should be repeated one to two weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Treatment failure may be caused by resistant organisms, underlying anatomic/functional abnormalities, or immunosuppressed states. Lack of response should prompt repeat blood and urine cultures and, possibly, imaging studies. A change in antibiotics or surgical intervention may be required.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^114wV69U]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to definitive therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice for patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, including acute pyelonephritis. Recognize that patients who are not septic have a lower risk of mortality from complicated UTI (≤ 5%) and initial inappropriate empiric antibiotic choice has little impact on mortality. Routine use of broader-spectrum agents in suspected complicated UTI without sepsis may drive antimicrobial resistance without substantial patient benefit.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^116cDn65]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The second definition is clinical only. Under the pressure of cost constraints, most Authors in the last decade have preferred (at least in adults) a clinical definition based on a classic tetrad of high fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, signs or symptoms of lower urinary tract infection and positive urinary cultures. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and lower costs but is unable to discriminate between the different forms of upper urinary tract infections (upper UTI).

The therapy of upper urinary tract infections is likewise controversial, possibly because of the different prevalence of severe parenchymal lesions in the different series. General agreement is reached only on the potential danger of kidney abscesses, requiring hospitalization and long-term antibiotic treatment.

In this context, there are at least two good reasons to reconsider acute pyelonephritis one century after the pivotal description by Tiemlich and a decade after the K-DOQI re-definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The first is the re-definition by the K-DOQI guidelines of CKD as any persistent alteration of the morphology of the kidneys or of kidney function. Thus kidney scars define the presence of CKD, suggesting that the therapeutic goals should include their avoidance, along with the prevention of sepsis and renal abscesses.

The second reason regards the impressive improvements of imaging in kidney infections, allowing the identification of small lesions and the distinction between healing, fibrotic and edematous (presumably active) infectious foci. However, despite the improvement in diagnostic tools, very few recent studies have investigated the relationship between clinical and imaging presentation in adults. Our previous studies suggested a relationship between the presence of renal abscesses at diagnosis and the development of kidney scars. They also indicated, in a cohort of cases referred to the Emergency Room, that only imaging data could distinguish between upper urinary tract infections with and without parenchymal involvement.

The aim of the present prospective study (June 2005-December 2009) was to analyze the clinical and imaging presentation of all patients hospitalized in our setting, in which diagnosis of APN was made according to imaging criteria.

Our goal was to test the relationship between the clinical-laboratory data at presentation and the imaging data. We reasoned that a strong correlation would allow a simpler, more rapid identification of the cases with the severest kidney involvement (abscessed and/or multiple lesions), requiring hospitalization and long-term therapy, while the lack of correlation would support the wide use of imaging techniques.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaUrinary tract Infection-child [^116UVaz1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in young children and may cause pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Long-term complications from renal scarring are low. The role of imaging is to evaluate for underlying urologic abnormalities and guide treatment. In neonates there is increased risk for underlying urologic abnormalities. Evaluation for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) may be appropriate especially in boys because of higher prevalence of VUR and to exclude posterior urethral valve. In children older than 2 months with first episode of uncomplicated UTI, there is no clear benefit of prophylactic antibiotic. Ultrasound is the only study that is usually appropriate. After the age of 6 years, UTIs are infrequent. There is no need for routine imaging as VUR is less common. In children with recurrent or complicated UTI, in addition to ultrasound, imaging of VUR is usually appropriate. Renal cortical scintigraphy may be appropriate in children with VUR, as renal scarring may support surgical intervention. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Imaging of renal masses and infection-related defects indicates that space occupying lesions can be detected by functional imaging as parenchymal defects; however, ultrasound, CT and MR imaging are best suited for evaluation of renal masses and should be recommended when regional defects in the parenchyma are detected. Functional imaging may play a role before surgical interventions to predict expected residual renal function after partial or complete unilateral nephrectomy. Infectious/inflammatory diseases may result in reduced parenchymal function, and renal cortical defects may be seen in focal pyelonephritis, renal abscess, and with post pyelonephritic scarring.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute pyelonephritis [^115fxkfK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis refers to infection involving the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis. In most patients, uncomplicated pyelonephritis is diagnosed clinically and responds quickly to appropriate antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, the patient is immunocompromised, or for other reasons, microabscesses that form during the acute phase of pyelonephritis may coalesce, forming a renal abscess. Patients with underlying diabetes are more vulnerable to complications, including emphysematous pyelonephritis in addition to abscess formation. Additionally, diabetics may not have the typical flank tenderness that helps to differentiate pyelonephritis from a lower urinary tract infection. Additional high-risk populations may include those with anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, pregnancy, nosocomial infection, or infection by treatment-resistant pathogens. Treatment goals include symptom relief, elimination of infection to avoid renal damage, and identification of predisposing factors to avoid future recurrences. The primary imaging modalities used in patients with pyelonephritis are CT, MRI, and ultrasound. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

Patients with complicated UTIs are a diverse group. These patients have upper UTIs and structural or functional abnormalities that reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. They are at increased risk for morbidity such as bacteremia and sepsis, perinephric abscess, renal deterioration, and emphysematous pyelonephritis. Appropriate urinary tract imaging, antimicrobials, medical and surgical therapies, and follow-up are required to avoid potentially devastating outcomes.

Discussion

The present study was performed in a setting in which patients with a clinical suspicion of "non-complicated" APN are routinely hospitalized and undergo an extensive imaging work-up (ultrasound and either MR or CT scans).

In two recent surveys in the USA and Korea, the incidence of APN was reported as 20–35 new cases per year per 10,000 inhabitants. Thus the gross incidence was about 10 times higher than in our study (about 2.5 new cases per year per 10,000 inhabitants). However it is difficult to compare the incidence data in our study with those in the literature, for two main reasons. Firstly, the definition of APN rests on different bases. Imaging data are not included in the diagnostic work-up in the USA and Korea but are required for diagnosis in our setting. Secondly, in the absence of an imaging work-up, the incidence data in the USA and Korea include both non-complicated and complicated pyelonephritis while our study was limited to the former category. In our setting the ratio between "complicated or secondary" and "non-complicated or primary" APN is approximately 3:1 in the Emergency Room (ER), a finding that could at least partly explain the difference.

Unlike other settings, Italian ERs are usually the second referral point after the family physician; both family physicians and ERs are provided by the national health care system and are free of charge. An efficient filter by family physicians could be postulated on the basis of the 42% prevalence of antibiotic treatment in the last 3 days and of a median time of 3 days between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization.

In this context the present study was planned with the aim of describing the clinical presentation of imaging-confirmed APN. From the practical point of view we wanted to identify clinical or biochemical markers of severity of the kidney lesions (multifocal and abscessed lesions) to test the alternatives to our imaging-guided diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

The key feature of our study is the high prevalence of severe lesions: multiple lesions were present in 79.8% of the patients and abscessed lesions in 39.5%.

### Urinary tract infection: an update on imaging strategies [^113jKJKT]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause of morbidity in children. The distinction between upper and lower tract UTI is clinically difficult but important, as permanent renal damage can occur when the UTI involves the kidneys. Children with a history of UTI need investigated promptly and thoroughly. The goal of imaging in UTI is to aid in the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, to identify those children who are at high risk of developing permanent renal damage, and to confirm and monitor the presence of renal scarring. This article reviews the role of radiology in each of these aims.

### Diagnosis and imaging in urinary tract infections [^1162U2kx]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of imaging in urinary tract infection is to detect conditions that must be treated in order to avoid immediate deterioration or recurrences, and probable long-term kidney damage. In newborns identified with hydronephrosis during pregnancy or by neonatal screening, vesicoureteral reflux and renal scarring are congenital and not caused by infection. Most of these patients are male and the vesicoureteral reflux is of a higher grade than that detected in girls having had urinary tract infection. In children with urinary tract infection, several authors advocate a more selective policy and recommend imaging only in those children who are at risk for developing renal damage. In adult females no imaging is necessary in cystitis, whereas ultrasonography and plain films are recommended in acute pyelonephritis. Because uncomplicated urinary tract infection in men is rare, diagnostic evaluation including imaging should be started early in order to rule out complicating factors within the urinary tract. The role of imaging in prostatitis, vesiculitis, epididymitis and orchitis is primarily to rule out abscess formation, but also to exclude testicular malignancies.

Objectives

The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) requires demonstration of parenchymal involvement. When no predisposing conditions are found, non-complicated APN is suspected and CT or MRI should be performed. Diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI might be useful, quicker and cheaper than the standard gadolinium-enhanced (GE) MRI. The aim of this study is to compare DW-MRI with GE-MRI to test its diagnostic accuracy in APN.

Methods

Of 318 consecutive patients hospitalised for APN, 279 underwent MRI. Four hundred and fourteen MR studies (first test and follow-up examinations) were gathered and data were processed using Diffusion Analysis software. DW-MRI has been compared with GE-MRI for evaluating diagnostic agreement.

Results

Two hundred and forty-four patients were diagnosed as having APN; 35 were negative. One hundred and sixty-three APN cases were considered non-complicated and selected for the study. Among the 414 MR examinations, comparing DW-MRI with GE-MRI, positive correlation was found in 258 cases, negative in 133. There were 14 false-negatives and 9 false-positives. DW-MRI achieved sensitivity 95.2%, specificity 94.9%, positive predictive value 96.9%, negative predictive value 92.3% and accuracy 94.6%.

Conclusions

DW-MRI is reliable for diagnosing non-complicated APN. The high diagnostic agreement between DW-MRI and GE-MRI offers new perspectives in diagnostic management, enabling diagnosis of non-complicated APN without using ionising radiation or contrast media.

Key Points

- The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) requires demonstration of renal involvement.
- Hitherto magnetic resonance imaging required gadolinium enhancement (GE-MRI) to establish this diagnosis.
- But diagnostic agreement between diffusion-weighted and GE-MRI offers new diagnostic opportunities.
- Quantification of ADC values can help diagnose and monitor APN.
- DW-MRI avoids ionising radiation and paramagnetic contrast medium administration.

### Radiologic evaluation of patients with renal infections [^116H6V2o]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Although renal imaging is not indicated routinely in cases of uncomplicated renal infection, CT is a highly sensitive modality to diagnose and guide the management of patients with acute renal infection. CT is particularly useful in identifying complications of renal infection. Intravenous urography and US are limited to screening for urinary obstruction, renal calculi, and underlying anomalies. CT is also of value in establishing the diagnosis in equivocal cases, in evaluating high-risk patients, and in determining the nature and extent of disease. CT urography is increasingly performed as a comprehensive urinary tract imaging study. MRI may be performed when patients have contraindications to iodinated contrast material. Cortical scintigraphy is the preferred imaging study for the evaluation of children with acute pyelonephritis, although power Doppler US can be considered as a possible alternative. Recent limited studies using gadolinium-enhanced MRI have been shown to be valuable in the depiction of changes of acute pyelonephritis.

### Imaging of urinary tract infection in the adult [^113Hqkrc]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the adult is primarily based on typical patient symptomatology and urinary evaluation for the presence of bacteria and white blood cells. Uncomplicated UTI usually does not require radiological evaluation unless it is recurrent. Imaging should, in general, be reserved for those patients in whom conventional treatment has failed or those who have recurrent or unusually severe symptoms. Patients with conditions predisposing to infection, or complications thereof, such as diabetes mellitus or immunocompromised states, may also benefit from early imaging. If pyonephrosis is suspected, early imaging and possible urgent drainage is also warranted. Intravenous urogram and ultrasound have traditionally been used in the assessment of these patients, allowing detection of calculi, obstruction and incomplete bladder emptying. These imaging techniques, while useful, have limitations in the evaluation of renal inflammation and infection in the adult. Computerised tomography has now become accepted as a more sensitive modality for diagnosis and follow-up of complicated renal tract infection. Contrast-enhanced CT allows different phases of excretion to be studied and can define extent of disease and identify significant complications or obstruction. Nuclear medicine has a limited role in the evaluation of urinary tract infection in adults. Its main role is in the assessment of renal function, often prior to surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging has a limited but increasing role. It is particularly useful in those with iodinated contrast allergies, offering an ionising radiation free alternative in the diagnosis of both medical and surgical diseases of the kidney.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^114RNVhw]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of APN is still a challenge. At least in settings such as ours in which patients are referred to the Emergency Room after a few days of empirical treatment, the prevalence of incomplete oligosymptomatic presentations is high.

In a context of high prevalence of abscessed lesions (39.5%), severe kidney involvement coexisted with incomplete presentations. None of the clinical or biochemical markers at presentation allowed discrimination between small simple lesions and multifocal or abscessed ones. Hence imaging techniques were needed to assess the severity of kidney involvement and to plan the antibiotic therapy. The relatively high prevalence of kidney scars at presentation (15.1%), mostly with a silent clinical history, draws attention to the difficulty in diagnosing and preventing long-term sequelae of APN.

Therefore, we believe that two recommendations for clinical practice can be drawn from our experience. First, the differential diagnosis of APN should be considered in all patients presenting at least one suggestive clinical feature (fever, flank pain, lower UTI symptoms) accompanied by high inflammatory markers. Second, second-line imaging tests (MRI or CT scans) should be systematically used to define the prevalence and type of parenchymal lesions in order to tailor interventions to the specific clinical contexts.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Pyelonephritis, renal scarring, and reflux nephropathy: a pediatric urologist's perspective [^116YDTnF]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Imaging of children with a clinical diagnosis of pyelonephritis is performed to characterize the extent of the infection, to identify associated renal injury and to uncover risk factors for future infections and renal damage. Although there is general agreement regarding the need for parenchymal imaging and the need to exclude processes that are either functionally or anatomically obstructive, there is controversy regarding the need for routine cystography, especially when parenchymal involvement has not been documented. A protocol that limits the use of cystography for evaluation of urinary tract infections must assume that the diagnosis of reflux is at least of variable clinical significance. It is now clear that vesicoureteral reflux and reflux nephropathy represent a diverse population that includes both congenital and acquired processes. MR imaging will improve our understanding of vesicoureteral reflux, pyelonephritis and renal scarring and might help us to identify and manage those patients most at risk for recurrent infections and renal injury. To recognize the potential contributions of this newer imaging technique it is helpful to look at our understanding of the pathophysiology of pyelonephritis, reflux and reflux nephropathy.

Acute pyelonephritis, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and imaging approach — detection of acute pyelonephritis increases the likelihood that VUR is present, and although higher grades of VUR are associated with a greater risk of developing pyelonephritis, acute pyelonephritis can occur without demonstrable vesicoureteral reflux; some believe that a normal [99mTc]Tc-DMSA scan in the acute setting is helpful because evaluation for VUR may not be necessary since only reflux sufficiently severe to cause pyelonephritis will require prophylaxis/treatment, and given that renal scarring can occur in pyelonephritis without VUR and VUR outcomes depend on patient characteristics, the imaging approach has in many places shifted toward a "top-down" that prioritizes detection of pyelonephritis and away from a "bottom-up" approach that prioritizes detection of VUR.

### Candida urinary tract infections – diagnosis [^1158o9tP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The finding of candiduria in a patient with or without symptoms should be neither dismissed nor hastily treated, but requires a careful evaluation, which should proceed in a logical fashion. Symptoms of Candida pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, or epididymo-orchitis are little different from those of the same infections produced by other pathogens. Candiduria occurring in critically ill patients should initially be regarded as a marker for the possibility of invasive candidiasis. The first step in evaluation is to verify funguria by repeating the urinalysis and urine culture. Pyuria is a nonspecific finding; the morphology of the offending yeast may allow separation of Candida glabrata from other species. Candida casts in the urine are indicative of renal candidiasis but are rarely seen. With respect to culture, colony counts have not proved to be diagnostically useful. In symptomatic or critically ill patients with candiduria, ultrasonography of the kidneys and collecting systems is the preferred initial study. However, computed tomography (CT) is better able to discern pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess. The role of magnetic resonance imaging and renal scintigraphy is ill defined, and prudent physicians should consult with colleagues in the departments of radiology and urology to determine the optimal studies in candiduric patients who require in-depth evaluation.

### State of the art: imaging of renal infections [^114ZS5FQ]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract are common and account for a large number of patient encounters in the ambulatory and emergency department setting. Their severity and presentation varies, and although uncomplicated infections can often be diagnosed and treated based on clinical and laboratory findings alone, diagnostic imaging may be necessary in some cases to guide appropriate medical or surgical therapy. We will briefly describe the indications for imaging known or suspected upper urinary tract infections, and the relative benefits and limitations of the different imaging modalities for a given clinical presentation. This will be followed by a discussion of various types of renal infections with a pictorial review of their imaging appearances and differential diagnoses.

Imaging

Historically, guidelines recommended aggressive imaging follow-up to identify renal scarring and complications from UTI. It is now known that the most children at risk of complications have structural abnormalities identifiable on ultrasound or recurrent UTI. Therefore, many recent guidelines suggest less or no imaging after first uncomplicated UTI for older children and less aggressive imaging after recurrent UTI (table 3).

Table 3
Summary of imaging recommendations from selected international guidelines for young children with UTI

Ultrasound

Ultrasound is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and an appropriate first-line investigation when imaging is indicated. Ultrasound can detect anatomical abnormalities and hydronephrosis or hydroureter suggesting obstruction or VUR. American and Canadian guidelines recommend ultrasound for all children aged < 2 years with first UTI, European Association of Urology guidelines recommend ultrasound for all children with first febrile UTI, while NICE recommends ultrasound only for infants < 6 months with first UTI unless infection is atypical or not responding to treatment. The NICE approach reflects the view that routine imaging after all first UTI is not cost-effective; however, imaging in younger children and other selected cases is more likely to detect findings of clinical significance. Ultrasound cannot exclude all cases of VUR but should detect most higher grade and clinically significant cases.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan

DMSA scan is a nuclear isotope uptake scan. Reduced uptake in the kidney can reflect either acute dysfunction (pyelonephritis) or long term damage (scarring), depending on the timing of the test. It is rarely required acutely but may help guide long-term management. DMSA may be indicated if UTI is atypical, recurrent or if initial ultrasound is significantly abnormal.

Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)

VCUG uses fluoroscopy (real-time X-ray) to identify the course of contrast inserted by bladder catheterisation. Bladder filling, emptying and ureteric reflux can be identified. While VCUG is the gold standard for identifying and quantifying VUR, the procedure has a radiation burden and is invasive.

Consensus for exactly who and how to image is lacking. Cost, invasiveness and radiation burden must be balanced against the likelihood of identifying an abnormality which may change management for the child. While most children with uncomplicated UTI outside infancy do not require any imaging, some children are at risk of long-term morbidity after UTI. Therefore, targeted imaging and surveillance strategies for children with selected indications remains appropriate.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^113YEs2x]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

All patients with a clinical picture suggestive of APN underwent abdominal ultrasound, whenever possible in the ER, and were hospitalized. In patients hospitalized for fever of unknown origin, in which the diagnosis was made during hospitalization, ultrasound was performed subsequently.

In the presence of systemic predisposing factors (any factor affecting the immune response, including diabetes, collagen diseases, chemotherapy, HIV positivity, neuromuscular diseases) and/or of anatomical predisposing factors (any factors causing obstruction, including active stone disease, prostatic hypertrophy, kidney malformations, polycystic kidney disease and indwelling catheters) the APN was considered as "complicated" or secondary and the patients were not included in the present analysis. Regarding the diagnostic pathway, in the presence of anatomical predisposing factors the most widely employed technique was CT scan, better in defining the urinary tract and superior in the definition of stone disease. Patients with complicated pyelonephritis were followed by the urological team and were not included in the analysis. Patients with systemic predisposing factors (such as diabetes or neoplasia) were followed by our group but were not included in the analysis, as the predisposing factors could affect both presentation and follow-up. Pregnant patients were also excluded. History of kidney stones was recorded, and APN was considered as non-complicated in the absence of kidney stones at imaging at diagnosis or of a history of having passed a kidney stone in the previous month. The only morphological exception was the presence of kidney scars presumably due to previous APN episodes, on the basis of the spatial relationship with the excretory system, at the first imaging.

Consent for publication and for anonymous management of data was obtained either at hospitalization or at first access in the day-hospital. Prof. Alberto Angeli from the Ethical Committee of the University of san Luigi Gonzaga assessed the study and confirmed that ethical approval was not needed since the study deals with a non-invasive diagnostic tool used according to its standard indications in a specific subset of patients, for which previous indications of the literature are available. Furthermore the study analyzes the results obtained in clinical practice and no test was performed for the sake of the study. Approval for the indication of each specific imaging test is a part of the routine controls of the Magnetic Resonance or Computerized Tomography experts, who ask for informed consent for each test and, in each case, control for the coherence of prescription of the analysis.

### CT imaging of acute and chronic pyelonephritis: a practical guide for emergency radiologists [^116VBMuJ]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Contrast-enhanced CT is not routinely indicated in uncomplicated urinary infections, but it may be necessary in patients with specific risk factors (i.e., diabetes, immunocompromised patients, history of stones, or prior renal surgery) or in patients not responding to antibiotics and in detecting complications of pyelonephritis. CT is the gold standard for imaging assessment of pyelonephritis severity. Imaging appearance of acute pyelonephritis, including focal (i.e., wedge-shaped zones of decreased attenuation or hypodense mass) and diffuse (i.e., global enlargement, poor parenchymal enhancement, lack of excretion of contrast, fat stranding) forms, needs to be differentiated from renal infarction, renal lymphoma, and interstitial nephritis. Chronic pyelonephritis-which appears as focal polar scars with underlying calyceal distortion, global atrophy, and hypertrophy of residual tissue-may mimic at imaging lobar infarcts. This pictorial essay reviews the CT imaging appearance of acute and chronic pyelonephritis, their uncommon subtypes, and their complications, with key features for early diagnosis. Their knowledge is crucial for emergency and abdominal radiologists to avoid misdiagnosis with malignancy and to guide the clinician towards the appropriate medical or surgical treatment.
