## Question

Is culture with sensitivity is mandatory in HAP? what if the patient is ill and not able to provide sputum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether culture with sensitivity is mandatory in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and what to do when the patient is too ill to provide sputum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between HAP and VAP and the guideline stance on obtaining respiratory cultures. Then, I should verify the strength of recommendations and whether "mandatory" is the right word. Next, I will examine what to do when sputum cannot be obtained, including noninvasive alternatives and when to escalate to invasive sampling. After that, I need to consider the role of blood cultures and how to handle results that return negative or are unobtainable. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, stewardship-aligned approach and summarize the bottom line with caveats about timing and local epidemiology.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. HAP is pneumonia occurring 48 hours or more after admission in patients who are not mechanically ventilated, whereas VAP is pneumonia occurring more than 48 hours after intubation; the diagnostic and sampling recommendations differ subtly, so I need to keep these separate as I reason through this [^14e0c452].

> Now, is culture with sensitivity "mandatory" in HAP? Wait, let me verify the guideline language. The 2016 IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guideline recommends obtaining respiratory cultures from essentially all patients with suspected VAP, reflecting expert consensus given MDR risk and the consequences of ineffective therapy, but for non-VAP HAP the recommendation is weaker: the panel suggests using noninvasive respiratory sampling with semiquantitative cultures rather than relying on empiric therapy alone, which is a weak recommendation with very low-quality evidence, so "mandatory" overstates the strength of the HAP recommendation [^0c7b536c] [^1f609fe5] [^ca07a978].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical implication. Even though the HAP recommendation is weak, contemporary practice and stewardship frameworks emphasize attempting to obtain respiratory cultures whenever feasible because they enable de-escalation and reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum exposure; thus, while not legally or guideline-mandated, obtaining cultures is standard of care in most hospitals and aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles [^1f609fe5] [^dc402bae].

> Next, I should review what to do when the patient cannot produce sputum. Let me think about noninvasive alternatives first. Options include sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in noncooperative patients, and, if the patient later requires intubation, endotracheal aspiration; these are endorsed by the HAP/VAP guideline as acceptable noninvasive methods to secure lower respiratory samples when spontaneous expectoration fails [^1f609fe5] [^ca07a978].

> But wait, what if noninvasive methods fail and the patient is critically ill or high risk for MDR pathogens? I should confirm when invasive sampling is reasonable. Bronchoscopic BAL or protected specimen brush can be considered in selected patients, particularly in the ICU or when noninvasive sampling is not possible; however, the guideline prefers noninvasive semiquantitative cultures over invasive quantitative cultures for VAP, and extrapolating that preference, noninvasive approaches should be prioritized in HAP when feasible, reserving invasive sampling for cases where it will change management or when noninvasive options are unobtainable [^05618cb4] [^1f609fe5] [^32a9c53a].

> I need to check the role of blood cultures because sputum may be unobtainable. Blood cultures are recommended in suspected VAP given a meaningful bacteremia rate and worse outcomes when bacteremic, and in HAP they are reasonable in severe cases or when there is concern for sepsis, even though the yield is lower than in VAP; importantly, blood cultures should be obtained before or as early as possible after antibiotics to preserve yield [^0c7b536c] [^b548822e].

> Let me consider how to interpret negative or unobtainable cultures so I don't jump to conclusions. If cultures are negative but the patient is clinically improving, de-escalation to a single, appropriately narrow agent aligned with the local antibiogram is reasonable; conversely, if cultures are negative and the patient is not improving, I should double-check for alternative sources of infection, inadequate sampling, or early antibiotic effect, and consider repeating cultures or escalating diagnostics rather than automatically broadening therapy [^4d8f81a7] [^dc402bae].

> I should confirm specimen quality and processing because this materially affects interpretability. Sputum samples with more than 10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field are considered contaminated and should be rejected or interpreted cautiously; processing should occur within 2 hours at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated to minimize false results, and these quality steps are essential even when the patient is ill and sampling is challenging [^5fc63d5d] [^2b1728e7].

> Next, I should review how this integrates with empiric therapy decisions so I don't delay necessary treatment. Empiric antibiotics for HAP should not be delayed for cultures in unstable patients; regimens should cover S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli, with MRSA and antipseudomonal coverage guided by local epidemiology and patient-specific risk factors, and then narrowed promptly when culture data return, ideally within 48–72 hours [^dca455e9] [^08bccc15] [^178fb166].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure I'm precise. Culture with sensitivity is not strictly "mandatory" for HAP, but current guidelines recommend attempting noninvasive respiratory cultures whenever feasible, and many hospitals operationalize this as standard of care for stewardship and safety; when sputum is unobtainable, use sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning, or endotracheal aspiration if intubated, and consider bronchoscopic sampling selectively in high-risk or ICU patients where results will change management [^1f609fe5] [^ca07a978] [^05618cb4].

---

Culture with sensitivity is **not absolutely mandatory** for HAP, but it is strongly recommended to guide therapy and enable de-escalation [^1f609fe5]. If the patient cannot provide sputum, obtain a **lower respiratory sample** by noninvasive methods such as induced sputum, nasotracheal suction, or endotracheal aspirate if intubated [^1f609fe5] [^b4582bd1]. If noninvasive sampling is not feasible or yields no result, consider **bronchoscopic sampling** (BAL or PSB) in severe or high-risk cases [^32a9c53a]. Empiric antibiotics should not be delayed for sampling; tailor therapy to culture results when available to optimize outcomes and reduce resistance [^dca455e9] [^060ceb25].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) provide clear recommendations on the role of culture and sensitivity testing in HAP:

- **Strong recommendation**: Obtain respiratory cultures from patients with suspected HAP to guide antibiotic therapy and enable de-escalation [^notfound].

- **Noninvasive sampling preferred**: Use noninvasive methods such as spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning, or endotracheal aspiration if the patient is intubated [^1f609fe5] [^b4582bd1].

- **Invasive sampling reserved**: Consider bronchoscopic sampling (BAL or PSB) only when noninvasive methods are not feasible or fail to yield results, particularly in severe or high-risk cases [^32a9c53a].

- **Empiric therapy**: Initiate empiric antibiotics promptly based on clinical judgment and local antibiograms, and adjust therapy once culture results are available [^dca455e9] [^08bccc15].

---

## Clinical scenarios where culture and sensitivity may not be feasible

Several scenarios may limit the ability to obtain sputum samples for culture and sensitivity testing:

- **Critically ill patients**: Patients may be unable to cooperate or produce sputum due to severe illness, respiratory distress, or altered mental status.

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Intubated patients may require alternative sampling methods such as endotracheal aspirates or bronchoscopic sampling [^b4582bd1].

- **Limited resources**: Some healthcare settings may lack the necessary equipment or trained personnel to perform invasive sampling techniques.

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

When sputum samples cannot be obtained, **alternative diagnostic methods** should be considered:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Induced sputum | Noninvasive technique using hypertonic saline to stimulate cough and produce sputum | Patients unable to produce spontaneous sputum |
| Nasotracheal suctioning | Noninvasive method to obtain lower respiratory tract secretions | Patients unable to cooperate or produce sputum |
| Endotracheal aspiration | Noninvasive sampling from intubated patients | Intubated patients with suspected HAP |
| Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) | Invasive bronchoscopic technique to obtain samples from lower respiratory tract | Severe cases, high-risk patients, or when noninvasive methods fail |
| Protected specimen brush (PSB) | Invasive bronchoscopic technique to obtain uncontaminated samples | Severe cases, high-risk patients, or when noninvasive methods fail |

---

## Clinical outcomes and implications

The inability to obtain sputum samples for culture and sensitivity testing can have **significant clinical implications**:

- **Empiric therapy**: Clinicians may need to rely on empiric antibiotic therapy based on local epidemiology and clinical judgment, increasing the risk of inappropriate antibiotic use, treatment failure, and antibiotic resistance [^dca455e9] [^73431c0c].

- **Delayed de-escalation**: Without culture results, de-escalation of antibiotic therapy may be delayed, leading to prolonged exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and increased risk of adverse effects [^e9d8bdcd].

- **Increased costs**: Prolonged hospital stays, increased antibiotic use, and potential treatment failures can significantly increase healthcare costs [^f36b072c].

---

## Clinical judgment and local epidemiology

In the absence of sputum samples, **clinical judgment and local epidemiology** play a crucial role in guiding antibiotic therapy:

- **Local antibiograms**: Regularly updated local antibiograms provide valuable information on prevalent pathogens and their resistance patterns, guiding empiric antibiotic selection [^08bccc15].

- **Clinical assessment**: Careful clinical assessment, including patient history, risk factors, and severity of illness, helps determine the likelihood of multidrug-resistant pathogens and guides empiric therapy [^178fb166].

- **Response to therapy**: Close monitoring of clinical response allows timely adjustment of antibiotic therapy based on patient outcomes [^4d8f81a7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Culture with sensitivity testing is **strongly recommended** for patients with suspected HAP, but it is not absolutely mandatory. If sputum samples cannot be obtained, use alternative noninvasive methods such as induced sputum, nasotracheal suctioning, or endotracheal aspiration. In severe or high-risk cases, consider invasive bronchoscopic sampling (BAL or PSB). Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly and adjusted based on culture results when available to optimize patient outcomes and reduce antibiotic resistance.

### Are quantitative cultures useful in the diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia? [^709497cf]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Noninvasive and invasive tests have been developed and studied for their utility in diagnosing and guiding the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, a condition with an inherently high mortality. Early empiric antibiotic treatment has been shown to reduce mortality, so delaying this treatment until test results are available is not justifiable. Furthermore, tailoring therapy based on results of either noninvasive or invasive tests has not been clearly shown to affect morbidity and mortality. This may be related to quantitative limitations of these tests or possibly to a high false-negative rate in patients who receive early antibiotic treatment and may therefore have suppressed bacterial counts. Results of these tests, however, do influence treatment. It is therefore hoped that they may ultimately provide a rational basis for making therapeutic decisions. In the future, outcomes research should be a part of large-scale clinical trials, and noninvasive and invasive tests should be incorporated into the design in an attempt to provide a better understanding of the value of such tests.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology—sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP)—conditions for empirical de-escalation indicate it is reasonable to empirically de-escalate to a single broad-spectrum antibiotic in patients with a negative sputum culture who are clinically improving, provided coverage aligns with a local HAP antibiogram (or, if not available, for enteric gram-negative bacilli and MSSA), whereas patients without good sputum cultures, with diminished culture reliability, or at high risk for MDR infections may not be appropriate candidates for de-escalation.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) non-VAP—We suggest that patients with suspected HAP (non-VAP) be treated according to the results of microbiologic studies performed on respiratory samples obtained noninvasively, rather than being treated empirically (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient unable to cooperate to produce a sputum sample, and endotracheal aspiration in a patient with HAP who subsequently requires mechanical ventilation. Evidence cited includes one randomized trial in which Sixty-eight patients with HAP were randomly assigned to undergo bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushing vs noninvasive management, where expectorated sputum samples were not obtained so noninvasive management resulted in empiric therapy; there was no difference in clinical cure at 28 days or hospital length of stay, and lower 28-day mortality in the empirically treated group was not statistically significant (10% vs 21.9%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, .13–1.61), with fewer patients in the invasive group receiving antibiotics than in the noninvasive group (76% vs 100%). Despite limited evidence, the panel agreed that an attempt should be made to obtain respiratory samples for culture and that respiratory specimens should be obtained noninvasively rather than invasively, noting opportunities to de-escalate antibiotic coverage and that routine invasive sampling via bronchoscopy would be associated with increased cost and increased risks to the patient, including rarely life-threatening complications and temporary worsening of gas exchange that could result in the need for respiratory support.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)—below-threshold invasive quantitative cultures and antibiotic management: Noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures is the preferred methodology to diagnose VAP; however, when invasive quantitative cultures are obtained, for patients with suspected VAP whose invasive quantitative culture results are below the diagnostic threshold for VAP, we suggest that antibiotics be withheld rather than continued (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with thresholds cited as PSB with <10^3 CFU/mL, BAL with <10^4 CFU/mL, and an ETA of <10^5 CFU/mL; values and preferences emphasize avoiding unnecessary harm and cost, and remarks note that clinical factors—including the likelihood of an alternative source of infection, prior antimicrobial therapy at the time of culture, degree of clinical suspicion, signs of severe sepsis, and evidence of clinical improvement—may alter the decision.

It should be emphasized that, for the management of VAP, like for all infectious diseases, the choice of antimicrobial treatment is much easier when the specific etiologic agents are identified by a reliable diagnostic technique. Before new antibiotics are administered, reliable pulmonary specimens (chosen according to the literature and within the capabilities of the local microbiology laboratory) must be obtained for direct examination and cultures from patients clinically suspected of having developed VAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a practical approach to management for the hospitalist [^33eae90e]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, and inpatient physicians should be familiar with the most current evidence about and guidelines for CAP management. Our conclusions and recommendations include: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common identified cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of severe CAP. The chest radiograph remains an essential initial test in the diagnosis of CAP and should be supplemented by blood cultures sampled prior to antibiotic therapy and sputum for gram stain and culture if a high-quality specimen can be rapidly processed. Once the diagnosis is made, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) should be used to optimize the location of treatment and to provide prognostic information. Absent other mitigating factors, patients in PSI risk classes I, II, and III can safely be treated as outpatients. Hospitalized patients with CAP should be treated promptly with empiric antibiotics. Nonsevere pneumonia should be treated with a parenteral beta-lactam plus either doxycycline or a macrolide. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone as well as be evaluated for pseudomonal risk factors. Most patients with nonsevere CAP reach clinical stability in 2-3 days and should be considered for a switch to oral therapy and discharge shortly thereafter. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, and tobacco cessation counseling prior to discharge if eligible. Multiple quality indicators are measured and publicly reported in the management of CAP, which provides hospitals with an opportunity to improve care processes and patient outcomes.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) adults—Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions at diagnosis: We recommend not obtaining sputum Gram stain and culture routinely in adults with CAP managed in the outpatient setting (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend obtaining pretreatment Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting who are classified as severe CAP, especially if they are intubated (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); are being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); were previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially those with prior respiratory tract infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence); or were hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Sputum Gram stain and culture in CAP—We recommend obtaining sputum for Gram stain and culture in situations when risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa are present, both when initial empiric therapy is expanded to cover these pathogens and when it is not expanded, and patients who have severe CAP requiring intubation should have lower respiratory tract samples, such as endotracheal aspirates, sent for Gram stain and culture promptly after intubation. The most consistently strong risk factor to consider is prior infection with either MRSA or P. aeruginosa, and hospitalization and treatment with parenteral antibiotics in the last 90 days is associated with an increased risk of these pathogens, and so we recommend sputum culture in this situation.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia—management when invasive quantitative cultures are below diagnostic thresholds: For patients with suspected VAP whose invasive quantitative culture results are below the diagnostic threshold for VAP (PSB With <10^3 Colony-Forming Units [CFU]/mL, BAL With <10^4 CFU/mL), we suggest that antibiotics be withheld rather than continued (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^43cabb74]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with invasive quantitative cultures below diagnostic thresholds—The evidence indicates that patients whose antibiotics are withheld on the basis of an invasive quantitative culture below the diagnostic threshold for VAP have similar clinical outcomes, less antibiotic use, and better microbiologic outcomes compared to those whose antibiotics are continued, but the panel’s confidence in these effects was very low due to observational study design, imprecision, and high risk of bias. Antibiotic discontinuation in patients with suspected VAP whose invasive quantitative culture results are below the diagnostic threshold for VAP may be beneficial because it decreases unnecessary antibiotic use and improves microbiological outcomes; while there is no evidence that this approach worsens clinical outcomes, in theory it could result in withdrawal of antibiotics from some patients if quantitative culture results are misleadingly low due to sampling error or prior antibiotic exposure.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (non-VAP)—microbiologic guidance for therapy: We suggest that patients with suspected HAP (non-VAP) be treated according to the results of microbiologic studies performed on respiratory samples obtained noninvasively, rather than being treated empirically (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient who is unable to cooperate to produce a sputum sample, and endotracheal aspiration in a patient with a tracheostomy.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults: management principles to improve outcomes [^1389e701]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for Management of HAP were developed jointly by the ATS and IDSA in 2004. These guidelines were designed to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens (see Fig. 1).Principles include early initiation of appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy after cultures of blood and sputum are obtained. Quantitative distal airway sampling by bronchoscopy provides greater diagnostic specificity for VAP: in one randomized study, improved outcomes were noted, compared with clinical diagnosis with qualitative endotracheal aspirates. Higher doses of initial, empiric antibiotics also are recommended. Assessment of the patient's clinical response to empiric antibiotics should be correlated with microbiologic results to streamline, de-escalate, or stop unnecessary anti-biotic treatment. Duration of therapy for uncomplicated HAP should be limited to 7 days followed by close monitoring for relapse after cessation of antibiotics. The authors suggest that prevention strategies target modifiable short- and long-term risk factors. They also advocate the use of a multidisciplinary team that is dedicated to the treatment and prevention of HCAP and the basic principle of the modern Hippocratic Oath: "I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure."

Adult community-acquired pneumonia—empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata—There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

### Recommendations for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: review of recent international guidelines [^060ceb25]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

Determining etiology of HAP and VAP—Because of MDR risk and consequences of ineffective initial therapy, experts believe that cultures of respiratory secretions should be obtained from virtually all patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a practice with which the panel agreed; subsequent sections presume cultures are obtained for all suspected VAP. Evidence supporting blood cultures in VAP is limited, but approximately 15% of VAP patients are bacteremic and bacteremic VAP has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality than nonbacteremic VAP.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline—key changes versus 2007—state that sputum culture is “Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa,” and blood culture is “Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.” Macrolide monotherapy carries a “Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels.” Use of procalcitonin is “Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy,” and corticosteroids are “Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock.” The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to “Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative.” For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, “Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination,” and follow-up chest imaging is “Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated.”

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP—definitive therapy recommendations state that for patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend that the choice of an antibiotic for definitive (not empiric) therapy be based upon the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks add that routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing should include assessment of the sensitivity of the P. aeruginosa.

### The potential economic value of sputum culture use in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia [^f36b072c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite numerous studies, the clinical value of sputum cultures in the management of pneumonia remains controversial; therefore, understanding the economic value of sputum cultures may help decision makers determine their appropriate use in patient management.

Methods

We developed a decision model to determine the economic and clinical value of using sputum cultures in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) from the hospital perspective under various conditions.

Results

For both CAP and HCAP patients, obtaining sputum cultures resulted in similar costs compared to no culture, even if cultures cost $0. Given current clinical practices, obtaining cultures cost $539-631 more per CAP patient and $13-170 per HCAP patient compared to no culture use. However, cultures saved $8-202 per HCAP patient with a 40% probability the pathogen was the true cause (75% reduction in adverse outcomes, greater length of hospital stay (LOS) increase) to a 70% probability the pathogen was the true cause (25% reduction in outcomes and greater LOS increase and a 75% reduction in outcomes and all LOS increases). Additionally, obtaining sputum cultures had no impact on the number of adverse outcomes (i.e., adverse drug events, Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia readmissions, additional hospitalization days). When all patients were treated with antibiotics empirically, obtaining cultures saved $4-342.

Conclusions

Overall, obtaining sputum cultures does not provide significant clinical or economic benefits for CAP or HCAP patients; however, it can reduce costs and shorten overall LOS under some circumstances. Clinicians should consider their local conditions when making decisions about sputum culture use.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

### Qualitative cultures in ventilator-associated pneumonia-can they be used with confidence? [^4d61d123]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic and clinical evidence used to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia vary depending on the number of clinical criteria present. Bacteriological confirmation that rules out other diseases can be achieved by quantitative or qualitative cultures of tracheal aspirate. The rate of tracheal colonization in ventilated patients reduces the usefulness of qualitative cultures, but the absence of multiresistant micro-organisms in cultures from patients on prior antibiotics or a sterile culture in patients without prior antimicrobials may provide sufficient justification to stop or de-escalate antibiotics. However, more accurate guidance regarding whether antibiotics are unnecessary and should be stopped is provided by quantitative culture.

### A subgroup of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia Do not require broad-spectrum Gram-negative antimicrobial coverage [^66309a5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) occurring outside the intensive care unit (ICU) is a relatively understudied nosocomial infection (non-ICU HAP). Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) such as Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are considered canonical HAP pathogens and international guidelines recommend empiric broad-spectrum Gram-negative antimicrobial coverage. However, much of the literature actually describes ventilator-associated pneumonia or ICU HAP. Case ascertainment bias exists in other studies, reporting only on patients able to expectorate sputum or with positive sputum cultures, whereas real-life data demonstrate that sputum samples are infrequently available and often culture-negative. Therefore, our understanding of the microbial aetiology of non-ICU HAP is incomplete, and empiric broad-spectrum Gram-negative coverage may not be mandated in all cases. In the United Kingdom, doxycycline is widely recommended for the empiric treatment of low-severity HAP, but we are aware of no clinical data supporting this practice. Doxycycline lacks activity against Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanii ; thus, its usage provides an opportunity to address the unanswered question of the requirement for broad-spectrum Gram-negative coverage in non-ICU HAP. The aims of this study were to (1) identify and characterize a representative cohort of patients with non-ICU HAP; and (2) report treatment outcomes without broad-spectrum Gram-negative coverage.

### Invasive and non-invasive diagnostic approaches for microbiological diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia [^32a9c53a]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a frequent event during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay and is characterized by a pneumonia acquired during hospitalization, in patients without invasive mechanical ventilation. Despite improved prevention measures, antimicrobial therapy, and supportive care, it remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. HAP is the leading cause of death among hospital-acquired infections, with estimates of its associated mortality ranging from 20 to 50% [,–].

Microbiological diagnosis is fundamental for guiding HAP treatment, allowing a targeted, effective antibiotic choice, and reducing the associated impact of ineffective empiric antibiotic regimens or the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Yet the current understanding of HAP pathogens is based mainly on data derived from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Although some studies have reported the pathogens in HAP that occur outside the ICU, there is no systematic description of the diagnostic approaches that should be used to efficiently obtain an microbiological diagnosis in HAP, mainly when critically ill.

In comparison with VAP, HAP poses additional challenges for respiratory sampling and, thus, for obtaining microbiological diagnosis. The utility of sputum cultures or distal sampling for HAP has not been comprehensively evaluated. The recent guidelines for HAP/VAP recognized that for some patients, whom non-invasively sampling is not possible, invasive sampling is an option ; however, the literature is scarce to support one method over the other in HAP. In this study, we aimed to describe the diagnostic approaches used in a cohort of HAP acquired during an ICU stay and their associated clinical impact.

Interestingly, one third of patients underwent sputum collection, which was positive in 34% of cases after ensuring sample quality and performing quantitative cultures. Very few data are available on the applicability of sputum in HAP. In our experience, this non-invasive diagnostic method should be encouraged, as it already is for community-acquired pneumonia. Indeed, when only one diagnostic method was positive, 15% of microbiologic confirmations were due to sputum, and in patients who were not subsequently intubated, this proportion was even higher (33%). Despite the limited numbers of patients allowing for pair-wise comparisons between methods, we observed a good agreement on retrieving the same pathogen (80% on average). As expected it was higher for invasive methods (FBAS vs. BAL, 86% of agreement). In our protocol, we tried to obtain as much as possible respiratory samples to increase the likelihood of identifying a causative pathogen, and the good agreement observed is reassuring. When two methods were discordant, respecting the sample quality check and cutoff values, clinicians interpreted the episode as polymicrobial and treated both pathogens, which is sound in critically ill patients. Taking different respiratory samples also increases the risk of false positives (i.e. colonization). We could not evaluate the actual impact that discordance between methods would have in clinician’s decision in a scenario where there would be a hierarchy between methods, for instance.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV—sputum testing timing and yield: Gram stain and culture of sputum is recommended in all hospitalized patients meeting the criteria stated above and is optional in individuals with HIV and CAP not meeting these criteria. In general, Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum should be performed only if a good-quality specimen can be obtained prior to (or not more than 12–18 hours after) initiation of antibiotics, and quality performance measures for collection, transport, and processing of samples can be met. Sputum cultures in patients with HIV have been shown to identify a bacterial etiology in up to 30% to 40% of good quality specimens although yield is less in other studies. For intubated patients, an endotracheal aspirate sample should be obtained promptly after intubation, or bronchoscopy may be indicated.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) diagnostic sampling—We suggest noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures to diagnose VAP, rather than invasive sampling with quantitative cultures and rather than noninvasive sampling with quantitative cultures (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Invasive respiratory sampling includes bronchoscopic techniques (ie, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), protected specimen brush (PSB)) and blind bronchial sampling (ie, mini-BAL), whereas noninvasive sampling refers to endotracheal aspiration. Evidence included 5 randomized trials, with 3 comparing invasive quantitative sampling to noninvasive semiquantitative sampling and 2 comparing invasive quantitative to noninvasive quantitative sampling. One trial showed that invasive sampling led to more antibiotic changes than noninvasive sampling (42% vs 15%; relative risk [RR], 2.81, 95% CI, 1.01–7.81), and another found more antibiotic-free days with invasive sampling (5.0 days vs 2.2 days; P < .001), whereas other trials found no difference; when the 5 trials were pooled via meta-analysis, sampling technique did not affect any clinical outcome, including mean duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality.

Respiratory pathogen testing in CAP—guideline-aligned recommendations note that testing for influenza viruses in both outpatient and inpatient settings during periods of community spread is a strong recommendation in the 2021 ATS clinical practice guideline, and testing recommendations for non-influenza viral pathogens endorse the use of NAATs in hospitalized patients with severe CAP or in patients with immunocompromising conditions; although a weak recommendation, in children with appropriate signs and symptoms, M. pneumoniae testing is indicated, and there are several molecular assays available for M. pneumoniae detection and C. pneumoniae detection. Laboratories must have a mechanism in place for screening sputum samples for acceptability prior to routine bacterial culture, and poor quality specimens provide misleading results and should be rejected because interpretation would be compromised.

However, there are several limitations that must be highlighted. First, our study is retrospective and single-center and, although we collected data from six ICUs with different profiles (from general medical to respiratory and liver units), the single-center characteristic decreases the generalizability of our findings. Second, our study is observational and allowed us for a reliable description of real-life diagnostic methods approaches for achieving microbiological diagnosis in HAP, our primary objective. However, the crude associations found for the potential benefit of invasive methods are exploratory and not causal; a well-designed, controlled randomized trial is now warranted to define the management of HAP regarding the use of invasive or non-invasive methods. Third, we could recruit 200 patients, which limited our ability to explore subgroups and pair-wise comparisons between different methods, but to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first and largest studies reporting all these different diagnostic methods in critically ill nonventilated HAP. Third, we could not achieve 100% of respiratory samples in the cohort; however, we believe that 93% represents a very high proportion of patients, considering the daily care in an ICU. Fourth, our population comprised critically ill patients, who commonly require iMV, and our results may not be applicable to patients outside the ICU. Fifth, we did not have a “gold standard” to confirm that the pathogen identified was responsible for the infection and not only colonizing the airways, a potential limitation particularly for sputum cultures. To limit the number of false positives, we used the most standard quality assessment to accept only lower airway representative samples. Sixth, at the time the current study was conducted, our center did not have routine access to rapid diagnostic methods because they were not standard of care, but these methods have been shown to be promising tools for pathogen identification in HAP. The performance of rapid diagnostic methods in nonventilated HAP, utilizing different sampling strategies, must be evaluated and could produce different results compared to our findings. Particularly, rapid diagnostic methods could increase the sensitivity for pathogen identification in those patients already receiving a new antibiotic upon sample collection, a fact that might explain the reason we achieved only 50% of microbiological diagnosis using traditional culture methods. Finally, we did not conduct a cost-effective analysis, which is a key element when comparing different respiratory sampling methods.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)—bacterial culture and Legionella testing guidance states that in those patients who require admission for severe CAP or who have strong risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, blood culture sets should be collected before initiating antimicrobial therapy; culture and Gram stain of good quality samples of expectorated sputum, when available, should be obtained for patients requiring hospitalization; urinary antigen tests for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, where available, should be considered for patients with severe CAP; in patients with non-severe disease and strong epidemiological risk factors for Legionella infection, testing for Legionella is warranted; in geographic areas where Legionella species other than L. pneumophila are more prevalent, culture for Legionella should be performed if clinically indicated; and the molecular syndromic pneumonia panel tests also detect Legionella pneumophila.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)—specimen collection and quantitative culture thresholds: The 2016 IDSA and ATS guidelines recommend noninvasive sampling of the respiratory tract for both HAP and VAP. In non-ventilated patients, specimens may include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, or nasotracheal suction, and in ventilated patients, endotracheal aspirates are preferred. Quantitative assessment of newly obtained samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and protected specimen brush (PSB) specimens is often performed, and quantities of bacterial growth above a threshold are diagnostic of pneumonia while quantities below that threshold are more consistent with colonization, with generally accepted thresholds of endotracheal aspirates, 10^6 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL; BAL, 10^4 CFU/mL; and PSB, 10^3 CFU/mL.

### New guidelines for nosocomial pneumonia [^d4046099]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. New evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of these entities were released by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society in 2016. This review summarizes the recommendations contained within these guidelines and their supporting rationale.

Recent Findings

With respect to diagnosis of HAP and VAP, the guidelines suggest using semiquantitative cultures of noninvasively obtained respiratory samples instead of quantitative cultures of invasively obtained samples. With respect to antibiotic treatment, the guidelines separate the treatment approach for VAP and HAP (non-VAP), and stress the importance of devising an appropriate empiric regimen based on an appropriate hospital or unit-specific antibiogram. For VAP, coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is recommended only when patients have specific risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens or in units where greater than 10-20% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates are methicillin resistant. Single coverage for MDR gram-negative pathogens can be used in many HAP and VAP patients without risk factors for MDR pathogens when the antibiogram demonstrates that at least 90% of gram negatives are sensitive to the agent being considered for monotherapy. A 7-day course of antibiotics was recommended for most patients, including those with glucose nonfermenting gram-negative organisms.

Summary

New guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP contain several novel recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of these entities.

### Applying sputum as a diagnostic tool in pneumonia: limited yield, minimal impact on treatment decisions [^770dce5c]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We evaluated the role of sputum examination in the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a primary-care hospital without microbiologic laboratory facilities.

Design and Interventions

A diagnostic strategy using regular collection of sputum samples, Gram staining in a local laboratory, and mailing of samples to a commercial laboratory for culture analysis.

Setting

A 200-bed primary-care hospital without subspeciality physicians.

Patients

One hundred sixteen consecutive patients with a diagnosis of CAP were prospectively evaluated during a 12-month period.

Results

Of 116 patients, 42 patients (36%) were capable of producing a sputum sample. Age > or = 75 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.93) and prior ambulatory antimicrobial treatment (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 8.4) were independent predictors of sputum production. A delay in collection and processing of sputum samples of > 24 h was present in 31% and 39%, respectively. A delay in collection yielded an increased number of Gram-negative enteric bacilli and nonfermenters (44% vs. 7%, p = 0.056). A delay in processing was associated with an increased number of Candida spp isolates (33% vs. 9%, p = 0.16). The overall diagnostic yield was low (10 of 116 patients, 9%) due to a limited number of valid samples (n = 23 of 42 patients, 55%) and a limited number of definitely or probably positive samples on Gram's stain and culture (n = 10 of 42 patients, 24%). Prior ambulatory antimicrobial treatment was associated with a reduction in diagnostic yield (14% vs. 56%, p = 0.09). The impact of diagnostic results on antimicrobial treatment decisions was minimal, with antimicrobial treatment directed to diagnostic results in only one patient.

Conclusions

We conclude that in this setting representative of primary-care hospitals in Germany, sputum had a low diagnostic yield and did not contribute significantly to patient management.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic considerations—sputum collection and pleural effusion management are noted alongside mycobacterial workup: the Combicatch or similar technology may be required in the hospitalized patient who is intubated or unable to produce an adequate sputum sample, a thoracentesis should be performed in the patient with a pleural effusion, mycobacterial infections should be in the differential diagnosis of CAP that fails to respond to therapy for the typical CAP pathogens, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important pathogen among persons from areas of high endemicity.

A technical remark states that microscopic visualization and culture are quite specific but lack sensitivity; adding serum antibody and urine antigen testing increases overall diagnostic yield.

### Guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw [^73431c0c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

The 2005 American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America's guidelines for pneumonia introduced the new category of health-care-associated pneumonia, which increased the number of people to whom the guidelines for multidrug-resistant pathogens applied. Three fundamental issues inherent in the definition of hospital-acquired pneumonia and health-care-associated pneumonia undermined the credibility of these guidelines and the applicability of their recommendations: a vulnerability, a pitfall, and a fatal flaw. The vulnerability is the extreme heterogeneity of the population of patients. The fatal flaw is the failure to accurately diagnose hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia; inability to distinguish colonisation from infection in respiratory-tract cultures renders the guidelines inherently unstable. The pitfall is spiralling empiricism of antibiotic use for severely ill patients in whom infection might not be present. A vicious circle of antibiotic overuse leading to emergence of resistant microflora can become established, leading to unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum combination antibiotics and increased mortality. Controlled studies now show that administration of broad-spectrum combination antibiotic therapy can lead to increased mortality in uninfected patients. Proposed solutions include the use of individualised assessment of patients. Health-care-associated pneumonia should be broken down into several distinct subgroups so narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy can be used. Emphasis should be placed on defining the microbial cause of the pneumonia rather than reflex administration of empirical combination therapy.

For processing, do not process sputum for cultures if >10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field and use a suction catheter to obtain endotracheal aspirates. For reporting, do not routinely report Candida spp in respiratory tract specimens and add comments to interpret results (eg, usual respiratory flora, no S. aureus or P. aeruginosa identified).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^eb2c46c0]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in people with HIV—recommended diagnostic evaluation: In outpatients, routine diagnostic tests to identify a bacterial etiologic diagnosis are optional, especially if microbiologic studies cannot be performed promptly. In hospitalized patients, a Gram stain of expectorated sputum and two blood cultures are recommended, particularly in severe pneumonia, in those not on ART, or in those with a CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 (and especially if <100 cells/mm3) prior to hospitalization; specimens should ideally be obtained before initiation of antibiotics, or within 12 hours to 18 hours of such initiation. Urinary antigen tests for L. pneumophila and S. pneumoniae are recommended in hospitalized patients, particularly with severe CAP; lower respiratory tract secretions should be cultured for Legionella on selective media or undergo Legionella nucleic acid amplification testing in adults with severe CAP, and Legionella testing should also be done in non-severe CAP when indicated by epidemiological factors (Legionella outbreak or recent travel). Microbiologic diagnostic testing is indicated whenever epidemiologic, clinical, or radiologic clues prompt suspicion of specific pathogens that could alter standard empirical management decisions. If available, rapid MRSA nasal testing should be performed, particularly with risk factors for MRSA or in a high prevalence setting, as results can direct empiric antibiotic therapy. Gram stain and culture of sputum is recommended in all hospitalized patients meeting the criteria stated above and is optional in people with HIV with CAP not meeting these criteria; in general, Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum should be performed only if a good-quality specimen can be obtained prior to—or not more than 12hours to 18 hours after—initiation of antibiotics.

- previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially with prior respiratory tract infection

- hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days.

Conclusion

In summary, our study raises the point that a comprehensive approach might be undertaken for microbiological diagnosis in critically ill nonventilated HAP. Sputum determined one third of microbiological diagnosis in HAP patients who were not subsequently intubated. Invasive methods were associated with higher rates of microbiological diagnosis; however, this might be replicated in other populations and through a randomized, well-designed, controlled trial.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP—antibiotic strategy guidance: For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who are not in septic shock or at a high risk for death, and for whom the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we recommend monotherapy using an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible rather than combination therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we suggest combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible rather than monotherapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). High risk of death in the meta-regression analysis was defined as mortality risk >25%; low risk of death is defined as mortality risk <15%. For a patient whose septic shock resolves when antimicrobial sensitivities were known, continued combination therapy is not recommended.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)—Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli epidemiology and treatment adequacy show that a meta-analysis of 23 studies found P. aeruginosa was associated with 13% of cases of HAP and other gram-negative bacilli with 22% of cases; an observational study of 165 patients suggested inadequate initial treatment may be associated with increased mortality, but this was indirect evidence because the causative pathogen was identified in only one-third of cases and, when identified, <50% were due to P. aeruginosa or other gram-negative bacilli.

### Invasive and non-invasive diagnostic approaches for microbiological diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia [^745ccb02]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Microbiologic assessment and methods

We tried to assess all patients upon clinical diagnosis of HAP, aiming to establish a microbiological diagnosis. Lower respiratory airway samples that could be collected for quantitative bacterial and fungal cultures were (1) sputum, (2) endotracheal aspirate (EAT), (3) bronchial aspirate through a fiberoptic-bronchoscopy (FBAS), and (4) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blinded or through a fiberoptic-bronchoscopy. Only samples of sputum or tracheal aspirates of high quality (i.e. < 10 squamous cells and > 25 leukocytes per optical microscopy field) were processed for culture. Additionally, blood cultures (recommended to all patients) and pleural fluid (if a pleural puncture was indicated) could be collected, as well as urinary antigens of Legionella sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae (mainly recommended for early-onset HAP). Pathogen identification and susceptibility testing were performed by standard methods. Microbiological diagnosis was defined by the presence of at least one potentially pathogenic microorganism (PPM) in respiratory samples above predefined thresholds (sputum, EAT, FBAS > 10 5 colony-forming units/mL or BAL > 10 4, or any count if the patient was receiving a new systemic antibiotic treatment). Blood cultures were considered positive if an alternative cause of bacteremia was ruled out.

Polymicrobial pneumonia was defined when more than one PPM was identified as causative agents. The initial empiric antimicrobial treatment was chosen following a local adaptation of the 2005 ATS/IDSA guidelines, based on the most frequently isolated pathogens and their patterns of antimicrobial sensitivity at our institution. The empiric antimicrobial treatment was considered appropriate when the isolated pathogens were susceptible in vitro to at least one of the antimicrobials administered. Multi-drug-resistant pathogens were defined based on consensus definition.

Antibiotic de-escalation was considered when physicians changed the antibiotic regimen to a narrower spectrum regimen, stopped the coverage for a class of pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), or reduced the number of antibiotics prescribed. Escalation was considered when physicians introduced a new regimen with broader coverage. We further divided the patients whom the empiric antibiotic scheme was maintained in those that no change was done, and in those whom an additional antibiotic was added to the empiric regimen.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^14e0c452]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) definitions—diagnostic scope and time thresholds: The panel states the existing definitions are clinically useful and generally accepted and did not consider amending them, and defines pneumonia as the presence of a new lung infiltrate plus clinical evidence of infection including new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation, while recognizing there is no gold standard for diagnosing HAP or VAP. HAP is defined as a pneumonia not incubating at hospital admission and occurring 48 hours or more after admission, and VAP is defined as a pneumonia occurring >48 hours after endotracheal intubation. In this document, HAP denotes pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation; thus, HAP and VAP are mutually exclusive events.

### The diagnostic yield of noninvasive microbiologic sputum sampling in a cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed hospital-acquired pneumonia [^4f15475d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical predictors of positive sputum culture have not been previously reported in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and data on yield of sputum culture in this setting are scant. Current Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for HAP recommend noninvasive sputum sampling, though the data for this practice are limited. We assessed the yield of sputum culture in HAP cases at an academic medical center from January 2007 to July 2013. HAP cases were identifi ed by International Classifi cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision-Clinical Modifi cation codes for bacterial pneumonia and all cases were validated by chart review. Our cohort had 1172 hospitalizations with a HAP diagnosis. At least 1 sputum specimen was collected noninvasively and sent for bacterial culture after hospital day 2 and within 7 days of HAP diagnosis in 344 of these hospitalizations (29.4%), with a total of 478 sputum specimens, yielding 63 (13.2%) positive, 109 (22.8%) negative, and 306 (64.0%) contaminated cultures (>10 epithelial cells per high power fi eld). Signifi cant predictors of a positive sputum culture were chronic lung disease (relative risk [RR] = 2.0; 95% confi dence interval [CI], 1.2-3.4) and steroid use (RR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2). The most commonly identifi ed organisms were Gram-negative rods not further speciated (25.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (21.0%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.8%). Because of the ease of obtaining a sputum sample combined with the prevalence of commonly drug-resistant organisms, we suggest that sputum culture in HAP is a potentially useful noninvasive diagnostic technique.

### Unmet needs in pneumonia research: a comprehensive approach by the CAPNETZ study group [^60fe4f87]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Identified topics covering unmet needs in CAP research

Detection of causative pathogens

Current setting

Defining the causative pathogen in patients with pneumonia is relevant for ensuring the best-suited antimicrobial treatment. However, microbial diagnosis of pneumonia is still based on culture in most hospitals worldwide and a causative pathogen is only detected in the minority of patients. In a recent CAPNETZ study, bacteraemia rates in CAP were 0.5% in outpatients, 7.8% in hospitalized patients, 12.4% in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and a relevant proportion of patients with bacteraemia and CAP (34.6%) was afebrile. With the rapid emergence of novel diagnostic techniques (e.g. isothermic multiplex-PCRs for point of care testing, microbiome analysis, host transcriptomics and metagenomics), the question arises if these techniques will provide an added value to the currently available and established diagnostic methods and whether they will change management.

Unmet needs

Define an improved gold standard for microbial diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia: Currently, microscopy and culture of lower respiratory tract specimens as well as blood cultures, detection of urine antigen detection and serology are routinely used to complement thorax imaging results in diagnosing pneumonia. However, most tests (particularly serology) lack sensitivity and specificity, while tests with a high sensitivity, such as PCR for non-influenza respiratory viruses may currently not properly translate into clinical relevance. No internationally accepted standard for microbiological tests in CAP has been defined, both in terms of including novel PCR-based techniques but also regarding the quality of the required respiratory samples. There is a need for a consented diagnostic standard that also serves as comparison for new diagnostic techniques.

### Pulmonary infections in critical / intensive care-rapid diagnosis and optimizing antimicrobial usage [^95de3f27]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diagnosis of pulmonary infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the critically ill patient remains a common and therapeutically challenging diagnosis with significant attributable morbidity, mortality, and cost. Current clinical approaches to surveillance, early detection and, conventional culture-based microbiology are inadequate for optimal targeted antibiotic treatment and stewardship. Efforts to enhance diagnosis of HAP and VAP and the impact of these novel approaches on rational antimicrobial selection and stewardship are the focus of recent studies reviewed here.

Recent Findings

Recent consensus guidelines for diagnosis and management of HAP and VAP are relatively silent on the potential role of novel rapid microbiological techniques and reply heavily on conventional culture strategies of noninvasively obtained (including endotracheal aspirate samples). Novel rapid microbiological diagnostics, including nucleic acid amplification, mass spectrometry, and fluorescence microscopy-based technologies are promising approaches for the future. Exhaled breath biomarkers, including measurement of VOC represent a future approach.

Summary

Further validation of novel diagnostic technology platforms will be required to evaluate their utility for enhancing diagnosis and guiding treatment of pulmonary infections in the critically ill. However, the integration of novel diagnostics for rapid microbial identification, resistance phenotyping, and antibiotic sensitivity testing into usual care practice could significantly transform the care of patients and potentially inform improved targeted antimicrobial selection, de-escalation, and stewardship.

Blood cultures in adults with CAP—We recommend not obtaining blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the outpatient setting (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) and we suggest not routinely obtaining blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend obtaining pretreatment blood cultures in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting who are classified as severe CAP (see Table 1) (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), are being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), were previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially those with prior respiratory tract infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence), or were hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The yield of blood cultures in most series of adults with nonsevere CAP is low, ranging from 2% (outpatients) to 9% (inpatients).

### Surveillance cultures in healthcare-associated pneumonia: sense or nonsense? [^639aa0c5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review explores the usefulness of surveillance cultures in healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

Recent Findings

The definition of HCAP is controversial. Causative micro-organisms of HCAP resemble those found in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Some types of surveillance cultures have proven useful in hospitalized patients. Whereas numerous studies have investigated the role of surveillance cultures in VAP, one may wonder whether surveillance culture implementation should belong in HCAP management guidelines.

Summary

Studies exploring the usefulness of obtaining surveillance cultures in VAP are numerous, but are mostly retrospective, observational and/or quasi-experimental in nature. Surveillance cultures may be useful for antibiotic guidance, but positive predictive value and specificity of surveillance cultures are low, obviously negatively impacting on cost effectiveness, especially in the large population at risk for HCAP. On the other hand, multidrug-resistance is increasing and surveillance cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in ICU-admitted patients appeared useful and cost-effective. Furthermore, surveillance cultures for the presence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli might be useful for antibiotic guidance. Currently, neither community-acquired pneumonia, HCAP, HAP nor VAP guidelines incorporate surveillance cultures. In the future, surveillance cultures in populations at risk for HCAP may be able to differentiate HCAP from other kinds of pneumonia and authorize its reason for existence.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia?: grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1fb53be2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bd24d22c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)—empiric Staphylococcus aureus coverage and MRSA risk factors: The panel recommend that all empiric regimens include an antibiotic with activity against S. aureus, and the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Although 10% (95% CI 6%–14%) of HAP cases are attributable to MRSA, this was insufficient justification to target MRSA in all HAP patients. Factors that probably increase MRSA risk include prior known MRSA colonization detected via nasal or respiratory cultures or nonculture screening, a high-quality Gram stain showing numerous and predominant gram-positive cocci in clusters, hospitalization in a unit where >20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant or the prevalence is not known (with the 20% threshold arbitrarily chosen), and intravenous antibiotic treatment during the prior 90 days. When MRSA coverage is chosen, the guideline panel prefers vancomycin or linezolid, noting similar clinical outcomes and that final choice rests on blood cell counts, concurrent prescriptions for serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, renal function, and cost.

### Pathogenic characteristics of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infection in a large teaching hospital in China: a retrospective study [^82151511]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this study, we evaluated the significance of sputum culture from a new perspective. This study compared the differences in pathogens and antimicrobial sensitivity between sputum samples and BALF, and compared the differences before and after quality control of sputum samples. Studies have shown that the results of culture and antimicrobial sensitivity are quite different between qualified sputum specimens and BALF. BALF was obtained via fiberoptic bronchoscopy and could represent the status of LRI infection. However, sputum specimens are easily contaminated by colonies in the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, clinicians need to be very careful when diagnosing and treating LRI on the basis of the results of sputum culture.

Sputum specimens are not optimal specimens from the viewpoint of LRI diagnosis. Doctors obtain biopsy specimens via fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the results of which could identify LRI. However, fiberoptic bronchoscopy is invasive and is not suitable for every patient. At present, qualified sputum specimens together with some invasive surgical techniques (e.g. transtracheal aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage, protected brush samples) are acceptable in the global LRI surveillance project. In the face of LRI, which is the most appropriate type of specimen is a question worth considering. The American Association of Pediatric Infectious Diseases specifies that blood cultures should be tested for moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children, especially those with complex pneumonia. However, at present, the rate of blood culture in Chinese patients with LRI is low. A multicenter study carried out in China showed that blood culture isolates accounted for only 5.3% of all specimen types. For LRIs, the question of whether one should perform blood culture or sputum culture is something every clinician often considers. Different strategies should be adopted for different patients. Outpatient blood culture and sputum culture are not routinely required. For inpatients with low-severity LRI, only sputum culture is needed. For inpatients with moderate severity LRI and no intensive care unit sputum culture, blood culture, legionella urinary antigen, and pneumococcal urinary antigen should be examined routinely. For inpatients in the intensive care unit with high-severity LRI, invasive sampling should also be performed in addition to all the above mentioned tests.

### The importance of cultural sensitivity in providing effective care for... [^cb97d5fa]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Cultural sensitivity is broadly recognized as the knowledge, skills, attitudes and beliefs that enable people to work well with, respond effectively to, and be supportive of people in cross-cultural settings. Cultural sensitivity is not solely the acceptance of cultural differences, but rather a transformational process that allows individuals to acknowledge interdependence and align with a group other than their own. Culturally proficient health care, in particular, makes use of a patient’s language and culture as tools to improve outcomes for that individual. The enhanced CLAS standards list the following elements of culture, acknowledging that culture is not limited to the following: Cultural sensitivity is an essential element for patient safety and adherence.

The National Center for Culture Competence provides six reasons for the implementation of cultural sensitivity: These six reasons touch upon two overarching and intertwined themes: social justice and good business practice. Cultural sensitivity, with its expected outcome, health equity, is not simply the “right thing to do. ” In today’s era of accountable care and emphasis on improving care and controlling cost, cultural proficiency is a “must do. ” Cultural sensitivity potentially can save both lives and money.

describes 15 distinct standards that are organized around 3 themes: Theme 1: Governance, Leadership and Workforce Theme 2: Communication and Language Assistance Theme 3: Engagement, Continuous Improvement and Accountability The Principal Standard of the Blueprint is, “To provide effective, equitable, understandable and respectful quality care and services that are responsive to diverse cultural health beliefs and practices, preferred languages, health literacy and other communication needs. ” This standard frames the essential goal of the remaining 14 standards and aligns with AAFP’s vision “to transform healthcare to achieve optimal health for everyone. ”. Communication and Language Assistance The AAFP endorses the 2013 enhanced CLAS standards that improve patient safety and reduce medical error due to miscommunication. Patients need to understand their care and participate in decisions regarding their health.

In order to ensure that individuals with limited English proficiency have equitable access to health services, AAFP supports the use of qualified interpreters who demonstrate special language aptitude in both the language of medical terminology and in health systems. Organizations must comply with requirements such as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and other relevant federal, state and local requirements. Written materials and signage should be easy to understand and translatable.

### Sputum as a diagnostic tool in patients with pneumonia-AAFP (...) [^fd186bab]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The use of sputum as a diagnostic tool in evaluating patients with community-acquired pneumonia is controversial. Recent studies have questioned any positive impact of sputum examination on treatment strategies. However, treatment guidelines that insist on using sputum results to direct treatment decisions in CAP persist. A recent update of the American Thoracic Society guidelines suggests collecting sputum samples only when the suspected etiology is a drug-resistant organism or one not covered by empiric treatment. Ewig and associates evaluated the use of sputum in the management of patients with CAP. A diagnostic strategy was established for patients with CAP who presented to a 200-bed primary care hospital without microbiologic facilities in Germany. This strategy included obtaining a Gram stain of the sputum and follow-up cultures. The sputum was evaluated to determine if it was purulent or mucoid.

It was also graded for the presence of leukocytes and bacteria, and the absence of epithelial cells. End points recorded included the number of patients capable of producing sputum, reasons for failure to collect sputum, validity of sputum samples, and the number of definite or probable samples. The impact of sputum sample diagnostic results on antibiotic decision-making was measured. There were 116 patients who met the diagnostic and study criteria. Of these patients, only 36 percent were able to produce a sputum sample. Older patients and those who had prior treatment with antibiotic therapy were less likely to produce sputum. Using the study criteria, 55 percent of sputum samples were considered microscopically valid. In only 10 patients were diagnostic results yielded. The impact on antibiotic decision-making was minimal; antibiotics were changed on the basis of sputum results in only one case.

The authors conclude that sputum has a low diagnostic yield in the management of CAP in the primary care setting. In this study population, the number of adequate sputum samples was small, and the diagnostic yield was minimal. The authors state that sputum studies should not be part of a management algorithm in the treatment of CAP in primary care.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa HAP/VAP—monotherapy vs combination therapy: For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who are not in septic shock or at a high risk for death, and for whom the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we recommend monotherapy using an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible rather than combination therapy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock or at a high risk for death when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, we suggest combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolate is susceptible rather than monotherapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa, we recommend against aminoglycoside monotherapy (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). High risk of death in the meta-regression analysis was defined as mortality risk ≥25%; low risk of death is defined as mortality risk ≤15%.

### Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review of the literature [^b548822e]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The major limitation of the clinical approach to diagnosis is that it consistently leads to more antibiotic therapy than when therapy decisions are based on the findings of invasive lower respiratory tract samples. The clinical approach is overly sensitive, and patients can be treated for pneumonia when another non-infectious process is responsible for the clinical findings.

As none of the available diagnostic tests, performed alone, can provide an accurate diagnosis of VAP, a diagnostic strategy incorporating several criteria seems to be a good compromise. On the basis of clinical data, patients with clinical suspicion of VAP should be further evaluated by imaging procedures, bacteriological cultures, and biomarkers (Figure 1). The results of complementary diagnostic procedures should be used to refine the probability of diagnosing VAP and guide therapeutic decisions. Quantitative cultures should be performed on endotracheal aspirates or samples collected bronchoscopically, each technique having its own methodological limitations. Delays in the initiation of adequate antibiotic therapy increase mortality of VAP and thus therapy should not be postponed for the purpose of performing diagnostic studies in patients who are clinically unstable. The presence of organ dysfunction may necessitate the prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. Garrard and A'Court recommended regular, repeated surveillance with a simple, inexpensive, and well tolerated lavage technique in addition to daily clinical scoring to identify patients who may have VAP. A recent meta-analysis of four randomized studies with a total of 628 patients showed that invasive strategies for the diagnosis of VAP did not alter mortality. In a recent multicenter trial, Heyland et al. randomized 740 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation and who had suspected VAP after 4 days in the ICU to undergo either BAL with quantitative culture of the BAL fluid or endotracheal aspiration with non-quantitative culture of the aspirate. Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated in all patients until culture results were available, at which point a protocol of targeted therapy was used for discontinuing or reducing the dose or number of antibiotics, or for resuming antibiotic therapy to treat a pre-enrollment condition if the culture was negative. There was no significant difference in outcomes or the use of antibiotics. The most likely explanation for this lack of effect on outcome is that prompt adequate initial antimicrobial coverage is the crucial issue affecting survival. Inappropriate or inadequate treatment refers to the use of antibiotics with either limited or no in vitro activity against the microorganism causing the infection. Since invasive sampling for suspected VAP does not directly affect the initial antibiotic prescription, it is not surprising that it does not alter mortality. Because of the nature of the technology, the culture results from bronchoscopy become available only after the crucial period when the clinician can intervene to maximal effect.

### Use of quantitative cultures and reduced duration of antibiotic regimens for patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia to decrease resistance in the intensive care unit [^e9d8bdcd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is responsible for approximately half of the infections acquired in the intensive care unit and represents one of the principal reasons for the prescription of antibiotics in this setting. Invasive diagnostic methods, including bronchoalveolar lavage and/or protected specimen bronchial brushing, could improve the identification of patients with true bacterial pneumonia and facilitate decisions of whether to treat. These techniques also permit rapid optimization of the choice of antibiotics in patients with proven bacterial infection, once the results of respiratory tract cultures become available, based on the identity of the specific pathogens and their susceptibility to specific antibiotics, to avoid prolonged use of a broader spectrum of antibiotic therapy than is justified by the available information. Because unnecessary prolongation of antibiotic therapy for patients with true bacterial infection may lead to the selection of multidrug-resistant microorganisms without improving clinical outcome, efforts to reduce the duration of therapy for nosocomial infections are also warranted. An 8-day regimen can probably be standard for patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Possible exceptions to this recommendation include immunosuppressed patients, patients who are bacteremic or whose initial antibiotic therapy was not appropriate for the causative microorganism(s), and patients whose infection is with very difficult-to-treat microorganisms and show no improvement in clinical signs of infection.

Acinetobacter species HAP/VAP—treatment recommendations are: “In patients with HAP/VAP caused by Acinetobacter species, we suggest treatment with either a carbapenem or ampicillin/sulbactam if the isolate is susceptible to these agents (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).” For isolates “that is sensitive only to polymyxins, we recommend intravenous polymyxin (colistin or polymyxin B) (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we suggest adjunctive inhaled colistin (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).” For isolates “that is sensitive only to colistin, we suggest NOT using adjunctive rifampicin (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).” Additionally, “we recommend against the use of tigecycline (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).” Values and preferences: “These recommendations place a relatively higher value on avoiding potential adverse effects due to the use of combination therapy with rifampicin and colistin, over achieving an increased microbial eradication rate, as eradication rate was not associated with improved clinical outcome.” Remarks: “Selection of an appropriate antibiotic for definitive (nonempiric) therapy requires antimicrobial susceptibility testing.”

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to blood cultures, inpatient setting, severe CAP, ESCMID 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining blood cultures in patients admitted with CAP and risk factors for or initiated on therapy for unusual or resistant pathogens.

### Diagnostic test for etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia [^34adfd96]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests for the detection of the etiologic agent of pneumonia are neither recommended nor done for most outpatients with CAP (Table 4).Most of these patients have no clear diagnosis but seem to do well with empiric antibiotic treatment, which often costs less than the diagnostic tests. For hospitalized patients, a pre-treatment blood culture and an expectorated sputum gram stain and culture should be done. Testing for Legionella spp is appropriate in hospitalized patients, especially those who are seriously ill. New tests that merit use in selected patients are the urinary antigen assay for S pneumoniae and the PCR test for L pneumophila. Anticipated developments in the near future are PCR tests for detection of C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae.

HAP (Non-VAP) antibiotic duration—recommendation states: For patients with HAP, we recommend a 7-day course of antimicrobial therapy (rather than a longer duration, very low-quality evidence). Remarks indicate that shorter or longer durations may be used depending on the rate of improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters, and the guideline panel found no studies that provided useful data for comparing short-term to long-term antibiotic therapy in HAP.

IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guidelines—evidence search and review methods—limited searches to studies performed in adults and those published in English or containing an English abstract, used no publication year limits, performed initial searches in 2012 and 2013 with an update in July 2014, and included studies published up to November 2015; titles and abstracts were screened with full-text review using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria; the panel decided if a qualitative and/or a quantitative analysis was appropriate; evidence summaries were prepared using the GRADE approach; panelists were not required to update recently performed meta-analyses unless likely to change the strength or direction of a recommendation; and literature search strategies, evidence tables, evidence profiles, and additional data, including meta-analysis results, can be found in the supplementary materials.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) microbiology—meta-analysis of prevalence across studies: We selected 24 studies that provided relevant data, with patients enrolled predominantly in North America, Europe, and Asia, with a small percentage from South America. A meta-analysis determined the following frequencies of potentially drug-resistant pathogens in HAP isolates: non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (19% [95% CI, 15%–24%]) with Pseudomonas species 13% [95% CI, 10%–17%] and Acinetobacter species 4% [95% CI, 2%–6%]; enteric gram-negative bacilli (16% [95% CI, 13%–20%]), Staphylococcus aureus (16% [95% CI, 12%–21%]), MRSA (10% [95% CI 6%–14%]), and MSSA (6% of isolates). There was considerable variation across studies, but the study year and geographic area did not account for the variation, with the possible exception of Acinetobacter species, which increased in prevalence from studies published between 1994 and 1999 to studies published between 2000 and 2012 and was a more common cause of HAP in Asia than in Europe and the United States. Because specific antibiotic sensitivities were not reported in most studies, the results reflect potentially antibiotic-resistant organisms, not actual antibiotic resistance rates, and there was also variation in the unit of analysis (ie, the patient or the isolate).
