## Question

Are small palpable submental lymph nodes normal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether small palpable submental lymph nodes can be normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about anatomic normalcy and what "submental" nodes are expected to do in health. Then, I should verify population data showing how often these nodes are seen in healthy individuals. Next, I need to check how "small" and "palpable" are defined clinically, including size, texture, and duration cutoffs. After that, I will review discriminating clinical features and drainage patterns that make benign reactivity more likely. Finally, I will synthesize red flags that should prompt evaluation and suggest when observation is reasonable, aligning with guideline-based approaches to lymphadenopathy evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic context. Submental nodes are a normal component of the cervical lymphatic system within the submental triangle and serve as an early drainage basin for the chin, lower lip, anterior floor of mouth, and anterior tongue; their presence on exam or imaging, by itself, is not pathological, and normal head and neck imaging surveys consistently identify multiple nodal groups in healthy populations, including in level I regions that encompass the submental area [^117Azxzs].

> Wait, let me verify I am not conflating anatomy here. I almost slipped into discussing the submandibular region, but the question is specifically about submental nodes beneath the chin; submandibular nodes are adjacent to the submandibular space and gland and are a different compartment, so my focus must stay on submental palpability rather than submandibular gland or space pathology.

> Next, I should review healthy-population evidence. A retrospective MRI study of 200 children with otherwise normal imaging demonstrated that head and neck nodes, including submental nodes, are identifiable in asymptomatic, healthy individuals and often exhibit an oval morphology with a short-to-long axis ratio around 0.6; importantly, the authors concluded that rounder and larger nodes may still be normal, depending on location and age, reinforcing that visibility or palpability alone does not equal disease [^117Azxzs].

> I need to define what "small" and "palpable" mean clinically. Although absolute normal cutoffs vary by region and age, general lymphadenopathy guidance supports that nodes under about 1 cm are often benign or reactive, particularly in children; nodes in the 1–2 cm range may still be reactive, especially with recent local infection; and nodes larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted are more concerning and merit further evaluation, particularly if they persist beyond four weeks or are accompanied by systemic symptoms [^117Azxzs] [^113wGzNw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; palpability must be interpreted with discriminating features. Soft, mobile, and tender nodes typically point to benign infectious or inflammatory causes, whereas hard, fixed, or matted nodes, progressive enlargement, or persistence beyond approximately four weeks increase the likelihood of significant pathology; age modifies risk, with palpable nodes being very common and often benign in children but relatively more concerning in older adults, especially with B symptoms or risk factors [^113wGzNw] [^116EJVzK].

> I will now consider drainage patterns, because they shape pretest probability. Submental nodes drain the lower lip, chin skin, anterior floor of mouth, and anterior tongue, so recent perioral, dental, or mucosal infections, herpes labialis, or minor skin infections commonly produce small, reactive submental nodes; this is particularly frequent in children and young adults who experience frequent viral and odontogenic stimuli [^114nSZjd] [^1125c4TM].

> But wait, what about location-based risk categories. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, or iliac nodes are classically considered abnormal and high risk on exam, while submental nodes are not in that inherently high-risk category; thus, a small palpable submental node is not the same risk signal as a palpable supraclavicular node, and context must drive action rather than palpability alone [^113wGzNw].

> Next, I should review when and how imaging helps if concern persists. Point-of-care or formal ultrasound can characterize nodal morphology, vascularity, and perinodal changes to distinguish reactive from suppurative or neoplastic patterns; however, very small micrometastases are below the detection threshold of cross-sectional imaging, so ultrasound features and clinical course together guide whether to observe, treat presumed infection, or proceed to sampling when worrisome features appear [^114LuJXs] [^111HVVax].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the recommendation is balanced. Small palpable submental nodes can indeed be normal, especially in children and young adults, when they are less than about 1 cm, soft, mobile, non-tender, temporally linked to local oral or cutaneous inflammation, and not enlarging; conversely, persistence beyond four weeks, size exceeding approximately 2 cm, hard or fixed consistency, progressive growth, or systemic features should prompt evaluation, often beginning with targeted ultrasound and, if risk is elevated, fine-needle aspiration rather than open biopsy to obtain tissue safely and expeditiously [^116EJVzK] [^113wGzNw] [^1155GpeK].

---

Yes, small palpable submental lymph nodes are **normal in healthy individuals** [^116EJVzK], especially in children and adolescents [^117Azxzs], and are usually **benign and self-limited** [^113wGzNw]. Nodes **≤ 1 cm**, soft, mobile, and non-tender are typically reactive to minor oral or dental inflammation [^114nSZjd]. Persistent nodes **> 2 cm**, hard, fixed, or associated with systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^116EJVzK] warrant further evaluation with ultrasound and possible biopsy [^1155GpeK] [^116qctE6].

---

## Normal size and characteristics

Normal submental lymph nodes are typically **≤ 1 cm in adults** [^116EJVzK]; in children, **up to 1.5 cm** can be normal due to a more active immune system [^117Azxzs]. They are soft to slightly firm, mobile, and non-tender, with a smooth surface and no matting or fixation to surrounding tissues [^113wGzNw]. They are oval or bean-shaped, and on ultrasound they demonstrate a **preserved fatty hilum** [^111HVVax].

---

## Common benign causes of palpable submental lymph nodes

Palpable submental nodes are **most often reactive to benign conditions**, such as [^114nSZjd]:

- **Dental infections**: Caries, periodontal disease, or periapical abscesses [^114nSZjd].

- **Oral infections**: Gingivitis, stomatitis, or aphthous ulcers.

- **Upper respiratory infections**: Pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or sinusitis [^116EJVzK].

- **Viral infections**: Epstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis), cytomegalovirus, or herpes simplex virus [^114nSZjd] [^1125c4TM].

- **Minor trauma**: Oral mucosal injury or recent dental procedures [^116EJVzK].

---

## Clinical features suggesting malignancy or serious pathology

While most palpable submental nodes are benign, some features **raise concern for malignancy** or serious disease [^1155GpeK]:

- **Size**: Nodes > 2 cm or rapidly enlarging [^113wGzNw].

- **Consistency**: Hard, firm, or rubbery nodes [^1155GpeK].

- **Fixation**: Nodes fixed to surrounding tissues or matted [^116EJVzK].

- **Duration**: Persistent nodes > 4 weeks without regression [^116EJVzK].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue [^113wGzNw].

- **Associated findings**: Oral lesions, persistent ulcers, or masses in the head and neck region [^1155GpeK].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

When evaluating palpable submental lymph nodes, **a systematic approach is essential**:

- **History**: Recent infections, dental issues, trauma, systemic symptoms, travel, animal exposures, medications, and family history [^116EJVzK].

- **Physical examination**: Node size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, and associated oral or neck lesions [^1155GpeK].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, and specific serologies (e.g. EBV, CMV, HIV) if indicated [^116EJVzK].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality; CT or MRI if deeper structures are involved or malignancy is suspected [^111HVVax].

- **Biopsy**: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy if malignancy is suspected or nodes persist beyond 4 weeks without regression [^1155GpeK] [^116qctE6].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**. Benign reactive nodes are managed with observation and reassurance, while underlying infections or inflammation are treated. Infectious lymphadenitis is treated with appropriate antibiotics or antiviral therapy [^116EJVzK]. Malignancy is managed with surgical excision, radiation, or chemotherapy based on tumor type and stage [^112eovgF]. Persistent unexplained nodes warrant biopsy and further evaluation [^1155GpeK].

---

## Prognosis and clinical significance

Benign reactive nodes have an **excellent prognosis**; most resolve spontaneously or with treatment of the underlying cause [^113wGzNw]. The prognosis of **malignant nodes** depends on tumor type, stage, and treatment response; early detection and treatment improve outcomes [^1155GpeK].

---

Small palpable submental lymph nodes are **normal in healthy individuals**, especially in children and adolescents, and are usually **benign and self-limited** [^117Azxzs] [^113wGzNw]. Persistent nodes > 2 cm, hard, fixed, or associated with systemic symptoms require further evaluation [^1155GpeK].

### Lymphadenopathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (e.g. complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (e.g. bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### Normal head and neck lymph nodes in the paediatric population [^117Azxzs]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the normal range of head and neck lymph nodes in a paediatric population.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective review was conducted on 200 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in patients aged between 5 months to 16 years. Exclusion criteria included any possible causes for lymphadenopathy. These studies were previously reported as normal. Eight regions were assessed for the presence of nodes, and both the short and long axes of the largest node were measured. Subsequently, the ratio was calculated.

- **Results**: The most commonly identifiable nodes were the deep cervical, submandibular, and posterior cervical, found in 100%, 99.5%, and 92.5% of studies, respectively. In terms of the long axis, the three largest nodes were the submandibular, deep cervical, and posterior cervical, with mean values of 19.7, 18.1, and 15.4 mm, respectively. For the short to long (S/L) axis ratio, the nodes with the most oval shape were the pre-auricular, occipital, and submental, with ratios of 0.64, 0.63, and 0.6, respectively. A positive correlation between the occipital and deep cervical lymph node groups with age was found to be stronger than that for other localisations.

- **Conclusion**: This study characterises the normal distribution, size, and shape of head and neck lymph nodes in a healthy paediatric population, demonstrating that rounder and larger lymph nodes may be normal, depending on their location and patient age.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates an underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy, depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### Incidental suspicious regional lymph nodes on breast sonography: Is sampling necessary [^115vUzP5]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Suspicious regional lymph nodes may be incidentally identified on breast ultrasound examinations in patients who present for sonographic evaluation without a known or suspected breast malignancy, and there is a paucity of data on whether biopsy should be performed. This study aims to characterize incidental sonographically detected suspicious regional lymph nodes and determine whether tissue sampling or follow-up imaging is required.

A total of 40,773 consecutive breast ultrasounds were reviewed. Overall, 7 women with nonpalpable, incidental, suspicious axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes in an otherwise unremarkable breast and without a history of malignancy or systemic disease were identified. In all, 5 women with 6 nodes underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, and 2 women with 3 nodes were recommended follow-up ultrasound. Follow-up imaging, cytology, and all-cause clinical data were reviewed to evaluate outcomes.

All 6 biopsied lymph nodes (mean = 1.5 cm) were benign on cytology. Follow-up imaging was available for 3 nodes (mean = 2.6 years), with all-cause follow-up for all nodes of 2.2 years. In the follow-up group, 3 lymph nodes (mean = 1.6 cm) were monitored (mean = 4.3 years) with all-cause follow-up of 4.7 years. No new cancers, growth, or suspicious features were found in these nodes during follow-up for either group of women.

In conclusion, women without a history of prior malignancy or systemic disease with incidentally detected, nonpalpable, suspicious regional lymph nodes and an otherwise normal breast ultrasound examination underwent fine needle aspiration and showed no new malignancy upon follow-up.

### Pleomorphic adenoma of the submandibular gland with skull metastasis: A case report [^116Rue4B]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). High credibility.

Metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma is a rare entity that has the propensity for distant metastasis despite being histologically benign. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with a long-standing right upper neck swelling and a recent-onset swelling over the left side of the scalp. Clinical workup did not reveal any other tumor deposits in the body. Complete excision of the right submandibular gland and the scalp swelling was performed. The case was diagnosed as metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma. The exact cause of the malignant manifestation of this histologically benign entity is unclear. The time of appearance of a metastatic deposit is highly variable and is usually preceded by a local recurrence. Further research on the malignant behavior of this entity is warranted.

Regarding the medical management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, specifically in relation to the management of regional lymph nodes, the NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend performing a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy in patients with palpable regional lymph nodes or abnormal lymph nodes identified by imaging studies. It is advised to conduct an ultrasound-guided biopsy at a center or by a physician with expertise. Consider preferring a core biopsy over FNA when the primary tumor histology is uncertain or if a larger tissue sample is required for further genetic or other testing.

### Imaging evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy: Approach, classification, and differential diagnosis [^112gpK21]. Seminars in Roentgenology (2025). High credibility.

Hilar lymphadenopathy may arise from various causes, including head and neck cancer, thyroid cancer, lymphoma, and lymph node metastasis. Other potential causes include coal worker pneumoconiosis, systemic sclerosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis. This condition can also be associated with bacterial pneumonia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, silicosis, and berylliosis. Furthermore, sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Castleman disease are also possible contributors. Additional causes encompass primary pulmonary hypertension, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, cytomegalovirus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and amyloidosis. Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and bronchiectasis are also related. Medications like phenytoin can additionally be a cause of hilar lymphadenopathy.

### Diagnostic test accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116mQR7P]. Head & Neck (2022). Low credibility.

Laryngeal and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comes with a substantial risk for cervical lymph node metastases. Historically, diagnostic work-up had limited accuracy for the detection of small nodal metastases, leading to the routine performance of elective irradiation of large anatomical volumes of the neck in the majority of patients with a clinically negative neck (cN0) receiving definitive (chemo)radiotherapy (CRT). The aim is to eradicate metastases that remain undetectable by diagnostics (i.e. occult or microscopic metastases).

Multimodal high‐resolution imaging approaches now boast unprecedented accuracy in detecting small nodal metastases. Consequently, the risk of microscopic nodal metastases and the overall microscopic tumor burden is currently much lower compared to previous decades. Nonetheless, elective neck irradiation (ENI) has remained largely unchanged, resulting in RT doses and volumes that likely exceed what is necessary for controlling occult disease. A significant consequence of ENI is its contribution to late radiation sequelae, such as dysphagia and xerostomia, which negatively impact quality of life. Depending on tumor site and T‐classification, the prevalence of occult metastases ranges between 10% and 35%. Therefore, most patients do not benefit from ENI but still endure the burden of radiation-induced sequelae. Unsurprisingly, de-escalation of both RT dose and volume of ENI are important topics in clinical research.

### Imaging of lymphadenopathy in the neck [^111HVVax]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a major role in the assessment of cervical lymphadenopathy. In infectious disease, assessing abscess formation and the relationship of the abscess to surrounding vital structures is crucial for its management. In cases of head and neck malignancies, imaging can be helpful for staging. Imaging of the neck for the assessment of nodal metastases can be used to detect occult metastases or to assess the operability of palpable metastases. The detection of small occult metastases has limitations, as micrometastases cannot be depicted. However, imaging can fulfill a role in diminishing the risk of occult metastases and thus influence management. For this purpose, a very sensitive technique is necessary. The currently used radiological criteria are not sensitive enough to sufficiently reduce the risk of occult metastases. Therefore, more sensitive CT and MRI criteria, and especially ultrasound-guided aspiration, should be employed to assess the clinically negative neck.

### Kybella [^1174M9Kz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage**: Kybella injection is administered into subcutaneous fat tissue in the submental area using an area-adjusted dose of 2 mg/cm². A single treatment consists of up to a maximum of 50 injections, 0.2 mL each (up to a total of 10 mL), spaced 1 cm apart. Up to six single treatments may be administered at intervals of no less than one month apart. See general considerations for administration and injection technique sections below before injection.

- **General considerations for administration**: Kybella should be administered by a healthcare professional. It is important to screen patients for other potential causes of submental convexity/fullness, such as thyromegaly and cervical lymphadenopathy. Careful consideration should be given when using Kybella in patients with excessive skin laxity, prominent platysmal bands, or other conditions where the reduction of submental fat may result in an aesthetically undesirable outcome. Use caution in patients who have had prior surgical or aesthetic treatment of the submental area, as changes in anatomy/landmarks or the presence of scar tissue may impact the ability to safely administer Kybella or achieve the desired aesthetic result.

Kybella is clear, colorless, and free of particulate matter. Visually inspect Kybella vials for particulate matter and/or discoloration, and discard the vial if the solution is discolored or contains particulate matter. After use, discard any remaining solution in the vial.

### Is routine inclusion of level IV necessary in neck dissection for clinically N0 supraglottic carcinoma [^111JBsBd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Elective level II to IV dissection has become a common practice for patients with N0 neck and supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma. Several authors have questioned the necessity of dissecting level IV and the possible risk of associated morbidities, such as chyle leak and phrenic nerve injury.

- **Study design and setting**: We reviewed 58 patients who underwent elective functional and lateral neck dissection for supraglottic carcinoma. Node levels were delineated just after the removal of the specimens. The patients were followed for at least 3 years postoperatively or until the time of death; recurrence rates and levels were evaluated.

- **Results**: Occult lymph node metastases were determined in 14 cases. Level II was the most involved zone (7 patients), while isolated level IV lymph node metastasis was not established.

- **Conclusion**: We think that routine level IV dissection is not necessary in the management of clinically and radiologically N0 necks in patients with supraglottic laryngeal carcinoma.

### Sarcoidosis of the submandibular gland: A systematic review [^1173tG1K]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Submandibular gland sarcoidosis is rare, and little is known about its clinical presentation beyond the usual neck swelling. The aim of the study was to extract clinical knowledge on submandibular sarcoidosis from the literature.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was performed using a search in Medline with the keywords "sarcoidosis", "submandibular", "submaxillary".

- **Results**: Forty-six articles fitting the search criteria were found; however, 31 had to be excluded because they did not report submandibular gland sarcoidosis. Twenty cases of submandibular gland sarcoidosis were considered suitable for analysis. Almost all reported cases concerned female patients. In some instances, submandibular gland swelling is the first and only manifestation of the disease.

- **Conclusion**: Sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all progressive and painless swellings of the submandibular gland, especially in women. Rarely, it may be the first manifestation of the disease.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for evaluating lymphadenopathy in the pediatric emergency department: Case series and review of literature [^114LuJXs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Children present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with enlarged lymph nodes due to a broad spectrum of conditions, ranging from benign causes like reactive lymph nodes to adverse conditions like malignancy. Identifying sonographic features typical of infection, inflammation, and neoplasms will assist clinicians in deciding the disposition of the patients from the ED. Point-of-care ultrasound has become an essential adjunct for diagnostic assessment in pediatric emergency medicine. The wider accessibility of ultrasound, along with greater resolution using high-frequency probes, makes this noninvasive, non-radiation-based bedside examination an ideal tool for the real-time evaluation of lymph nodes in the EDs.

- **Case series**: We present a series of cases in which the point-of-care ultrasound examination proved valuable in the timely diagnosis and expedited care of lymph node pathologies secondary to reactive, infectious, and malignant processes.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Point-of-care ultrasound will facilitate diagnosis in children with lymph node swelling and should be considered in children of all ages. While assessing the lymph node pathology at the bedside, describe the shape, size, internal echotexture, borders, vascularity, and the pattern of the perinodal soft tissue to differentiate between a normal, reactive, infectious, inflammatory, or malignant underlying pathology.

### European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES) consensus statement on advanced thyroid cancer: Definitions and management [^116mGpjQ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Management of regional nodal disease is crucial for preventing recurrent or persistent disease in thyroid cancer, particularly in advanced stages. It has been documented that approximately 60–75% of all neck recurrences occur in cervical lymph nodes. In neck dissections, two principles should guide surgical extent:

- **Lymph node containment**: Cervical lymph nodes are invariably contained within spaces defined by muscular fascias and vascular aponeuroses. In the absence of direct invasion, vital structures such as muscular, vascular, and neural components should be preserved. The fascia covering the fibrofatty tissue and nodes should be removed en bloc.

- **Pattern of dissemination**: It is essential to understand lymphatic disease dissemination patterns and balance disease-free and disease-specific survival based on the dissected compartments. The Surgical Affairs Committee Statement of the ATA recommends selective neck dissection of levels IIa, III, IV, and Vb for lateral neck dissection of macroscopic DTC metastases. This was further confirmed in the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) guidelines in 2020. Extended dissection, including levels IIb, Va, and, on rare occasions, I, should be conducted only if there is evident involvement. For central neck dissection (CND), levels VI and VII are involved. CND is indicated for all patients with clinically involved nodes, either determined before or during surgery, and is encouraged in patients with larger or locally mor.

### Management of salivary gland malignancy: ASCO guideline [^112mk74Y]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, specifically in the management of regional lymph nodes, the ASCO 2021 guidelines recommend considering ipsilateral neck dissection of involved and at-risk levels. This may be extended to adjacent levels up to levels 1–5 in patients with cN1 neck.

### Salivary gland cancer: ESMO-European reference network on rare adult solid cancers (EURACAN) clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^114LK2sn]. ESMO Open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, specifically in the management of regional lymph nodes, ESMO/EURACAN 2022 guidelines recommend offering elective neck irradiation (cN0 at least levels II and III unilaterally; pN+ levels I-V) in patients with parotid gland cancer who have risk factors for cN0 pN+ that are discovered postoperatively.

### The evolving landscape of salivary gland tumors [^111sjZus]. CA (2023). High credibility.

Although neck dissection is recommended when clinically involved nodes are seen on physical examination or imaging, the extent of dissection in this situation is controversial. Most experts have advocated for selective neck dissection, including levels II-IV or I-IV, depending on the primary site. However, others have advocated for a comprehensive neck dissection involving levels I-V.

One study demonstrated that 60% of patients undergoing neck dissection with clinically evident anterolateral neck disease also had occult nodal metastases in level V. However, this was a single-institution, retrospective study, and it is unclear whether these patients could have been adequately treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. Notably, no regional recurrences were seen in patients who did not undergo level V dissection.

### Deletion of the entire interferon-γ receptor 1 gene causing complete deficiency in three related patients [^111QggyV]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Physical examination revealed multiple small cervical lymph nodes and one enlarged left pre-sternocleidomastoid node (4 × 2 cm) without fluctuation or redness of the overlying skin. Laboratory analysis showed leukocytosis with increased granulocyte and lymphocyte numbers without leukemic blasts, mild anemia, and a normal thrombocyte count. A chest X-ray was normal. Serologic tests for Streptococcus, Bartonella sp., toxoplasmosis, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were negative. A bacterial infection was suspected, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was administered.

In light of the progressive enlargement of the cervical lymph node (4 × 6 cm) and appearance of supraclavicular nodes in the following weeks, other diagnoses, such as malignancy and (atypical) mycobacterial infection, were considered. Screening for anti-nuclear antibodies, sarcoidosis, human immunodeficiency virus, germ cell tumor, and neuroblastoma was negative. Ultrasound did not show abscess formation or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy.

Quantitative immunoglobulin levels revealed marginally raised IgM and IgA levels, whereas the IgG level was normal. Peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts were performed, showing increased CD3 and CD4 counts, and an elevated CD4 effector-memory population, while naïve T-cells were mildly decreased. The tuberculin skin test showed an induration of 7.0 mm. The result of the IFN-γ release assay (QuantiFERON®) showed high values for the specific mycobacterial antigens; however, the assay was interpreted as invalid due to very high IFN-γ values obtained for the negative control (64 IU/ml), normal.

### Joint practice guidelines for radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node localization in oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^114FkHag]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

The side, number, and level of each node basin in the neck must be recorded. A diagram provided by the surgical team should be incorporated into the pathology record where possible. The report must include details of the numbers of nodes found in each individual basin and which nodes were hot, blue, both, or unlabelled. The dimensions of each node must be included, and the macroscopic appearance of the gross and cut surfaces should be stated.

- **Macrometastasis**: Note the largest dimension of the metastatic deposit in each node, and whether extracapsular spread is present or not.

- **Micrometastasis**: Should be recorded even in the presence of macrometastasis. The largest dimension should be recorded. Anatomical location within the node: capsular, subcapsule, parenchymal, unifocal, or multifocal. It is often not possible to be confident of the exact numbers. Presence of extracapsular spread is permitted if the deposit is peripherally located and is associated with a reactive stromal response.

- **Isolated tumour cells**: If evident, should be recorded even in the presence of macro or micrometastasis. If cohesive, the size of the largest deposit should be stated. If dispersed, note the anatomical distribution.

Benign inclusions, including naevus cells, salivary inclusions, and false-positive cytokeratin artefacts (e.g. dendritic cells or scattered nonviable anucleate cells), should be recorded. The histopathological features of isolated tumour cells need careful description, as the UICC size cut-off by necessity encompasses small metastases which vary greatly in size and presumably in biological significance.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^116MnaDB]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders, including RA, SLE, and SS. In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases, such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease. These must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions.

In this review, we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Long-term efficacy of ethanol ablation as treatment of metastatic lymph nodes from papillary thyroid carcinoma [^113GnVKk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Treatment of small neck lymph node metastases from papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is challenging. Our institution was among the first worldwide to introduce ultrasound (US)-guided ethanol ablation (EA) as an optional treatment for neck lymph node metastases from PTC in 2004, following promising results published by Lewis et al. in 2002. Our results from treatment with EA over a five-year period (2004–2009) were presented by Heilo et al. in 2011.

Neck lymph node metastases are common, found in 20% to 50% of patients with PTC at diagnosis. With more sensitive diagnostic methods, studies have reported a frequency of micrometastasis (< 2 mm) approaching 90%. The presence of lymph node metastases is considered an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and locoregional recurrence but the effect on survival remains controversial. Surgical extirpation is recommended when lymph node metastases are present before or during primary surgery. The benefits of prophylactic lymph node dissection are still controversial, but it is usually recommended in cases with advanced stage primary tumors (T3–4).

Studies have demonstrated a risk of recurrence in neck lymph nodes ranging from 5% to 21%, with most cases occurring within 10 years after primary treatment. High-resolution US, thorough morphologic evaluation, and sensitive assays for the detection of thyroglobulin (Tg) in fine-needle aspiration biopsy washouts (FNAB-Tg) can detect metastases as small as 2 to 3 mm. The availability of such tools contributes to an increase in the detection of smaller metastatic nodes.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^1169jQAG]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The suprahyoid neck is frequently the site of many common conditions. Although accessible to clinical examination, some components are better evaluated with imaging; lesions occupying the sublingual and submandibular spaces are invisible to the referring clinician. A broad array of pathological processes can occur in these spaces, and pinpointing the origin can narrow the differential and, in certain cases, determine the diagnosis. These lesions can be classified into congenital, infectious/inflammatory, vascular, and neoplastic processes. Typically, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for evaluation, but there may be cases where both are needed in conjunction. This review article discusses the relevant anatomy, clinical highlights, and the characteristic imaging features of the various pathologies that occur within the sublingual and submandibular spaces.

### Clinical practice guideline: Evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114WGu6w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Neck masses are common in adults, but often the underlying etiology is not easily identifiable. While infections cause most of the neck masses in children, most persistent neck masses in adults are neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms far exceed any other etiology of adult neck mass. Importantly, an asymptomatic neck mass may be the initial or only clinically apparent manifestation of head and neck cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland cancer. Evidence suggests that a neck mass in the adult patient should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Timely diagnosis of a neck mass due to metastatic HNSCC is paramount because delayed diagnosis directly affects tumor stage and worsens prognosis. Unfortunately, despite substantial advances in testing modalities over the last few decades, diagnostic delays are common.

Currently, there is only one evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist clinicians in evaluating an adult with a neck mass. Much of the available information is fragmented, disorganized, or focused on specific etiologies. Although there is literature related to the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests, there is little guidance about rational sequencing of tests in the course of clinical care. This guideline strives to bring a coherent, evidence-based, multidisciplinary perspective to the evaluation of the neck mass with the intention to facilitate prompt diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes.

### Joint practice guidelines for radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node localization in oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^1145YGgU]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical indications:

The most important inclusion criterion for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is a clinically negative neck, as defined by physical examination and clinical imaging by CT, contrast-enhanced MRI, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology, or 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET with or without low-dose CT. There remains considerable debate regarding the preferred imaging modality, and at the time of writing, none has the ability to detect small or micrometastatic tumor deposits. However, all techniques improve the sensitivity beyond that of palpation alone and are therefore recommended prior to SNB. Recently, the high specificity of PET has been highlighted as an important means of avoiding unnecessary neck dissections. Gross lymphatic involvement can lead to distortion of the normal architecture, causing aberrant drainage patterns and biopsy of false sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). SNB is therefore contraindicated for staging clinically positive necks.

Following the first report of SNB for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the technique has undergone extensive validation against the gold-standard elective neck dissection (END) for tumors located in the oral cavity and accessible subsites of the oropharynx. It has been demonstrated to be an accurate means of staging the clinically negative neck, and more recently, the potential prognostic value of SNB for these tumor sites has also been highlighted. While SNB has been successfully reported for tumors in other locations, such as the hypopharynx and supraglottic larynx, there remain significant technical barriers, and SNB for these sites should therefore still be considered investigational.

### Prospective study of the pattern of lymphatic metastasis in relation to the submandibular gland in patients with carcinoma of the oral cavity [^114Yi2os]. Head & Neck (2016). Low credibility.

The submandibular gland is responsible for 70% to 90% of unstimulated saliva production. Its excision causes a decrease in basal salivary flow, resulting in increased symptoms of subjective xerostomia and decreased quality of life. In this study, we assessed the pattern of nodal metastasis in relation to the submandibular gland. We aimed to determine whether submandibular gland preservation is a viable option in patients with carcinoma of the oral cavity.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study conducted in a tertiary care cancer center. The fibrofatty tissue surrounding the submandibular gland was divided into six parts based on its location around the submandibular gland. All six parts, along with the submandibular gland, were separately sent for histopathological analysis. The metastasis pattern in the level Ib region was noted.

- **Results**: The study included 137 patients with carcinoma of the oral cavity who underwent neck dissections. Eighty-five patients had a clinic-radiologically N0 neck, while 52 patients had a clinically node-positive (cN+) neck. Level Ib involvement was observed in 8.2% of cases with cN0 necks. In patients with cN+ necks, level Ib metastasis was seen in 40% of cases. Metastasis in N0 necks, in the area deep to the submandibular gland, was seen in only one case (9% of all pathologically node-positive patients) with a cN0 neck. This was the only case in which submandibular gland mobilization would have been required to excise the metastatic node. Even in cases with N+ necks, deep metastasis was seen in four cases.

### Level V lymph node dissection in oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma patients with clinically node-positive neck: Is it absolutely necessary [^116u6jN7]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Postoperative shoulder dysfunction has been significantly associated with any dissection of level V secondary to traction or ischemic injury to the spinal accessory nerve. The aim of this study was to determine whether the dissection of level V lymph node pads is absolutely necessary in therapeutic neck dissection as a treatment for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OOSCC) patients with a clinically N+ neck.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of 93 OOSCC patients who underwent surgical treatment of the primary lesion along with a simultaneous comprehensive neck dissection from January 1992 to December 2003. Of these, only one patient had a clinically positive neck node at level V. During the neck dissection, the contents of the level V lymph nodes were dissected, labeled, and processed separately from the remainder of the major neck dissection specimen. We studied the incidence of pathologic metastasis to level V lymph nodes. In addition, we evaluated several potential risk factors for metastatic disease in the level V lymph nodes such as sex, age, T stage, N stage, histologic grade, and presence of other positive lymph nodes.

- **Results**: A total of 96 comprehensive neck dissections were performed in this series. The prevalence of metastases in the level V lymph nodes was 5% (5 of 93) in ipsilateral and 0% (0 of 3) in contralateral necks. One case with a clinically positive node at level V had a pathologic positive node in levels II, III, IV, and V. The occult metastasis rate of ipsilateral level V was significant.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, more specifically with respect to the management of regional lymph nodes, the ESMO/EURACAN 2022 guidelines recommend including the gland in a selective neck dissection involving levels I-III in patients with submandibular gland cancer, unless the tumor is intraglandular and a low-grade histology is proven. In such cases, only resection of the gland and level Ib lymph nodes is required.

### Salivary gland cancer: ESMO-European Reference Network on Rare Adult Solid Cancers (EURACAN) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diagnosis, Treatment and Follow-up [^114LG2z1]. ESMO Open (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for salivary gland cancer, specifically in the management of regional lymph nodes, the ESMO/EURACAN 2022 guidelines recommend performing elective neck dissection when the neck is entered as an approach to the primary site or for reconstruction in patients with minor salivary gland cancer (SGC). It is advised to avoid performing elective neck dissection in patients with tumors originating from the laryngeal, sinonasal, external acoustic meatus, and lacrimal glands.

- **Neck dissection recommendation**: Elective neck dissection or elective neck irradiation should be offered to patients with oral cavity/oropharynx, T3-T4, and high-grade tumors. The decision on the levels of dissection should depend on the tumor location and be comparable with the treatment for clinically node-negative (cN0) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

### Management of clinically node-negative salivary gland cancer: Observation, neck dissection, or neck irradiation [^114LoTYJ]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Nodal status is a well-known prognostic factor for salivary gland cancer. Prognostic factors for the risk of occult nodal disease are tumor grade, histology, and location of the tumor. In one series of 22,653 patients, salivary ductal carcinoma had a 23.6% incidence of occult lymph node metastasis compared with 4.4% in acinar cell carcinoma. Two indices have been developed to aid in determining the risk of lymph node metastases. The prognostic index by Tergaard et al. is based on histology and primary tumor location, whereas the index by Wang et al. includes PNI, histology, LVSI, and ENE. All variables included in these indices were significant in univariate analysis in our study.

Tergaard et al. assessed the outcomes of 565 patients and found that nodal status impacted regional failure and overall survival. Similarly, our study showed a significantly higher risk of local and regional failure with borderline clinical nodal status and pathologically positive lymph nodes. Although Tergaard et al. reported that ENE did not impact regional control, our data shows a significant effect of ENE and margin status on regional recurrence; with additional studies supporting either. In addition, we found tumor grade, positive margin, PNI, and LVSI also impacted regional recurrence. A number of studies have attributed a specific neck treatment modality to improved outcomes; however, most have only compared a single modality of neck management against observation. Others that have compared NI and ND versus observation are very few, and reported outcomes may be skewed by lack of randomiz.

### The EANM practical guidelines for sentinel lymph node localisation in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [^116dh8z2]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Diseases or previous treatments that affect lymphatic drainage can complicate sentinel lymph node identification. Tuberculosis, lymphoma, or previous interventions, such as radiotherapy and/or surgery within the neck, can distort the normal lymphatic pathways, leading to unexpected lymph node uptakes. Lymphoscintigraphy is suggested to be useful in mapping aberrant drainage, particularly in cases where disrupted lymphatic pathways may result in metastasis occurring in unexpected locations.

- **FDG PET/CT**: Due to its insufficient negative predictive value, FDG PET/CT does not replace sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in oral cancer. Moreover, its lack of specificity makes it unable to differentiate malignant from inflammatory lymph nodes, the latter being highly prevalent in the head and neck area.

- **Number of injections**: The optimal number of injections is four. However, depending on the individual case, this number can be adjusted.

- **Non-migration or non-visualisation of the lymph nodes**: This is a rare occurrence. If SPECT/CT is negative, reinjection might be considered.

- **Depth of invasion**: The risk of metastasis increases with tumour depth, though there is no definitive upper or lower limit to accurately predict a patient's nodal status. Currently, there are no recommendations for neck management based solely on depth, but this may change with further data.

Patients with widespread field change present additional challenges. Occasionally, large areas of the oral cavity may contain unstable epithelium. These patients are not good candidates for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB), as the periphery of unstable mucosa is indistinct, complicating the assessment process.

### Non-sebaceous lymphadenoma of the submandibular gland: Diagnostic challenges in the head and neck cancer pathway [^1112xnDE]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Non-sebaceous lymphadenoma (NSLA) is a rare benign salivary gland tumor with lymphoid and epithelial components and without sebaceous differentiation. The large majority of reported cases arise within the parotid gland. We present an NSLA arising from the submandibular gland. The tumor presented as a painless, longstanding neck lump. Ultrasound, fine needle aspiration, MRI, and positron emission tomography found features supportive of squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was treated with surgery for oropharyngeal carcinoma of unknown origin, in accordance with local and national guidelines. The final histological assessment revealed the level Ib neck lesion to be NSLA. Although a rare occurrence, these lesions may pose a diagnostic challenge in the head and neck cancer pathway.

Orolabial herpes can be associated with a variety of symptoms, including crusts around the lips, cervical lymphadenopathy, and tingling around the lips. Patients may experience painful lesions around the lips, swollen gums, headaches, and mouth sores. Other symptoms include oral mucosal erythema, oral vesicles, and herpetic whitlow. Submandibular lymphadenopathy, malaise, and herpetic keratitis may also occur. Additional manifestations include blisters around the lips, papulovesicular rashes, and painful oral lesions. Swelling and erythema of the lips, fever, erythema multiforme, facial nerve palsy, lip sores, and a burning sensation around the lips are also common.

### Prevalence and distribution of cervical lymph node metastases in HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^111Qrk3d]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

In oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OP-SCC), the prevalence and distribution of clinical and pathological lymph node metastasis in the neck have been extensively reported, serving as the basis for consensus recommendations on the selection of lymph node levels in the neck requiring treatment. The objective of this study is to compare the prevalence and distribution of neck node metastases in HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV-) OP-SCC from a large series of patients who underwent a cervical lymph-node dissection (LND) as part of their treatment.

- **Methods**: The study focused on OP-SCC patients treated by various neck node dissection (LND) procedures from January 2014 to December 2018 in three French institutions. Patients with prior head and neck cancer, prior neck surgery, the use of induction chemotherapy, or those with carcinoma of unknown primary were excluded. HPV status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry. For each patient, the clinical and pathological nodal status, as well as the distribution of the positive nodes in each neck level (from Ia to V), were reported.

- **Results**: A total of 263 patients were included, comprising 126 p16-negative (p16-) and 137 p16-positive (p16+) individuals. The rate of clinical positive nodes (cN+) reached 54% in the p16- group and 88.3% in the p16+ group (p < 0.001); the corresponding rate of pathological positive nodes (pN+) reached 61.9% and 91.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). Regarding the clinical lymph node distribution in p16+ patients, more positive nodes were observed in the ipsilateral level IV (p = 0.003).

### Bony cystic lesion with associated submandibular lymphadenopathy on a background of breast carcinoma: an unexpected case of cervicofacial actinomycosis [^1115JtCe]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Actinomycosis is an uncommon, chronic suppurative granulomatous infection and needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis. A 56-year-old woman with a background of type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast carcinoma was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery 2-week wait clinic regarding a tender sublingual mass and firm erythematous swelling in the right submandibular and submental region. This was slowly progressive and had not responded to oral co-amoxiclav.

An orthopantomogram showed a well-defined radiolucency and smaller radiolucent lesions throughout the edentulous right body of the mandible. A contrast-enhanced CT confirmed a right submandibular abscess communicating with cavitating lesions. The differentials included osteomyelitis, bony metastases, multiple myeloma, or other cystic lesions. The patient underwent incision and drainage of the abscess, alongside biopsies, and intravenous co-amoxiclav was given. Microbiology cultures confirmed the presence of Actinomyces israelii and a diagnosis of cervicofacial actinomycosis with mandibular osteomyelitis. The patient was successfully treated with prolonged antibiotics.

### The "small, dark tonsil" in patients presenting with metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy from an unknown primary [^113jRZ1q]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

When squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) involves the palatine tonsils, they are generally enlarged and demonstrate intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images; they also enhance after gadolinium administration. We have identified two patients with SCC of the tonsil where the affected tonsil has low signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images and is smaller than the contralateral normal tonsil. We present the "small, dark tonsil" as an alternative imaging presentation of SCC and a new sign to look for when evaluating the patient with metastatic lymphadenopathy from an unknown primary tumor.

### Anatomic variability of the accessory nerve: Implications for dissection of level IIB [^1174icD9]. The Laryngoscope (2024). High credibility.

For over a century, the surgical management of cervical lymph nodes has been an integral part of treating patients with head and neck cancer. The nodes in the upper neck are among the most likely to be involved in metastasis in many head and neck cancers. The Rouvière classification, based on the study of lymphatic flow, describes two chains of lymph nodes in the upper neck that drain the head and neck: the jugular chain, which follows the internal jugular vein, and the spinal accessory chain, which takes an oblique course. The two chains overlap near the jugular foramen.

More recent terminology defines six nodal levels on each side of the neck. Level II comprises the lymph nodes deep to the sternocleidomastoid, extending from the skull base to the level of the hyoid. The spinal accessory nerve (SAN) crosses level II and divides it into level IIA inferomedially and level IIB superolaterally. Level II contains the overlapping pathways of both the jugular and the spinal accessory chains.

The morbidity of neck dissection derives, in a meaningful part, from the position of the SAN within level II. Early descriptions of the procedure involved the removal of the spinal accessory nerve in the upper neck to achieve rapid lymphadenectomy while avoiding the dissemination of cancer through transgression of lymphatic channels. The nerve supplies the trapezius muscle, including the superior portion, which elevates and controls the scapula. After a radical neck dissection, patients often experience long-term disability related to the shoulder and neck. The SAN must be exposed and dissected when it is preserved.

### Radiolucent lesions of the mandible: A pattern-based approach to diagnosis [^114HNf1F]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Mandibular lymphoma involves malignant tumors that develop from cells of the lymphatic system and can affect any organ containing lymphoid tissue. While Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) most often involve lymph nodes in the head and neck, non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) can equally affect extra-nodal sites such as the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, muscles and soft tissues of the orbit, thyroid gland, maxilla, and mandible. Mandibular NHL is very rare; it is frequently mistaken for dental infection, leading to a prolonged delay in diagnosis.

All age groups can be affected, although adults are more commonly affected than children, and there is no gender predilection. The clinical features of mandibular NHL are not specific and include pain, jaw swelling, ulceration, tooth mobility, and cervical lymphadenopathy. On panoramic views, mandibular NHLs appear as ill-defined radiolucent lesions. Despite their large size, the tumors can be easily missed on conventional X-rays.

Radiological findings can be quite subtle, such as teeth displacement in the occlusal direction and loss of the lamina dura with widening of the periodontal ligament space. Rarely, mandibular NHL can present with minor osteolysis or with unilateral enlargement of the mandibular canal and mental foramen. Enlargement of the mandibular canal and mental foramen are rare and have been reported in neurogenic tumors affecting the inferior alveolar nerve (such as schwannoma and neurofibroma), in perineural spread of diseases (mainly from SCC, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and lymphoma), and as an anatomic variant.

### Ancient schwannoma of the submandibular gland [^112YtAYr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and computed tomography (CT) of the neck to evaluate the characteristics, size, and position of the tumor for surgical assessment. The FNA results of the submandibular mass indicated granulomatous sialadenitis, and the official CT scan report described a well-circumscribed, multiloculated cystic mass with an enhancing mural solid component and several enhancing septa arising from the superolateral part of the right submandibular gland. The mass measured 3.4×3.4×4.4 cm, with multiple subcentimeter bilateral cervical lymph nodes present.

Isolated submandibular swellings pose a diagnostic challenge to the practicing otolaryngologist. We report an unusual case of mumps isolated to bilateral submandibular glands. We discuss the case and the literature surrounding this condition, reminding clinicians that mumps should be considered as a diagnosis in the presence of submandibular gland swelling, even in the absence of typical parotid swelling associated with mumps. Early consideration of this differential diagnosis, alongside serological testing and a multidisciplinary approach, may aid in earlier diagnosis and prevent the spread of the virus.

### Ectopic submandibular thyroid tissue with a coexisting normally located multinodular goitre: Case report and review of the literature [^111NmK1A]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

The simultaneous finding of submandibular ectopic thyroid tissue and a functional orthotopic thyroid gland is an extremely rare event. The present report describes the case of a woman presenting with a left submandibular mass, distant from a palpable multinodular goitre. Ultrasonography showed an ovoidal solid mass adjacent to the lower margin of the left submandibular gland. Cytological specimens revealed colloid material and thyroid follicular cells with no malignant features. A preoperative CT scan demonstrated a very thin connection between the thyroid and the submandibular mass. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and excision of the submandibular mass. Histopathological diagnosis confirmed the thyroid tissue as multinodular goitre, and the submandibular mass as ectopic thyroid tissue showing a hyperplastic pattern. The primary differential diagnosis for the submandibular mass was a metastasis from well-differentiated cancer. This case illustrates that an ectopic thyroid off the midline may not necessarily be a metastasis from thyroid cancer.

### Oropharyngeal lesions and cervical lymphadenopathy: Syphilis is a differential diagnosis that is still relevant [^115egfnx]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Syphilis (lues), a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum, has been increasing in incidence during the last few years. Therefore, while it is often not clinically suspected, syphilis is increasingly becoming a differential diagnosis in routine pathology.

- **Aim**: To report our experience with five cases of cervical lymphadenopathy and/or oropharyngeal lesions, initially thought to be lymphomas, lymph node metastases, or carcinoma, in which we made the mostly clinically unsuspected diagnosis of syphilis.

- **Methods**: Fine needle aspiration of enlarged cervical lymph nodes was evaluated by cytology and flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis), and biopsies were examined using histology. In addition, all materials were subjected to immunostaining, silver staining, and molecular (PCR) testing.

- **Results**: Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed follicular hyperplasia in two cases and granulomatous lymphadenitis in one case. In three patients, concomitant biopsy of co-existing oropharyngeal lesions revealed histological findings compatible with syphilis. T. pallidum was detected in all cytological and histological samples by immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry and PCR. Subsequently, a diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed clinically and by serology.

- **Conclusions**: Syphilitic lymphadenitis is still a relevant differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy, and it is clinically often not suspected. Co-existing oropharyngeal lesions should alert the physician to this differential diagnosis, and lesions with compatible morphology should be further investigated.

### Afferent and efferent lymph-collecting vessels of the submandibular nodes with special reference to the lymphatic route passing through the mylohyoid muscle [^111Ynbvr]. Head & Neck (2003). Low credibility.

Although metastasis of cancer in the oral region to the submandibular node is well described, there has been no anatomic representation of lymph vessels penetrating the oral floor and draining into the node.

- **Materials and methods**: Ninety specimens were obtained from formalin-fixed, donated cadavers. Histologic observations using serial sections followed the macroscopic observations.

- **Results**: In 19 of 90 specimens, we found afferent collecting lymph vessels exiting from the mylohyoid surface and draining into the preglandular submandibular node. In 3 of the 19 specimens, collecting vessels passing through the narrow muscle gap with or without arteries, veins, and nerves were identified histologically. The postglandular submandibular node was not evident in the drainage route.

- **Conclusions**: Although it carries a low incidence, because of the direct lymphatic route or pathway between the oral region and preglandular submandibular node, the pathologically positive supraomohyoid node sometimes seems to be found even in elective neck dissection. However, we speculate that sentinel node investigation would reveal the much more critical role of the jugulodigastric node not only as the actual sentinel node but also as the common terminal node along the various drainage routes from the oral region.

### Defining the risk of involvement for each neck nodal level in patients with early T-stage node-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma [^1117s8G4]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of ipsilateral subclinical neck nodal involvement in early T-stage/node-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Methods and materials**: Patients undergoing multilevel upfront neck dissection (ND) at Johns Hopkins Hospital within the last 10 years for early clinical T-stage (cT1–2) node-positive (cN+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were identified. Pathologic involvement of Levels IB-V was determined. For each nodal level, the negative predictive value of imaging results was computed using sensitivity/specificity data for computed tomography (CT). This was used to calculate the risk that a negative level on CT harbors subclinical disease.

- **Results**: One hundred three patients met the criteria. Radical ND was performed in 14.6%, modified radical ND in 70.9%, and selective ND in 14.6%. Pathologic positivity rates were 9.5%, 91.3%, 40.8%, 18.0%, and 3.3% for Levels IB-V, respectively. Risks of subclinical disease despite negative CT imaging results were calculated as 3.1%, 76.3%, 17.5%, 6.3%, and 1.0% for Levels IB-V, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Levels IB and V are at very low (< 5%) risk of involvement, even with ipsilateral pathologically proven neck disease; this can guide radiation planning. Levels II and III should be included in high-risk volumes regardless of imaging results, and Level IV should be included within the lowest risk volume.

### Novel diagnostic modalities for assessment of the clinically node-negative neck in oral squamous-cell carcinoma [^117KTYSh]. The Lancet Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Oral squamous-cell carcinomas arise in the mucosal linings of the oral cavity and frequently metastasize to regional lymph nodes in the neck. The presence of nodal metastases is a determinant of prognosis and clinical management. The neck is staged by palpation and imaging, but the accuracy of these techniques to detect small metastases is low. In general, 30–40% of patients will have occult nodal disease and will develop clinically detectable lymph-node metastases when the neck is left untreated. The choice at present is either elective treatment or careful observation followed by treatment of the neck in patients who develop manifest metastases. These unsatisfying therapeutic options have been the subject of debate for decades. Recent developments in neck staging, including expression profiling and sentinel lymph-node biopsy, will allow more personalized management of the neck.

### Management of the neck in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^112ouHty]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for oropharyngeal cancer, particularly in relation to indications for neck dissection and post-treatment surgery, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend not performing neck dissection in patients whose anatomic cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) at ≥ 12 weeks after radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy shows resolution of previously abnormal lymph nodes.

### Assessment of second tier lymph nodes in melanoma and implications for extent of elective neck dissection in metastatic cutaneous malignancy of the parotid [^11514hyY]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

The parotid is the most common site of cutaneous metastases in the head and neck. The role and extent of neck dissection in patients with parotid metastatic cutaneous malignancy remains controversial.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission CT (SPECT) of patients with melanoma who had a sentinel node in the parotid to determine the second tier cervical lymph nodes.

- **Results**: Levels II and III cervical nodes make up 82% of second tier lymph nodes for the parotid, and levels IV and V, 12% and 4%, respectively. Second tier lymph nodes isolated to levels I, IV, or V, bypassing levels II and III, occurred in only 2% of cases.

- **Conclusion**: The risk of harboring occult metastasis in levels I, IV, and V when levels II and III are negative is low. Levels II and III neck dissection is likely to be an effective staging procedure in patients with isolated parotid metastases.

### The EANM practical guidelines for sentinel lymph node localisation in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [^114kF1MW]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Preoperative imaging**: The acquisition protocol should include the following:

- **Positioning**: Adequate anterior hyper-extension of the neck is required, as long as tolerated by the patient, to accurately evaluate the neck levels, especially level I.

- **Dynamic acquisition**: Acquire immediate dynamic images of the neck in the anterior view (within 5 minutes post-injection). The dynamic study should encompass at least the first 10–15 minutes. This part of the imaging process is used to identify lymphatic vessels that drain the tumour.

- **Early static images**: Anterior and lateral views should be acquired shortly after dynamic acquisition. Both steps are particularly important to visualize the lymphatic pathways, which allows the distinction between sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and second-tier lymph nodes. To improve the quality of imaging, the distance between the collimator and the neck should be minimal, and an adequate zoom factor (×1.5) should be used. This part of the imaging process is used to identify the lymph nodes (LNs) that receive direct drainage from the tumour.

- **Late images**: A late static image at 60–120 minutes post-injection using the same views as in the early static images should be acquired, at least anterior views if SPECT/CT is also performed. This part of the imaging process is used to identify additional LNs that receive slower direct drainage from the tumour. Importantly, comparing early and late images provides a crucial tool needed to distinguish between surgically relevant SLNs and irrelevant higher echelon nodes.

### Intermediate grade salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma: Is neck dissection indicated [^1179qea5]? Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

- **Abstract**: The NCCN guidelines recommend a neck dissection addressing at least levels II‐IV for high‐grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and close observation of the lymphatic basins for low‐grade MEC. However, no guidelines exist for intermediate‐grade MEC with clinically and radiologically uninvolved cervical lymph nodes.

- **Study design**: Retrospective analysis.

- **Setting**: Patients with intermediate‐grade MEC with a clinically N0 neck from our tertiary academic institution from 2015 to 2023.

- **Methods**: Evaluation for histologic lymphatic metastases was performed when surgeons elected to perform neck dissection. For patients who did not receive a neck dissection, a review of medical records was conducted to document the results of clinical observation and specifically regional lymphatic recurrence on long‐term follow‐up.

- **Results**: Thirty‐five patients with N0 intermediate grade MEC were included, composed of 26 patients who underwent primary tumor resection and neck dissection and 9 patients who received resection of the primary tumor without neck dissection. One out of 26 patients undergoing neck dissection was found to have lymphatic metastasis. Watchful waiting of 9 patients demonstrated no recurrence at a mean follow-up of 40 months. Thus, 1 out of 35 patients (2.9% [95% confidence interval: 2.7%‐3.1%]) had documented metastatic disease in the lymphatics.

- **Conclusions**: For patients presenting with intermediate‐grade MEC, there was a low chance (2.9%) of positive histologic or clinical lymphatic metastases in the neck. Given this low risk, we believe the potential benefit of neck dissection is minimal.

### Relevance of intraparotid metastases in head and neck skin squamous cell carcinoma [^112DPqmM]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Parotid lymph node metastases are common in head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCCHN). This study evaluates the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications of intraglandular lymph node (IGLN) metastases in cSCCHN.

This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary referral university cancer institute. Patients with cSCCHN who underwent parotidectomy and neck dissection (ND), with or without synchronous resection of the skin primary, between January 1999 and January 2018, were included. The characteristics of cSCCHN with or without IGLN involvement were compared.

A total of 68 patients were included. Of the 29 (42.6%) patients classified as cN0, eight were upstaged to pN+ and had concomitant IGLN involvement. IGLN metastases were absent in only three of the 21 patients with pN0 disease, resulting in a specificity and sensitivity of parotid metastases to diagnose occult nodal neck metastases of 14.29% and 100%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 14.29% and 100%, respectively. Univariate analyses displayed a significantly higher rate of moderately and poorly differentiated primaries in patients with IGLN metastases (P = 0.015). Additionally, only advanced T-stages were significantly associated with neck recurrences.

IGLN status in advanced cSCCHN is potentially predictive for occult nodal neck metastases. The results suggest that ND in patients with histopathologically negative IGLNs and clinically negative neck lymph nodes may not be necessary, given the high negative predictive value of IGLN status.

### Optical molecular imaging can differentiate metastatic from benign lymph nodes in head and neck cancer [^113V4Kor]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Although a combination of direct visualization and palpation is considered the gold standard by pathologists for detecting and harvesting lymph nodes (LNs) from neck dissection specimens, this technique is time-consuming, can miss smaller LNs, and is subject to high interobserver variability, limiting standardization within institutions and across medical centers. To improve nodal yield and increase the detection of small LNs, fat clearance can be performed. However, this technique requires a chemical agent to dissolve the fat tissue around the LNs, making it time-consuming, expensive, and potentially hazardous.

Local or intravenous/intra-arterial injections of methylene blue and indocyanine green have been used to improve LN identification at pathology. However, due to poor tumor specificity, this approach has never been routinely implemented; sensitivities and specificities achieved with this approach vary between 52–94% and 76–78%, respectively. Most importantly, none of these techniques discriminates between metastatic LNs and benign LNs.

Our proposed method, using anti-EGFR-based fluorescence molecular imaging, allows for the localization and segregation of LNs at the highest risk of harboring metastasis. This method provides an opportunity to ease the process of LN assessment at pathology. In the same way that sentinel LN mapping selects LNs most likely to harbor metastatic disease, pathological molecular imaging selects high-risk LNs rather than requiring complete processing of all the LNs. However, in contrast to sentinel LN mapping — which requires a re-operation when metastatic LNs are found — molecular imaging does not necessitate re-operation.

### Malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva metastasizing to the submandibular gland: A case report and review of the literature [^116jLfLw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Conjunctival malignant melanoma is an aggressive tumor with the potential for metastasis and death. It is rare in the Black population because of the protective effect of melanin. Metastases usually occur in regional lymph nodes, most commonly the preauricular nodes, deep cervical lymph nodes, and the salivary gland.

- **Case presentation**: We described the case of a 41-year-old Black African woman who presented to our ophthalmology clinic with a painless, right medial pigmented bulbar conjunctival swelling and right preauricular and submandibular swelling. Two years ago, she had a similar swelling at the same location in the right eye. She subsequently underwent surgical excision under general anesthesia. Histology of both tissues showed proliferating malignant melanocytes with heavy pigmentation, disposed in solid nests, tongues, and sheets, obscuring cellular details in these areas. Immunohistochemistry showed tumor cells that stained for HMB45 and Melan A. This led us to conclude that the tumor was a malignant melanoma. The patient died a year after the diagnosis was made.

- **Conclusion**: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare ocular malignancy that should be considered in cases of pigmented lesions of the eye, especially in people with dark pigmentation. Primary acquired melanosis with atypia or a nevus are known preexisting melanocytic lesions from which conjunctival melanomas might develop. Metastases are often to preauricular and cervical lymph nodes as well as to the salivary gland. This demonstrates the significance of early presentation and thorough history taking.

### Management of clinically node-negative salivary gland cancer: Observation, neck dissection, or neck irradiation [^113yxxKL]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 445 patients met the eligibility criteria and were included in this analysis. The median follow-up was 60.8 months (range 0.4–258.3). Patient and disease characteristics are summarized in the analysis. The major salivary gland was the most common site in 73.7% of patients (N = 328). This included the parotid gland (6.1%, N = 270), submandibular gland (11.9%, N = 53), and sublingual gland (1.1%, N = 5).

The minor salivary gland was the primary tumor site in 26.3% (N = 117), including the oral cavity (19.3%, N = 86), nasal cavity (3.1%, N = 14), paranasal sinus (2.2%, N = 10), oropharynx (0.9%, N = 4), and larynx (0.7%, N = 3). The median age of the entire cohort was 59 years old (range 13–93).

Preoperative radiographic imaging was completed in 87% of patients, with a total of 349 CT scans, 115 MRIs, and 96 PET scans completed preoperatively among all patients.

### Management of clinically node-negative salivary gland cancer: Observation, neck dissection, or neck irradiation [^114rhpf9]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Patients were categorized based on ipsilateral neck management: observation, neck dissection (ND), neck irradiation (NI), or a combination of ND and NI. Patient demographics, disease and treatment details, and outcomes were recorded. A head and neck pathologist reevaluated any tumors with ambiguous staging or grade. Tumor margins were considered close if they were ≤ 5 mm from the specimen edge.

Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is delivered when intermediate or high pathologic risk factors are present. These commonly include pT3‐4, perineural invasion (PNI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive lymph nodes (LN), and close margins. If patients met the criteria for neck management, had indications for adjuvant RT, and had not undergone ND due to indeterminate preoperative pathology, a second operation for ND was not recommended, and NI was completed.

Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were compared among treatment groups using the Chi‐square test for categorical variables and the Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables. Local, regional, and distant recurrence rates were estimated using cumulative incidence and compared among treatment groups using Gray's test. Overall survival (OS) was estimated with Kaplan–Meier methods and compared using a log‐rank test. All outcomes were assessed from the date of surgery. Risk factors for local and regional recurrences were assessed with Fine and Gray regression. Multivariable analysis was not conducted due to a small number of events. Data were analyzed with SAS software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were two‐sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Intermediate grade salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma: Is neck dissection indicated [^112uUDrq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

If we look at what has happened with the management of the cervical lymphatics in a different tumor type, for comparison, there have been significant efforts in oral cavity cancer to reduce morbidity and still stage the lymphatics through the use of sentinel node biopsy, a procedure involving perilesional injection of a radiotracer, and more selective lymph node sampling based on gamma radioactivity. The sentinel node technology has not been developed for salivary gland tumors, where perilesional injection is generally more difficult. Nonetheless, the existence of this literature for oral cavity cancer points to the importance of reducing neck morbidity by selecting patients who are unlikely to harbor lymphatic metastases. Generally, in oral cavity cancer, and other tumor types, a metastatic rate of less than 10% was considered low enough to justify surveillance instead of formal lymphadenectomy. For our patients with intermediate grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, the metastatic rate is below this cutoff. Other studies have recently evaluated the need for elective neck dissection for selected patients with low T stage oral cavity cancers, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating the pathological characteristics and depth of invasion of tumors. Extrapolating from these efforts in oral cavity cancer, a more common disease, it is important to revisit our approach to the cervical lymphatics for intermediate grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma and consider the benefit of "watchful waiting" in selected patients.
