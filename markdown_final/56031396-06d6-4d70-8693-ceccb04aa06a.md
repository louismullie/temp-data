## Question

a1c 8.4 treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage an HbA1c of 8.4% in type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret an A1c of 8.4% and what it implies for risk and urgency. Then, I should verify the appropriate individualized A1c target based on patient characteristics. Next, I will review first-line and escalation pharmacotherapy, including when to add insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonists. After that, I need to check dosing and titration specifics for insulin and fixed-ratio combinations. I will then consider non-glycemic risk reduction, monitoring cadence, and adherence barriers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-bound plan and double-check that it aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of HbA1c 8.4% and the urgency it warrants. An A1c of 8.4% corresponds to an average glucose around 194 mg/dL and exceeds the ADA's general target of less than 7%, indicating suboptimal control and increased risk for microvascular complications. It also sits at the threshold where many guidelines recommend treatment intensification, particularly if it is more than 1.5% above the individualized goal, which it often is for typical targets of 7–8% [^112z9Yaz] [^111o3WxT] [^112JDMsi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single target for everyone. I need to individualize the A1c goal based on age, comorbidities, life expectancy, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences. For most adults, a reasonable range is 7.0–8.5%, with tighter goals (6.0–7.0%) considered for younger patients with long life expectancy, no significant cardiovascular disease, and low hypoglycemia risk, and more lenient goals (7.5–8.5% or higher) for older adults, those with limited life expectancy, multiple comorbidities, or high hypoglycemia risk. I should confirm that this aligns with VA/DoD, ACP, and ADA/EASD positions, which emphasize individualized ranges and shared decision-making [^114PdFx9] [^114M26zM] [^112z9Yaz] [^113QouE3].

> Next, I should review foundational therapy and ensure metformin is in place if tolerated. Metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated, and I need to check for eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or significant GI intolerance; if present, I should consider alternatives or dose adjustments, but otherwise I will titrate metformin to a maximally effective dose while reinforcing lifestyle measures, which can lower A1c by roughly 0.5–1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors [^1158avd1] [^117H4U9h] [^111mHWBv].

> I will now examine when to escalate beyond metformin. Given an A1c of 8.4%, which is typically at least 1.5% above individualized targets, dual therapy is appropriate; I should confirm that ADA/EASD and AACE endorse early combination when A1c is ≥ 1.5% above goal or ≥ 7.5–8.0%, and that the choice of second agent should be tailored to comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, and cost [^111o3WxT] [^116YSn1B] [^112dHfyA].

> Let me consider second-line options carefully. If the patient has established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, I should prioritize an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardio-renal benefit. If weight loss is a priority, a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA is attractive. If hypoglycemia risk must be minimized, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, or GLP-1 RAs are preferred over sulfonylureas. I should double-check that these align with ADA/EASD and AACE recommendations and the 2024 ACP guidance on newer agents [^1158avd1] [^111mHWBv] [^112cY7d4].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on two agents and still at 8.4%? I need to check for therapeutic inertia and promptly add a third agent or transition to insulin. Triple therapy or insulin initiation is reasonable when dual therapy fails to reach target, and I should confirm that guidelines support timely intensification rather than prolonged suboptimal control, which is associated with worse outcomes [^111o3WxT] [^112JDMsi] [^115mzgHx].

> Now, I should review insulin initiation thresholds and dosing. If A1c is ≥ 10% or glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL, or if there are catabolic symptoms, insulin should be initiated. For A1c 8.4%, basal insulin is a reasonable next step if dual or triple oral/injectable therapy fails or is not tolerated, with typical starting doses of 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day when A1c is below 8% and 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day when A1c is 8% or higher. I should titrate by about 2 units every 2–3 days based on fasting glucose until at goal, and consider fixed-ratio basal insulin/GLP-1 RA combinations to mitigate weight gain and hypoglycemia [^115C63cJ] [^114xaJbn] [^117GAR1j].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of fixed-ratio combinations and how to start them. Fixed-ratio basal insulin plus GLP-1 RA (iGlarLixi or iDegLira) can simplify regimens and improve A1c by about 1% while limiting weight gain and hypoglycemia; when converting from basal insulin, I should start iGlarLixi at 30 units if on ≥ 30 units basal or 15 units if on < 30 units, and iDegLira at 16 units, then titrate to fasting glucose targets and consider discontinuing short-acting insulin unless prandial coverage is still needed [^117GAR1j] [^112XFKci].

> I need to ensure non-glycemic risk reduction is addressed in parallel. High-intensity statin for ASCVD risk, blood pressure control to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, antiplatelet therapy when indicated, smoking cessation, and comprehensive diabetes self-management education are essential and often yield greater absolute risk reduction than pushing A1c alone, so I should confirm these are optimized alongside glycemic therapy [^1158avd1] [^111mHWBv].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up cadence. A1c should be checked at least every 6 months if stable and more frequently, about every 3 months, when therapy changes or targets are not met. I should also consider structured home glucose monitoring or CGM when hypoglycemia risk is present or insulin is used, and I must screen for and address barriers such as adherence, cost, and health literacy to avoid clinical inertia [^11627gHn] [^111t2kVN] [^113ezgkF].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan for a typical patient with A1c 8.4% and no contraindications. I would confirm metformin at a therapeutic dose, add a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor based on comorbidities and patient goals, reassess A1c in about 3 months, and if still above goal, either add the other class or initiate basal insulin at 0.2 units/kg/day with structured titration. If weight loss is prioritized and access permits, a dual GIP/GLP-1 RA could be considered, and if multiple daily injections are undesirable, a fixed-ratio basal/GLP-1 combination can be used after basal insulin failure or as a next step in selected patients [^1158avd1] [^111o3WxT] [^117GAR1j].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought an A1c of 8.4% mandates insulin right away, but I should correct that. Insulin is indicated for severe hyperglycemia (A1c ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL) or catabolic symptoms, whereas at 8.4% the standard approach is to optimize or add noninsulin agents first unless there is symptomatic hyperglycemia or intolerance to noninsulin therapy; I need to ensure I individualize this decision and avoid overtreatment where risks outweigh benefits [^115C63cJ] [^111o3WxT] [^114PdFx9].

> Finally, I should double-check that the plan addresses key evidence gaps and patient-specific factors. The balance of benefits and harms from intensive glycemic control varies by age, comorbidity, and treatment burden, so shared decision-making is critical. I should document the individualized target, the rationale for agent selection, and a concrete follow-up schedule, and I will remain vigilant for hypoglycemia, weight changes, and access issues that could derail adherence and outcomes [^111mHWBv] [^112z9Yaz] [^111t2kVN].

For an A1c of 8.4%, **initiate metformin** unless contraindicated, and **add a second agent** (GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor) if the A1c remains ≥ 7.5% after 3 months [^112JDMsi] [^112dHfyA]. Use **combination therapy** if the A1c is ≥ 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, and consider basal insulin if the A1c remains ≥ 10% or glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL [^111o3WxT] [^115C63cJ]. Individualize A1c targets to 7–8% for most, 7–7.5% for younger/healthier patients, and 8–8.5% for older/complex patients [^114PdFx9] [^114M26zM]. Reassess every 3 months and address adherence, lifestyle, and comorbidities to reduce complications [^11627gHn] [^1158avd1].

---

## Initial pharmacologic therapy

- **Metformin**: First-line unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or intolerance) [^112JDMsi] [^117H4U9h].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Concurrent with metformin — dietary changes, physical activity, and weight management [^1158avd1].

---

## Intensification of therapy

Intensify if the **A1c remains ≥ 7.5%** after 3 months of metformin:

| **A1c level** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|
| ≥ 7.5% | Add GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor [^115mzgHx] [^114YnLui] |
| ≥ 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal | Initiate combination therapy (metformin + GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor) [^112dHfyA] [^111o3WxT] |
| ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL | Consider basal insulin (with or without GLP-1 RA) [^111o3WxT] [^115C63cJ] |

---

## Individualized A1c targets

Tailor targets to patient characteristics:

- **Most patients**: 7–8% [^114M26zM].

- **Younger/healthier patients**: 7–7.5% if safely achievable [^notfound].

- **Older/complex patients**: 8–8.5% (frailty, comorbidities, limited life expectancy) [^116ouwun] [^113QouE3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess **every 3 months** with A1c checks, glucose monitoring, and review of adherence, side effects, and comorbidities [^11627gHn]. Adjust therapy based on response and patient factors [^116HoDy3].

---

## Potential complications of inadequate glycemic control

Poor control (A1c 8.4%) increases risk of:

- **Microvascular complications**: Retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy [^1158avd1].

- **Macrovascular complications**: Cardiovascular disease, stroke [^1158avd1].

- **Increased mortality**: Higher all-cause mortality [^1158avd1].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Provide **diabetes self-management education** and reinforce adherence to medications, diet, and exercise [^113iy9G8]. Address barriers (cost, side effects, health literacy) to improve outcomes [^113ezgkF].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Metformin first-line**: Unless contraindicated [^112JDMsi].

- **Add GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor**: If A1c remains ≥ 7.5% after 3 months [^notfound].

- **Combination therapy**: For A1c ≥ 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal [^111o3WxT].

- **Basal insulin**: For A1c ≥ 10% or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [^115C63cJ].

- **Individualize A1c targets**: Based on patient characteristics [^114PdFx9].

- **Monitor every 3 months**: Adjust therapy as needed [^11627gHn].

---

An A1c of 8.4% warrants **prompt intensification** beyond metformin, with agent selection and targets individualized to balance glycemic benefit against hypoglycemia and comorbidity risk.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1123awg6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes guidelines and organizations typically advocate a target glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value of 6.5–7.0% but highlight that glycemic management must be individualized. Whereas individualization of both glycemic targets and management is appealing to the clinician as a way of potentially maximizing benefit while minimizing risk, there is little evidence that such an approach will bring more patients to target. It may be argued that this approach could contribute to fewer patients attaining optimal glycemic targets. Nonetheless, the results of recent large outcome trials clearly highlight the fact that individual glycemic target achievement varied markedly, with some patients apparently deriving more clinical benefit and others deriving more harm. At the same time, there is ongoing evidence of a treatment gap in many surveys of clinical practice and a suggestion that algorithm-driven protocols may be more effective. Collectively, therefore, the currently available evidence suggests that algorithm-driven protocols that incorporate individualized targets based on patient characteristics designed to preserve a sound balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control may be an appropriate way of getting more patients to target in a safe and effective manner.

When transitioning to iGlarLixi from basal insulin, the starting dose depends on the patient's current basal insulin regimen. It is recommended to start at 30 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on 30 units of basal insulin daily or more, and 15 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on < 30 units of basal insulin daily, with titration directed by FPG targets. In those transitioning to iDegLira from basal insulin, the starting dose is 16 units once daily, with titration based on FPG, up to a maximum daily dose of 50 units once daily. Short‐acting insulin should generally be discontinued once an FRC is initiated, unless continued for specific prandial needs that are not expected to be covered by the GLP‐1 RA component. The rationale for discontinuing short‐acting insulin once initiating an FRC is that the GLP‐1 RA is expected to provide sufficient prandial glucose control. In most patients, this is sufficient to address post‐prandial glycemic excursions without the need for additional insulin. However, for those with high carbohydrate intake, continued post‐prandial excursions or long‐standing diabetes with impaired beta‐cell function, prandial insulin may be warranted to achieve glycemic targets.

6.3 Changing from a‐1 receptor agonist to an

Switching from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC such as iGlarLixi or iDegLira is a strategy to consider when glycemic control is inadequate, particularly secondary to rising FPG levels not being adequately addressed by the GLP‐1 RA alone. Patient selection should take into account the degree to which HbA1c exceeds the target. Overall, intensifying therapy from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC provides an improvement in HbA1c of ~1%. In those on a GLP‐1 RA with more marked HbA1c elevations (i.e. HbA1c more than 2% above goal or more than 10%), FRC therapy may not be expected to achieve glycemic targets, necessitating the initiation of a separate basal insulin. Rates of hypoglycaemia are expected to increase with FRC use due to the inclusion of basal insulin, though the hypoglycaemia risk remains low overall. Weight gain should be expected when initiating an FRC compared to GLP‐1 RA monotherapy due to the insulin component, though it is usually modest and offset by the improvement in glycemic control.

KDOQI Diabetes Guideline — HbA1c targets in high-risk chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients — Years of intensive glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ~ 7%) are required before a reduction in complications becomes evident, and with intensified insulin treatment there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain; in individuals 70–79 years of age on insulin, the probability of falls begins to increase when HbA1c ≤ 7%. Therefore, a target HbA1c of > 7.0% is suggested for patients with diabetes who are at risk of hypoglycemia and have clinically-significant co-morbidities or limited life expectancy, and co-morbidities can abrogate benefits of lower HbA1c on cardiovascular events; achieved HbA1c in conventional groups were 7.3–8.4%.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^113nGgLu]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past 3 decades, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased dramatically in North America, ushering in a variety of health problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which previously was not typically seen until much later in life. The rapid emergence of childhood T2DM poses challenges to many physicians who find themselves generally ill-equipped to treat adult diseases encountered in children. This clinical practice guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations on managing 10- to 18-year-old patients in whom T2DM has been diagnosed. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a Subcommittee on Management of T2DM in Children and Adolescents with the support of the American Diabetes Association, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association). These groups collaborated to develop an evidence report that served as a major source of information for these practice guideline recommendations. The guideline emphasizes the use of management modalities that have been shown to affect clinical outcomes in this pediatric population. Recommendations are made for situations in which either insulin or metformin is the preferred first-line treatment of children and adolescents with T2DM. The recommendations suggest integrating lifestyle modifications (ie, diet and exercise) in concert with medication rather than as an isolated initial treatment approach. Guidelines for frequency of monitoring hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and finger-stick blood glucose (BG) concentrations are presented. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation. The clinical practice guideline underwent peer review before it was approved by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for the care of all children with T2DM, and its recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of children with T2DM. Providers should consult experts trained in the care of children and adolescents with T2DM when treatment goals are not met or when therapy with insulin is initiated. The AAP acknowledges that some primary care clinicians may not be confident of their ability to successfully treat T2DM in a child because of the child's age, coexisting conditions, and/or other concerns. At any point at which a clinician feels he or she is not adequately trained or is uncertain about treatment, a referral to a pediatric medical subspecialist should be made. If a diagnosis of T2DM is made by a pediatric medical subspecialist, the primary care clinician should develop a comanagement strategy with the subspecialist to ensure that the child continues to receive appropriate care consistent with a medical home model in which the pediatrician partners with parents to ensure that all health needs are met.

### Initial management of severe hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: an observational study [^113a3QwM]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines recommend insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and severe hyperglycemia, but this recommendation lacks sufficient evidence and poses practical challenges. It is unclear whether non-insulin treatments are effective in this setting. The objective of this study was to describe treatment strategies of T2D patients with severe hyperglycemia and identify which initial treatments, interventions, or patient characteristics correlated with successful glucose lowering.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of 114 patients with T2D and a glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) ≥ 12%. Changes in A1C were compared between patients started on non-insulin medications versus insulin-based regimens. Regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of success in achieving A1C ≤ 9% within 1 year. The main outcomes measures were change in A1C from baseline and predictors of success in achieving A1C ≤ 9% within 1 year.

Results

At baseline, 43 patients (37.7%) started one or more non-insulin medications; 71 (62.3%) started insulin. Fifty-eight patients (50.8%) achieved an A1C ≤ 9%. Predictors of success were newly diagnosed T2D, certified diabetes educator (CDE) visits, and less time to follow-up A1C; insulin therapy was not. Change in A1C was significantly better in the non-insulin cohort compared to the insulin cohort (-4.5% vs. -2.8%, p = 0.001). Newly diagnosed patients were less likely to start insulin therapy (20.8% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.001), less likely to use insulin at any point (29.2% vs 81.1%, p < 0.001), and more likely to achieve an A1C ≤ 9% compared to patients with established T2D (87.5% vs 41.1%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Insulin therapy was used in roughly two-thirds of patients with severe hyperglycemia, but did not result in better glycemic control compared to non-insulin regimens. Rapid follow-up, more CDE visits, and a new diabetes diagnosis were predictors of successful glucose lowering. Patients with T2D and severe hyperglycemia, particularly those newly diagnosed, may be managed with non-insulin therapy.

Lifestyle Management Lifestyle and nutrition counseling is essential for patients with prediabetes or new-onset diabetes to slow the progression of type 2 diabetes. 2–5 Current ADA recommendations state that medical nutrition therapy should remain part of the treatment plan after pharmacotherapy is initiated. 2 In a large, randomized, multicenter trial, patients were assigned to an intensive lifestyle intervention group or to a diabetes support and education group. The intensive intervention consisted of baseline diabetes education; frequent individual and group counseling from dietitians, behavioral psychologists, and exercise specialists; caloric restriction; and regular exercise. The ADA recommends starting therapy with metformin, because it is the only medication shown to reduce mortality and complications in randomized controlled trials.

7 Additional medications should be added in a patient-centered, individualized fashion, although there is no evidence from RCTs that any of these medications reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality. 1 A 2011 comparative effectiveness review showed that metformin, second-generation sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and repaglinide lowered A1C levels by about 1% when used as monotherapy and that combination therapies showed an additive effect on A1C levels. 8 Table 1 lists common hypoglycemic agents for treating type 2 diabetes. 1, 9 Table 2 lists typical doses and costs of common hypoglycemic agents.
10. INITIAL MANAGEMENT Metformin should be used as initial therapy if there are no contraindications. If A1C levels remain above goal after three months of therapy, a second agent should be added. Dual therapy may be considered if the A1C level is 9% or greater at initial presentation. Progression to triple therapy is recommended if the A1C level is above goal after three months of dual therapy. If a patient presents with severe hyperglycemia or an A1C level of 10% or greater, the ADA recommends that insulin therapy be strongly considered as initial therapy. 1, 12 These recommendations are largely based on expert opinion, because of a lack of comparative effectiveness data. 1, 12.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — treatment escalation thresholds specify that for some recently diagnosed individuals with T2D and more severe hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 7.5%), early combination pharmacotherapy should be considered, usually to include metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia; for newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an entry A1C > 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, clinicians should initiate dual- or possibly triple-combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin, and basal insulin along with noninsulin therapy is recommended if there are significant signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia, especially including catabolism or a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L); persons with T2D initially treated with monotherapy who do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets should progress to dual-combination therapy and then triple-combination therapy, if needed, and use a basal insulin to adequately obtain and maintain control.

Module A: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management directs clinicians first to determine whether the patient has an "urgent or emergent care need (e.g., symptomatic hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, concurrent medical issue, etc.)"; if yes, "Treat and/or refer for acute care". If no, "Assess barriers to success (e.g., psychosocial needs, navigating health care, health literacy/numeracy, patient/provider inertia, social determinants of health (e.g., transportation, economic or food insecurity))" and review non-pharmacologic therapies including "Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) (including weight management) (see Module B)", "Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) (see Module B)", and "Exercise", with pharmacologic initiation to "begin metformin unless contraindicated" if indicated. Next, evaluate comorbid conditions: "Established ASCVD or high ASCVD risk" (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, ASCVD), "Diabetic nephropathy", or "Heart failure (see Sidebar 4)"; if present, "Consider GLP-1 RA (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist) or SGLT-2 inhibitor (sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitor) if indicated". Otherwise, assess goal attainment: "Has the patient's glycemic target been achieved (A1C 7.0–8.5% for most patients or alternative range based on individualization)?", and if yes, "Review treatment plan to minimize or treat complications and/or comorbidities (see Sidebars 1, 2, 3 and 4)"; if no, "Consider additional medications until target A1C range is achieved. Select agent based on efficacy and risk-benefit ratio. See CPG Appendix B". Finally, incorporate health promotion by "Review[ing] health promotion activities" including tobacco cessation, age-related vaccinations, and dental care.

5 INDICATION AND USE OF BASAL INSULIN IN PEOPLE WITH

The human body requires insulin to function and no number of non‐insulin medications can address absolute insulin deficiency, as in type 1 diabetes, or a relative insulin deficiency, as in some cases of T2D, when the magnitude of that deficiency exceeds endogenous insulin's ability to overcome concurrent insulin resistance.

The need for insulin therapy is an assessment that must be done throughout the course of T2D; indeed, most patients will eventually require insulin therapy. However, this is typically later in the course of therapy following progressive loss of beta‐cell function (Figure 1). In T2D, insulin therapy should be considered regardless of current antihyperglycemic therapy when glycemic markers are very high (i.e. HbA1c more than 10% or blood glucose more than 300 mg/dL) or with symptomatic hyperglycemia (e.g. catabolic symptoms including weight loss, ketonuria and ketosis). This early stabilisation of glycemia requires basal insulin with or without bolus insulin. Following stabilisation, non‐insulin antihyperglycemic medications (including GLP‐1 RAs) should be considered, particularly in cases of new‐onset T2D.

The more typical circumstance is the addition of basal insulin following loss of glycemic control with multiple non‐insulin agents. These non‐insulin medications should include a GLP‐1 RA first given the advantages to weight loss and low hypoglycaemia risk vs. starting injectable antihyperglycemic therapy with basal insulin. True once daily basal insulins are preferred over intermediate‐acting insulin, which requires twice‐daily administration and has a higher risk for hypoglycaemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Additionally, once insulin is started, sulfonylureas should be discontinued. As it pertains to dosing, three options exist for an initial basal insulin dose,: (1) a flat 10 units daily, 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, and for patients with a baseline HbA1c greater than 8%, 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day. In a 100 kg patient, these options differ by 10 units/day. A typical basal insulin titration schedule increases the dose by 2 units every 2–3 days in which fasting plasma glucose (FPG) remains above target. Notably, this is extended to 3–5 days for insulin degludec given its longer half‐life. Overall though, dose adjustments become smaller and with greater intervals between adjustments as FPG is nearing the goal.

### Glycaemic impact of treatment intensification in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with oral antidiabetes drugs or basal insulin [^111M2AvS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The recommended approach to the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) for newly diagnosed patients involves the administration of oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) combined with exercise and dietary adjustments. 1, 2 Current treatment guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend individualized glycated haemoglobin A 1c (A1C) targets based on age, disease severity, the presence of comorbidities and other individual patient factors. 2

Guidelines suggest that patients who do not achieve their target A1C levels within 3 months of initiating monotherapy and lifestyle changes may benefit from the addition of basal insulin (BI) therapy. 1, 2 If glycaemic control is still not achieved, ADA guidelines recommend intensification of treatment by the addition of a prandial insulin or a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA), or switching to a premixed insulin. 1 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) guidelines also recommend intensifying with a prandial insulin, a GLP‐1 RA, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitor or a dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitor if target A1C levels are not reached with BI therapy. 3 However, despite the presence of clear treatment guidelines, approximately 50% of patients with T2D in the United States do not achieve optimal glycaemic control. 4 Delayed treatment adjustment or failure to intensify therapy when appropriate (described as "clinical inertia") is often associated with poor clinical outcomes among these patients. 5, 6 Clinical inertia has also been suggested to contribute to poor outcomes in patients with T2D and results in higher healthcare utilization and associated costs. 7, 8

### To what target hemoglobin A1c level would you treat this patient with type 2 diabetes? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113A6kBq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 9.4% of all adults-and 25% of those older than 65 years-have diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and end-stage renal disease and contributes to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. The management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common and important activity in primary care internal medicine practice. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an estimate of mean blood sugar levels and glycemic control. The optimal HbA1c target level among various persons with T2D is a subject of controversy. Guidelines regarding HbA1c targets have yielded differing recommendations. In 2018, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a guideline on HbA1c targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D. In addition to a recommendation to individualize HbA1c target levels, the ACP proposed a level between 7% and 8% for most patients. The ACP also advised deintensification of therapy for patients who have an HbA1c level lower than 6.5% and avoidance of HbA1c-targeted treatment for patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. This guidance contrasts with a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association to aim for HbA1c levels less than 7% for many nonpregnant adults and to consider a target of 6.5% if it can be achieved safely. Here, 2 experts, a diabetologist and a general internist, discuss how to apply the divergent guideline recommendations to a patient with long-standing T2D and a current HbA1c level of 7.8%.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112zoRmz]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The most recent glycemic goal recommended by the American Diabetes Association, selected on the basis of practicality and the projected reduction in complications over time, is, in general, an A1C level of < 7%. The most recent glycemic goal set by the International Diabetes Federation is an A1C level of < 6.5%. The upper limit of the nondiabetic range is 6.1% (mean ± SD. A1C level of 5 ± 2%) with the DCCT/UKPDS-standardized assay, which has been promulgated through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and adopted by the vast majority of commercially available assays. Several recent clinical trials have aimed for A1C levels ≤ 6.5% with a variety of interventions. The results of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, which had the primary objective of decreasing CVD with interventions aimed at achieving an A1C level of < 6.0% vs. interventions aimed at achieving an A1C level of < 7.9%, showed excess CVD mortality in the intensive treatment group. Results from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial, both of which had different interventions and study populations than ACCORD, did not demonstrate any excess total or CVD mortality with intensive regimens that achieved A1C levels comparable with the 6.5% in ACCORD. However, none of the studies has demonstrated a benefit of intensive glycemic control on their primary CVD outcomes. Our consensus is that an A1C level of ≥ 7% should serve as a call to action to initiate or change therapy with the goal of achieving an A1C level of < 7%. We are mindful that this goal is not appropriate or practical for some patients, and clinical judgement based on the potential benefits and risks of a more intensified regimen needs to be applied for every patient. Factors such as life expectancy, risk of hypoglycemia, and the presence of CVD need to be considered for every patient before intensifying the therapeutic regimen.

Assiduous attention to abnormalities other than hyperglycemia that accompany type 2 diabetes, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, has been shown to improve microvascular and cardiovascular complications. Readers are referred to published guidelines for a discussion of the rationale and goals of therapy for the nonglycemic risk factors, as well as recommendations on how to achieve them.

### Treatment pattern trends of medications for type 2 diabetes in British columbia, Canada [^111UtEy6]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Guideline recommendations for pharmacologic management of T2DM changed considerably over the study period. In 1998, the Canadian Diabetes Association revised and expanded their 1992 guidelines for the management of diabetes in Canada. Lack of standardization of the hemoglobin A1C test precluded its use in the diagnosis of diabetes. First-line pharmacologic treatment recommendations included monotherapy of an oral AGI, biguanide (eg, metformin) or SU. Combination therapy was not recommended until after 2–4 months of monotherapy. In 2008, the Canadian Diabetes Association recommended differentiating first-line treatment choice based an A1C threshold of 9.0%. Metformin monotherapy was recommended for most patients, with exception of symptomatic patients with A1C ≥ 9.0%, where metformin in combination with another agent from a different class, including insulin, was recommended. By 2016, the threshold A1C value had lowered from 9.0% to 8.5% in which first-line treatment choice was differentiated. In 2018, the Diabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines expert committee recommended starting metformin plus a second agent if A1C is > 1.5% above target. The expert committee also recommended intense glycemic control to target A1C ≤ 7.0% in most people with T2DM to reduce the risk of microvascular and CV complications. Additionally, more intensive glucose control of A1C ≤ 6.5% was recommended for users of blood glucose-lowering drugs with low risk of hypoglycemia and shorter duration of diabetes and longer life expectancy.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### ACP releases updated guidance statement on A1c targets for… [^113pmsbw]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Goals of glycemic control should be individualized to each patient, after discussing harms and benefits, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense.
- An A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients, because targets of 7% or less do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events. In a review of these guidelines, the authors found no studies indicating that A1C targets less than 6. 5% improve clinical outcomes. Moreover, using medication to achieve this level had associated harms. Guidance Statements Goals of glycemic control via medication should be individualized to each patient, after talking about benefits and harms of more vs. less control, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense. Because targets of 7% or less vs.

approximately 8% do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events, an A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients. However, variability in A1C measurements should still be considered when making treatment decisions. Taking into account patient preference, a stricter A1C target can be considered in persons who are expected to live at least 15 more years. A lower target can be considered in patients who can achieve it with diet and lifestyle changes. Because there is no evidence that an A1C level lower than 6. 5% has clinical benefit, and evidence has shown associated harms, the medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients who achieve an A1C level lower than
6. 5%. Treatment in older persons and those with a shorter life expectancy should aim to reduce symptoms of hyperglycemia, rather than to achieve A1C targets.

In addition, because achieving certain A1C targets is associated with more harm than good, these targets are not recommended in any patient expected to live fewer than 10 years because of older age, living in a long-term care facility, or with a chronic condition. Shared decision making, based on a shared understanding of the possible risks and benefits of specific goals, should replace strict A1C targets. — Allen F. Shaughnessy, PharmD, AFP Assistant Medical Editor.

### Therapies for type 2 diabetes: lowering HbA1c and associated cardiovascular risk factors [^115jnqR1]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Both the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) and ADA have established practice guidelines (with slight differences in goals) outlining target glucose, HbA1c, BP, and lipid concentrations (table 2). Additionally, treatment algorithms have been developed by the ADA/(EASD) and AACE/ACE for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes (figure 1), outlining step-wise recommendations for treatment initiation and alterations based on HbA1c-lowering efficacy, additive effects, and costs associated with interventions. The new AACE/ACE algorithms also prioritize regimens based on their ability to minimize the risk and severity of hypoglycemia and the risk and magnitude of weight gain. Thus, these algorithms favor the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors because of their efficacy and safety, include thiazolidinediones (TZDs) as "well-validated" agents, and move sulfonylureas (SFUs) to lower priority because of their risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and short period of efficacy. At all steps, lifestyle interventions are recommended and should be encouraged. The effects of specific agents on modifiable risk factors and the CV risk profile should also be considered when building an antidiabetes regimen.

QUESTION 2: WHAT GLYCEMIC TARGETS CAN BE RECOMMENDED IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS?

The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital presents unique challenges that stem from variations in a patient's nutritional status and level of consciousness, the practical limitations of intermittent glycemic monitoring, and the ultimate importance of patient safety. Accordingly, reasonable glucose targets in the hospital setting are modestly higher than may be routinely advised for patients with diabetes in the outpatient setting.

Definition of glucose abnormalities

In this report, hyperglycemia is defined as any BG value > 140 mg/dl (> 7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this level may necessitate treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated BG concentrations may be due to stress hyperglycemia, a condition that can be established by a review of prior medical records or measurement of A1C. A1C values of > 6.5–7.0% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization.

Hypoglycemia is defined as any BG level < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many clinicians as < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l), although this value is lower than the approximate 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l], respectively) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

### Treatment patterns and glycated haemoglobin levels over 36 months in individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line glucose-lowering therapy: the global DISCOVER study [^115mzgHx]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

For individuals receiving glucose‐lowering therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D), changing from first‐ to second‐line therapy may include the addition of a new glucose‐lowering drug or switching treatment class, and is recommended when first‐line therapy fails to control glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Although most guidelines recommend a target HbA1c level of 48 to 53 mmol/mol (6.5‐7.0%) in otherwise healthy adults with T2D, they also suggest tailoring glycaemic targets to individual patients. Glucose‐lowering treatment should be intensified if an individual does not achieve their target HbA1c level with first‐line treatment. Despite this recommendation, observational studies show that a substantial proportion of patients have poor glycaemic control for several years before treatment is intensified, a delay referred to as treatment inertia.

Many glucose‐lowering agents are available for second‐line therapy, including sulphonylureas (SUs), dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, or sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and insulin. Global guidelines, including those from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes/American Diabetes Association, Diabetes Canada, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), suggest selecting second‐line glucose‐lowering treatments based on patient characteristics such as age, duration of diabetes, and presence of comorbidities, as well as risk of adverse events including hypoglycaemia and weight gain. However, longitudinal data on glucose‐lowering regimens and clinical outcomes after second‐line treatment are lacking.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — achieved HbA1c levels in major trials and interpretation of intensive therapy indicate that "only ACCORD and ADVANCE reached and sustained HbA1c levels between 6–7% in the intensive therapy group through the end of the study (e.g., average HbA1c 6.5%; interquartile range 6.0–6.8%)". In contrast, "The UKPDS initially lowered HbA1c below 7%, but values steadily increased to approximately 7% after 6 years and subsequently remained between 7–8% through completion". Consequently, "the results from ADVANCE and ACCORD should be weighted more heavily when interpreting the relative benefits and risks of intensive glucose lowering, if defined as HbA1c < 7%".

FUTURE DIRECTIONS/RESEARCH NEEDS

For antihyperglycemic management of type 2 diabetes, the comparative evidence basis to date is relatively lean, especially beyond metformin monotherapy. There is a significant need for high-quality comparative-effectiveness research, not only regarding glycemic control, but also costs and those outcomes that matter most to patients — quality of life and the avoidance of morbid and life-limiting complications, especially CVD. Another issue about which more data are needed is the concept of durability of effectiveness (often ascribed to β-cell preservation), which would serve to stabilize metabolic control and decrease the future treatment burden for patients. Pharmacogenetics may very well inform treatment decisions in the future, guiding the clinician to recommend a therapy for an individual patient based on predictors of response and susceptibility to adverse effects. We need more clinical data on how phenotype and other patient/disease characteristics should drive drug choices. As new medications are introduced to the type 2 diabetes pharmacopeia, their benefit and safety should be demonstrated in studies versus best current treatment, substantial enough both in size and duration to provide meaningful data on meaningful outcomes. It is appreciated, however, that head-to-head comparisons of all combinations and permutations would be impossibly large. Informed judgment and the expertise of experienced clinicians will therefore always be necessary.

These recommendations apply only to scheduled elective procedures where time allows therapy implementation, and BG concentrations should be within the targeted range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L) 1 to 4 hours prior to surgery.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^113s5JvL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The ADA/EASD goal starts at an HbA1c of 7% or less, then suggests lower goals can be selected for patients in whom this can be achieved safely, without significant hypoglycaemia or other adverse effects. The recommendation aligns with the data presented herein, that use of medications which do not lead to hypoglycaemia is a hallmark of being able to achieve low HbA1c targets safely. Further, characteristics pointing toward achieving a benefit from tight control include younger age with long life expectancy and achieving that control without hypoglycaemia. Conversely, short life expectancy, frailty, advanced complications and poorly tolerating therapy point toward needing a more conservative patient‐specific HbA1c goal (e.g. < 8%). Advanced complications are important for two key reasons: patients such as these may have more difficulty safely managing medications and patients with extensive complications, including microvascular complications, have experienced the outcome tighter glycemic control would have attempted to prevent.

### Treatment patterns and glycated haemoglobin levels over 36 months in individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line glucose-lowering therapy: the global DISCOVER study [^114qFkGE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Target HbA1c levels should be personalized to each patient and a target HbA1c level of 48 to 53 mmol/mol (6.5‐7.0%) may not be appropriate for all individuals. For example, individuals with complex comorbidities may have less stringent glycaemic goals with an individualized target HbA1c level of > 53 mmol/mol (> 7.0%). In fact, a previous DISCOVER study report showed that 70.2% of patients had been set an individualized glycaemic control target; targets were 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) for 2513 patients (49.6%), < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) for 2073 patients (40.9%), ≥ 53 mmol/mol (≥ 7.0%) for 484 patients (9.6%). As such, a proportion of participants with an HbA1c level of 53 to < 64 mmol/mol (7.0‐ < 8.0%) may be considered as having reached their individualized HbA1c target and therefore did not receive treatment intensification during follow‐up.

### Are diabetes management guidelines applicable in' real life'? [^112oeNwm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has published several diabetes treatment algorithms, but none have been tested in real-life settings. The aim of this study is to analyze the feasibility of achieving and/or maintaining HbA1c levels < 7.0% using current diabetes treatment guidelines and the resources available in the public health care system of Brazil.

Methods

A one-year, single-arm interventional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients in a primary care unit. Intervention consisted of intensification of lifestyle changes and sequential prescription of drugs based on ADA guidelines using the medications available through the publicly funded Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS).

Results

Ninety patients (age: 62.7 ± 10.4 years; diabetes duration: 8.2 ± 9.1 years) completed the trial. During the intervention period, increases were observed in number of oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) classes per patient (1.50 ± 0.74 vs. 1.67 ± 0.7; p = 0.015), OAD pills per patient (2.64 ± 1.89 vs. 3.33 ± 2.23 pills/patient; p < 0.001), insulin dosage (0.20 ± 0.29 vs.0.50 ± 0.36 UI/kg/day; p = 0.008) and number of patients on insulin (19 [21%] vs. 31 [34%]; p < 0.01), but no improvement in HbA1c (7.2 ± 1.6% vs. 7.3 ± 1.5%; p = 0.453) or frequency of patients on target, defined as HbA1c < 7% (53.3% vs. 48.9%; p = 0.655). Patients with baseline HbA1c < 7% had a small increase in HbA1c during the trial (6.3 ± 0.4 vs. 6.7 ± 0.9%; p = 0.002). No such change was observed in those with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7%.

Conclusions

In this group of patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.2%, implementation of 2006/2009 ADA/EASD guidelines led to achievement of the therapeutic goal of HbA1c < 7% in a small proportion of patients.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^116Tc2ws]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Over 280 million people worldwide are known to have diabetes, and this number is projected to grow to 438 million by 2030. Current diabetes treatment guidelines encourage a multifaceted therapeutic approach. Central to these recommendations is early diagnosis and active intervention to realize and maintain glycemic control, with the aim of stopping the development of microvascular complications, reducing the risk of macrovascular events, and ameliorating the symptoms of acute hyperglycemia (,–).

The prognostic significance of A1C in regard to the incidence of diabetes complications, and the risk reductions associated with improvements in A1C, have been documented in both type 1 and type 2 (–,) diabetes. These have led to the underscoring of the importance of A1C target achievement. Many organizations around the world including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence currently advocate a general target level for A1C of 6.5–7.0%. They also all say that the targets of therapy must be individualized. Recently, a joint position statement from the American College of Cardiology, ADA, and the American Heart Association released in response to the premature discontinuation of the glycemic intervention in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial recommended that although an appropriate A1C target is generally < 7.0%, individualized glycemic targets may be appropriate for some patients. For example, they stated that higher A1C targets may be more appropriate for those patients who are older, have longer duration of diabetes, have a history of severe hypoglycemia, exhibit advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, or present with extensive comorbidities. Others have noted that where glucose control closer to normal, or in the normal range, is easily attained, the care necessary to achieve it should be offered to the individual concerned.

CF patients with CFRD should be treated with insulin therapy. (ADA-A; USPSTF-B)

Oral diabetes agents are not as effective as insulin in improving nutritional and metabolic outcomes in CFRD and are not recommended outside the context of clinical research trials. (ADA-A; USPSTF-D)

Management goals

ADA has established plasma glucose goals for people with diabetes. These are primarily based on the need to decrease the risk of microvascular complications and thus apply to CFRD with slight modifications (supplementary Table 4). Whether more stringent goals should be adopted for CF patients based on the relationship between hyperglycemia, nutrition, and pulmonary disease cannot be determined at present.

To safely achieve glucose goals, ADA recommends that all patients on insulin therapy perform SMBG at least three times daily. Continuous glucose monitoring has been validated in CF and may be useful for clinical management in some patients.

Patients with CFRD who are on insulin should perform SMBG at least three times a day. (ADA-E; Consensus)

Patients with CFRD should strive to attain plasma glucose goals as per the ADA recommendations for all people with diabetes, bearing in mind that higher or lower goals may be indicated for some patients and that individualization is important. (ADA-E; Consensus)

ADA considers A1C the primary target for glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although A1C levels may be spuriously low in CF, they are generally higher in CF patients with CFRD compared with those with normal glucose tolerance or IGT, and elevated levels are associated with increased risk of microvascular complications. In one study of patients with > 10-year duration CFRD, those with retinopathy and/or microalbuminuria had average A1C levels of 8.0% compared with 5.8% in CFRD patients with no eye or kidney changes, and 83% of those with microvascular complications had A1C levels ≥ 7.0%, consistent with data in the general diabetes population. For a given patient, the rise and fall in A1C may be a useful indicator of trends in glycemic control. Thus, regular monitoring of A1C is advised.

A1C measurement is recommended quarterly for patients with CFRD. (ADA-E; Consensus)

For most patients with CFRD, the A1C treatment goal is ≤ 7% to reduce the risk of microvascular complications, bearing in mind that higher or lower goals may be indicated for some patients and that individualization is important. (ADA-B; USPSTF-B)

Diabetes Prevention and Treatment

DM and prediabetes are both important risk factors for CHD. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) added hemoglobin A1c cutoffs to its definitions of DM and prediabetes, which has made it simpler to diagnose both conditions with increased sensitivity. DM is diagnosed when hemoglobin A1c is ≥ 6.5%, and prediabetes is diagnosed when hemoglobin A1c is 5.7% to 6.4%. The ADA recommends routinely screening all overweight or obese adults beginning at age 45 years, with prediabetics monitored yearly for progression to DM.

Lifestyle interventions among prediabetics can significantly lower the rate of DM. These include 5% to 10% weight loss, 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity, and increased consumption of fiber and whole grain carbohydrates. Metformin can be considered for obese, prediabetic individuals younger than 60 years that are at high risk of progressing to DM (eg, family history of DM or presence of metabolic syndrome).

For those with DM, the ADA recommends treatment to achieve a target hemoglobin A1c level < 7%. Numerous therapies are available including oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin, but metformin is recommended as first‐line treatment for most patients with type 2 DM. More intensive goals should be avoided because they have not been associated with improvement in CV outcomes and have been associated with increased mortality. –

For selected diabetic patients that are adept at using technology, use of mobile phone based "apps" that allow blood glucose tracking can also result in improved hemoglobin A1c levels and higher patient satisfaction. – Physicians can now write prescriptions for such interventions, many of which are available without cost to the patient.

If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose control. The goal of initial intensive insulin therapy for symptomatic hyperglycemia is to reduce glucose levels safely and promptly. After improved glycemic control is achieved with short-term insulin therapy, especially with a new diagnosis of DM, a role for noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents could be considered.

### Impact of diabetes mellitus and hemoglobin A1c level on outcomes among Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome [^117MU6A1]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In China, more than 700 000 deaths each year, one quarter of all deaths, are caused by coronary events. 1, 2 Rapid epidemiological transition and a concomitant increase in the prevalence of major risk factors have led to an increasing numbers of patients being admitted to hospitals with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). More than two thirds of the burden of death and disability from ACS, which is a major contributor to national mortality and economic burden in our country, will occur in adults aged < 65 years. 3, 4

In 2010, an estimated 6.4% of the world's adult population (approximately 285 million individuals) had diabetes mellitus (DM), and the prevalence is projected to increase to 7.7% (approximately 439 million individuals) by 2030. 5 DM is considered to be a "coronary heart disease (CHD) equivalent" and associated with a 2‐ to 4‐fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

The measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides a reliable reflection of the glycemic control in the previous 8 to 12 weeks and is minimally affected by stress during ACS. The International Expert Committee has recommended the use of HbA1c in diagnosing diabetes with a cutoff value of 6.5%. 6 The recommended guideline for patients with CVD is HbA1c values < 7%. 6 Although the benefit of controlling HbA1c levels (glycemic control) in patients with type 2 diabetes on microvascular events such as retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy is well established, the association between glycemic control and macrovascular or cardiovascular events is less well defined. 7, 8 Moreover, most previous studies generally evaluated the impact of diabetes on outcomes in patients after acute myocardial infarction. 9, 10, 11, 12 Further understanding of the impact of normal and different admission glycemic control conditions on in‐hospital and long‐term outcomes among patients with ACS is essential. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of the diabetes and admission HbA1c levels (glycemic control conditions) on in‐hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and long‐term mortality in a large cohort of Chinese patients hospitalized for ACS who underwent modern treatments in the contemporary post‐2000 era.

Clinicians should be cognizant that combination of incretin therapies is not recommended. Antihyperglycemic medications should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose and additional agents should be considered in a timely fashion to avoid therapeutic inertia. If the A1C is > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, ≥ 2 antihyperglycemic agents may need to be initiated at once.

We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy. We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved. In insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not achieving glycemic goals, we suggest real-time continuous glucose monitoring to decrease hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c.

### Additional medications to improve glycemic control… [^1163ZiTe]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The current recommendation for patients with diabetes is to maintain A1C levels of 8 percent or less to reduce long-term complications of type 2 diabetes. Most patients with type 2 diabetes eventually need to take more than two agents to achieve and maintain this blood glucose goal. More than 50 percent of patients who have type 2 diabetes for more than 15 years require insulin therapy. Although insulin therapy has been shown to be beneficial in patients in research studies, it is not as effective in clinical settings, perhaps because general patients are less motivated and have fewer resources. The trial was a nonblinded, open-label, randomized controlled study involving 62 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, defined as an A1C level greater than 8 percent.

Eligibility criteria included age between 30 and 85 years, having type 2 diabetes for at least one year, taking maximal doses of metformin and an insulin secretagogue, and undergoing stable treatment for diabetes for more than 12 weeks. Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with insulin or a thiazolidinedione, or class III or IV New York Heart Association heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke within the past six months. Patients were assigned randomly to receive NPH insulin or pioglitazone at bedtime in addition to their usual doses of diabetes medications for 16 weeks. The NPH insulin therapy was started at 0. 3 units per kg and titrated in an attempt to achieve a fasting blood glucose level of less than 108 mg per dL. Pioglitazone therapy was started at 30 mg per day and, after four weeks, the dosage was increased to 45 mg per day if the fasting glucose goal had not been achieved.

The main outcome measurements included glycemic control, hypoglycemia, blood pressure, lipid levels, microalbuminuria, and quality of life. Insulin therapy reduced the A1C level by 2. 3 percent, and pioglitazone therapy reduced it by

1. 9 percent during the study. This was not a significant difference in reduction. A significant number of patients receiving insulin were more likely to develop hypoglycemia than those who received pioglitazone. The authors conclude that the addition of pioglitazone or bedtime insulin to maximum dosages of metformin and insulin secretagogue improves glycemic control during a 16-week trial. Compared with insulin therapy, pioglitazone causes fewer hypoglycemic episodes and improves HDL cholesterol levels.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

Conclusions

All three components of hyperglycemia — elevated fasting blood glucose; elevated postprandial blood glucose; and, as a consequence, elevated HbA 1c — contribute to and correlate with the development and progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications in subjects with diabetes. Glycemic targets from the European Society of Cardiology/EASD guidelines are < 108 mg/dL for fasting blood glucose, 2 h after beginning eating postprandial blood glucose < 135 mg/dL, and ≤ 6.5% for HbA 1c in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recently, the ADA/EASD guidelines have recommended new HbA 1c treatment goals in their patient-centered approach.

In patients not reaching therapeutic goals on metformin only to achieve/maintain an HbA 1c target over ∼3 months, the next step recommended was to add either a second OHA, a GLP-1 RA, or basal insulin. Basal insulins, especially basal insulin analogs (glargine or detemir), added to OHAs (in particular metformin) alone at bedtime, have the highest efficacy lowering HbA 1c and fasting blood glucose with consecutively improved postprandial blood glucose levels. In principle, insulin therapy has a high risk of hypoglycemia and is associated with weight gain compared with the other options recommended on level 2 of the treatment algorithm. However, BOT using either insulin glargine or insulin detemir was associated with significantly less risk comparing BOT using NPH insulin with other insulin regimens like prandial insulin or premixed insulin. Insulin therapy theoretically allows reaching glycemic goals from high baseline glycemic values by individual and consequent dose titration to the desired target. Basal insulin analogs in that respect provide relatively uniform insulin coverage throughout the whole day and night.

On the other hand, GLP-1 RAs added to metformin have a high efficacy in lowering HbA 1c and postprandial blood glucose with improvement of fasting blood glucose levels alongside. By contrast, GLP-1 RA treatment confers no risk of hypoglycemia with further advantage of weight loss and a relative low risk of gastrointestinal side effects.

Two head-to-head studies of GLP-1 RAs, using either exenatide once per week or liraglutide once a day, found superiority or noninferiority in terms of lowering HbA 1c compared with basal insulin glargine. In both studies, GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and loss of weight compared with insulin glargine therapy. Both basal insulin therapy and GLP-1 RA therapy are more effective but still more expensive than OHA treatment.

Type 2 diabetes epidemiology and glycemic control — among U.S. adults, the age-adjusted prevalence is higher in Black (19%) and Hispanic (21%) adults than in White adults (12%), and 16% of adults with type 2 diabetes have inadequate glycemic control with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of 9% or higher; inadequate control is more prevalent among Black (24%) and Hispanic (29%) adults than among White adults (9%). In the United States, the excess risk for premature deaths attributed to type 2 diabetes decreased between 1997 and 2011 among Hispanic and White adults, but not among Black adults, and access to high-quality health care in people with type 2 diabetes differs by race and ethnicity even after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health factors.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^115TcJLY]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

2. Testing frequency.

There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of HbA 1c testing. The ADA recommends, "For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician". In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, expert opinion recommends HbA 1c testing "at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control)… and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals". These testing recommendations are for nonpregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients with diabetes who are admitted to a hospital should have HbA 1c measured if the results of testing in the previous 2–3 months are not available. Diabetes quality-assurance programs [e.g. Provider Recognition Program and HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set)] have generally required documentation of the percentage of diabetic patients who have had at least one HbA 1c measurement during the preceding year. Studies have established that serial HbA 1c measurements (quarterly for 1 year) produce large improvements in HbA 1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.

3. Interpretation.

HbA 1c values in patients with diabetes constitute a continuum. They range from within the reference interval in a small percentage of patients whose mean plasma glucose concentrations are close to those of nondiabetic individuals, to markedly increased values (e.g. two- to threefold increases in some patients) that reflect an extreme degree of hyperglycemia. A proper interpretation of HbA 1c test results requires that physicians understand the relationship between HbA 1c values and mean plasma glucose, the kinetics of HbA 1c, and specific assay limitations/interferences. Small changes in HbA 1c (e.g. ± 0.3% HbA 1c) over time may reflect assay imprecision rather than a true change in glycemic status.

5. Emerging considerations

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c MAY BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES, WITH VALUES ≥ 6.5% BEING DIAGNOSTIC. AN NGSP-CERTIFIED METHOD SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY. ANALOGOUS TO ITS USE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE HbA 1c ASSAY WILL PRECLUDE ITS USE IN DIAGNOSIS A (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: POINT-OF-CARE HbA 1c ASSAYS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE TO USE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES B (moderate).

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^111oZQ9e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

Medications

The characteristics of currently available glucose-lowering interventions, when used as monotherapy, are summarized in Table 1. The glucose-lowering effectiveness of individual therapies and combinations demonstrated in clinical trials is predicated not only on the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention but also on the duration of diabetes, baseline glycemia, previous therapy, and other factors. A major factor in selecting a class of drugs, or a specific medication within a class, to initiate therapy or when changing therapy, is the ambient level of glycemic control. When levels of glycemia are high (e.g. A1C > 8.5%), classes with greater and more rapid glucose-lowering effectiveness, or potentially earlier initiation of combination therapy, are recommended; however, patients with recent-onset diabetes often respond adequately to less intensive interventions than those with longer-term disease. When glycemic levels are closer to the target levels (e.g. A1C < 7.5%), medications with lesser potential to lower glycemia and/or a slower onset of action may be considered.

Obviously, the choice of glycemic goals and the medications used to achieve them must be individualized for each patient, balancing the potential for lowering A1C and anticipated long-term benefit with specific safety issues, as well as other characteristics of regimens, including side effects, tolerability, ease of use, long-term adherence, expense, and the nonglycemic effects of the medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by worsening glycemia; higher doses and additional medications are required over time if treatment goals are to be met.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: time for an evidence-based about-face? [^116HHG4U]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Some diabetes guidelines set low glycemic control goals for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (such as a hemoglobin A(1c) level as low as 6.5% to 7.0%) to avoid or delay complications. Our review and critique of recent large randomized trials in patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that tight glycemic control burdens patients with complex treatment programs, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and costs and offers uncertain benefits in return. We believe clinicians should prioritize supporting well-being and healthy lifestyles, preventive care, and cardiovascular risk reduction in these patients. Glycemic control efforts should individualize hemoglobin A(1c) targets so that those targets and the actions necessary to achieve them reflect patients' personal and clinical context and their informed values and preferences.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114PdFx9]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) glycemic targets — We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved (Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended). We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of T2DM, comorbidities, and life expectancy. The discussion notes intensive control as targets such as HbA1c < 7.0%. Supporting evidence cited includes a Cochran review of 20 trials (n = 29,986) reporting no significant difference between intensive and conventional glucose control for all-cause mortality but reduced risk of amputation and microvascular diseases in the intensive treatment arm, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

Prediabetes — recommendation 11.6 and diagnostic thresholds: Diabetes medications including metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) can be considered in persons with prediabetes or in those with adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) who remain glucose-intolerant after weight loss using lifestyle and/or weight-loss medications (Grade A; BEL 1). Prediabetes can be identified by impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test result 140 to 199 mg/dL, 2 hours after ingesting 75 g of glucose), or A1C 5.7% to 6.4%, and progression risk is greatest with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, strong family history of type 2 diabetes, progressive glycemia within the prediabetes range, or meeting a combination of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome criteria (any 2 out of 3).

Evolution of intensive therapy during ACCORD

Patterns in the whole ACCORD population

The ACCORD participants' mean age was 62 years and median A1C 8.1% (mean 8.3%) at enrollment. About 60% were already taking metformin, 50% a sulfonylurea, 20% a thiazolidinedione, and 35% insulin. In the first year, participants assigned to intensive treatment were prescribed combinations of oral agents to improve glycemic control according to general guidance in the ACCORD protocol. Insulin was added when needed, usually first as basal insulin but with prandial injections later in many cases. By the end of treatment, 95% of intensively treated participants had been prescribed metformin, 87% a secretagogue, 92% a thiazolidinedione, 23% an α-glucosidase inhibitor, 77% some form of insulin therapy, and 55% a regimen including prandial insulin. The median A1C of the intensive group decreased to 6.7% at 4 months and by 1 year after randomization stabilized at a plateau in the 6.4–6.5% range. In contrast, the standard group attained median A1C 7.5% at 4 months and maintained this level to the end of treatment.

At the end of 1 year, the upper interquartile boundary for A1C in the intensive treatment group in ACCORD was about 7%, indicating that ∼25% of participants had values above 7%. A similar proportion of "high-outliers" persisted throughout 3.5 years of intensive treatment, represented by a tail of the distribution curve of A1C levels attained (Fig. 4). After cessation of the intensive treatment strategy, levels of A1C for participants previously assigned to intensive treatment increased gradually over the last 1.5 years of observation. Even so, at the end of the trial, the former intensive group had median A1C 7.2% — still lower than 7.6% for the standard group.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^115G9Vba]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia should be confirmed prior to ordering, dispensing, or administering insulin (A). Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A). Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A). The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B). For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B). Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B). In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B). The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B). If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C). Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient's care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B). Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C). Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D). Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B). The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A). Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A). Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^112JmZW3]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Most leading guidelines suggest adding one of several antihyperglycemic drugs when lifestyle and metformin fail to keep A1C at target unrelated to these questions. The previous American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement suggested a preferable order of drugs, while the AACE/ACE Diabetes Algorithm for Glycemic Control suggested starting treatment with combination therapy in naïve patients with A1C > 7.6%. The Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines suggested adding one of several second drugs after metformin in patients with A1C > 7%. Similarly, the recently published ADA/EASD position statement suggested leaving the decision of which drug to add to the treating physician. The above-mentioned guidelines are mainly based on drug efficacy and safety and do not necessarily address the various pathophysiology defects leading to hyperglycemia and increased risk for CVD in these patients. The case for initiating combination therapy that addresses the different pathophysiological faults in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in order to preserve near-normal glycemic durability is presented in this issue by DeFronzo, Eldor, and Abdul-Ghani. I will present the case for guidelines while referring and critiquing the approach of DeFronzo, Eldor, and Abdul-Ghani and suggest another option for a middle-of-the-road treatment method.

Trial design, conduct, and demographic limitations hinder definitive conclusions for specific subgroups, and additional research is needed to determine whether particular subsets achieve a favorable balance of benefits and harms by targeting lower HbA1c ranges.

If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current treatment guidelines recommend a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) as the goal for most individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 1, 2 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2 guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to therapies if glycaemic targets are not achieved, with basal insulin considered as second‐line or later therapy, with the exception of very poor glycaemic control (HbA1c > 9.0%; > 75 mmol/mol). Similarly, the recently updated ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus report recommends a stepwise approach to therapies in individuals with T2DM who are not at glycaemic target. However, with the exception of patients with HbA1c > 11.0% (97 mmol/mol), addition of a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA) as first injectable is recommended, with addition of basal insulin as second injectable. 3

Currently, 24%‐54% of individuals with T2DM worldwide prescribed supplementary basal insulin do not achieve their therapeutic targets. 4 Clinical inertia, defined as failure to adequately intensify treatment regimens sufficiently early, is an important contributing factor. 5 Identifying biomedical predictors of treatment success may assist clinicians in the selection of therapeutic interventions. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between baseline characteristics and glycaemic outcomes may help to prevent unnecessary delay in optimizing the use of basal insulin therapy. Previous studies have investigated the relevance of baseline characteristics to determine effective outcomes in individuals with T2DM who are initiating insulin therapy. 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 Those characteristics that have been shown to be associated with an inadequate glycaemic response, that is, not achieving HbA1c less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol), include the number of oral anti‐hyperglycaemic drugs (OADs) prescribed at baseline, in addition to HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, body mass index (BMI), diabetes duration and sex. 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

The goal of this pooled participant‐level analysis of 16 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) was to further investigate, in a larger cohort exposed to the same basal insulin treatment, which baseline and post‐baseline characteristics better predict the glycaemic response and achievement of HbA1c less than 7.0% at 24 weeks with the introduction and titration of basal insulin glargine 100 units (U)/mL (Gla‐100), administered once daily at bedtime in combination with existing OADs.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) — 2017 VA/DoD individualized HbA1c target ranges described patient-tailored goals and tradeoffs: an "HbA1c range of 6–7% was suggested for patients with a life expectancy greater than 10–15 years and absent or mild microvascular complications, if it could be safely achieved", whereas "an HbA1c range of 7–8.5% was recommended for patients with established microvascular or macrovascular disease, comorbid conditions, or a life expectancy of 5–10 years". The Work Group noted that intensively lowering HbA1c "will reduce microvascular complications… but not other important clinical outcomes", and that any benefits are "counterbalanced by an increased risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and, in one trial, all-cause mortality".

### Consensus report: definition and interpretation of remission in type 2 diabetes [^115y7zt9]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Improvement of glucose levels into the normal range can occur in some people living with diabetes, either spontaneously or after medical interventions, and in some cases can persist after withdrawal of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. Such sustained improvement may now be occurring more often due to newer forms of treatment. However, terminology for describing this process and objective measures for defining it are not well established, and the long-term risks versus benefits of its attainment are not well understood. To update prior discussions of this issue, an international expert group was convened by the American Diabetes Association to propose nomenclature and principles for data collection and analysis, with the goal of establishing a base of information to support future clinical guidance. This group proposed "remission" as the most appropriate descriptive term, and HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) measured at least 3 months after cessation of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy as the usual diagnostic criterion. The group also made suggestions for active observation of individuals experiencing a remission and discussed further questions and unmet needs regarding predictors and outcomes of remission.

### Early combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycemic control to HbA1c ≤ 6.5% without increasing hypoglycemia: pooled analysis of two randomized clinical trials [^116FnT3B]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

CAROLINA and CARMELINA are among the wave of cardiovascular outcomes trials of glucose-lowering drugs over the past decade that have influenced clinical guidelines. Based on the results of these studies, the latest joint consensus report from the ADA and EASD recommends that patients with indicators of high cardiovascular risk, established cardiovascular disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease receive second-line treatment with a glucose-lowering drug that has proven cardiovascular benefit, such as an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor agonist. For others, the consensus report recommends DPP-4 inhibitors, including linagliptin, as one of the options to add to metformin when there is a compelling need to avoid hypoglycemia.

Clinical guidelines differ in their recommendations for when to consider initial combination therapy. The ADA suggests that patients who have HbA1c ≥ 1.5% above their glycemic target at the time of diagnosis should start with combination therapy; this would equate in most cases to a HbA1c of ≥ 8.5% or ≥ 8.0% based on the ADA targets of HbA1c < 7.0% for most patients and HbA1c of < 6.5% for certain other patients. In contrast, the AACE guidelines suggest HbA1c ≥ 7.5% as the level at which combination therapy should be initiated. Results from our analysis support the AACE recommendation as, compared with monotherapy, significantly more patients receiving initial combination treatment achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% if they had a baseline HbA1c between 7.5 and 9.0%. However, in patients with baseline HbA1c > 9.0%, although combination therapy numerically improved the proportion achieving HbA1c ≤ 6.5%, the majority still did not reach this target — not unexpectedly, given the high baseline level; adding another OAD or insulin to the combination therapy may be considered for such patients, as suggested by the AACE guidelines. The ADA treatment guidelines suggest considering the early introduction of insulin for patients with HbA1c > 10%. Finally, in patients with baseline HbA1c < 7.5% in our study, the linagliptin/metformin combination was more efficacious than metformin monotherapy for achieving HbA1c ≤ 6.5% or < 7.0% only at the higher dose of metformin (1000 mg), but the majority of patients with baseline HbA1c < 7.5% in all treatment groups achieved these targets. Future guidelines on initial combination therapy are also likely to be impacted by the recent 5-year VERIFY study, in which initial combination treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin and metformin in newly diagnosed T2D patients with HbA1c 6.5–7.5% provided greater and more durable glycemic control than metformin monotherapy.

### Epidemiologic relationships between A1c and all-cause mortality during a median 3.4-year follow-up of glycemic treatment in the ACCORD trial [^116Dqha5]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Randomized treatment comparing an intensive glycemic treatment strategy with a standard strategy in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial was ended early because of an unexpected excess of mortality in the intensive arm. As part of ongoing post hoc analyses of potential mechanisms for this finding, we explored whether on-treatment A1C itself had an independent relationship with mortality.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 10,251 with mean age 62 years, median duration of diabetes 10 years, and median A1C 8.1%) were randomly assigned to treatment strategies targeting either A1C < 6.0% (intensive) or A1C 7.0–7.9% (standard). Data obtained during 3.4 (median) years of follow-up before cessation of intensive treatment were analyzed using several multivariable models.

RESULTS

Various characteristics of the participants and the study sites at baseline had significant associations with the risk of mortality. Before and after adjustment for these covariates, a higher average on-treatment A1C was a stronger predictor of mortality than the A1C for the last interval of follow-up or the decrease of A1C in the first year. Higher average A1C was associated with greater risk of death. The risk of death with the intensive strategy increased approximately linearly from 6–9% A1C and appeared to be greater with the intensive than with the standard strategy only when average A1C was > 7%.

CONCLUSIONS

These analyses implicate factors associated with persisting higher A1C levels, rather than low A1C per se, as likely contributors to the increased mortality risk associated with the intensive glycemic treatment strategy in ACCORD.

### Guidelines abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes mellitus: 2013 update [^113QouE3]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Medium credibility.

Glycemic control targets for older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) — target goal for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in older adults generally should be 7.5% to 8%; HbA1c between 7% and 7.5% may be appropriate if it can be safely achieved in healthy older adults with few comorbidities and good functional status, and higher HbA1c targets (8–9%) are appropriate for older adults with multiple comorbidities, poor health, and limited life expectancy; there is potential harm in lowering HbA1c to less than 6.5% in older adults with type 2 DM, and there is no evidence that using medications to achieve tight glycemic control in older adults with type 2 DM is beneficial; for adults younger than 65, using medications to achieve HbA1c levels of less than 6.5% is associated with harms, including hypoglycemia and mortality, except for reductions in MI and mortality with metformin; given the long time frame needed to achieve a reduction in microvascular complications, glycemic goals should reflect patient goals, health status, and life expectancy.

### Hemoglobin A1c targets for glycemic control with pharmacologic therapy for nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a guidance statement update from the American College of Physicians [^114M26zM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians developed this guidance statement to guide clinicians in selecting targets for pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The National Guideline Clearinghouse and the Guidelines International Network library were searched (May 2017) for national guidelines, published in English, that addressed hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) targets for treating type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant outpatient adults. The authors identified guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. In addition, 4 commonly used guidelines were reviewed, from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology, the American Diabetes Association, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the guidelines.

Guidance Statement 1

Clinicians should personalize goals for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on the basis of a discussion of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy, patients' preferences, patients' general health and life expectancy, treatment burden, and costs of care.

Guidance Statement 2

Clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Guidance Statement 3

Clinicians should consider deintensifying pharmacologic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve HbA1c levels less than 6.5%.

Guidance Statement 4

Clinicians should treat patients with type 2 diabetes to minimize symptoms related to hyperglycemia and avoid targeting an HbA1c level in patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years due to advanced age (80 years or older), residence in a nursing home, or chronic conditions (such as dementia, cancer, end-stage kidney disease, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure) because the harms outweigh the benefits in this population.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^114horTU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) also compared the effects of tight vs. standard glycemic control. In this study, the duration of diabetes at baseline was longer (11.5 years) vs. other trials, as was the difference in achieved HbA1c (6.9% vs. 8.4%). Yet, the only outcome that improved over a median follow‐up of 5.6 years with tight control was the progression of albuminuria. However, when follow‐up was extended to a median of 9.8 years, tight control reduced the risk of the composite outcome of first heart attack, stroke, new or worsening congestive heart failure, amputation for ischaemic gangrene or cardiovascular‐related death (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.34–0.85). Interestingly, hazard ratios for all components of the primary outcome favoured tight control, yet none were statistically significant.

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial randomly assigned 10 251 subjects to tight glycemic control (HbA1c < 6%) or standard control (HbA1c of 7%–7.9%). On average, the study population had diabetes for 10 years at baseline and the tight control arm was stopped early after a median follow‐up of 3.5 years. The tight control arm received more frequent antihyperglycemic medication changes and more antihyperglycemic medications overall including key differences in rosiglitazone (91.2% vs. 58.3%) and any insulin (77.3% vs. 55.4%). Relatively few patients were on incretins at this time and the only incretin‐based therapies used were exenatide and sitagliptin. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors were not available at the time of this trial. The tight control group experienced more hypoglycaemia (3.1% vs. 1%), more weight gain (3.5 kg vs. 0.4 kg), more all‐cause death (5.0% vs. 4.0%; hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01–1.46) and more death from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04–1.76). Conversely, there was no increase in stroke risk, heart failure risk and tight control reduced nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.92).

### Effect of multifactorial treatment targets and relative importance of hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol on cardiovascular diseases in Chinese primary care patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a population-based retrospective cohort study [^115hhWwa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) remains a growing global health challenge. There are currently 415 million patients with DM worldwide, and this figure is predicted to increase to 642 million by 2040. 1 Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the dominant cause of mortality in diabetic populations, contributing to 70% of deaths. 2 The International Diabetes Federation and the American Diabetes Association strongly recommend maintaining optimal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), and low‐density lipoprotein‐cholesterol (LDL‐C) ("ABC") levels for the primary prevention of CVD. 3, 4 Unfortunately, achieving target levels of all ABC risk factors remains a significant challenge as has been reported in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe. 5, 6, 7, 8 The benefits of CVD risk reduction through better control of all 3 factors is beyond doubt, but little is known about the relative effects of controlling individual or various combinations of these risk factors in diabetic populations.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111sf3fo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, indications, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating insulin therapy in adult patients with T2DM with symptoms of hyperglycemia or very high HbA1c (> 10% or > 86 mmol/mol) or blood glucose levels (≥ 300 mg/dL or ≥ 16.7 mmol/L), regardless of background glucose-lowering therapy or disease stage.

### Epidemiologic relationships between A1c and all-cause mortality during a median 3.4-year follow-up of glycemic treatment in the ACCORD trial [^1155qcKK]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Randomized treatment comparing an intensive glycemic treatment strategy with a standard strategy in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial was ended early because of an unexpected excess of mortality in the intensive arm. As part of ongoing post hoc analyses of potential mechanisms for this finding, we explored whether on-treatment A1C itself had an independent relationship with mortality.

Research Design and Methods

Participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 10,251 with mean age 62 years, median duration of diabetes 10 years, and median A1C 8.1%) were randomly assigned to treatment strategies targeting either A1C < 6.0% (intensive) or A1C 7.0–7.9% (standard). Data obtained during 3.4 (median) years of follow-up before cessation of intensive treatment were analyzed using several multivariable models.

Results

Various characteristics of the participants and the study sites at baseline had significant associations with the risk of mortality. Before and after adjustment for these covariates, a higher average on-treatment A1C was a stronger predictor of mortality than the A1C for the last interval of follow-up or the decrease of A1C in the first year. Higher average A1C was associated with greater risk of death. The risk of death with the intensive strategy increased approximately linearly from 6–9% A1C and appeared to be greater with the intensive than with the standard strategy only when average A1C was > 7%.

Conclusions

These analyses implicate factors associated with persisting higher A1C levels, rather than low A1C per se, as likely contributors to the increased mortality risk associated with the intensive glycemic treatment strategy in ACCORD.

### Efficacy of antihyperglycemic therapies and the influence of baseline hemoglobin A (1C): a meta-analysis of the liraglutide development program [^113CCJoV]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare liraglutide versus common antihyperglycemic treatments in reducing hemoglobin A1c (A1C) values across multiple levels of baseline glycemic control and in reaching glycemic targets.

Methods

Pooled patient data from 7 phase 3, multinational, randomized controlled trials in patients with type 2 diabetes were stratified by baseline A1C values into 5 categories: ≤ 7.5%, > 7.5% to 8.0%, > 8.0% to 8.5%, > 8.5% to 9.0%, and y9.0%. The changes in A1C from baseline to week 26 of treatment and patient proportions reaching A1C targets of < 7.0% and ≤ 6.5% were compared between liraglutide (1.8 mg daily) and sitagliptin, glimepiride, rosiglit-azone, exenatide, and insulin glargine across all baseline A1C categories.

Results

Irrespective of treatment, reductions in A1C levels were generally greater in groups with higher baseline A1C values. After 26 weeks of treatment, liraglutide produced the greatest reductions in A1C values across all baseline categories, ranging from 0.7% to 1.8% (baseline A1C categories ≤ 7.5% to > 9.0%, respectively), followed by insulin glargine (0.3% to 1.5%) and then by glimepiride (0.4% to 1.3%). Generally, larger percentages of patients achieved the A1C target of ≤ 6.5% with liraglutide therapy across all baseline categories (from 62% of patients with A1C values ≤ 7.5% to 10% of patients with A1C values > 9.0%) in comparison with other treatments (ranging from 49% to 0% of patients, respectively). Similarly, greater proportions of patients also reached the A1C target of < 7.0% with liraglutide therapy across all baseline categories (from 83% of patients with A1C values ≤ 7.5% to 25% of patients with A1C values > 9.0%) versus comparators (from 74% to 5% of patients, respectively).

Conclusion

Across a wide spectrum of baseline A1C categories, liraglutide is an efficacious treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes.

AACE 2022 — insulin initiation and titration in type 2 diabetes: Start basal (long-acting) insulin with A1C < 8% at 0.1 to 0.2 units/kg and with A1C ≥ 8% at 0.2 to 0.3 units/kg; consider discontinuing sulfonylurea (SU) therapy, basal analogs preferred over Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH), and bedtime dose preferred. Titrate using a fixed regimen to increase by 2 units/d to reach glycemic goals, and monitor for hypoglycemia with dose reductions as follows: for blood glucose (BG) < 70 mg/dL reduce by 10% to 20% and for BG < 60 mg/dL reduce by 20% to 40%. For most persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) taking insulin, glucose goals are A1C < 7% and fasting and premeal blood glucose < 110 mg/dL in the absence of hypoglycemia.

### Second-line pharmaceutical treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes [^112JDMsi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control. However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands. When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required (1) between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required and level of commitment to the treatment. Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein-in terms of their convenience of measurement, usefulness and relevance to the physician and patient are also evaluated. When prioritising the variables to be measured it is suggested that where feasible, HbA(1c) should be the standard measurement by which to gauge risk and treatment efficacy. Serial measurements should be made and, where possible, the use of blood glucose meters encouraged, in order to obtain a blood glucose profile for the patient.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^117GAR1j]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are available in two fixed-ratio combinations (FRCs) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), insulin degludec with liraglutide and insulin glargine with lixisenatide. FRCs offer a convenient strategy to administer basal insulin and a GLP-1 RA, taking advantage of complementary mechanisms in a single injection to minimize treatment burden and improve glycemic control while mitigating weight gain. For most, a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) goal for patients with T2D using a FRC would be < 7%, though it can be adjusted based on patient-specific factors. An HbA1c goal of < 6.5% is less likely to be appropriate for patients requiring basal insulin, which is included in the FRCs. Ideal candidates for FRCs are those (1) taking oral antihyperglycemic medications only with an HbA1c < 10% and < 2% away from goal, (2) those on basal insulin and above HbA1c goal, (3) those unwilling or unable to initiate or manage multiple daily injections (i.e., basal-bolus insulin therapy) and (4) those tolerating a GLP-1 RA who require basal insulin to achieve glycemic goals.

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — Recommendation 12.2.1 states individualized pharmacotherapy for persons with T2D should be prescribed based on evidence for benefit that includes glucose lowering, avoidance of hypoglycemia and weight gain, and reduction of cardio-renal risk (Grade A; BEL 1). Recommendation 12.2.2 states persons with T2D and their health care professionals should use patient-centered shared decision-making to agree on therapy targets and treatments as well as a regimen for glucose monitoring (ie, BGM, structured BGM, or CGM) (Grade B; BEL 2). Recommendation 12.2.3 lists glycemic targets including A1C, BGM, and CGM metrics, and nonglycemic targets including avoidance of hypoglycemia plus control of BP, lipids, other CVD risk factors, and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight (Grade B; BEL 4). Recommendation 12.2.4 states that independent of glycemic control, targets, or treatment, if there is established or high risk for ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD, clinicians should prescribe a GLP-1 RA or an SGLT2i with proven efficacy for the specific condition(s) of the person with T2D being treated (Grade A; BEL 1). Recommendation 12.2.5 states DM therapy should be individualized based on level of glycemia and the presence of comorbidities, complications, and access; metformin is often the preferred initial therapy, and other agents may be appropriate as first line or in addition to metformin to reduce BG and/or to address specific comorbidities (such as ASCVD, HF, CKD, obesity, NAFLD), independent of glucose-lowering effects (Grade A; BEL 1).

### Effect of patients' risks and preferences on health gains with plasma glucose level lowering in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11179p6N]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is common, and treatment to correct blood glucose levels is standard. However, treatment burden starts years before treatment benefits accrue. Because guidelines often ignore treatment burden, many patients with diabetes may be overtreated.

Objective

To examine how treatment burden affects the benefits of intensive vs moderate glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We estimated the effects of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction on diabetes outcomes and overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using a Markov simulation model. Model probabilities were based on estimates from randomized trials and observational studies. Simulated patients were based on adult patients with type 2 diabetes drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study.

Interventions

Glucose lowering with oral agents or insulin in type 2 diabetes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were QALYs and reduction in risk of microvascular and cardiovascular diabetes complications.

Results

Assuming a low treatment burden (0.001, or 0.4 lost days per year), treatment that lowered HbA1c level by 1 percentage point provided benefits ranging from 0.77 to 0.91 QALYs for simulated patients who received a diagnosis at age 45 years to 0.08 to 0.10 QALYs for those who received a diagnosis at age 75 years. An increase in treatment burden (0.01, or 3.7 days lost per year) resulted in HbA1c level lowering being associated with more harm than benefit in those aged 75 years. Across all ages, patients who viewed treatment as more burdensome (0.025–0.05 disutility) experienced a net loss in QALYs from treatments to lower HbA1c level.

Conclusions and Relevance

Improving glycemic control can provide substantial benefits, especially for younger patients; however, for most patients older than 50 years with an HbA1c level less than 9% receiving metformin therapy, additional glycemic treatment usually offers at most modest benefits. Furthermore, the magnitude of benefit is sensitive to patients' views of the treatment burden, and even small treatment adverse effects result in net harm in older patients. The current approach of broadly advocating intensive glycemic control should be reconsidered; instead, treating patients with HbA1c levels less than 9% should be individualized on the basis of estimates of benefit weighed against the patient's views of the burdens of treatment.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, treatment monitoring, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to assess for potential precipitants of increasing HbA1c, such as infection, ischemia, concomitant medications, or changes in eating or physical activity, before intensifying pharmacologic therapy. Explore medication adherence and barriers to adherence, such as adverse drug effects, costs, beliefs, and preferences.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1158avd1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in the setting of insulin resistance and manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diabetes globally, with estimates ranging from 589 million to 828 million people worldwide. In the US, type 2 diabetes affects approximately 1 in 6 adults.

Observations

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, and American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Black race. Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, or 2-hour glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Approximately one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes have cardiovascular disease and 10.1% have severe vision difficulty or blindness. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 39.2% among patients with kidney failure. Although weight management is an important component of treatment for type 2 diabetes, no specific diet has been proven to be most effective for improving health outcomes. Physical activity can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.4% to 1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Randomized clinical trials have reported absolute reductions in microvascular disease (3.5%), such as retinopathy and nephropathy, myocardial infarction (3.3%-6.2%), and mortality (2.7%-4.9%), with intensive glucose-lowering strategies (hemoglobin A1C < 7%) vs conventional treatment 2 decades after trial completion. First-line medications for type 2 diabetes include metformin and, in patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities or at high cardiovascular risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Common add-on medications include dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes require treatment with insulin during their lifetime. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of specific SGLT2i and GLP-1RA medications compared with placebo for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (12%-26% risk reduction), heart failure (18%-25% risk reduction), and kidney disease (24%-39% risk reduction) over 2 to 5 years. Most trial participants with type 2 diabetes were taking metformin. High-potency GLP-1RA and dual GIP/GLP-1RA medications result in weight loss of greater than 5% in most individuals with type 2 diabetes, and weight loss may exceed 10%.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes affects up to 14% of the global population and is associated with preventable long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and increased mortality. In addition to lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, metformin is generally first-line therapy for attainment of hemoglobin A1C targets. For individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or kidney disease or at high cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend early treatment with SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA medications.
