## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of stage IV melanoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about staging and prognostic stratification. Then, I should verify the initial workup and imaging requirements. Next, I will classify disease as limited versus disseminated and outline treatment pathways accordingly. After that, I need to examine surgical metastasectomy candidacy and timing. Then, I will review systemic therapy options, including neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and first-line metastatic regimens, and reconcile guideline differences. I should also consider special populations such as brain metastases and BRAF-mutant disease. Finally, I will integrate multidisciplinary care, biomarkers, and follow-up, and close with a concise decision framework summary.

> Let me first confirm the staging and prognostic framework, because treatment hinges on AJCC 8th edition categories and LDH status. Stage IV melanoma is defined by distant metastases and is subclassified as M1a (skin, soft tissue, distant nodes), M1b (lung), and M1c (non-pulmonary visceral), with elevated LDH placing patients in the highest-risk M1c category, which independently predicts worse outcomes and should guide aggressiveness of therapy and trial consideration [^113PMbGS].

> Wait, let me verify the initial workup before committing to treatment. Pathologic confirmation of metastases is preferred when feasible, with core or excisional biopsy to enable molecular profiling, particularly BRAF, NRAS, and KIT, because results will shape targeted therapy and trial eligibility; brain MRI is recommended at baseline given the high incidence of asymptomatic CNS disease, and whole-body imaging with CT or PET/CT plus LDH establishes baseline burden and informs prognosis and surveillance planning [^113tKVYW] [^112i8MCJ] [^114tfEhF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy until I classify disease as limited (oligometastatic, potentially resectable) versus disseminated (unresectable or high-volume). NCCN distinguishes these categories because limited disease may benefit from local control plus systemic therapy, whereas disseminated disease is managed primarily with systemic therapy and palliative local measures; this distinction drives whether metastasectomy or ablation is appropriate and whether neoadjuvant strategies are considered [^116PB4jF] [^116DSZxn].

> I will now examine surgical metastasectomy candidacy, and I need to ensure I am precise about selection. Candidates generally have good performance status, low disease burden, and disease amenable to complete resection with negative margins; retrospective series and reviews suggest 5-year survival around 20–30% in highly selected patients, and contemporary practice integrates surgery with modern systemic therapy rather than using surgery in isolation, with surgery considered after systemic response or in oligoprogression to consolidate control [^113DfGxx] [^116GJVGf] [^116PB4jF].

> Let me think about neoadjuvant therapy, because this is where guidelines diverge and I should reconcile them carefully. ASCO recommends neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (three doses) followed by resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab (up to 15 doses) for resectable stage IIIB–IV disease based on event-free survival benefits, whereas ESMO 2025 prioritizes clinical trial enrollment, metastasectomy or local ablation followed by adjuvant anti–PD-1, or anti–PD-1 monotherapy, and also allows nivolumab–ipilimumab in selected resected stage IV patients; NCCN supports multidisciplinary evaluation and allows either upfront resection or systemic therapy with reassessment for surgery, reflecting the absence of mature OS data and variability in trial designs [^112BBJsk] [^1169hHum] [^114FCmp2] [^111pzVbe] [^116PB4jF].

> Next, I should review adjuvant therapy options after complete resection, and I need to check which agents have the strongest evidence. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab improve recurrence-free survival and distant metastasis–free survival in resected stage III–IV melanoma, with nivolumab also showing superiority to ipilimumab in CheckMate 238; dabrafenib plus trametinib is an alternative for BRAF V600–mutant disease, though OS benefits in the adjuvant setting remain debated and long-term data continue to mature [^111zHV32] [^11589SqV] [^1178XDMG].

> For disseminated, unresectable disease, I should confirm first-line systemic therapy standards. Ipilimumab plus nivolumab achieves the highest response rates and durable survival in approximately 40–50% of patients but carries higher toxicity; nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy offers meaningful activity with a more favorable safety profile; BRAF V600–mutant patients can receive targeted therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib for rapid responses, though durability may be inferior to immunotherapy in some contexts, and sequencing should be individualized [^111qJwhR] [^115obGb3].

> But wait, what if the patient has brain metastases? I should double-check the approach. Historically, brain metastases carried poor prognosis, yet modern immunotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery have improved outcomes; management is multimodal with SRS for limited lesions, whole-brain radiotherapy for bulky or numerous lesions, and systemic therapy including nivolumab–ipilimumab or anti–PD-1 with careful neurologic monitoring, as extracranial disease burden and LDH remain key prognostic factors [^112wUHhD] [^112i8MCJ].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and biomarkers. For elderly or comorbid patients, monotherapy or targeted options may mitigate toxicity; for BRAF-mutant disease, targeted therapy is reasonable when rapid disease control is needed, while immunotherapy may confer more durable responses in others; emerging biomarkers such as TMB, interferon-γ signatures, and circulating factors like LDH and IL-8 may inform selection, but they are not yet practice-changing and should be interpreted within trials when possible [^112kbwsa] [^1115BgQQ].

> Next, I should review multidisciplinary care and follow-up, because coordination changes outcomes. All patients with stage IV melanoma should have MDT review to integrate surgery, systemic therapy, radiology, and supportive care; surveillance includes regular clinical exams and imaging tailored to risk, with brain MRI considered at intervals in higher-risk patients; patient-reported outcomes and toxicity management should be embedded early to preserve quality of life and maintain therapy adherence [^116PB4jF] [^112i8MCJ].

> Let me reconsider the decision framework to ensure internal consistency. Limited disease warrants MDT assessment for metastasectomy or ablation, with consideration of neoadjuvant immunotherapy per ASCO or systemic therapy followed by reassessment per NCCN, and adjuvant anti–PD-1 or targeted therapy after complete resection; disseminated disease is managed with first-line immunotherapy or targeted therapy, with local palliation for symptomatic sites; throughout, clinical trials should be prioritized when available to access evolving neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and combination strategies [^112BBJsk] [^116PB4jF] [^114FCmp2].

> In summary, I should confirm that the plan aligns with high-quality evidence and guidelines: stage IV melanoma management is individualized by disease burden, resectability, BRAF status, performance, and patient preferences, with surgery integrated selectively, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab supported by ASCO for resectable disease, adjuvant nivolumab or pembrolizumab standard after resection, and first-line ipilimumab–nivolumab or anti–PD-1 monotherapy for unresectable disease, all within MDT oversight and with attention to toxicity, access, and equity considerations [^112BBJsk] [^111zHV32] [^111qJwhR] [^116PB4jF].

Stage IV melanoma is defined by **distant metastases** and has a **5-year survival of 10–20%** [^111qJwhR], though modern immunotherapy and targeted therapy have improved outcomes [^111qJwhR]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with systemic therapy as the cornerstone [^116PB4jF]; immunotherapy (anti–PD-1 ± CTLA-4) is first-line for most, and BRAF/MEK inhibitors are used for BRAF-mutant disease [^115obGb3]. Metastasectomy is considered for oligometastatic disease or to palliate symptoms [^116PB4jF]. Prognosis depends on metastatic site, LDH, and performance status [^115pGtPL]; brain metastases and elevated LDH portend worse survival [^112wUHhD]. Clinical trials and biomarker-driven strategies are essential to optimize outcomes [^111c9VsQ].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Stage IV melanoma presents with **distant metastases** — most commonly to the skin, lymph nodes, lungs, liver, bone, and brain [^115pGtPL]. Diagnosis relies on:

- **Imaging**: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; brain MRI; PET/CT as indicated [^113tKVYW].
- **Biopsy**: Confirmation of metastases and molecular profiling (BRAF, NRAS, KIT) [^113tKVYW].
- **Laboratory tests**: LDH is a key prognostic marker [^115pGtPL].

---

## Prognostic factors

Prognosis varies with **metastatic site**, **LDH level**, and **performance status** [^115pGtPL]:

| **Prognostic factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Metastatic site | - Skin/soft tissue: better <br/> - Visceral: worse [^115pGtPL] |
| LDH level | Elevated LDH: worse [^115pGtPL] |
| Performance status | ECOG ≥ 2: worse [^notfound] |
| Number of metastases | Fewer: better [^notfound] |

---

## Treatment options

### Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy is the **cornerstone of treatment** [^116PB4jF]:

- **Immunotherapy**: Anti–PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) ± CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) is first-line for most patients [^115obGb3].
- **Targeted therapy**: BRAF/MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib) for BRAF V600–mutant disease [^114USydC].
- **Chemotherapy**: Limited role; reserved for refractory cases [^notfound].

---

### Surgical metastasectomy

Metastasectomy is considered for **oligometastatic disease** or to palliate symptoms; it can improve survival in carefully selected patients [^113DfGxx] [^116PB4jF].

---

### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is used for **palliation**, particularly for bone or brain metastases, and for symptom control [^116PB4jF].

---

## Emerging therapies and clinical trials

Clinical trials are essential for **advancing care**. Key areas include:

- **Neoadjuvant immunotherapy**: Promising in early-phase trials [^111YGqNk].
- **Combination therapies**: Immunotherapy plus targeted agents [^notfound].
- **Biomarker-driven strategies**: TMB, PD-L1, and ctDNA to guide therapy [^112kbwsa].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Regular follow-up is critical for **early detection of recurrence** [^notfound]. Typical surveillance includes:

- **Imaging**: Every 3–6 months for 2 years, then annually.
- **Clinical exams**: Every 3–6 months.
- **Laboratory tests**: LDH and liver function tests [^notfound].

---

## Quality of life and supportive care

Stage IV melanoma significantly affects **quality of life** [^1124dqPu]. Supportive care focuses on:

- **Symptom management**: Pain, fatigue, and psychological support.
- **Palliative care**: Early integration to improve quality of life.
- **Patient education**: Empowering patients to manage symptoms and adhere to therapy [^notfound].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include **immune checkpoint inhibitors**, which have improved survival [^111qJwhR]; **targeted therapies** such as BRAF/MEK inhibitors for BRAF-mutant disease [^114USydC]; and **personalized medicine** using biomarkers to tailor therapy [^112kbwsa]. Future directions include novel immunotherapies, combination strategies, and improved biomarker integration [^112kbwsa].

---

Stage IV melanoma is advanced disease with heterogeneous prognosis; **modern immunotherapy and targeted therapy** have improved survival, and management should be individualized within a multidisciplinary framework [^116PB4jF].

### Surgical treatment options for stage IV melanoma [^115CEUjk]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Melanomas have unique tumor biology and unpredictable patterns of metastasis. Metastatic melanoma is classified based on the location of metastasis. Surgical resection of metastatic melanoma may be performed for curative or palliative intent. In carefully selected patients, there is a survival benefit to metastasectomy. Candidates for surgical resection generally have favorable prognostic factors. Targeted biologic therapies and immunomodulatory therapies are promising new treatments associated with improved progression-free and overall survival. In the setting of new, effective medical therapies, further study is needed to determine how best to combine nonsurgical and surgical treatments for stage IV melanoma.

### Metastasectomy for stage IV melanoma [^116J5zD7]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Metastatic melanoma has an unpredictable natural history but a predictably high mortality. Despite recent advances in systemic therapy, many patients do not respond, or develop resistance to drug therapy. Surgery has consistently shown good outcomes in appropriately selected patients. It is likely to be even more successful in the era of more effective medical treatment. Surgery should remain a strongly considered option for metastatic melanoma.

### Metastasectomy for stage IV melanoma: for whom and how much? [^116QiHY2]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Although the conventional paradigm for treating metastatic melanoma relies on systemic therapies, a surgical approach should be strongly considered in selected patients. A surgical approach may not be appropriate for all patients, but it can offer a rapid clearance of disease without the toxicity of systemic therapy. Patient selection is of paramount importance for surgery to be effective. The rationale for surgical intervention in the management of metastatic melanoma, selection factors to be considered, published results, and future directions are discussed in this article.

### Where are we with adjuvant therapy of stage III and IV melanoma in 2009? [^114PhoGT]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Adjuvant therapy options for advanced melanoma in 2009 remain active observation, high-dose interferon, or clinical trial participation. Close observation is currently the only required adjuvant management, with the purpose of detecting the emergence of regional or metastatic disease early, when surgical management may still be possible. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the workup and follow-up of all stages of melanoma must be tailored to specific patients by the treating physician. This article explores the factors to consider when individualizing care within the scope of these guidelines.

### Adjuvant therapy for melanoma [^111X68Uy]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, effective systemic therapies have emerged for patients with metastatic melanoma. These therapies have also made their way to the perioperative setting, demonstrating improved recurrence-free survival for subsets of individuals with stage III and IV disease that received therapy after having undergone surgical resection. While adjuvant therapy is recommended for certain patients with stage II, III, and IV disease, patient selection can be nuanced. Adjuvant therapies are not without their own risks, and an individual's ability to tolerate treatment must be weighed. We review key adjuvant therapy trials, recommendations for its use in contemporary practice, and future directions.

### Complete metastasectomy in patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma [^113DfGxx]. The Lancet: Oncology (2006). Medium credibility.

Patients with stage IV melanoma have traditionally been managed with various systemic treatments; however, overall survival with this approach has been disappointing. Findings of many retrospective, single-institution, and multicentre studies suggest that participants treated with complete metastasectomy for stage IV metastases have enhanced overall 5-year survival. Complete surgical resection of metastatic disease to stage IV sites-including skin, soft tissue, distant lymph nodes, lungs, or other non-CNS visceral regions-offers the best chance for prolonged survival. This Review will present data lending support to the idea that if complete surgical metastasectomy is technically feasible, then surgery should be the first option for properly selected patients with stage IV melanoma.

### Surgical treatment of stage IV melanoma [^114fxZVf]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Surgical therapy plays an important role in the management of selected patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients are frequently symptomatic from metastatic lesions, have few effective therapeutic options, and are faced with dismal outcomes. Surgical resection may provide successful palliation of symptomatic lesions with low morbidity and operative mortality. In carefully selected patients, resections performed with curative intent may result in improved survival if a pattern of disease recurrence suggestive of favorable tumor biology is present, and if complete resection of tumor is achieved. Because the majority of post-surgical metastatic patients eventually relapse and succumb to distant disease, adjuvant immunotherapeutic strategies are currently being evaluated.

### Role of surgery in stage IV melanoma [^116GJVGf]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Stage IV melanoma has a 5-year survival rate of 6%, but considerable advances have been made in systemic therapies. Systemic immunotherapy has achieved durable responses in up to 40% of patients, with similar improvements with targeted therapies. This has reshaped the landscape for surgery in stage IV melanoma. Metastasectomy can be considered in patients on systemic immunotherapy or targeted therapy with responding, stable, or isolated progressing lesions, oligometastatic disease, or long disease-free intervals. Surgery plays a role in providing tumor tissue for preparation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapy. Surgical palliation plays a role in patients with symptomatic metastases.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^116PB4jF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Distant metastatic melanoma management emphasizes that multidisciplinary tumor board consultation is encouraged for stage IV metastatic melanoma, and treatment depends on whether disease is limited (resectable) or disseminated (unresectable). For limited metastatic disease, options include resection or systemic therapy, and observation is no longer a recommended option; systemic treatment should be followed by repeat scans to better select patients for surgical intervention. Following systemic therapy, patients with resectable disease should be reassessed for surgery, and if completely resected with no evidence of disease (NED) they can be observed or offered adjuvant treatment; patients with residual disease after incomplete resection should be treated as disseminated disease. For disseminated disease, management can include clinical trial, systemic therapy, local treatment, or best supportive care. For extracranial metastases, local treatment options may include intralesional T-VEC, resection, or radiation; T-VEC can be injected into nodal or distant metastases to help with disease control, but the impact on survival is not known and it may be useful for patients with very limited stage IV disease or in combination with other modalities. Symptomatic extracranial metastases can be managed with palliative resection and/or radiation, and radiation can be used for palliation of visceral, bone, and CNS metastases.

### Randomized trials in melanoma: an update [^113Cunu7]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

No effective therapy for metastatic melanoma exists. Polychemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy have not shown survival benefits. Vaccines have shown little activity in stage IV disease. To advance the identification of effective agents, new drugs can and should be offered as first-line treatment. Efforts must be made to improve understanding of the biology of malignant melanoma. Too many phase III trials have been conducted with a poor understanding of the mechanism of action of the involved drugs.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 Melanoma: Cutaneous — Clinical characterization of metastatic disease notes that among patients with distant metastatic melanoma (stage IV), the site of metastases is the most significant predictor of outcome. The AJCC risk categories are skin, soft tissue, and remote nodes (M1a); visceral-pulmonary (M1b); and visceral-nonpulmonary (M1c). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an independent predictor of poor outcome in stage IV disease and places patients with distant metastases and elevated LDH in the highest risk category (M1c). Prognosis has improved with effective systemic therapies associated with improved overall survival (OS) and long-term survival in some patients.

Despite advances in early detection as described in part 1 of this continuing medical education series, melanoma continues to be a large contributor to cutaneous cancer-related mortality. In a subset of patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, surgical clearance is often not possible; therefore, systemic and local therapies are considered. The second article in this series provides dermatologists with an up-to-date working knowledge of the treatment options that may be prescribed by oncologists for patients with unresectable stage III, stage IV, and recurrent melanoma.

Conclusions

Following the promising results of new systemic therapies in stage IV disease, these are currently being investigated in phase II and III trials in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Neoadjuvant therapy has several potential advantages, including a possibility of decreased surgical morbidity, prevention of micrometastases, personalization of adjuvant therapy based on the response to neoadjuvant therapy, and the opportunity to collect biospecimens for evaluation of the underlying mechanisms of action and drug resistance. In metastatic disease, new strategies are desired for patients with poorer prognostic factors at baseline.

### Management options for metastatic melanoma in the era of novel therapies: a primer for the practicing dermatologist: part I: management of stage III disease [^1157w1mB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of melanoma has increased for decades, and while surgical treatment of early stage disease is often curative, metastatic disease continues to carry a significantly less promising outlook with high associated health burden and economic cost. An expanding number of dermatologists are playing a key role in coordinating the care of patients with melanoma, including in an increasingly important role among multidisciplinary melanoma clinics, many of which are anchored in dermatology departments. Advances in the understanding of the genetic and immunoregulatory aspects of melanoma development and progression have yielded a wave of novel therapeutics that has made significant impact on the approach to patients with metastatic disease. Frequently updated management guidelines and unfamiliarity with approved adjuvant treatment options, including interferon, clinical trials, or radiation therapy, can pose a challenge for dermatologists seeking to effectively coordinate the care of and establish proper expectations for patients with stage III disease. Moreover, greater awareness of treatment modalities for in-transit disease may allow dermatologists to play a more active role in the treatment of these patients and to expand their ability to explain and coordinate options, such as limb perfusion or infusion. Part I of this continuing medical education article will use clinical scenarios to outline the current management options for patients with stage III melanoma, including both adjuvant treatment options for resected stage III disease and primary treatment options for in-transit metastases. Part II of this series will address stage IV disease.

### Neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma [^111YGqNk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cutaneous melanoma is amongst the most aggressive of all skin cancers. Neoadjuvant treatment is a form of induction therapy, given to shrink a cancerous tumour prior to the main treatment (usually surgery). The purpose is to improve survival and surgical outcomes. This review systematically appraises the literature investigating the use of neoadjuvant treatment for stage III and IV cutaneous melanoma.

Objectives

To assess the effects of neoadjuvant treatment in adults with stage III or stage IV melanoma according to the seventh edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 10 August 2021 inclusive: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and four trials registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We also handsearched proceedings from specific conferences from 2016 to 2020 inclusive.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with stage III and IV melanoma, comparing neoadjuvant treatment strategies (using targeted treatments, immunotherapies, radiotherapy, topical treatments or chemotherapy) with any of these agents or current standard of care (SOC), were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AEs). Secondary outcomes included time to recurrence (TTR), quality of life (QOL), and overall response rate (ORR). We used GRADE to evaluate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs involving 402 participants. Studies enrolled adults, mostly with stage III melanoma, investigated immunotherapies, chemotherapy, or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgical excision with or without adjuvant treatment. Duration of follow-up and therapeutic regimens varied, which, combined with heterogeneity in the population and definitions of the endpoints, precluded meta-analysis of all identified studies. We performed a meta-analysis including three studies. We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.21; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Neoadjuvant treatment may increase the rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (26% versus 16%, risk ratio (RR) 1.58, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.55; 2 studies, 162 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases TTR (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Studies did not report ORR as a comparative outcome or measure QOL data. We are very uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib increases OS (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1 study, 21 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or TTR (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22; 1 study, 21 participants; very low-certainty evidence) when compared to surgery. The study did not report comparative rates of AEs and overall response, and did not measure QOL. We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant immunotherapy with talimogene laherparepvec increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.64; 1 study, 150 participants, very low-certainty evidence). It may have a higher rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (16.5% versus 5.8%, RR 2.84, 95% CI 0.96 to 8.37; 1 study, 142 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if it increases TTR (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.79; 1 study, 150 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure QOL. OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab as adjuvant treatment. There may be little or no difference in the rate of AEs between these treatments (9%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.34; 1 study, 20 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure TTR and QOL. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) likely results in little to no difference in OS when compared to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy (P = 0.18; 1 study, 23 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It may increase the rate of AEs, but the certainty of this evidence is very low (72.8% versus 8.3%, RR 8.73, 95% CI 1.29 to 59; 1 study, 23 participants); this trial was halted early due to observation of disease progression preventing surgical resection in the monotherapy arm and the high rate of treatment-related AEs in the combination arm. Neoadjuvant combination treatment may lead to higher ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (72.8% versus 25%, RR 2.91, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.27; 1 study, 23 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It likely results in little to no difference in TTR (P = 0.19; 1 study, 23 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure QOL. OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to neoadjuvant sequential immunotherapy (ipilimumab then nivolumab). Only Grade 3 to 4 immune-related AEs were reported; fewer were reported with combination treatment, and the sequential treatment arm closed early due to a high incidence of severe AEs. The neoadjuvant combination likely results in a higher ORR compared to sequential neoadjuvant treatment (60.1% versus 42.3%, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.32; 1 study, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure TTR and QOL. No data were reported on OS, AEs, TTR, or QOL for the comparison of neoadjuvant interferon (HDI) plus chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant HDI plus chemotherapy may have little to no effect on ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (33% versus 22%, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 4.95; 1 study, 36 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS or TTR compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, and it may be associated with a slightly higher rate of AEs. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of neoadjuvant treatment in clinical practice. Priorities for research include the development of a core outcome set for neoadjuvant trials that are adequately powered, with validation of pathological and radiological responses as intermediate endpoints, to investigate the relative benefits of neoadjuvant treatment compared with adjuvant treatment with immunotherapies or targeted therapies.

### Intratumoural immunotherapies for unresectable and metastatic melanoma: current status and future perspectives [^113XWaG1]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The standard of care for patients with melanoma whose tumour burden is limited and disease spread is confined comprises surgical resection with the intention to cure. In approximately two-thirds of all cases of primary cutaneous melanoma, disease spread begins with locoregional metastasis, with about 50% of patients developing the first metastasis in regional lymph nodes. Satellite or in-transit metastases also frequently occur at readily accessible cutaneous or subcutaneous locations. – Although resection still, theoretically, remains an option in such cases, repeated surgery for locoregional disease might not be the best approach for patients with disease affecting a large anatomic area, for those in whom relapse occurs rapidly following repeated surgery, or for those in whom the morbidity of surgery might outweigh the benefits. In these, and other, patients with unresectable melanoma, the approval of targeted therapies (such as inhibitors of BRAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase [MEK]) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs; such as anti-programmed death receptor 1 [PD-1] and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4] agents) has revolutionised outcomes — with CPI treatment, around one-third of patients survive at least 5 years. – However, the treatments can result in severe and long-lasting toxicities, and primary or acquired resistance are common. – Furthermore, because most Phase 3 trials assessing targeted therapies or CPIs have predominately enrolled patients with stage IV disease, limited efficacy data are available for these agents in the treatment of unresectable stage IIIB–C locoregional melanoma. –

### Cost-effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibition in BRAF wild-type advanced melanoma [^1164tJmW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Patients who are diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma have an estimated 5-year relative survival rate of only 17%. Randomized controlled trials of recent US Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors-pembrolizumab (PEM), nivolumab (NIVO), and ipilumumab (IPI)-demonstrate improved patient outcomes, but the optimal treatment sequence in patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma remains unclear. To inform policy makers about the value of these treatments, we developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for sequencing novel agents for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Materials and Methods We developed Markov models by using a US-payer perspective and lifetime horizon to estimate costs (2016 US$) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for treatment sequences with first-line NIVO, IPI, NIVO + IPI, PEM every 2 weeks, and PEM every 3 weeks. Health states were defined for initial treatment, first and second progression, and death. Rates for drug discontinuation, frequency of adverse events, disease progression, and death obtained from randomized phase III trials were used to determine the likelihood of transition between states. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty. Results PEM every 3 weeks followed by second-line IPI was both more effective and less costly than dacarbazine followed by IPI then NIVO, or IPI followed by NIVO. Compared with the first-line dacarbazine treatment strategy, NIVO followed by IPI produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $90,871/QALY, and first-line NIVO + IPI followed by carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $198,867/QALY. Conclusion For patients with treatment-naive BRAF wild-type advanced melanoma, first-line PEM every 3 weeks followed by second-line IPI or first-line NIVO followed by second-line IPI are the most cost-effective, immune-based treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma.

### The age of enlightenment in melanoma immunotherapy [^112Jgiwh]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Unprecedented treatment advances for patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma have occurred in the past few years. Consensus guidelines are available for treating metastatic melanoma patients with immunotherapy options currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) including high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2), ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab, and talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC; for patients with accessible lesions). We now have report of a 3-year OS rate of 63% in 94 patients with measurable, unresectable stage III or IV melanoma who received ipilimumab and nivolumab as concurrent therapy. In contrast, a 1-year OS rate of 25.5% was provided in a 2008 meta-analysis of 42 phase II cooperative group trials (70 trial arms) as a reference point for future phase II metastatic melanoma studies. As phase 1 studies historically overestimate survival rates, the magnitude of recent advanced melanoma treatment progress is perhaps best appreciated by comparing treatment options for patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma in 2018 with treatment options for similar patients before the year 2011. The treatment options before 2011 included dacarbazine (DTIC), an alkylating agent approved by the US FDA in 1975 for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The efficacy of DTIC in metastatic melanoma was low, without a confirmed survival benefit, and with a transient response realized in only 10–20% of patients. While many other chemotherapeutic agents were also tested in metastatic melanoma, none achieved a meaningful survival benefit over DTIC alone. Cytokine-based therapy with high dose bolus IL-2, pioneered by Dr. Steven Rosenberg (Chief, Surgery Branch and Head, Tumor Immunology Section; National Cancer Institute), provided insights about the host immune response to cancer and was shown to have an overall response rate of 16% and a 6% complete response rate in metastatic melanoma. However, treatment with high dose IL-2 had severe toxicity and was limited to excellent performance status patients at specialized treatment centers with expertise in managing severe high dose IL-2 associated toxicities. While participation in an appropriate clinical trial offered a theoretical basis for clinical benefit, that benefit was not often achieved in the pre-immunotherapy era. The unmet need to successfully translate lab insights into the melanoma clinic for most metastatic melanoma patients, metaphorically speaking, represented a "dark ages" for treatment of advanced melanoma. The historical Dark Ages is generally considered to be a period of intellectual depression in the history of Europe during the Middle Ages. The "dark ages" of melanoma immunotherapy can be considered to include that period before the year 2011 when few effective systemic treatments were available in the clinic for metastatic melanoma patients. The prognosis was poor, medical management had limited impact on that poor prognosis, and outcomes were almost universally fatal. As summarized in a 2011 metastatic melanoma overview and update, "the standard of care for patients with metastatic melanoma has not changed significantly in the past 20 years and new strategies for treatment of metastatic melanoma are urgently needed". However, the beginning of a new age in melanoma therapy was also predicted as "significant insights have recently been gained into the molecular events underpinning the development of melanoma. A number of novel compounds designed to target these molecular events, as well as monoclonal antibodies to key immune regulatory functions, have been developed and used in clinical trials. The results of these trials hold great promise for the treatment of subsets of patients with metastatic melanoma". The identification of driver mutations and genetic aberrations in melanoma allowed for the development of therapies with drugs targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (BRAF and MEK inhibitors). This translational insight has greatly advanced the care of metastatic melanoma patients with BRAF mutations and is reviewed elsewhere. The evolution of practice-changing advances in melanoma immunotherapy are discussed here.

### Rapidly evolving pre-and post-surgical systemic treatment of melanoma [^112kbwsa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

With the development of effective BRAF-targeted and immune-checkpoint immunotherapies for metastatic melanoma, clinical trials are moving these treatments into earlier adjuvant and perioperative settings. BRAF-targeted therapy is a standard of care in resected stage III-IV melanoma, while anti-programmed death-1 (PD1) immunotherapy is now a standard of care option in resected stage IIB through IV disease. With both modalities, recurrence-free survival and distant-metastasis-free survival are improved by a relative 35–50%, yet no improvement in overall survival has been demonstrated. Neoadjuvant anti-PD1 therapy improves event-free survival by approximately an absolute 23%, although improvements in overall survival have yet to be demonstrated. Understanding which patients are most likely to recur and which are most likely to benefit from treatment is now the highest priority question in the field. Biomarker analyses, such as gene expression profiling of the primary lesion and circulating DNA, are preliminarily exciting as potential biomarkers, though each has drawbacks. As in the setting of metastatic disease, markers that inform positive outcomes include interferon-γ gene expression, PD-L1, and high tumor mutational burden, while negative predictors of outcome include circulating factors such as lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-8, and C-reactive protein. Integrating and validating these markers into clinically relevant models is thus a high priority. Melanoma therapeutics continues to advance with combination adjuvant approaches now investigating anti-PD1 with lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), and individualized neoantigen therapies. How this progress will be integrated into the management of a unique patient to reduce recurrence, limit toxicity, and avoid over-treatment will dominate clinical research and patient care over the next decade.

Melanoma: Cutaneous — stage IV workup includes pathologic confirmation and targeted testing with imaging and laboratory recommendations. For patients presenting with stage IV distant metastatic disease, all panel members agree it is appropriate to confirm the suspicion with either FNA or core, incisional, or excisional biopsy of the metastases, and genetic analyses (eg, BRAF or KIT mutation status) are appropriate when considering targeted therapy or clinical trial eligibility; to ensure adequate metastatic material, biopsy (core, excisional, or incisional) is preferred if initial therapy is to be systemic and archival tissue is not available, although brain metastases are typically treated without histologic confirmation. Panelists encourage baseline chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with or without PET/CT in patients with stage IV melanoma, and because of a high incidence of brain metastases, brain MRI or CT with contrast should be performed at presentation; brain MRI is also recommended if patients have even minimal symptoms or physical findings suggestive of CNS involvement, or if imaging results would affect treatment decisions. Although LDH is not a sensitive marker for detecting metastatic disease, its prognostic value is recognized, and it is recommended that serum LDH be obtained at diagnosis of stage IV disease, with other blood work at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Changes in health care costs, survival, and time toxicity in the era of immunotherapy and targeted systemic therapy for melanoma [^1124dqPu]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this population-level, value-based cohort study, there was a significant increase in mean per-person health care costs over time, largely due to the high costs of immunotherapies and targeted systemic therapies for the treatment of advanced and metastatic melanoma. Additionally, there was continued high time toxicity in patients with stage IV melanoma. These results suggest the importance of early detection, as early-stage (stage II) melanoma was associated with much lower per-person health care utilization costs as well as improved prognosis. Furthermore, these results highlight the value trade-off of these new effective systemic therapies in which there is a greater economic burden to the health care system and time burden to patients with stage IV disease but with associated improvements in patient survival. These findings have broad implications for other cancers and other health care systems for which immunotherapies and targeted therapies are funded and are used more frequently across numerous cancer types.

### Management of localized melanoma in the anti-PD-1 era [^114XoJxb]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Introduction

The management of cutaneous melanoma has rapidly progressed over the past decade following the introduction of effective systemic therapies. Despite this, the worldwide burden of disease remains high, particularly in populations with fair-skinned individuals of European descent and is expected to rise over the coming decade. Therefore, the appropriate integration of these novel therapies into current treatment algorithms is crucial to improve survival outcomes for melanoma patients.

The role of effective systemic therapies such as PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and BRAF directed targeted therapy (TT) is now well established, both in unresectable stage III and metastatic stage IV (together also known as 'advanced') melanoma, as well as in the adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma with a reduced risk of recurrence and improved distant metastasis-free survival. However, the role of these agents in earlier stages (I-II) melanoma, both in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings is still developing. The initial success of systemic therapies has also prompted debate about the changing role of surgery in the management cutaneous melanoma, particularly regarding surgical margins, lymph node staging and the role of nodal dissection. This has led to a paradigm shift in management from radical surgery with wide margins and extensive lymphadenectomy, to a more multi-disciplinary approach with narrower margins and de-escalated nodal surgery when combined with systemic therapies, to minimise morbidity and improve disease outcomes.

This review aims to discuss the current management of early (stage I-II) and regionally metastatic (stage III) cutaneous melanoma in the era of effective systemic therapy and to discuss future trends in this evolving field.

Fig. 3
Stage III N1b-3 (AJCC 7th)/Stage IIIB-D (AJCC 8th) melanoma immunotherapy treatment algorithm. The consensus of the panel was to separate Stage III N1a (based on AJCC 7th edition) and Stage IIIA (AJCC 8th) from other Stage III subsets based on lower risk of metastatic potential. However, a minority (30%) felt that all Stage III subsets should be treated similarly. All treatment options shown may be appropriate and final selection of therapy should be individualized based on patient eligibility and treatment availability at the physician's discretion. These algorithms represent consensus sequencing suggestions by the panel. (1) There are limited data on the role of adjuvant therapy following sentinel lymphadenectomy alone. (2) After evaluation by multi-disciplinary team with surgical oncology, if complete resection is possible patients should undergo resection followed by adjuvant therapy listed. If the tumor is considered unresectable, a different treatment paradigm should be followed. (3) In patients with Stage IIIB-IV resected melanoma, there is Level A evidence supporting the use of nivolumab over ipilimumab and pembrolizumab over placebo for stage IIIB-C and IIA patients with micrometastases > 1 mm. Accordingly, nivolumab or pembrolizumab were supported by 46% of the panel. (4) Ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg was supported by a minority of panelists (8.3%). (5) There is Level A evidence to support the use the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutant, Stage III melanoma. (6) While there are Level A data that 1 year interferon-α2b is associated with improvement in RFS, no panelists recommended considering this therapy for this patient population. (7) Overall, the majority of panelists recommended a clinical trial, if available. (8) The majority of the panelists have had experience with T-VEC, and half of respondents said they would recommend T-VEC for first-line treatment for limited disease burden, and a significant minority (39%) would consider T-VEC for patients with locoregional disease. (9) Unresectable disease could be managed by options available for stage IV patients (see Fig. 4).

### Neoadjuvant therapy: changes in the management of macroscopic stage III / resectable stage IV melanoma [^115Qe6dd]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Existing adjuvant therapies improve outcomes for resected stage III and IV melanoma patients but fail in almost half to prevent recurrence and death. Large, multi-institution, randomized studies firmly establish the superiority of neoadjuvant to adjuvant therapy alone. Checkpoint inhibition, either anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monotherapy or combination with CTLA-4/LAG-3 blockage, demonstrates more durable event-free survival compared to targeted or targeted/immunotherapy combination therapies. Novel combinations of intralesional immunotherapies and other agents aim to increase clinical efficacy and limit toxicity of therapies. Pathologic response to treatment remains as the best prognostic surrogate for clinical outcomes for patients.

### Novel adjuvant options for cutaneous melanoma [^111K87zC]. Annals of Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma have a high risk of recurrence. As the outcomes for patients with metastatic disease have improved dramatically over the past decade due to systemic therapy, more recently so too have the outcomes of patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma with the introduction of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy and targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting.

Materials and Methods

This review outlines the latest clinical trial data, the current adjuvant treatment landscape and its application to clinical practice and expected future progress for the management of early-stage melanoma.

Results

Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monotherapy and BRAF/MEK inhibitors are currently deemed standard of care for resected stage III melanoma. For patients with stage IIIB [American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system version 7 (AJCCv7)] melanoma, 2-year and 3-year recurrence-free survival is approximately 72% and 65% for nivolumab, 70% and 65.7% for pembrolizumab and 68% and 60% for dabrafenib/trametinib, respectively. For stage IIIC (AJCCv7) melanoma, 2-year and 3-year recurrence-free survival is 60% and 53.5% for nivolumab, 60% and 54.3% for pembrolizumab and 59% and 47% for dabrafenib/trametinib, respectively. Adjuvant treatment is recommended for patients with stage IIIB-IIID [AJCC staging system version 8 (AJCCv8)] melanoma, and may be considered for patients with stage IIIA melanoma. For resected stage IV, nivolumab is the only approved agent; however, recent results from a phase II clinical trial show promising efficacy for combined ipilimumab and nivolumab as well. Long-term data are required to determine which therapy has the greatest impact on overall survival. Schedules, delivery and toxicity are also important factors to consider when selecting adjuvant treatment.

Conclusions

Randomized studies of patients with resected high-risk melanoma have shown that immunotherapy or targeted therapy improve recurrence-free survival compared with placebo/ipilimumab. In order to optimize these treatments, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as strategies to reduce treatment-related toxicities and overcome resistance, are required.

### Advances and perspectives in immunotherapy of melanoma [^115XnErM]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Immunotherapy using unspecific modulators has a long tradition in the adjuvant treatment of stage II/III melanoma. Interferon has shown a consistent effect on relapse-free survival independent of interferon dosage and duration. The results of the american Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Melanoma Staging Database analysis led to a strict inclusion of additional prognostic risk factors such as ulceration of the primary and microscopic lymph node involvement explored by the sentinel node biopsy in the revised 2009 AJCC classification. These factors are now being increasingly included as stratification factors into clinical trials and yield a new hypothesis that primarily patients with both characteristics benefit from adjuvant interferon treatment. In the metastatic situation, interleukin-2 is the only immunotherapeutic agent approved by the Food and Drug administration. In combination with interferon and/or with various chemotherapeutic agents, IL-2 is associated with substantial toxic effect and poor efficacy that does not improve overall survival (OS). Ipilimumab is a fully human, monoclonal antibody that blocks the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and has recently been approved for metastatic melanoma based on two independent randomized phase III studies both demonstrating an improved OS rate after 1, 2, and 3 years compared with the control group. Based on this major step in treating metastatic melanoma, novel adjuvant strategies in stage III and combination therapies with targeted agents in stage IV are currently being explored.

### The role of social determinants of health in the receipt of systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma [^112Wq8yR]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Simple Summary

The development of contemporary immune and targeted therapies for patients with metastatic extended survival compared to the previous standard of care treatments. Therefore, equitable access to these therapies for all patients with advanced melanoma is of high importance. We aimed to understand the association between SES with treatment receipt and prognosis. Furthermore, we aimed to identify detailed reasons why patients with stage IV melanoma do not undergo systemic treatment. Our findings would help us understand what interventions are most helpful to improve the care of patients with advanced melanoma within our regional hospital system.

Objectives

The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) has not been used to study the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) in the receipt of treatment in melanoma. We set out to understand the effect of SES on the receipt of systemic treatment upon diagnosis of stage IV melanoma patients within our health system.

Methods

We queried patients with stage IV melanoma at our institution between 2010 and 2021. We defined SES based on ADI (highest quartile considered "low SES"). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of systemic therapy receipt. Additionally, we reviewed granular reasons for not receiving systemic treatment.

Results

One hundred seventy-nine patients were included, of whom 119 (66.5%) received any type of systemic treatment. Patients were less likely to receive systemic therapy if they had worse performance status, low SES, or were diagnosed between 2010 and 2017. The majority of barriers to receiving systemic therapy included poor baseline medical condition and advanced disease with recommendation for hospice care (39 patients, 65%). Potentially modifiable reasons included refusal by the patient (5 patients, 8.3%), which did not differ between high and low SES patients, and occurred in only 1 patient ≥ 2018.

Conclusions

Low SES predicted lower systemic treatment receipt for stage IV melanoma at our institution; however, most limitations to treatment came from nonmodifiable barriers to care at the time of diagnosis. These findings provide valuable insight into equity-focused programming at our institution and others.

### Prognosis of patients with primary melanoma stage I and II according to American joint committee on cancer version 8 validated in two independent cohorts: implications for adjuvant treatment [^114sykxK]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In Western White populations, the incidence of cutaneous melanoma has been steadily increasing for decades, from approximately one case per 100,000 inhabitants/year in the 1950s to 30–50 cases today. Ninety percent to 95% of this increase is due to UV exposure. In recent decades, thin melanomas with tumor thickness up to 1 mm have been detected with increasing frequency at initial diagnosis. In Western European countries and the United States, 60%-70% of all newly diagnosed melanomas now have a tumor thickness ≤ 1 mm. There is no tumor thickness threshold at which metastasis cannot occur. Since the proportion of thin melanomas is very large, more patients die today from T1 tumors than from T4 tumors in absolute numbers.

Systemic therapies with targeted BRAF and MEK inhibitors and with immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved the treatment of melanoma. These drugs were initially used in the treatment of patients with distant metastatic or unresectable regional melanoma (stages III-IV) leading to 5-year survival rates between 30% and 50%. In adjuvant therapy, these new drugs have now been approved for resectable stage III melanoma. In the three landmark stage III trials, adjuvant therapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab, and in BRAF -mutant melanomas with the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib, showed a reduction in the hazard ratio (HR) for recurrence to approximately 0.5 to approximately 0.6 in comparison to placebo in all trials. - Currently, large prospective randomized trials are underway testing adjuvant therapy for stage IIB and IIC melanoma, and in the first adjuvant trial of pembrolizumab versus placebo recently reported, the HR for recurrence was 0.65 after 12 months and 0.61 after 18 months of follow-up, and this agent received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in December 2021.

### Q-TWiST analysis comparing ipilimumab / dacarbazine vs placebo / dacarbazine for patients with stage III / IV melanoma [^114QiX6x]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of metastatic melanoma is advancing with the advent of new targeted immune-modulating therapies. This aggressive disease was traditionally treated with dacarbazine (DTIC) chemotherapy, which has never been shown to provide survival benefit and is associated with serious side effects. For decades, it was the only FDA-approved treatment for metastatic stage IV melanoma. In 2011, ipilimumab was approved after significantly improving survival in patients with metastatic melanoma in a phase 3 study comparing ipilimumab/DTIC vs placebo/DTIC (hazard ratio, 0.72; P < 0.001). Patients who received ipilimumab and DTIC for up to 48 weeks had consistently higher survival rates at each annum, with a 4-year survival rate of 19% vs 10% in the group treated with DTIC only. Disease progression was slowed and durable objective responses noted. These results mark a major advance in the treatment of metastatic melanoma; thus, ipilimumab is seen to fulfill an unmet medical need.

Treatment with ipilimumab is associated with a distinct set of adverse events (AEs) that are consistent with its immune-based mechanism of action. These immune-mediated AEs may affect any organ system; however, the most frequently affected organs are the skin (rash, pruritus) and gastrointestinal tract (diarrhoea, colitis). Most immune-mediated AEs are mild to moderate in grade and resolve when established treatment guidelines are followed. Occasionally, immune-mediated AEs may be severe in nature and require stopping of treatment and administration of systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressant agents. In some reports, immune-mediated AEs have been reported to correlate with treatment response.

To assess the overall effect of ipilimumab on the patient experience, we implemented quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicities (Q-TWiST) methodology. Q-TWiST is an analytical approach that compares time with toxicities and clinical outcomes simultaneously to evaluate the trade-off between AEs and benefits of treatment during the entire survival period. The approach has been used to evaluate treatments in many different cancer indications including interferon for melanoma.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^112y7G8x]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Pembrolizumab in previously treated unresectable stage III/IV melanoma (KEYNOTE-002): Randomized trials in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV metastatic disease have shown that pembrolizumab (monotherapy), like nivolumab, improves response and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with chemotherapy or ipilimumab (monotherapy). In KEYNOTE-002, pembrolizumab was compared with investigators choice of chemotherapy in unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma that had progressed on ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600-mutation positive, on a BRAF inhibitor, with over 70% of patients having received two or more prior systemic therapies. Long-term follow-up (median 28 months) showed higher rates and durations of response and long-lasting improvements in PFS with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy, while the trend toward improved overall survival (OS) was not statistically significant even after adjustment for crossover. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were somewhat lower with pembrolizumab than chemotherapy, although the only fatal treatment-related AE occurred in a patient treated with pembrolizumab, and immune-related AEs were largely limited to the pembrolizumab arms; compliance, global health status, and health-related quality of life were better with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy.

### An update on the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on tumor immunotherapy for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma: version 2.0 [^112CHa4K]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

In an older trial, which included patients with completely resected stage IV or high-risk stage III melanoma, adjuvant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not demonstrate improvements in RFS or OS in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study. GM-CSF, an immunomodulatory agent with pleiotropic and sometimes opposing effects on antitumor immunity, remains investigational for any stage of melanoma, although its incorporation into an oncolytic virotherapy for intratumoral administration is approved for advanced melanoma, and its role in combination immunotherapy appears promising.

Although immunomodulatory therapy is the only intervention that had ever shown promise in the adjuvant therapy of melanoma, there is now evidence that molecularly-targeted therapies can benefit patients with resected high-risk melanoma whose tumor cells carry an activating BRAF mutation. A trial of dabrafenib and trametinib given at standard doses (CombiAD), randomized 870 patients (1:1) to either the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib (D/T) or placebo for 1 year. This trial excluded patients with stage IIIA (N1) with a < 1 mm metastatic nodal deposit. With a median follow up of 2.8 years, D/T was associated with improved RFS (HR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.39–0.58, P < 0.001) and OS (HR 0.57; 95% CI: 0.42–0.79, P < 0.001) compared to placebo. Moreover, there were no additional safety concerns that arose with D/T that had not previously been seen in patients with unresectable or stage IV melanoma. While this combination is not considered immunotherapy, inhibitors of BRAF and associated pathways in the tumor cell have been shown to have immunomodulatory properties that contribute to their activity. For these patients, the choice between molecularly targeted and immune checkpoint-based adjuvant therapy remains unclear, as direct comparisons have not yet been made. However, benefit was seen across all AJCC 7th (and by extrapolation 8th) edition stage III subgroups, and this combination can be considered for any patient with stage III, BRAF V600E/K -mutant melanoma.

### Estimating long-term survivorship rates among patients with resected stage III / IV melanoma: analyses from checkMate 238 and European organization for research and treatment of cancer 18071 trials [^1136dUgu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This MCM analysis used data from two large phase III RCTs with extended follow-up, namely, CheckMate 238 and EORTC 18071, to estimate the fraction of patients with resected melanoma who would be cured on adjuvant treatment with NIVO or IPI. The analysis demonstrated that patients receiving NIVO are more likely to be cured than those receiving IPI and those receiving IPI are more likely to be cured than those receiving placebo. The MCMs suggested that treatment effects are primarily borne by the differences in cure rates, whereas RFS outcomes among uncured patients are largely unaffected by treatment. Access to patient-level data from both trials enabled the implementation of a detailed ITC, addressing differences in staging inclusion criteria between the two trials to obtain a more valid assessment of the relative efficacy of NIVO versus placebo. NIVO-treated patients were more than twice as likely to be cured than patients receiving placebo. To our knowledge, this contribution is the first study devoted to examination of underlying survival heterogeneity among patients with stage III/IV resected melanoma regardless of their BRAF mutation status and estimation of the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on the cure rates. The findings provide insights into the long-term efficacy of adjuvant immunotherapy, which may not be drawn empirically from the raw data, to guide treatment decisions for patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

Analyzing the RFS end point within the MCM framework imposes the condition that patients who experience recurrence cannot be classified as cured, which is an important caveat when interpreting the results and leads to some advantages over the analysis of OS. Analysis of RFS outcomes using MCMs effectively corresponds to estimation of cure rates specifically in the adjuvant setting, which is a highly relevant outcome from a clinical standpoint since recurrence and metastasis can severely affect the quality of life of the patient. Relatedly, estimating cure rates from RFS data largely eliminates the confounding effects of subsequent treatments, which differed greatly across the four arms of the two studies analyzed here. Although there is the possibility of cure in the metastatic setting, cure rates with subsequent treatments are liable to be much smaller than the achievable cure rates in the adjuvant setting. - Furthermore, RFS may be a suitable surrogate predictor of melanoma-specific survival - and is the prevalent primary end point of recent and ongoing trials investigating adjuvant treatment in resected stage II/III/IV melanoma.

Adjuvant Therapy in Melanoma

The prognosis of patients with advanced unresectable stage III/metastatic stage IV melanoma has significantly improved over the last years with the advent of novel systemic therapies, namely immunotherapy and targeted therapy. The first strategy includes unleashing the immune response through immune checkpoint inhibitors, with antibodies targeting the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). The second strategy consists of targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (i.e. the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors), which is constitutively activated in approximately 50% of cutaneous melanoma patients, namely those harboring a BRAFV600 mutation. Given the survival benefit provided by these drugs in the metastatic setting, in recent years efforts have been made to evaluate their role as adjuvant treatment for high-risk resected disease. The first immunotherapy to demonstrate a significant improvement in relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with placebo was the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab in the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071/CA184-029 trial. However, ipilimumab was associated with a high rate of serious adverse events (SAEs), leading to early treatment discontinuation in a substantial proportion of patients and to treatment-related deaths (five patients, 1.1%). Indeed, anti-PD1 antibodies were demonstrated to be more effective and less toxic than ipilimumab in metastatic disease. The CheckMate 238 trial compared nivolumab with high-dose ipilimumab in patients with high-risk, radically resected stage IIIB/IIIC or stage IV melanoma. After a minimum of 4 years' follow-up, adjuvant nivolumab demonstrated a significant improvement in RFS and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) compared with ipilimumab. Nivolumab exhibited a favorable toxicity profile, with fewer patients experiencing treatment-related SAEs or discontinuing therapy due to any treatment-related toxicity. Furthermore, there were no treatment-related deaths in the cohort of patients treated with nivolumab. Similarly, adjuvant pembrolizumab for resected high-risk stage III melanoma resulted in significantly longer RFS than placebo in the EORTC 1325-MG/KEYNOTE-054 trial, with no reports of new toxic effects at 3 years' follow-up. In both trials, the survival improvement of adjuvant anti-PD1 was consistent across all patient subgroups, regardless of disease stage and BRAF mutational status.

Cutaneous melanoma — adjuvant therapy eligibility and staging context: Guidelines recommend considering adjuvant treatment, and trials generally have included only those sentinel node-positive patients with a nodal metastasis at least 1 mm in diameter. Trial entry used American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th Edition staging, with 5-year melanoma-specific survival for AJCC 7th Edition stage IIIA at 78%, compared to 93% for AJCC 8th Edition stage IIIA. In patients with resected stage III disease at low risk of recurrence (eg, AJCC 8th Edition stage IIIA and/or those with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis < 1 mm), the toxicity of adjuvant therapy may outweigh the benefit and should be discussed with the patient.

### Strategies for the development of more effective adjuvant therapy of melanoma: current and future explorations of antibodies, cytokines, vaccines, and combinations [^111Wy8mC]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

Adjuvant trials have evaluated the influence of multiple agents on relapse and mortality for patients with intermediate-risk (stage IIA, American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual, 6th ed.), high-risk (stage IIB-III), or very high-risk (stage IIIB-IV) operable melanoma. A 25% to 33% reduction of relative relapse risk with high-dose IFN-alpha2b therapy has been documented in stage groups overall, with survival prolongation in two of these trials. In contrast, no large cooperative group trial has ever shown a significant prolongation of survival for inoperable advanced stage IV melanoma. The basis for the failure of therapies in advanced disease may lie in differences in the immune function of patients with active metastatic stage IV disease. These observations argue for the exploration of promising new therapies in adjuvant settings. Past adjuvant studies have targeted stage IIB-III patients, focusing less on the more advanced but resectable stage IIIB and IV (M(1a-b)) disease groups. Current chemobiotherapy (S0008) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor plus peptide vaccination (E4697) trials have now evaluated the higher-risk disease groups where trials may soon be expected to yield results. Predictive markers that would allow us to focus treatment on those patients who are most likely to respond would accelerate our development of adjuvant therapy for melanoma. We have recently developed a neoadjuvant approach to high-dose IFN in which the molecular and immunologic effects of IFN have been correlated with clinical antitumor effects of this therapy. In addition, the Hellenic Oncology group has shown that the benefit of high-dose IFN is closely correlated with serologic and clinical manifestations of autoimmunity. These new insights will allow us to develop more efficient approaches to adjuvant therapy of melanoma, focusing on autoimmunity and antitumor immunity with new immunomodulators, such as anti-CTLA4 antibodies and vaccination.

### DNA methylation-based prediction of response to immune checkpoint inhibition in metastatic melanoma [^1158KR7v]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Malignant melanoma accounts for one of the most frequent cancer types and shows a rising incidence over the past years. Prognosis and treatment implications highly depend on the melanoma stage classified by the criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The presence of distant metastases defines stage IV and thus advanced melanomawith patients facing a considerably poorer prognosis than in earlier melanoma stages. However, overall survival (OS) significantly improved due to novel therapy options. Among these, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) modulating the anticancer immune response developed toward a promising treatment in tumors of various cancer entities. In metastatic melanoma, ICIs were approved as an effective therapy option. Of these, the combinatorial blockage of the immune checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (ipilimumab) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, nivolumab/pembrolizumab) displayed the highest objective response rate in a phase III randomized clinical trial with 58% in the ipilimumab plus nivolumab arm compared with 19% in the ipilimumab monotherapy arm. Furthermore, multicenter studies have shown that anti-PD1-monotherapy (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) achieves response rates of up to 40% in treatment naïve patients and about 27%–35% in pretreated melanoma patients. However, treatment resistance to ICIs remains a relevant issue. Equally important, serious immune-related adverse events (irAE) display a major challenge, particularly under combinatorial therapy which frequently lead to discontinuation of ICI treatment.

### Treatment of unresectable stage IV metastatic melanoma with aviscumine after anti-neoplastic treatment failure: a phase II, multi-centre study [^1116jSpX]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Aviscumine, a recombinant plant protein, is an immune modulator that induces ribotoxic stress at the 28S ribosomal RNA subunit. In this way cytokine release and T-cell responses are enhanced. This phase II trial was conducted to test the efficacy and safety of aviscumine in patients with systemically pre-treated metastatic melanoma stage IV.

Methods

A total of 32 patients with progressive stage IV melanoma after failure of standard therapy were enrolled onto a single-arm, multi-centre, open-label, phase II trial. All patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Patients received 350 ng aviscumine twice weekly by subcutaneous injection until progression. The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Safety was assessed as adverse events (AEs). Tumor response was assessed every eight weeks and survival of patients was followed up to one year after the end of therapy. Thirty one patients (intent-to-treat population (ITT)) were assessed for efficacy; safety was assessed in the whole population.

Results

One patient achieved a partial response (PR) and 10 patients showed stable disease/no change (SD). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 63 days (95% CI 57–85) and median overall survival (mOS) was 335 days (95% CI 210–604). In total 210 treatment-emergent adverse events were recorded. Grade 1 or 2 AEs occurred in 72% of patients and were mostly application-site effects such as pruritus Grade 3–4 treatment-emergent drug-related adverse events occurred in 9% of patients.

Conclusion

These results suggest that aviscumine may have a clinical impact in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma and provide rationale for further clinical evaluation of this agent. In the light of effective new immune checkpoint blockers it might be a candidate for combinations with these agents.

### Dabrafenib and trametinib vs anti-PD (L) 1 for the adjuvant treatment of locally advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iibU7]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

In the adjuvant setting, where treatment is given after surgical resection of high-risk melanoma, the therapeutic goal shifts to reducing recurrence risk and improving survival. Stage III melanoma is defined by regional lymph node involvement or in-transit metastases/satellite lesions and carries a substantial risk of relapse. For patients with stage III melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation, one year of adjuvant therapy with dabrafenib plus trametinib or an anti-PD-1 agent (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) significantly prolongs recurrence-free survival (RFS). Nivolumab is also approved for patients with resected stage IV disease. However, unlike in the metastatic setting, the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab failed to show superiority over nivolumab alone in the adjuvant setting and is therefore not recommended for most patients. Despite the clear RFS advantages of adjuvant therapy — whether targeted therapy or immunotherapy — no significant improvement in OS has been demonstrated to date in pivotal trials. Real-world data have also yielded conflicting findings regarding the OS benefit of adjuvant treatment, as evidenced by reports from Sweden and the United States. Interpreting OS in the adjuvant context is particularly challenging because subsequent treatments at the time of relapse can dramatically influence survival outcomes. Notably, approximately half of patients receiving first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab in the metastatic setting remain alive after 10 years, underscoring how later lines of therapy may confound OS analyses in the adjuvant setting.

To date, no randomized trials have directly compared adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibition with anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with BRAF-mutant stage III or resected stage IV melanoma. In most countries, both strategies are approved and reimbursed for this population, leaving clinicians and patients to weigh the benefits, risks, and side-effect profiles of each approach in the absence of head-to-head data. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of these two adjuvant treatment modalities in BRAF-mutant stage III and resected stage IV melanoma.

### Prognosis of patients with stage III melanoma according to American joint committee on cancer version 8: a reassessment on the basis of 3 independent stage III melanoma cohorts [^111Xdrxc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Three adjuvant stage III therapies for melanoma have been approved since 2018, all of which are effective in extending relapse-free survival, distant-metastases–free survival and (in part) OS. First, it was shown that adjuvant treatment with ipilimumab versus placebo in stage III melanoma resulted in a hazard ratio for relapse-free survival of 0.76, and another study comparing nivolumab and ipilimumab for relapse-free survival showed a hazard ratio of 0.65 (product value of both hazard ratios = 0.49). Nivolumab was subsequently approved in both the United States and Europe for the adjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma. The estimated hazard ratio for relapse-free survival comparing the programmed cell death protein 1 antibody pembrolizumab with placebo was 0.57, and for the targeted therapy (with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib) with placebo was 0.47. Both therapies were approved for adjuvant treatment in the United States, Europe, and many other countries. The estimated hazard ratios for distant-metastasis–free survival were generally in the same range as for relapse-free survival. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the combined treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib showed promising results regarding OS (estimated hazard ratio, 0.57), but more mature follow-up results are required to draw conclusions. Overall, there is no other cancer for which such effective adjuvant therapies are available.

### Factors affecting recurrence and survival for patients with high-risk stage II melanoma [^114NFZ6m]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

With an estimated 97,000 new cases and 9000 deaths in 2023, melanoma remains the fifth most common cancer in the United States. The introduction of effective systemic therapies for the treatment of advanced melanoma has radically improved outcomes for patients with metastatic disease and has led to expanded use of both targeted therapy and immune checkpoint blockade in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Because patients with resectable melanoma have the potential to attain a cure with surgery alone, there is interest in a biologically informed approach to the selection of patients for active surveillance and/or adjuvant therapy. As the field advances, understanding how best to predict recurrence in melanoma will help us limit risk, maximize benefits, and minimize cost in the multidisciplinary care of patients with melanoma.

Histopathologic characteristics such as the depth of tumor invasion, the presence of ulceration (T-stage), and the presence of local (N stage) or distant metastases (M stage) are used to stage patients with primary cutaneous melanomas and guide clinical decisions and treatment accordingly. The current standard of care for tumors with a Breslow depth greater than 0.8 mm or ulceration without clinical evidence of metastatic disease includes surgical excision of the primary tumor with a wide local excision (WLE) and nodal sampling via sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).

The eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria uses histopathologic features to define patients without nodal metastases but with high-risk tumor features (e.g. Breslow depth > 4 mm or an ulcerated tumor with a Breslow depth > 2.1 mm) as having high-risk stage II disease (IIB or IIC). Early stage III disease (IIIA) is defined by the presence of clinically occult lymph node metastases in the context of a primary melanoma with a Breslow depth of less than 1 or 2 mm as long as no ulceration is seen. Interestingly, patients with stage IIIA melanomas have a higher probability of 5- and 10-year MSS (93% and 88%, respectively) than patients with stage IIB (87% and 82%) or IIC (82% and 75%) melanomas, suggesting that high-risk primary tumor features may be biologic drivers of recurrence and survival. Both targeted therapies and checkpoint blockade have been approved for use in the stage III adjuvant setting for patients with melanoma, and adjuvant anti-PD1 currently is approved for patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma. However, these therapies can carry substantial risks, reinforcing the need for prognostic tools to help guide surveillance and treatment decisions.

### Survival after introduction of adjuvant treatment in stage III melanoma: a nationwide registry-based study [^1178XDMG]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Medium credibility.

With a longer follow-up, improved distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival were demonstrated with ipilimumab compared with placebo. Noteworthy, the study participants were included in the years 2008–2011, which was before the approval of checkpoint inhibitory or targeted therapy in the metastatic setting. Hence, in the occurrence of disease-relapse at this timepoint, treatment options were still very limited. Conversely, longer follow-up in both the CheckMate 238 and also the SWOG S1404 study (adjuvant pembrolizumab vs ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or high-dose Interferon alfa (IFNalpha)-2b in stage III-IV melanoma) did not show any overall survival benefit. The lack of translation of the recurrence-free survival benefit to an overall survival benefit has been attributed to both the study design, with active comparators, and also to the entrance of effective treatments in the metastatic setting. Further, for the 2 studies with placebo comparators, KEYNOTE-054 and COMBI-AD, overall survival results have still not been published. Hence, adjuvant treatments with PD-1 and BRAF+MEK inhibitors have been widely implemented based on the recurrence-free survival benefit. However, in light of the considerable side effects and costs of the treatment, the effect on overall survival compared with no adjuvant treatment remains a highly anticipated outcome. In this nationwide registry-based study from Sweden, we report melanoma-specific and overall survival in stage III melanoma patients diagnosed before or after the national implementation of adjuvant treatments for this indication.

### Melanoma treatment: the heart has skin in the game [^114MhfHi]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cancer and cardiovascular disease are neck and neck when it comes to leading causes of death worldwide. Many survivors who triumph over cancer will experience cardiovascular complications due to the undesired side effects of cancer treatment. The field of oncology has tirelessly pushed forward the development of as many new and effective cancer therapies as possible in order to improve the prognosis of patients with malignancies. Unfortunately, many of these newer therapies require further investigation into their cardiotoxic side effect profiles.

Melanoma is the most aggressive of all skin cancers, and its incidence is rising dramatically, especially in young adults. As of today, melanoma diagnosis is the fifth most common malignancy overall and the second most common cancer in patients younger than 39 years of age. The prognosis is even less encouraging, considering that the survival rate at 5 years following the diagnosis of stage IV metastatic melanoma can be as low as 30%, as reported by the American Cancer Society.

On a more positive note, treatment for stage IV melanoma is rapidly evolving. Targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has shown promising results. Phase III clinical trials on the use of dual rapid accelerated fibrosarcoma B-type (BRAF) and mitogen-activated extracellular signal-related kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibition have both revolutionized the treatment of melanoma in the metastatic and adjuvant settings by increasing overall survival and/or cancer-free progression survival. BRAF inhibitors have shown critical issues regarding cardiovascular toxicity. Patients receiving this class of drugs have displayed hypertension and QT-interval prolongation. MEK1 inhibitors have been developed to counteract the BRAF-induced treatment-related resistance; however, cardiovascular sequelae have been highlighted, including hypertension and decreased cardiac ejection fraction in up to 11% of patients leading to dose interruption in 3% or discontinuation in < 1% of patients.

Introduction

Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most common cancers, with an estimated 100,350 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020. Melanoma is staged using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system. "T" refers to primary tumor depth of invasion and ulceration status. "N" refers to regional lymph node metastases and presence of in‐transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastases. "M" refers to distant metastases and integrates elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels — an independent, adverse prognostic factor in melanoma.

Patients with disease localized to the skin (stages I–II) are managed with wide surgical excision and have a generally favorable prognosis. The 5‐year melanoma‐specific survival (MSS; i.e. survival until death from melanoma) rate for stage I to IIA disease ranges from 94% to 99%; stages IIB and IIC have lower 5‐year MSS rates of 87% and 82%, respectively. In patients with stage III melanoma, four pathological stage groups exist (IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, IIID) as determined by T and N ratings, with considerable variability in prognosis by disease substage. Recurrence risk increases and long‐term survival decreases with advancing disease stage. The 5‐year MSS rate is 77% for all patients with stage III melanoma. However, the 5‐year MSS rates for stages IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IIID are 93%, 83%, 69%, and 32%, respectively, demonstrating a wide range of prognosis in these patients.

Treatment for BRAF ‐mutant stage III melanoma depends on whether the tumor is surgically resectable or unresectable. Patients with resectable melanoma typically undergo surgery to remove the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. Because of a high 5‐year risk of relapse in patients with stage III melanoma, ranging from 48% to 85%, patients with BRAF ‐mutant melanoma are often treated with adjuvant therapy, including immunotherapy (e.g. ipilimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab) or targeted therapy (e.g. dabrafenib plus trametinib), following surgery to mitigate risk of relapse. In patients with unresectable disease, first‐line therapy is either immunotherapy or targeted therapy. The incidence rate of stage III melanoma has increased in recent years, from 1.14 per 100,000 people in 2010 to 1.36 per 100,000 in 2014, stressing the need for effective treatments.

### A phase II study of ABT-510 (thrombospondin-1 analog) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma [^114MLM21]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Thrombospondins are natural inhibitors of angiogenesis, tumor metastases, and tumor growth (melanoma). ABT-510 is a synthetic analog of thrombospondin-1, well tolerated in phase I studies. We conducted a phase II trial evaluating the clinical efficacy of ABT-510 and its effects on biomarkers of angiogenesis and immunity in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM).

Patients and Methods

A 2-stage phase II clinical trial was conducted to assess the clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamic effects (angiogenesis and immunity) of ABT-510 in patients with stage IV melanoma. The primary endpoint was 18-week treatment failure rate. Patients self-administered 100 mg of ABT-510 subcutaneously twice daily. Blood samples were collected at baseline and every 3 weeks while on therapy. Eligible patients demonstrated measurable disease, good performance status and no evidence of intracranial metastases. Correlative laboratory studies evaluated biomarkers of angiogenesis and immunity.

Results

Twenty-one patients were enrolled. Most patients were stage M1c (71%) and all had prior therapy for MM. Only 3 of the first 20 patients enrolled were progression free and on treatment at 18 weeks resulting in early termination of the study. Decreases in peripheral blood VEGF-A levels and VEGF-C levels, and CD146 and CD34/133 counts relative to pretreatment were detected. Limited changes in antitumor T cell immunity were observed.

Conclusions

ABT-510 therapy administered at 100 mg twice/day in patients with MM did not demonstrate definite clinical efficacy. Further dose escalation or combination with cytotoxic therapy may be more effective therapeutically.

### Adjuvant systemic therapies for resected stages III and IV melanoma: a multi-center retrospective clinical study [^114FT6LS]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Two therapeutic strategies have significantly improved melanoma outcomes over the past decade: molecularly targeted therapy for BRAF-mutant melanoma, also known as target therapy\ and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that are not mutation specific. In metastatic melanoma, BRAF/MEK-targeted therapy, such as dabrafenib plus trametinib, can induce rapid tumor response in BRAF-mutant melanoma and improve survival. Additionally, ICIs targeting a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), such as ipilimumab and programmed death-1 (PD-1), nivolumab or pembrolizumab, can produce sustained tumor regression with the possibility of prolonged survival and long-term disease control.

Between 2017 and 2018, 3 adjuvant systemic therapies gained rapid regulatory approval for high-risk resected stage III or IV melanoma based on a significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS). Randomized phase III clinical trials have consistently demonstrated the clinical benefit of adjuvant therapy. Notably, in CHECKMATE-238, the hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death for nivolumab was 0.65 (97.56% CI, 0.51–0.83 at 1 year, P < .001 vs. ipilimumab) in American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7 stage IIIB-C or IV melanoma, including mucosal melanoma. In KEYNOTE-045, pembrolizumab showed a hazard ratio of 0.57 (98.4% CI, 0.43–0.74 at 1 year, P < .001 vs. placebo) in AJCC-7 stage IIIA-C melanoma without in-transit disease. Additionally, COMBI-AD demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.42–0.79, P = 0.0006 at 3 years vs. placebo) for dabrafenib plus trametinib in AJCC-7 stage IIIA-C melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

### Changes in outcomes and factors associated with survival in melanoma patients with brain metastases [^112wUHhD]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The treatment options for MBM patients have changed substantially over the past decade. In this study, which represents one of the largest single-center cohorts reported to date, as expected we observed an improvement in OS from MBM diagnosis over time. The reasons for this survival increase are likely multi-factorial, as we observed significant differences in both patient characteristics at MBM diagnosis and in the treatments these patients subsequently received. Importantly, the change in outcomes was accompanied by changes in factors associated with survival. Together these results provide new information to consider in the counseling and management of contemporary MBM patients.

The most important factor impacting OS in the PE in this cohort was the presence of extracranial metastatic disease, consistent with several prior studies. Likely reflecting the increasing effectiveness of systemic therapies, the presence of extracranial disease in the CE was not significantly associated with survival — but the extent of extracranial disease was important as serum LDH was the most significant factor associated with survival in that cohort. This observation is consistent with the worse outcomes observed in patients with elevated serum LDH in all registration studies of current FDA-approved systemic therapies for metastatic melanoma over the last decade. The relationship between LDH and clinical outcomes has been observed in some clinical trials in MBM patients, while in other studies it has not been reported. Notably, increased serum LDH was the only factor associated with survival in both the PE and CE cohorts. This observation reinforces the inclusion of LDH in the AJCC 8th edition melanoma M1D category, its use in decision-making and clinical trial design in contemporary MBM patients, and the continued unmet need for more effective treatments for these patients. Interestingly, Breslow thickness was associated with MBM patient survival in the CE cohort. The most recent update (8th edition) of the AJCC staging system for cutaneous melanoma includes primary tumor Breslow thickness in the staging criteria for patients with regional metastases (Stage III) based on association with melanoma-specific survival. Notably, the AJCC 8th edition did not update staging criteria for patients with distant metastases (stage IV) due to the rapid changes in treatments and outcomes for these patients. The association identified in our MBM cohort supports further investigation of Breslow thickness associations in stage IV melanoma.

### Prognostic value of von Willebrand factor levels in patients with metastatic melanoma treated by immune checkpoint inhibitors [^1146NhZa]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The latest advances in targeting immune checkpoints opened a new promising era in management of patients suffering from melanoma. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) using anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA4 antibodies have significantly extended progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable malignant melanoma American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2017 stage IV and in early stages (AJCC 2017 stage IIB-C, IIIA-D) patients. Together with BRAF-/MEK-inhibitors in the presence of BRAF mutation, ICI is considered as the gold standard in treatment of melanoma in adjuvant and palliative situations. These very encouraging results hide however heterogeneous clinical outcomes: 22% of patients have durable clinical response (median OS not reached at 5 years, suggesting a potential long-term survival in these patients) while 60% of patients present clinical progression within the first year of therapy in the metastatic setting. Moreover, 59% of treated patients experience severe (grade III-IV) side effects under anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA4 combination-therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent but still unmet clinical need for the identification of patients presenting a high risk of early treatment failure and of those who will respond on the long term to the treatment. The development of new biomarkers is therefore critical to better personalize the therapeutic strategy and to limit unnecessary exposure to immune-related adverse events.

### Prognosis of patients with stage III melanoma according to American joint committee on cancer version 8: a reassessment on the basis of 3 independent stage III melanoma cohorts [^116ATivg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The incidence of cutaneous melanoma has been increasing continuously for decades, and so far, no change in trend has been observed in Europe or the United States. The proportion of metastatic melanomas is largely stable and shows an increasing trend in absolute numbers, including patients with regional lymph node or skin metastasis classified as stage III in the 8th version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification (AJCCv8).

A new era of adjuvant therapy has begun for stage III melanoma. Two immunotherapies and 1 targeted therapy were approved for stage III melanoma in 2018 in Europe and the United States on the basis of improved relapse-free, distant metastases-free, and in part overall survival (OS) benefits. The exact prognostic outcomes should be taken into consideration in adjuvant treatment recommendations.

The TNM classification of solid tumors, as established by the AJCC and the Union International Control Cancer, provides the backbone for prognostic classification and treatment decisions for solid tumors. The first AJCC classification of melanoma was published in 1977 and was valid until 1983. Starting with the AJCCv6 classification in 2002, Breslow's tumor thickness and ulceration were used for the T classification, and the distinction between micro- and macrometastasis and the number of nodes was used for the N classification. The AJCCv7 classification of melanoma contained only small differences compared with the 6th classification. The AJCCv8 of melanoma contains minor changes for the T classification, the N classification has been changed in several aspects, and substages of stage III disease have been newly defined.

In the AJCCv8 classification, stage III melanoma is defined both by the N classification with 9 subgroups and by the T classification, also with 9 subgroups, resulting in 81 different combination possibilities, which in 78 cases become relevant for the stage classification and makes staging complicated. The combinations are presented in a field diagram and then assigned to the prognostically relevant substages of stage III: the 5- and 10-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) rates for stage IIIA (combining 6 fields) were 93% and 88%, respectively; for stage IIIB (combining 19 fields), 83% and 77%, respectively; for stage IIIC (combining 48 fields), 69% and 60%, respectively; and for stage IIID (combining 3 fields), 32% and 24%, respectively. For the entire stage III population, the 5- and 10-year MMS rate were 77% and 69%, respectively.

Molecular testing and systemic treatment selection — BRAF mutation testing is recommended for patients with stage III melanoma for whom future BRAF-directed therapy may be an option, and broader genomic profiling may be considered if results could guide treatment or trial eligibility. If BRAF V600 mutation positive, other BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations can be considered in the event of unacceptable toxicities to dabrafenib/trametinib or based on side effect profiles. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nivhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV nivolumab, and it has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV nivolumab.

### Systemic therapy for melanoma: ASCO guideline update [^113gEFb2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO melanoma systemic therapy — adjuvant options for resected stage IIIA–D BRAF wild-type indicate that the following adjuvant therapy options should be offered (in no particular order): nivolumab × 52 weeks OR pembrolizumab × 52 weeks; ipilimumab and high-dose interferon are not recommended for routine use in adjuvant therapy; and the rating is Type: Evidence based, benefits outweigh the harms; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong. Qualifying statements specify that patients with stage IIIA disease with microscopic sentinel nodal metastasis < 1 mm in diameter were not included in the randomized trials, both nivolumab and pembrolizumab are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved adjuvant treatments for patients with melanoma with lymph node involvement who have undergone complete disease resection, and that patients with stage IIIA disease with < 1 mm involvement in the sentinel lymph node have a relatively better prognosis and lower risk of relapse; therefore, treatment should be individualized after discussing risk-benefit quotient with these patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^111zHV32]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Cutaneous melanoma — adjuvant anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti‑PD‑1) monotherapy: Two PD‑1–directed antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been tested as adjuvant therapy for resected melanoma in phase III randomized trials. In CheckMate 238, adjuvant nivolumab was compared with adjuvant ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) in patients with resected stage IIIB/C or stage IV; at a median 19.5 months follow-up, nivolumab was associated with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in relapse‑free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis‑free survival (DMFS), and the percent of patients with grade 3–4 AEs was 30% lower versus ipilimumab. Based on the improvement in RFS, the FDA approved nivolumab for adjuvant treatment of resected nodal or metastatic melanoma; although trial entry for stage IIIB/C (AJCC 7th Edition) required clinically detected lymph nodes and/or ulcerated primary, the FDA‑approved indication is broader, including all patients with "lymph node involvement". In KEYNOTE‑054, pembrolizumab versus placebo in resected stage III melanoma showed at a median follow‑up of 1.2 years that pembrolizumab improved RFS and reduced risk of distant metastases, while overall survival (OS) data were not mature at initial report.

### Therapy for metastatic melanoma: the past, present, and future [^112BBvSU]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Role of surgery in metastatic disease

Patients with oligometastatic disease present a clinical dilemma of whether to treat systemically or locally. Highly selected patients with isolated lung or liver metastasis, good performance status, and less aggressive tumor biology have benefited from metastasectomy with improved five-year survival rates and median OS rates of 20 to 25 months. Again, patient selection is the key for success in this setting. A recent phase 2 study enrolled 77 patients for complete resection of metastatic disease and demonstrated a relapsed free survival of five months and 36% of patients alive at three years. While this trial demonstrates that long-term survival can be achieved through surgery, the trial did not further identify patients more likely to benefit from surgery. Currently, a prospective trial of patients with oligometastatic disease is randomizing patients to either surgery versus systemic therapy. This will hopefully shed more light on which patients are most likely to benefit from metastasectomy.

### Adjuvant systemic therapies for resected stages III and IV melanoma: a multi-center retrospective clinical study [^111WoHgV]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Provincial approval for indications of adjuvant therapies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or dabrafenib/trametinib) was centralized, despite variations in the enrollment populations with partially overlapping stages. These included completely resected melanoma stage IIIA to IIIC or IV according to the AJCC-7th edition. After migration to AJCC-8th edition in 2018, the indication for IIIA melanoma was restricted to lymph node micrometastasis measuring more than or equal to 1 mm at the greatest diameter. Nivolumab was approved in 2017 and was dosed at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, for a total of 24 doses for approximately 1 year, or until or unless unacceptable toxicity developed, or disease recurred. After March 2020, the dosing schedule for nivolumab was transitioned to 6 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks. In 2017, the combination of adjuvant dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus trametinib (2 mg once daily) every 28 days for 1 year was approved for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma, specifically those with BRAF V600 mutations. Lastly, adjuvant pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, for a total of 18 doses) was approved for the standard-of-care use in 2018.

Disease recurrence was determined using serial physical examinations and radiographic assessments, typically every 6 months. The regional lymph node basin was assessed with ultrasonography every 4 months in the absence of prior lymph node dissection. RFS was defined as the time from the initiation of adjuvant therapy to the appearance of one or more new melanoma lesions or death by any cause. Locoregional recurrences included local recurrences at the periphery of the previous surgical bed, regional in-transit metastases, and regional nodal failure. Distant metastases are defined as any recurrences outside the locoregional area. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0. Adverse events (AEs) and immune-related adverse advents (irAE) of clinical significance were defined as any immune-breakthrough adverse event that was grade 3 or higher or any event that caused a treatment delay greater than 4 weeks, caused discontinuation, or resulted in permanent organ dysfunction. Late-emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events with onsets greater than 100 days after the last dose of treatment, as in the CheckMate-238 study. Finally, long-term toxicities were defined as persistent functional impairments after the completion or discontinuation of systemic therapies and were unresolved at the last follow-up assessment.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^114tfEhF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Melanoma: Cutaneous — positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and central nervous system (CNS) imaging show stage-dependent performance and selective impact on management. Most investigators have described very low yield and poor sensitivity in detecting metastatic disease in patients with clinically localized melanoma, whereas in patients with stage III disease, PET/CT scan may be more useful. A systematic review documented PET sensitivity ranging from 68% to 87% and specificity ranging from 92% to 98% for stage III and IV melanoma, compared to sensitivity ranging from 0% to 67% and specificity ranging from 77% to 100% for stage I and II melanoma; another large meta-analysis suggested that PET/CT was superior over CT in detecting distant metastases. In stage III or IV melanoma, additional information from PET/CT may impact treatment decisions in up to 30% of patients, with the greatest impact seen in surgical management. For the CNS, early detection and treatment of subclinical metastases is important because clinically symptomatic CNS metastases are associated with significant morbidity and poor survival, and outcomes after treatment are markedly better in patients with lower CNS tumor burden and/or asymptomatic metastases; although CNS recurrence is rare in stage I–IIIB melanoma (≤ 5%), stage IIIC disease has an appreciable risk (> 11%), and although the yield of baseline CNS imaging may be low, it may be useful for comparison with follow-up scans in patients at risk of CNS recurrence.

### Adjuvant pembrolizumab versus placebo in resected stage III melanoma (EORTC 1325-MG / KEYNOTE-054): distant metastasis-free survival results from a double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^11589SqV]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Background

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 1325/KEYNOTE-054 trial assessed pembrolizumab versus placebo in patients with resected high-risk stage III melanoma. At 15-month median follow-up, pembrolizumab improved recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57 [98.4% CI 0.43–0.74], p < 0.0001) compared with placebo, leading to its approval in the USA and Europe. This report provides the final results for the secondary efficacy endpoint, distant metastasis-free survival and an update of the recurrence-free survival results.

Methods

This double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 123 academic centres and community hospitals across 23 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with complete resection of cutaneous melanoma metastatic to lymph node, classified as American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, seventh edition (AJCC-7) stage IIIA (at least one lymph node metastasis > 1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC (without in-transit metastasis), and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a central interactive voice response system to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 18 doses or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified according to disease stage and region, using a minimisation technique, and clinical investigators, patients, and those collecting or analysing the data were masked to treatment assignment. The two coprimary endpoints were recurrence-free survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. The secondary endpoint reported here was distant metastasis-free survival in the ITT and PD-L1-positive populations. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02362594, and EudraCT, 2014-004944-37.

Findings

Between Aug 26, 2015, and Nov 14, 2016, 1019 patients were assigned to receive either pembrolizumab (n = 514) or placebo (n = 505). At an overall median follow-up of 42.3 months (IQR 40.5–45.9), 3.5-year distant metastasis-free survival was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group in the ITT population (65.3% [95% CI 60.9–69.5] in the pembrolizumab group vs 49.4% [44.8–53.8] in the placebo group; HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.49–0.73]; p < 0.0001). In the 853 patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, 3.5-year distant metastasis-free survival was 66.7% (95% CI 61.8–71.2) in the pembrolizumab group and 51.6% (46.6–56.4) in the placebo group (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.49–0.76]; p < 0.0001). Recurrence-free survival remained longer in the pembrolizumab group 59.8% (95% CI 55.3–64.1) than the placebo group 41.4% (37.0–45.8) at this 3.5-year follow-up in the ITT population (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.49–0.70]) and in those with PD-L1-positive tumours 61.4% (56.3–66.1) in the pembrolizumab group and 44.1% (39.2–48.8) in the placebo group (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.49–0.73]).

Interpretation

Pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy provided a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in distant metastasis-free survival at a 3.5-year median follow-up, which was consistent with the improvement in recurrence-free survival. Therefore, the results of this trial support the indication to use adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in patients with resected high risk stage III cutaneous melanoma.

Surgical prerequisites were explicit: "All patients had their primary tumor excised with adequate margins and complete regional lymphadenectomy, but none had received systemic therapy for melanoma". The trial "demonstrated that ipilimumab improved RFS, DMFS, and OS", indicating benefit across relapse-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis–free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS).

### Systemic therapy for melanoma: ASCO guideline update [^117J6hJd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Qualifying statements — stage IIIA details and regulatory status: Patients with stage IIIA disease with microscopic sentinel nodal metastasis < 1 mm in diameter were not included in the randomized trials of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors; both nivolumab and pembrolizumab are US Food and Drug Administration–approved adjuvant treatments for melanoma with lymph node involvement after complete resection. Patients with stage IIIA disease with < 1 mm involvement in the sentinel lymph node have a relatively better prognosis and lower risk of relapse, so treatment should be individualized after discussing risk-benefit with the patients.

### Cutaneous side effects and types of dermatological reactions in metastatic melanoma patients treated by immunotherapies or targeted therapies: a retrospective single center study [^113W6ZNj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The incidence of melanoma has increased in Europe in the last years. In the past, the median survival of patients with stage IV melanoma was only 6–8 months and treatment consisted of chemotherapy with a poor prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies have revolutionized the management of metastatic melanoma with unprecedented survival and response rates. Moreover, in recent years, both treatments have been demonstrated to prolong progression free survival (PFS) in stage III disease free patients thus in an adjuvant setting.

However, these novel therapies are associated with adverse effects (AEs), of which cutaneous toxicities are the most frequently observed. These cutaneous AEs can exert significant morbidity and impact on patient quality of life, hence the recognition and management of AEs is fundamental in preventing interruption or cessation of survival‐prolonging treatments. According to international guidelines, cutaneous adverse events are generically classified as rash or erythema in the majority of cases, without a specific dermatological classification. However, a series of studies and literature review have clearly shown that cutaneous manifestations associated with immunotherapy or target therapy can present with different clinical features.

A precise dermatological diagnosis is fundamental in order to allow an adequate management and treatment of the adverse events.

In this study, a retrospective analysis of patients treated with immunotherapy and target therapy at the Dermatologic Clinic of the University of Turin was performed, and cutaneous adverse events were classified according to clinical and histological features.

### Cisplatin, gemcitabine, and treosulfan in relapsed stage IV cutaneous malignant melanoma patients [^1119wnR2]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The prognosis of patients with relapsed high-risk melanoma failing standard DTIC-based chemotherapy remains disappointing. However, recent preclinical studies on the chemosensitivity of metastatic melanoma cells to cytotoxic agents identified high sensitivity to cytotoxic single agents including cisplatin, treosulfan, gemcitabine, as well as to combinations of gemcitabine plus treosulfan and gemcitabine plus cisplatin.

Our present analysis of 91 high-risk AJCC stage IV melanoma patients failing previous first-, second-, or third-line therapy, showed a median overall survival of 6 months upon subsequent treatment with the combination of CGT.

While this is the first report on the effect of CGT on metastatic cutaneous melanoma, recent results on CGT-treated metastatic uveal melanoma patients showed a similar median overall survival of 7.7 months. Other authors reported that 14 metastatic uveal melanoma patients treated with gemcitabine and treosulfan as first-line therapy (except one) yielded an objective reponse of 28% and a median overall survival of 61 weeks.

This present multi-agent chemotherapy regimen led to 21% of patients with stable disease or partial remission, with a prolonged median overall survival of 11 months. This was even more striking given the number of prior therapies and the high percentage of cisplatin-pretreated patients.

However, there was no difference in response between cisplatin-pretreated and noncisplatin-pretreated patients suggesting that relapse after previous systemic therapy, that is, prior to the current regimen, may have been cisplatin unrelated.

In the present group of pretreated metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients, median overall survival upon CGT treatment was similar to that reported upon standard DTIC-based therapy, which yielded a median overall survival of 7 months. Similar historical outcome upon current CGT second-/third-/fourth-line therapy compared with DTIC-based first-line treatment might be explained by treatment eligibility-related patient selection; thus, only patients with Karnofsky performance status > 80% despite relapse of disease received subsequent CGT therapy, here.

In summary, treatment with CGT was efficient in one-fifth of pretreated relapsed stage IV melanoma patients achieving disease stabilisation or partial remission. In future, it could be beneficial to prospectively identify melanoma patients, who could benefit from selected chemotherapeutic agents after failing first- or second-line standard chemotherapy.

Abstract

Immunotherapy and target therapy have revolutionized treatment of stage III/IV melanoma. Both treatments show a favorable toxicity profile even if cutaneous adverse events (AEs) are frequent (30%–40% of cases). This is a retrospective single center cohort study that included patients with stage IV or inoperable stage III metastatic melanoma (AJCC 8th) who received BRAFi + MEKi therapy or immunotherapy with Checkpoint inhibitors. All cutaneous AEs were ascertained by a dermatologist based on clinical and histological findings. The primary outcome was to provide a detailed clinical dermatological classification of cutaneous adverse events and an evaluation of the incidence of skin toxicity in the two arms of therapy (immunotherapy and target therapy). A total of 286 patients with stages III–IV metastatic melanoma were included: 146 received immunotherapy and 140 target therapy. In the immunotherapy cohort, 63 (43.1%) cutaneous reactions were observed while 33 skin reactions (23.6%) were identified in patients treated with target therapy. All the skin toxicities observed were grade I, excepted four cases: an erythema multiforme‐like eruption, a grade III psoriasis and two grade III maculopapular rashes. Immunotherapy in older age resulted statistically related to skin toxicities (p = 0.011), meanly in metastatic setting (p = 0.011). Cumulative incidence of skin toxicities was 65.63% in immunotherapy cohort (p = 0.001). Also multivariate logistic regression shows a significant association between skin adverse events and immunotherapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29–0.85, p: 0.01) and between cutaneous AEs and metastatic setting (OR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.04–3.74, p: 0.04). We have also shown that as the age of initiation of therapy increases the probability of developing skin toxicity grows. However, stratifying by type of therapies the effect of age persists only in immunotherapy (OD: 1.04; CI: 1.01–1.06; p: 0.04) while for target therapy age does not affect the onset of skin toxicity (OD 1.01; CI 0.98–1.04; p = 0.42). No differences were shown between patients on target therapy and immunotherapy regarding gender. Patients were also evaluated regarding concomitant therapies and seems that Levotyroxine may be involved in AEs during immunotherapy treatment. More studies are needed to deepen this aspect, also considering the medical history and diverse drug associations. Cutaneous adverse events are characterized by heterogeneous manifestations, are more often seen in patients on immunotherapy and dermatologists can play a crucial role in multidisciplinary care.
