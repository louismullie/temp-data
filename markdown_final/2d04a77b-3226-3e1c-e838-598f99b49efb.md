## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dietary sodium restriction in heart failure, specifically whether it helps or harms and what the practical recommendation should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why sodium restriction has been recommended historically. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality randomized evidence, especially SODIUM-HF. Next, I will review meta-analyses and observational data for consistency and potential harm. After that, I need to check guideline positions and how they have evolved. Finally, I will consider patient-specific factors, feasibility, and synthesize a cautious, individualized recommendation with monitoring and safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the traditional rationale. In heart failure, neurohormonal activation drives sodium and water retention, worsening congestion and symptoms; historically, clinicians advised sodium restriction to mitigate fluid overload and reduce hospitalizations, often targeting less than 2,000–2,300 mg/day, though the evidence base has long been weak and based on physiologic reasoning rather than hard outcomes [^eae7d51d] [^7198130f].

> Now, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. The SODIUM-HF trial enrolled 806 ambulatory patients with chronic HF on guideline-directed therapy and randomized them to less than 1,500 mg/day sodium versus usual care; after 12 months, there was no significant reduction in the composite of CV hospitalization, ED visit, or all-cause death (15% vs 17%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.63–1.26), and no signal for mortality benefit, establishing that aggressive sodium restriction did not improve hard outcomes in this population [^947f4943] [^c51fa5e6].

> Wait, let me verify whether symptom or quality-of-life benefits emerged despite neutral clinical events. In SODIUM-HF, exploratory analyses suggested modest improvements in disease-specific quality of life and NYHA class in those who actually achieved lower sodium intake, but these were secondary endpoints and not definitive; similarly, smaller pilot RCTs showed feasibility and symptom/QoL signals with structured sodium restriction, though they were underpowered for events and often confounded by concurrent interventions [^947f4943] [^b1a8c30f] [^bf7db4db].

> Next, I should review meta-analyses for consistency. A 2023 meta-analysis of 17 RCTs including 1,705 patients found no significant reduction in all-cause mortality, hospitalization, or the composite with sodium restriction, again reinforcing that event benefits are unproven; earlier systematic reviews likewise concluded that evidence for hard outcomes was limited and inconclusive, aligning with SODIUM-HF [^5331a11e] [^1492780e] [^8bd9a880].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for signals of harm. Observational and pooled analyses have reported increased risk with strict sodium restriction in some HF cohorts, including higher rates of death or HF hospitalization with sodium intake below about 2.5 g/day in certain populations, and a Cochrane review suggested increased mortality with salt reduction in HF, although these data are confounded and should be interpreted cautiously; nonetheless, they raise a plausible concern that overly aggressive restriction may activate RAAS and sympathetic pathways, worsening neurohormonal profiles in some patients [^545e44a8] [^a3d44240] [^7cf0abcd].

> I should confirm how guidelines have responded to this evolving evidence. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline gives sodium restriction a Class IIa, Level of Evidence C-LD recommendation to avoid excessive sodium to reduce congestive symptoms, explicitly noting the low-quality evidence and emphasizing individualized counseling; the ESC Heart Failure Association's 2024 consensus advises limiting salt to no more than 5 g/day (about 2 g sodium) in HF, reserving fluid restriction for selected patients, reflecting a shift away from blanket aggressive restriction toward moderation and personalization [^eae7d51d] [^00c47c58].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors that might modify risk–benefit. In advanced NYHA III–IV HF, very high sodium intake (> 3 g/day) associates with worse outcomes, supporting a reasonable ceiling on sodium, whereas in milder disease, overly strict restriction may be counterproductive; comorbidities like CKD, hyponatremia, and malnutrition, as well as high diuretic burden, warrant tailored advice, and in euvolemic or hypotensive patients, modestly increasing sodium can be appropriate to preserve perfusion while monitoring volume status [^5b63c900] [^90df55e3] [^00c47c58].

> I need to ensure we address feasibility and adherence, because recommendations without implementation are not helpful. Real-world data show poor adherence to less than 2 g/day sodium targets, with average intakes around 3 g/day despite education, and sodium-restricted diets can inadvertently reduce calories and micronutrients; structured, dietitian-led interventions improve adherence and may mitigate nutritional trade-offs, reinforcing the need for practical, culturally sensitive counseling rather than rigid prescriptions [^d42aedf4] [^4c6ad8b9] [^7a8ef14d].

> But wait, what if the issue is not just sodium quantity but overall diet quality. Emerging data suggest that a DASH-style, plant-forward pattern with moderate sodium restriction and emphasis on whole foods may improve blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and quality of life in HF, including HFpEF, without the potential harms of extreme restriction; this aligns with a broader shift toward comprehensive dietary quality rather than single-nutrient dogma in HF care [^96cbcd5c] [^800ff483].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-conscious approach. For most patients with chronic HF, I would target approximately 2,000–3,000 mg/day sodium, avoid routine fluid restriction unless there is hyponatremia or refractory congestion, and prioritize dietitian-guided education to reduce processed foods and adopt a DASH-like pattern; I would reassess volume status, renal function, and symptoms regularly, and in those with persistent congestion despite optimized GDMT, I would intensify diuretics and consider stricter sodium limits temporarily, while in euvolemic or hypotensive patients I would avoid overly strict restriction and even allow modest increases if symptomatic [^eae7d51d] [^00c47c58] [^b252c856].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line matches the evidence: aggressive sodium restriction to less than 1,500 mg/day has not reduced clinical events in a large, well-conducted RCT, may worsen neurohormonal activation in some patients, and is hard to sustain; a moderate, individualized sodium target of about 2,000–3,000 mg/day, embedded in high-quality dietary counseling and aligned with guideline-directed therapy, is the most evidence-aligned, safety-conscious strategy pending further definitive trials [^947f4943] [^5331a11e] [^eae7d51d].

Salt restriction in heart failure is **not universally beneficial** [^5331a11e] and should be **individualized** [^00c47c58]. Aggressive sodium restriction to < 1,500 mg/day does not reduce mortality or hospitalizations [^947f4943] and may worsen quality of life in some patients [^0bc95505]. Current guidelines recommend avoiding excessive sodium (> 2,300–3,000 mg/day) [^eae7d51d] and tailoring intake to symptoms, comorbidities, and response [^00c47c58]. Moderate restriction (2,000–3,000 mg/day) is reasonable for most patients with symptomatic HF, while those with hyponatremia or advanced HF may need stricter limits [^e51a8dd3] [^00c47c58]. Monitor for hypotension, renal dysfunction, and neurohormonal activation when restricting sodium [^93bca610].

---

## Physiological rationale for sodium restriction

Sodium restriction reduces extracellular fluid and plasma volume, lowering preload and afterload and thereby **improving cardiac output and reducing congestion** [^b252c856]. It also lowers blood pressure, which can reduce afterload and myocardial oxygen demand [^0761c2a7]. However, excessive restriction may activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system, potentially worsening HF [^7cf0abcd].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

### Benefits of sodium restriction

- **Symptom improvement**: Moderate sodium restriction (2,000–3,000 mg/day) can reduce dyspnea, edema, and improve NYHA class in symptomatic patients [^5331a11e] [^b1a8c30f].
- **Quality of life**: Some studies report improved quality of life with moderate restriction, though results are inconsistent [^5331a11e] [^947f4943].
- **Blood pressure reduction**: Sodium restriction lowers blood pressure, which may benefit HF patients with hypertension [^0761c2a7].

---

### Potential harms of excessive sodium restriction

- **Neurohormonal activation**: Very low sodium intake (< 1,500 mg/day) can activate RAAS and sympathetic activity, potentially worsening HF [^7cf0abcd].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Excessive restriction may impair renal perfusion and increase risk of renal dysfunction [^93bca610].
- **Quality of life**: Strict restriction can reduce palatability, leading to poor adherence and reduced quality of life [^0bc95505].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 | - Avoid excessive sodium (> 2,300 mg/day) [^eae7d51d] <br/> - Individualize restriction based on symptoms and response [^e51a8dd3] |
| ESC 2024 | - Limit sodium to ≤ 5 g/day (≤ 2 g sodium) [^00c47c58] <br/> - Fluid restriction only in selected patients |
| AND 2017 | - Individualize sodium intake to 2,000–3,000 mg/day [^e51a8dd3] <br/> - Emphasize medical nutrition therapy |

---

## Individualized approach to sodium restriction

Sodium restriction should be **tailored** to the patient's clinical status, comorbidities, and response:

- **Mild HF (NYHA I–II)**: Moderate restriction (2,000–3,000 mg/day) is reasonable [^e51a8dd3].
- **Advanced HF (NYHA III–IV)**: Stricter restriction may be needed, but monitor for adverse effects [^00c47c58].
- **Hyponatremia**: Fluid restriction and careful sodium management are essential [^1894b0ac].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Avoid excessive restriction to prevent renal hypoperfusion [^93bca610].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Dietary counseling**: Provide individualized counseling by a registered dietitian [^d21f85bb].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor weight, blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes [^65050399].
- **Patient education**: Educate on hidden sodium sources and adherence strategies [^7a8ef14d].
- **Flexibility**: Adjust sodium intake based on symptoms, weather, and activity level [^959ae5ea].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Sodium restriction in heart failure should be **moderate and individualized** [^00c47c58]. Aggressive restriction does not improve outcomes and may cause harm [^947f4943]. A practical target of 2,000–3,000 mg/day suits most symptomatic patients, with adjustments based on response and comorbidities [^e51a8dd3].

### Salt, No salt, or less salt for patients with heart failure? [^7cf0abcd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Restricting dietary sodium is a common recommendation given by clinicians to patients with heart failure and is one supported by current guidelines. However, the quality of evidence for this recommendation is suboptimal, and there is no consensus on the optimal level of sodium intake. Though excessive sodium intake is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertension, recent data have suggested that very low sodium intake is paradoxically associated with worse outcomes for patients with heart failure. This is possibly explained by the association between low sodium intake and activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. Nevertheless, sodium restriction is routinely recommended and remains a cornerstone of heart failure and blood pressure therapy. In this review we discuss the pros and cons of sodium restriction for patients with heart failure from the current literature.

### Reduced salt intake for heart failure: a systematic review [^1492780e]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recent estimates suggest that more than 26 million people worldwide have heart failure. The syndrome is associated with major symptoms, significantly increased mortality, and extensive use of health care. Evidence-based treatments influence all these outcomes in a proportion of patients with heart failure. Current management also often includes advice to reduce dietary salt intake, although the benefits are uncertain.

Objective

To systematically review randomized clinical trials of reduced dietary salt in adult inpatients or outpatients with heart failure.

Evidence Review

Several bibliographic databases were systematically searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. The methodologic quality of the studies was evaluated, and data associated with primary outcomes of interest (cardiovascular-associated mortality, all-cause mortality, and adverse events, such as stroke and myocardial infarction) and secondary outcomes (hospitalization, length of inpatient stay, change in New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, adherence to dietary low-salt intake, and changes in blood pressure) were extracted.

Findings

Of 2655 retrieved references, 9 studies involving 479 unique participants were included in the analysis. None of the studies included more than 100 participants. The risks of bias in the 9 studies were variable. None of the included studies provided sufficient data on the primary outcomes of interest. For the secondary outcomes of interest, 2 outpatient-based studies reported that NYHA functional class was not improved by restriction of salt intake, whereas 2 studies reported significant improvements in NYHA functional class.

Conclusions and Relevance

Limited evidence of clinical improvement was available among outpatients who reduced dietary salt intake, and evidence was inconclusive for inpatients. Overall, a paucity of robust high-quality evidence to support or refute current guidance was available. This review suggests that well-designed, adequately powered studies are needed to reduce uncertainty about the use of this intervention.

### Dietary salt restriction in heart failure: where is the evidence? [^7198130f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Several dietary guidelines, health organizations and government policies recommend population-wide sodium restriction to prevent hypertension and related comorbidities like heart failure (HF). The current European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Heart Failure guidelines recommend restricting sodium in HF patients. However, these recommendations are based on expert opinion (level C), leading to wide variability in application and lack of consensus among providers pertaining to dietary salt restriction. To evaluate the strength of current evidences to recommend dietary salt restriction among HF patients, we performed a comprehensive literature review and explored the safety and efficacy of such recommendations.

### Dietary sodium and fluid intake in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^00c47c58]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium and fluid restriction has traditionally been advocated in patients with heart failure (HF) due to their sodium and water avid state. However, most evidence regarding the altered sodium handling, fluid homeostasis and congestion-related signs and symptoms in patients with HF originates from untreated patient cohorts and physiological investigations. Recent data challenge the beneficial role of dietary sodium and fluid restriction in HF. Consequently, the European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines have gradually downgraded these recommendations over time, now advising for the limitation of salt intake to no more than 5g/day in patients with HF, while contemplating fluid restriction of 1.5-2L/day only in selected patients. Therefore, the objective of this clinical consensus statement is to provide advice on fluid and sodium intake in patients with acute and chronic HF, based on contemporary evidence and expert opinion.

Fluid and salt intake
Fluid intake: Guidelines suggest that patients should limit fluid intake to 1.5–2 L in severe HF to relieve symptoms, and increase intake (and/or reduce diuretics) in hot and humid weather or in case of fluid loss. 14, 15 Very limited data with low level of evidence suggest that fluid restriction may reduce the risk for HF hospitalization, 16, 17 whereas other reports suggest it is not helpful for improving outcomes and is worse for patients' quality of life. 16 Fluid restriction is believed to be especially important in patients with hyponatraemia, but in one observational study of hospitalized patients with HF and hyponatraemia, fluid restriction was not associated with a meaningful increase in serum sodium. 18
Salt intake: There is no robust evidence for benefits of limiting salt intake in HF. In New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III–IV HF, ingesting > 3 g salt per day was associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death 19, 20 whereas in NYHA class I–II HF, an intake of < 2 g salt was associated with increased risk. 19 Others describe that sodium restriction is associated with increased risk of HF hospitalization. 21 A recent systematic review of nine trials involving 479 HFrEF patients was inconclusive. 22 Strict salt intake reduction is not recommended further than the recommendation for the general population by the World Health Organization for a healthy salt intake of < 5 g a day.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^eae7d51d]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — dietary sodium restriction: Recommendation (COR 2a; LOE C-LD): For patients with stage C heart failure (HF), avoiding excessive sodium intake is reasonable to reduce congestive symptoms. Restricting dietary sodium is a common nonpharmacological treatment for patients with HF symptomatic with congestion, but specific recommendations have been based on low-quality evidence. The AHA currently recommends a reduction of sodium intake to < 2300 mg/d for general cardiovascular health promotion; however, there are no trials to support this level of restriction in patients with HF. Sodium restriction can result in poor dietary quality with inadequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake, and nutritional inadequacies have been associated with clinical instability, while routine supplementation of oral iron, thiamine, zinc, vitamin D, or multivitamins has not proven beneficial. The DASH diet can achieve sodium restriction without compromising nutritional adequacy when accompanied by dietary counseling and may be associated with reduced hospitalizations for HF. Supportive data include that a registered dietitian– or nurse-coached intervention with 2 to 3 g/d sodium restriction improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); in a nonrandomized study (> 2.5 g/d versus < 2.5 g/d), lower dietary sodium was associated with worse all-cause mortality in HFrEF; and in small randomized controlled trials, aggressive sodium restriction (0.8 g/d) during decompensated HF has not reduced weight, congestion, diuretic use, rehospitalization, or all-cause mortality in HFrEF or in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

### Reduction of dietary sodium to less than 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF): an international, open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^947f4943]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dietary restriction of sodium has been suggested to prevent fluid overload and adverse outcomes for patients with heart failure. We designed the Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure (SODIUM-HF) to test whether or not a reduction in dietary sodium reduces the incidence of future clinical events.

Methods

SODIUM-HF is an international, open-label, randomised, controlled trial that enrolled patients at 26 sites in six countries (Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and New Zealand). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class 2–3), and receiving optimally tolerated guideline-directed medical treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), using a standard number generator and varying block sizes of two, four, or six, stratified by site, to either usual care according to local guidelines or a low sodium diet of less than 100 mmol (ie, < 1500 mg/day). The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular-related admission to hospital, cardiovascular-related emergency department visit, or all-cause death within 12 months in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all randomly assigned patients). Safety was assessed in the ITT population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02012179, and is closed to accrual.

Findings

Between March 24, 2014, and Dec 9, 2020, 806 patients were randomly assigned to a low sodium diet (n = 397) or usual care (n = 409). Median age was 67 years (IQR 58–74) and 268 (33%) were women and 538 (66%) were men. Between baseline and 12 months, the median sodium intake decreased from 2286 mg/day (IQR 1653–3005) to 1658 mg/day (1301–2189) in the low sodium group and from 2119 mg/day (1673–2804) to 2073 mg/day (1541–2900) in the usual care group. By 12 months, events comprising the primary outcome had occurred in 60 (15%) of 397 patients in the low sodium diet group and 70 (17%) of 409 in the usual care group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·89 [95% CI 0·63–1·26]; p = 0·53). All-cause death occurred in 22 (6%) patients in the low sodium diet group and 17 (4%) in the usual care group (HR 1·38 [0·73–2·60]; p = 0·32), cardiovascular-related hospitalisation occurred in 40 (10%) patients in the low sodium diet group and 51 (12%) patients in the usual care group (HR 0·82 [0·54–1·24]; p = 0·36), and cardiovascular-related emergency department visits occurred in 17 (4%) patients in the low sodium diet group and 15 (4%) patients in the usual care group (HR 1·21 [0·60–2·41]; p = 0·60). No safety events related to the study treatment were reported in either group.

Interpretation

In ambulatory patients with heart failure, a dietary intervention to reduce sodium intake did not reduce clinical events.

### Estimates of dietary sodium consumption in patients with chronic heart failure [^dab7824e]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Estimating dietary sodium intake is a key component of dietary assessment in the clinical setting of HF to effectively implement appropriate dietary interventions for sodium reduction and monitor adherence to the dietary treatment. In a research setting, assessment of sodium intake is crucial to an essential methodology to evaluate outcomes after a dietary or behavioral intervention. Current available sodium intake assessment methods include 24-hour urine collection, spot urine collections, multiple day food records, food recalls, and food frequency questionnaires. However, these methods have inherent limitations that make assessment of sodium intake challenging, and the utility of traditional methods may be questionable for estimating sodium intake in patients with HF. Thus, there are remaining questions about how to best assess dietary sodium intake in this patient population, and there is a need to identify a reliable method to assess and monitor sodium intake in the research and clinical setting of HF. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current methods for sodium intake assessment, addresses the challenges for its accurate evaluation, and highlights the relevance of applying the highest-quality measurement methods in the research setting to minimize the risk of biased data.

### Reduction of dietary sodium to less than 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF): an international, open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^c51fa5e6]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study SODIUM-HF was published by Justin A Ezekowitz and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the SODIUM-HF study, the trial question was: what is the role of dietary intervention to reduce sodium intake in patients with HF? In the SODIUM-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SODIUM-HF study, the population was: 806 patients (268 female, 538 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with chronic HF receiving optimally tolerated medical treatment. The key exclusion criteria were average dietary intake of sodium < 1,500 mg/day; serum sodium < 130 mmol/L; renal failure; hepatic failure; uncontrolled thyroid disorder; uncontrolled AF; hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes in the previous month. In the SODIUM-HF study, the interventions were: n = 397 reduced sodium intake (sodium intake < 1,500 mg/day) n = 409 usual sodium intake (usual care according to local guidelines). In the SODIUM-HF study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in a composite of admission to hospital for cardiovascular causes, emergency department visit for cardiovascular causes, or death from all causes at 12 months (15% vs. 17%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.26). In the SODIUM-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes (6% vs. 4%; HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.6) No significant difference in hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (10% vs. 12%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.24) No significant difference in cardiovascular-related emergency department visits (4% vs. 4%; HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.41). In the SODIUM-HF study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with chronic HF receiving optimally tolerated medical treatment, reduced sodium intake was not superior to usual sodium intake with respect to a composite of admission to hospital for cardiovascular causes, emergency department visit for cardiovascular causes, or death from all causes at 12 months.

### Sodium restriction in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^5331a11e]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium restriction is a nonpharmacologic treatment suggested by practice guidelines for the management of patients with heart failure (HF). In this study, we synthesized the data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of sodium restriction on clinical outcomes in patients with HF.

Methods

In this aggregate data meta-analysis, Cochrane Central, MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), Embase Ovid, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) Plus databases were searched up to April 2, 2022. RCTs were included if they investigated the effects of sodium/salt restriction as compared to no restriction on clinical outcomes in patients with HF. Outcomes of interest included mortality, hospitalization, change in New York Heart Association functional class, and quality of life (QoL).

Results

Seventeen RCTs were identified (834 and 871 patients in intervention and control groups, respectively). Sodium restriction did not reduce the risk of all-cause death (odds ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.58–1.58]), hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.62–1.13]), or the composite of death/hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.63–1.23]). The results were similar in different subgroups, except for the numerically lower risk of death with reduced sodium intake reported in RCTs with dietary sodium at the 2000 to 3000 mg/d range as opposed to < 2000 mg/d (and in RCTs with versus without fluid restriction as a co-intervention). Among RCTs reporting New York Heart Association change, 2 RCTs (which accounted for two-thirds of the data) showed improvement in New York Heart Association class with sodium restriction. Substantial heterogeneity existed for QoL: 6 RCTs showed improvement of QoL and 4 RCTs showed no improvement of sodium restriction on QoL.

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis of RCTs, sodium restriction was not associated with fewer deaths or hospitalizations in patients with HF. Dietary sodium restriction may be associated with improvements in symptoms and QoL.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025 advises individuals 14 years and older to limit their consumption to 2, 300 mg/day; this aligns with recommendations from the National Academies. sodium intake to 2, 300 mg/day4 by encouraging sodium reduction over the short term to achieve an average intake of 3, 000 mg/day; 3 Above this level, sodium intake should be reduced in order to reduce the risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease; lower levels are recommended for children younger than 14 years of age. 4 The Dietary Guidelines recommendation is for individuals aged 14 and older to limit intake of sodium to less than 2, 300 mg/day. The CDRR level for individuals ages 14 years and older set by the NASEM 2019 Dietary Reference Intakes for sodium and potassium report is 2, 300 mg of sodium per day. The recommendations for children.

- Reduction in sodium levels should progress gradually to allow time for product reformulation;
- Population-level sodium intake reduction should progress at a pace such that consumer preferences and expectations for saltiness in foods adjust; 7
- Reduction in sodium levels should not lead to reformulation that negatively affects the nutritional quality of the foods by modifying other nutrient levels. The recommendations of scientific groups that are. countries found no evidence of adverse effects from initiatives to reduce sodium intake.

This guidance supports the goal of reducing sodium intake as recommended by scientific consensus groups, by focusing on short-term reduction to 3, 000 mg/day as a gradual approach to sodium reduction in the food supply. The guidance reflects the broad consensus among experts. 13 For discussions of FDA's regulation of sodium, see generally 72 FR 59973 and 47 FR 26590.

### Three Gram sodium intake is associated with longer event-free survival only in patients with advanced heart failure [^5b63c900]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence to support the recommendation that patients with heart failure (HF) restrict sodium intake. The purpose of this study was to compare differences in cardiac event-free survival between patients with sodium intake above and below 3 g.

Methods

A total of 302 patients with HF (67% male, 62 ± 12 years, 54% New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III/IV, ejection fraction 34 ± 14%) collected a 24-hour urine sodium (UNa) to indicate sodium intake. Patients were divided into 2 groups using a 3-g UNa cutpoint and stratified by NYHA Class (I/II vs. III/IV). Event-free survival for 12 months was determined by patient or family interviews and medical record review. Differences in cardiac event-free survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival curve with log-rank test and Cox hazard regression.

Results

The Cox regression hazard ratio for 24-hour UNa ≥ 3 g in NYHA Class I/II was 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20–0.97) and 2.54 (95% CI = 1.10–5.84) for NYHA III/IV after controlling for age, gender, HF etiology, body mass index, ejection fraction, and total comorbidity score.

Conclusions

These data suggest that 3 g dietary sodium restriction may be most appropriate for patients in NYHA functional Classes III and IV.

### Rationale and design of the study of dietary intervention under 100 MMOL in heart failure (SODIUM-HF) [^364e10e6]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) remain at high risk for future events despite medical and device therapy. Dietary sodium reduction is often recommended based on limited evidence. However, it is not known whether dietary sodium reduction reduces the morbidity or mortality associated with HF.

Methods

The SODIUM study is a pragmatic, randomized, open-label trial assessing the efficacy of dietary sodium reduction to < 1500 mg daily counseling compared to usual care for patients with chronic HF. The intervention is provided by trained personnel at the site and uses 3-day food records for directing counseling. The primary outcome is an intention-to-treat analysis on the time to first cardiovascular event or death measured at 12 months. Secondary end points include the change in quality of life (using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), change in New York Heart Association class, and change in 6-minute walk test. The first patient was enrolled in March 2014, and subsequently, 27 sites in 6 countries enrolled patients.

Conclusions

The SODIUM-HF trial will provide a robust evaluation of the effects of dietary sodium reduction in patients with HF. Results are expected in 2020.

Dietary patterns

Sodium restriction and the DASH diet

Dietary sodium restriction is one of the most common self-care recommendations for patients with HF. Increased sodium intake frequently occurs before HF decompensation, and HF hospitalizations increase in parallel with reported sodium consumption. However, concerns exist about neurohormonal activation and decreased renal perfusion if dietary sodium restriction is too strict. Current guidelines only state that avoiding excessive sodium intake is "reasonable" for symptomatic patients with HF, reflecting a lack of strong evidence for this practice.

To date, the only trial conducted solely in patients with HFpEF randomized 53 inpatients to aggressive sodium (800 mg/d) and fluid (800 ml/day) restriction, with no difference in weight loss or congestion score over 7 days, with an increase in thirst and reduction in calorie intake in the intervention group. The SODIUM-HF (Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure) trial randomized 806 patients with chronic HF (277 with left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 40%) to dietitian-guided sodium restriction (goal 1,500 mg/day) vs usual dietary guidance. Overall, there was no difference in cardiovascular hospitalization or mortality over 12 months of follow-up, and no significant interaction by EF. Patients in the intervention group had modest improvement in disease-related quality of life (+3.38 points adjusted difference in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, P = 0.011) and were more likely to improve NYHA functional class, but these data have not been reported in the LVEF > 40% subgroup. A recent meta-analysis of 17 dietary intervention trials that followed the publication of SODIUM-HF found no reduction in hospitalization or mortality with sodium restriction in patients with HF.

Heart failure dietary sodium restriction — pilot randomized controlled trials: A recent pilot RCT (N = 27) showed that providing patients with 1.5 g/d sodium meals can reduce urinary sodium and improve QOL but not improve clinical outcomes. Another recent pilot RCT (N = 38) of 1.5 versus 2.3 g/d sodium resulted in improvement in BNP levels and QOL in the 1.5 g/d sodium intake arm; the full trial is due to be completed in 2022. A third pilot RCT (N = 66) of home-delivered 1.5 g/d meals showed favorable but nonsignificant trends toward improvement in clinical status and readmission rates, and results from RCTs have shown that reducing dietary sodium is difficult to achieve in patients with HF, even with prepared meals or home visits.

### Recommendation of low-salt diet and short-term outcomes in heart failure with preserved systolic function [^4d6c06ef]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary sodium indiscretion frequently contributes to hospitalizations in elderly heart failure patients. Animal models suggest an important role for dietary sodium intake in the pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved systolic function. The documentation and effects of hospital discharge recommendations, particularly for sodium-restricted diet, have not been extensively investigated in heart failure with preserved systolic function.

Methods

We analyzed 1700 heart failure admissions to Michigan community hospitals. We compared documentation of guideline-based discharge recommendations between preserved systolic function and systolic heart failure patients with chi-squared testing, and used logistic regression to identify predictors of 30-day death and hospital readmission in a prespecified follow-up cohort of 443 patients with preserved systolic function. We hypothesized that patients who received a documented discharge recommendation for sodium-restricted diet would have lower 30-day adverse event rates.

Results

Heart failure patients with preserved systolic function were significantly less likely than systolic heart failure patients to receive discharge recommendations for weight monitoring (33% vs 43%) and sodium-restricted diet (42% vs 53%). Upon propensity score-adjusted multivariable analysis, patients with preserved systolic function who received a documented sodium-restricted diet recommendation had decreased odds of 30-day combined death and readmission (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.79; P = 0.007). No other discharge recommendations predicted 30-day outcomes.

Conclusions

Clinicians document appropriate discharge instructions less frequently in heart failure with preserved systolic function than systolic heart failure. Selected heart failure patients with preserved systolic function who receive advice for sodium-restricted diet may have improved short-term outcomes after hospital discharge.

### A review of the DASH diet as an optimal dietary plan for symptomatic heart failure [^f19ad8d8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Despite tremendous focus, effort, drug and device development and resources dedicated to the care of patients at risk for and with heart failure (HF), the epidemic continues. The HF patient presents with a widely deranged physiology and typically at the same time is malnourished adding to the disease complexity and therapeutic challenges. Most nutritional approaches for patients with HF focus on dietary restrictions (of salt and water) and lack uniformity or clarity or focus on meeting nutritional needs, barriers and deficits of the patient with HF. Finally, it seems reasonable to anticipate that any dietary program recommendation should contribute in a positive way toward HF management goals and at its foundation positively contribute to the deranged physiology. In many ways the "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension" (DASH) dietary program fulfills these needs and early evidence supports the notion that the DASH diet may be optimal for patients with HF. This brief review examines some of this evidence and provides recommendations for the HF community.

### The current state of evidence for sodium and fluid restriction in heart failure [^0bc95505]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The field of heart failure has evolved in terms of the therapies that are available including pharmaceutical and device therapies. There is now substantial randomized trial data to indicate that dietary sodium restriction does not provide the reduction in clinical events with accepted heterogeneity in the clinical trial results. Dietary sodium restriction should be considered for some but not all patients and with different objectives than clinical outcomes but instead for potential quality of life benefit. In addition, fluid restriction, once the mainstay of clinical practice, has not shown to be of any additional benefit for patients in hospital or in the ambulatory care setting and therefore should be considered to be used cautiously (if at all) in clinical practice. Further developments and clinical trials are needed in this area to better identify patients who may benefit or have harm from these lower cost interventions and future research should focus on large scale, high quality, clinical trials rather than observational data to drive clinical practice.

### Salt intake and cardiovascular disease: why are the data inconsistent? [^3da48bc6]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Effective population-based interventions are required to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Reducing salt intake has emerged as a leading target, with many guidelines recommending sodium intakes of 2.3 g/day or lower. These guideline thresholds are based largely on clinical trials reporting a reduction in blood pressure with low, compared with moderate, intake. However, no large-scale randomized trials have been conducted to determine the effect of low sodium intake on CV events. Prospective cohort studies evaluating the association between sodium intake and CV outcomes have been inconsistent and a number of recent studies have reported an association between low sodium intake (in the range recommended by current guidelines) and an increased risk of CV death. In the largest of these studies, a J-shaped association between sodium intake and CV death and heart failure was found. Despite a large body of research in this area, there are divergent interpretations of these data, with some advocating a re-evaluation of the current guideline recommendations. In this article, we explore potential reasons for the differing interpretations of existing evidence on the association between sodium intake and CVD. Similar to other areas in prevention, the controversy is likely to remain unresolved until large-scale definitive randomized controlled trials are conducted to determine the effect of low sodium intake (compared to moderate intake) on CVD incidence.

Self‐care Management behaviour

Self‐care behaviour to respond appropriately to symptoms

Appropriate responses to symptoms include patients adjusting their diuretic dose, contacting a health care provider, and decreasing activity level as well as fluid and salt intake.

Current guidelines and evidence

HF guidelines recommend diuretics to improve symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with signs and/or symptoms of congestion, and they should likewise be considered to reduce the risk of hospitalization in these same patients. 14
A flexible and individualized diuretic dosing regimen may improve quality of life and help reduce emergency department visits and HF‐related hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF. 116
Despite the guideline recommendation to use the lowest possible dose of diuretics and discontinue loop diuretics if possible, little information is available on discontinuing loop diuretics in contemporary treated patients with HF. 117, 118
Adjustment of diuretic therapy (often an increase) may improve outcomes. 104

### Dietary sodium intake and outcomes: a secondary analysis from sodium-HF [^2b028bed]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This post hoc analysis of SODIUM-HF (Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure) assessed the association between baseline dietary sodium intake and change at 6 months with a composite of cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations, emergency department visits and all-cause death at 12 and 24 months.

Background

Dietary sodium restriction is common advice for patients with heart failure (HF). Randomized clinical trials have not shown a beneficial effect of dietary sodium restriction on clinical outcomes.

Methods

A multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to assess the association of dietary sodium intake measured at randomization with primary and secondary endpoints.

Results

The study included 792 participants. Baseline sodium intake was ≤ 1500 mg/day in 19.9% (n = 158), 1501–3000 mg/day in 56.5% (n = 448) and > 3000 mg/day in 23.4% (n = 186) of participants. The factors associated with higher baseline sodium intake were higher calorie consumption, higher body mass index and recruitment from Canada. Multivariable analyses showed no association between baseline sodium intake nor magnitude of 6-month change or 12- or 24-month outcomes. In a responder analysis, participants achieving a sodium intake < 1500 mg at 6 months showed an association with a decreased risk for the composite outcome (adjusted HR 0.52 [95% CI 0.25, 1.07] P = 0.08) and CV hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.24, 1.09] P = 0.08) at 12 months.

Conclusion

There was no association between dietary sodium intake and clinical outcomes over 24 months in patients with HF. Responder analyses suggest the need for further investigation of the effects of sodium reduction in those who achieve the targeted dietary sodium-reduction level.

### A high-sodium diet is associated with acute decompensated heart failure in ambulatory heart failure patients: a prospective follow-up study [^7e936e86]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A low-sodium diet is an accepted treatment of patients with heart failure (HF), although minimal evidence exists on the appropriate amount of sodium intake for this population. Certain HF guidelines have liberalized dietary sodium recommendations, which actually exceed guidelines for healthy adults.

Objectives

We tested the hypothesis that high sodium intake is related to acute decompensated HF (ADHF) in ambulatory HF patients. Secondary outcomes included all-cause hospitalization and mortality.

Design

We prospectively enrolled medically stable, ambulatory patients with systolic HF (n = 123; mean ± SD age: 60 ± 13 y) from 2 outpatient HF clinics from 2003 to 2007. Baseline estimates of dietary sodium and other nutrient intakes were obtained from two 3-d food records.

Results

The median follow-up time was 3.0 y. Mean (± SD) sodium intakes were 1.4 ± 0.3, 2.4 ± 0.3, and 3.8 ± 0.8 g Na/d in the lower, middle, and upper tertiles, respectively. Cumulative ADHF event rates at 3 y were 12 ± 6%, 15 ± 7%, and 46 ± 11% in the low, middle, and upper tertiles, respectively (log-rank P = 0.001). For ADHF, the upper tertile was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.55 (95% CI: 1.61, 4.04; P < 0.001). Time-to-event probabilities were significant for mortality (log-rank P = 0.022) but not for all-cause hospitalization (log-rank P = 0.224). The high-sodium tertile was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.83; P = 0.018) for all-cause hospitalization and 3.54 (95% CI: 1.46, 8.62; P = 0.005) for mortality.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this study provides the first prospective evidence that ambulatory HF patients who consume higher amounts of sodium are at greater risk of an ADHF event. These data provide support for more stringent sodium intake guidelines than those currently recommended for HF patients.

### Dietary sodium restriction for heart failure: a systematic review of intervention outcomes and behavioral determinants [^3bc1cc38]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The 1500 mg/d dietary sodium restriction commonly recommended for patients with heart failure has recently been questioned. Poor adherence to sodium-restricted diets makes assessing the efficacy of sodium restriction challenging. Therefore, successful behavioral interventions are needed. We reviewed sodium restriction trials and descriptive studies of sodium restriction to: 1) determine if sodium restriction was achieved in interventions among heart failure patients; and 2) characterize predictors of successful dietary sodium restriction. Among 638 identified studies, 10 intervention trials, and 25 descriptive studies met inclusion criteria. We used content analysis to extract information about sodium restriction and behavioral determinants of sodium restriction. Dietary sodium was reduced in 7 trials; none achieved 1500 mg/d (range 1938–4564 mg/d). The interventions implemented in the interventional trials emphasized knowledge, skills, and self-regulation strategies, but few addressed the determinants correlated with successful sodium restriction in the descriptive studies (eg, social/cultural norms, social support, taste preferences, food access, self-efficacy). Findings suggest that incorporating determinants predictive of successful dietary sodium restriction may improve the success of interventional trials. Without effective interventions to deploy in trials, the safety and efficacy of sodium restriction remains unknown.

### Self-care of heart failure patients: practical management recommendations from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^8c0f94d4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Tailored advice for patients and their caregivers should be provided considering their actual food and fluid intake, symptoms and current medication use. Severely ill patients with HF with low quality of life and decreased life expectancy should not be burdened with extensive lifestyle changes which may be of limited benefit.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Do not judge others for their lifestyle choices or behaviour.
Educate the patient on a healthy, varied diet. This can be done by a team member of the HF team and specialist consultation of a dietician might be needed.
Because weight reduction may confer metabolic and functional benefits, it is reasonable to recommend weight loss for selected patients, especially if young, functionally limited by overweight, and morbidly obesity (e.g. BMI > 35 kg/m 2). However, weight loss may be especially challenging for patients and caregivers already managing chronic HF. 10
Ask during every outpatient encounter about food intake. It is reasonable for patients with HF to be screened for unintentional weight loss at least annually, because of the strong association between cachexia and adverse clinical outcomes. It is important to detect early weight loss and loss of appetite. Research primarily focused on cancer patients found that identification of so‐called 'pre‐cachexia' and the provision of tailored nutritional counselling, helped maintain nutritional status, improve treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes. 35 Such findings might be applicable to a HF population. Consider regular (twice yearly) blood tests to check for iron levels and other micronutrients if history suggests this may be required. 10
Offer counselling to those who present with malnutrition or alcohol dependency. Referral to nutritionist or dietician with CV expertise should be offered to patients with cachexia, morbid obesity, or unhealthy food intake. Consider referral for support (addiction expertise) if the patient wishes to stop drinking alcohol.
Ask patients if they take any supplements (including vitamins) and the rationale for it. Supplements have not been studied in large randomized trials and the general recommendation is to gain these micronutrients from a varied diet to prevent depletion. Some supplements might be expensive, some contain high levels of sodium or potassium without the patient and health care provider knowing about it.

Recommendations for future research

Weight management tailored for overweight patients with HF.
Optimal fluid and salt management in patients with HF.
The need for micronutrient supplementation in patients with HF.
Optimal dietary advice for cachectic patients

### Dietary counseling to reduce moderate sodium intake. concerns about the methods, evidence and feasibility of lowering sodium intake [^696767e1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Smyth et al. do not provide adequate context when stating that "observational studies report conflicting findings on the association of low sodium intake with CVD and mortality, with some studies reporting a higher risk at low intake (< 3 g/day) compared to moderate intake", and that a recent large RCT in patients with heart failure did not report a lower risk of mortality of CVD with low sodium intake. Smyth et al. also state long term dietary advice studies are ineffective at reducing sodium below 3000 mg/day which contrasts with major trials of dietary advice that lowered sodium intake to less than 3000 mg/day.

A meta-analysis of RCTs based on dietary advice had an average reduction in sodium intake from 3646 to 2690 mg/day with a 26% reduction in CVD and a linear association of CVD with sodium intake down to 2300 mg/day. Thus, dietary advice is feasible to lower dietary sodium below 3000 mg/day and reduces CVD. Furthermore, an analysis of cohort studies that used the recommended multiple 24 h urine collections found a linear association of sodium intake from 1846 to 5230 mg/day with CVD. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and 75 national and international nongovernmental organizations have stated that low quality research, such as the cohort studies Smyth et al. cited as showing higher CVD with lower sodium intake, are a driver of the controversy regarding the health benefits of reducing dietary sodium and that nongovernmental organizations have also expressed concern that misinformation about dietary sodium is also a driver of controversy. The change in dietary sodium in the large RCT in heart failure, based on dietary advice, that Smyth et al. cited, reduced dietary sodium from 2286 to 1658 mg/day, far lower than Smyth et al. claim is not feasible and the reduction was associated with an improvement in quality of life and NYHA functional class of heart failure (although mortality was not significantly changed).

The study by Smyth et al. shows that in the current food environment, it is difficult for individuals to sustain lower sodium intake long-term. Thus, upstream interventions, (e.g. mandatory sodium targets for processed foods), are urgently needed and strongly recommended to improve the food system to reduce sodium intake.

### Impact of dietary sodium restriction on heart failure outcomes [^545e44a8]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the impact of sodium restriction on heart failure (HF) outcomes.

Background

Although sodium restriction is advised for patients with HF, data on sodium restriction and HF outcomes are inconsistent.

Methods

We analyzed data from the multihospital HF Adherence and Retention Trial, which enrolled 902 New York Heart Association functional class II/III HF patients and followed them up for a median of 36 months. Sodium intake was serially assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Based on the mean daily sodium intake prior to the first event of death or HF hospitalization, patients were classified into sodium restricted (< 2,500 mg/d) and unrestricted (≥ 2,500 mg/d) groups. Study groups were propensity score matched according to plausible baseline confounders. The primary outcome was a composite of death or HF hospitalization. The secondary outcomes were cardiac death and HF hospitalization.

Results

Sodium intake data were available for 833 subjects (145 sodium restricted, 688 sodium unrestricted), of whom 260 were propensity matched into sodium restricted (n = 130) and sodium unrestricted (n = 130) groups. Sodium restriction was associated with significantly higher risk of death or HF hospitalization (42.3% vs. 26.2%; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 2.84; p = 0.004), derived from an increase in the rate of HF hospitalization (32.3% vs. 20.0%; HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.96; p = 0.015) and a nonsignificant increase in the rate of cardiac death (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 0.70 to 3.73; p = 0.257) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.074). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that sodium restriction was associated with increased risk of death or HF hospitalization in patients not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (HR: 5.78; 95% CI: 1.93 to 17.27; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

In symptomatic patients with chronic HF, sodium restriction may have a detrimental impact on outcome. A randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively address the role of sodium restriction in HF management. (A Self-management Intervention for Mild to Moderate Heart Failure [HART]; NCT00018005).

### Effect of lower sodium intake on health: systematic review and meta-analyses [^2ea0e7e0]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this review

Strengths of our review include the inclusion and synthesis of all available randomised controlled trial and epidemiological evidence on sodium intake for both positive and negative health outcomes; the transparent reporting of studies found, screened, and included and excluded; the evaluation of the entire body of evidence; the generation of overall effect estimates and conclusions across a large number and variety of studies; and the evaluation of the quality of evidence following the GRADE methodology.

Limitations include a limited number of outcomes, with the exclusion of acutely ill and special populations; and the constraints of the GRADE methodology on the low grading given to observational cohort studies. The GRADE methodology categorises a body of evidence from observational studies (for example, cohort studies) as low quality, and although the methodology liberally downgrades evidence it is conservative in upgrading evidence to a higher quality rating. Therefore the quality of evidence from cohort studies is almost exclusively low and very low using the GRADE methodology. Constraints on time and resources, as well as the deliberate scoping of the review to be relevant to public health guidance, led to the exclusion of cellular and animal studies and case studies on sodium intake and physiology. Likewise, outcomes that might be of interest, such as bone health or certain types of cancer, were also not included. Because the objective of the review was to inform the WHO guideline development process for the generation of a sodium intake guideline for most people globally, studies in unique populations such as patients with heart failure and other acute illnesses were also not included. The scoping of the review was completed in a systematic manner following the WHO guideline review committee handbookto ensure that all priority questions needed to review and potentially revise WHO guidelines on sodium intake were answered.

Nonpharmacological management — fluid restriction for hyponatremia in advanced heart failure carries a Class of Recommendation 2b and Level of Evidence C-LD: For patients with advanced HF and hyponatremia, the benefit of fluid restriction to reduce congestive symptoms is uncertain. Supportive text notes that in a registry study of hyponatremia in acute decompensated HF, fluid restriction only improved hyponatremia marginally; a registered dietitian–guided fluid and sodium restriction intervention improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were not in stage D HF, and fluid restriction improved quality of life (QOL) in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with HFrEF and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (NYHA class I to IV); however, in a meta-analysis of RCTs, restricted fluid intake compared with free fluid consumption did not result in reduced hospitalization or mortality rates, changes in thirst, the duration of intravenous diuretic use, serum creatinine, or serum sodium levels, and the validity of a prior trial supporting clinical benefits of fluid restriction is in serious question.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers approved for the treatment of HF are recommended in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF who are ACEI-intolerant (Level of Evidence: A). Drugs known to adversely affect the clinical status of patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF should be avoided or withdrawn whenever possible.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dietary salt (NaCl) provides the body with sodium, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and a variety of physiological functions. Sodium plays a pivotal role in maintaining extracellular fluid volume and osmolality, as well as in transmembrane transport, particularly by mediating membrane and action potentials via sodium/potassium exchange. It is well established that the quantity of salt required to maintain normal physiological homeostasis in adult humans is < 1.25 g/d. However, in modern diets, daily salt intake far exceeds this amount. For example, epidemiological studies demonstrate that the average daily sodium consumption of most people in the United States is > 3.2 g (equivalent to > 8 g salt, sodium × 2.5 = salt). The general average intake of salt reached 10.06 g/d, and in some populations it has reached approximately 15 to 25 g/d. Ample evidence has shown that long‐term over‐consumption of salt is harmful to health, contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly hypertension. As such, health organizations around the world have established dietary guidelines for daily salt intake. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020‐2025 recommend that daily sodium intake in healthy adults should not exceed 2.3 g (5.75 g salt). The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to lower daily dietary salt intake to < 5 g/d. In addition to avoiding excess consumption, low‐salt diets have been encouraged for patients with CVD, particularly heart failure (HF). However, given that sodium ions are an essential noncaloric nutrient, there has been some controversy in the field concerning how large the reduction in salt intake should be. In light of the potential shortcomings of sodium restriction, salt replacement therapy has been proposed as an alternative treatment strategy; this has been tested in the population, with encouraging results.

With this background, the Heart Failure Society of America, European Society of Cardiology, ACC, and AHA recommend exercise training or regular physical activity in patients with HF.

Dietary Sodium Restriction

A meta-analysis of 85 studies reports an approximately linear relation between dietary sodium intake and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in normotensive individuals and in patients with hypertension. The current guidelines on hypertension recommend a dietary intake of sodium restricted to < 100 mmol (≈5.8 g sodium chloride) per day. A high dietary sodium intake is considered to enhance sympathetic activity, likely mediated by the brainstem. Direct infusion of sodium into cerebrospinal fluid elevated blood pressure and increased sympathetic activity in the adrenal glands of rodents. Accordingly, a high sodium intake is associated with high levels of plasma norepinephrine in patients with salt-sensitive hypertension. It is unknown whether ANS modulation by dietary sodium restriction influences HF and AF. However, sodium restriction is recommended in patients with HF to reduce congestive symptoms, likely by attenuating fluid retention.

2.2 Salt reduction: For better or for worse?

Given the deleterious effects of salt intake on CVD, salt reduction has been suggested to reduce the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular events. Previous studies have reported that reductions in dietary salt can protect against salt‐associated diseases, lowering BP and decreasing the risk of CVD. In a 4‐month RCT among healthy families, individuals receiving salt‐reduced bread had beneficial changes in cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, low‐salt diets can significantly reduce SBP in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In light of such findings, in another RCT, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, rich in whole grains, poultry, fish and nuts but lower in sodium, was used for 30 days, and participants were found to have reduced BP. In a prospective observational study involving 36 019 participants, the DASH diet was associated with a lower incidence of HF and reduced HF hospitalization. Therefore, all HF clinical practice guidelines recommend sodium restriction for patients with HF, including the 2022 ACC/AHA heart failure guidelines. The beneficial effects of sodium restriction on HF are thought to be achieved by reducing SBP and DBP, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness, inflammation, and aldosterone levels.

Despite the CVD benefits associated with sodium restriction, salt reduction interventions have also been observed to cause contrasting, paradoxical effects on cardiovascular health. In a recent open‐label RCT (the SODIUM‐HF study) in patients with HF recruited from six countries across the globe, the authors reported sodium restriction resulted in minimal effects on future adverse cardiovascular events. Previous evidence has shown that salt deficiency elevated low‐density lipoprotein, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. A recent observational study analysed data from the HART study and demonstrated that sodium restriction (< 2.5 g/d) in patients with HF was associated with an increased risk of death or hospitalization compared to those without a sodium‐restricted diet. Likewise, low sodium intake showed worsened systemic inflammation in HF patients. Moreover, studies showed that sodium restriction can cause inadequacies in macronutrients and micronutrients that could be associated with clinical instability. Therefore, due to inconsistent evidence, there has been some debate about the clinical benefits or harm of sodium/salt restriction in HF patients. As such, more randomized clinical trials with larger sample sizes and sufficient racial and ethnic diversity are needed to definitively address the role of sodium restriction in HF management. Finally, it is important to note that effective salt reduction is very difficult to achieve at the individual level.

### The long-term effects of dietary sodium restriction on clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure. the SODIUM-HF (study of dietary intervention under 100 mmol in heart failure): a pilot study [^b1a8c30f]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing a low-sodium to a moderate-sodium diet in heart failure (HF) patients.

Methods and Results

Patients with HF (New York Heart Association classes II-III) were randomized to low (1500 mg/d) or moderate-sodium (2300 mg/d) diet. Dietary intake was evaluated using 3-day food records. The end points were changes in quality of life as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels from baseline to 6 months of follow-up presented as medians [25th, 75th percentiles]. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (19/group). After 6 months, median sodium intake declined from 2137 to 1398 mg/d in the low-sodium and from 2678 to 1461 mg/d in the moderate-sodium diet group. Median BNP levels in the low-sodium diet group declined (216–71 pg/mL, P = 0.006), whereas in the moderate-sodium diet group, there was no change in BNP (171–188 pg/mL, P = 0.7; P = 0.17 between groups). For 6 months, median KCCQ clinical score increased in both groups (63–75 [P = 0.006] in the low-sodium diet group and 66–73 [P = 0.07] in the moderate-sodium group; P = 0.4 between groups). At 6 months, a post hoc analysis based on the dietary sodium intake achieved (> or ≤ 1,500 mg/d) in all patients showed an association between a sodium intake ≤ 1,500 mg/d and improvement in BNP levels and KCCQ scores.

Conclusions

A dietary intervention restricting sodium intake was feasible, and achievement of this sodium goal was associated with lower BNP levels and improved quality of life in patients with HF.

Dehydration and drugs — syncope management recommendations state that fluid resuscitation via oral or intravenous bolus is recommended in patients with syncope due to acute dehydration, and reducing or withdrawing medications that may cause hypotension can be beneficial in selected patients with syncope. In selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake, and rehydration, whether by intravenous or oral formulation, should include sodium supplementation for more rapid recovery. Additional dietary sodium may be provided as sodium tablets or sodium already dissolved in beverages, and higher-sodium-content beverages with osmolality comparable to normal body osmolality may rehydrate faster than lower-sodium-content beverages; this treatment option is not appropriate for patients with cardiac dysfunction or HF, uncontrolled hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.

### A randomized controlled pilot study of outcomes of strict allowance of fluid therapy in hyponatremic heart failure (SALT-HF) [^2774a963]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, fluid restriction recommendations in heart failure (HF) are based on expert opinion. After implementing a 1,000-mL/d fluid restriction for 60 days after discharge, outcomes were examined.

Methods and Results

In a randomized controlled design, hyponatremic patients (serum sodium ≤ 137 mg/dL) received usual care (UC; n = 26) or 1,000 mL/d fluid restriction (n = 20) at discharge. Quality of life (QoL), thirst, difficulty following fluid recommendations, adherence to fluid restriction, HF emergency care, HF rehospitalization, and all-cause death were examined. Mean age was 62.8 ± 12.8 years; 46% were white. There were no differences by group in baseline demographics, comorbidities, and QoL, except that more UC patients had New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV status (P = 0.019). Median [interquartile range] QoL scores were better in the 1,000 mL/d group for symptom burden (83.3 [68.8–91.7] vs 50 [29.2–79.2]; P = 0.018), total symptoms (77.1 [58.1–91.7] vs 54.2 [30.2–73.9]; P = 0.022), overall QoL summary (72.6 [52.2–86.3] vs 51.0 [37.7–68.5]; P = 0.038), and clinical QoL summary (75.5 [57.8–92.9] vs 59.1 [35.7–77.3]; P = 0.039). There were no group differences in thirst, difficulty adhering to fluid recommendations, adherence to fluid restriction, or health care consumption.

Conclusions

The 1,000 mL/d fluid restriction led to improved QoL at 60 days after discharge. Future research in a larger more heterogeneous sample is needed.

Dehydration-related syncope — salt and fluid repletion states that in selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake. In patients with dehydration, sodium supplementation improves plasma volume and improves orthostatic tolerance, and additional dietary sodium may be provided as sodium tablets or sodium already dissolved in beverages; higher-sodium-content beverages with osmolality comparable to normal body osmolality may rehydrate faster than lower-sodium-content beverages. This treatment option is not appropriate for patients with cardiac dysfunction or heart failure (HF), uncontrolled hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.

### Dietary sodium adherence is poor in chronic heart failure patients [^d42aedf4]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to determine the rates and predictors of dietary sodium restriction and to evaluate the reliability of 24-hour urine collection as a tool to estimate dietary sodium intake in heart failure (HF) patients.

Methods and Results

We evaluated the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion of 305 outpatients with HF and reduced ejection fraction who were educated on following a < 2 g sodium diet. The mean sodium excretion according to a single sample from each participant was 3.15 ± 1.58 g, and 23% were adherent to the < 2 g recommendation. One hundred sixty-eight participants provided 2 samples with urinary creatinine excretion within normative range. Averaging both resulted in a mean sodium excretion of 3.21 ± 1.20 g and lower adherence rates to the < 2-gram diet: 14% versus 23% (P = 0.019). Multivariate logistic regression showed only male sex and higher body mass index (BMI) to be associated with nonadherence (male: odds ratio [OR] 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–3.88; 1 unit BMI: OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.10). Bland-Altman plots of urinary sodium and creatinine showed poor reproducibility between samples.

Conclusions

In this chronic HF population, sodium consumption probably exceeds recommended amounts, particularly in men and those with higher BMI. Urine analyses were not highly reproducible, suggesting variation in both diet and urine collection.

### Potential contributing factors to noncompliance with dietary sodium restriction in patients with heart failure [^b06b2279]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although sodium restriction is considered essential in the management of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), there are no data available regarding patients awareness of and ability to comply with the sodium restriction guideline.

Methods

Between May 1999 and August 2000, 50 patients referred to the Parkland Memorial Hospital CHF clinic were assessed by a registered dietitian for (1) awareness of the sodium restriction guideline, (2) ability to read the sodium content from a Nutrition Facts label, and (3) ability to sort 12 food containers, all bearing a Nutrition Facts label, into high- and low-sodium groups. A global measure of dietary sodium knowledge was calculated ("sodium knowledge score", range 0–10). These tests were repeated after the patient completed one or more educational sessions (mean 2.8 ± 1.5) with the dietitian.

Results

The proportion of patients aware of the sodium restriction guideline was 14% at baseline and 42% at follow-up (P < .01). The proportion of patients able to read the sodium content from the Nutrition Facts label was 58% at baseline and 92% at follow-up (P < .01). The sodium knowledge score was 3.8 ± 3.4 at baseline and 5.8 ± 3.2 at follow-up (P < .01). The proportion of subjects who achieved a perfect sodium knowledge score of 10 was 8% at baseline and 26% at follow-up (P < .05). The number of food containers sorted accurately was 10.6 ± 1.5 at baseline and 11.3 ± 1.1 at follow-up, P = 0.09.

Conclusions

On referral to a specialty CHF clinic, many patients had severe deficiencies in their knowledge base regarding dietary sodium intake that would preclude compliance with the sodium restriction guideline. Directed education focusing on sodium intake corrected many of these deficiencies.

### Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^a3d44240]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

An earlier Cochrane review of dietary advice identified insufficient evidence to assess effects of reduced salt intake on mortality or cardiovascular events.

Objectives

1. To assess the long term effects of interventions aimed at reducing dietary salt on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity.2. To investigate whether blood pressure reduction is an explanatory factor in any effect of such dietary interventions on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect (DARE)), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched through to October 2008. References of included studies and reviews were also checked. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Trials fulfilled the following criteria: (1) randomised with follow up of at least six-months, (2) intervention was reduced dietary salt (restricted salt dietary intervention or advice to reduce salt intake), (3) adults, (4) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data was available. Two reviewers independently assessed whether studies met these criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and study validity were compiled by a single reviewer, and checked by a second. Authors were contacted where possible to obtain missing information. Events were extracted and relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs calculated.

Main Results

Seven studies (including 6,489 participants) met the inclusion criteria - three in normotensives (n = 3518), two in hypertensives (n = 758), one in a mixed population of normo- and hypertensives (n = 1981) and one in heart failure (n = 232) with end of trial follow-up of seven to 36 months and longest observational follow up (after trial end) to 12.7 yrs. Relative risks for all cause mortality in normotensives (end of trial RR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.12, 60 deaths; longest follow up RR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.40, 79 deaths) and hypertensives (end of trial RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.13, 513 deaths; longest follow up RR 0.96, 95% CI; 0.83 to 1.11, 565 deaths) showed no strong evidence of any effect of salt reduction. Cardiovascular morbidity in people with normal blood pressure (longest follow-up RR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.20, 200 events) or raised blood pressure at baseline (end of trial RR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.23, 93 events) also showed no strong evidence of benefit. Salt restriction increased the risk of all-cause death in those with congestive heart failure (end of trial relative risk: 2.59, 95% 1.04 to 6.44, 21 deaths). We found no information on participants health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (665 deaths in some 6,250 participants), there is still insufficient power to exclude clinically important effects of reduced dietary salt on mortality or cardiovascular morbidity in normotensive or hypertensive populations. Further RCT evidence is needed to confirm whether restriction of sodium is harmful for people with heart failure. Our estimates of benefits from dietary salt restriction are consistent with the predicted small effects on clinical events attributable to the small blood pressure reduction achieved.

### The dietary quality of persons with heart failure in NHANES 1999–2006 [^2e952ad4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary quality may impact heart failure outcomes. However, the current status of the dietary quality of persons with heart failure has not been previously reported.

Objective

To describe sodium intake, patient factors associated with sodium intake and overall dietary quality in a national sample of persons with heart failure.

Design

Analysis of repeated cross-sectional probability sample surveys using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) of 1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2003–2004 and 2005–2006.

Participants

The study sample consisted of 574 persons with self-reported heart failure (mean age = 70 years; 52% women).

Measurements

Diet of each survey participant was assessed using single 24 hour recall. Dietary nutrients of interest included sodium, the mainstay of heart failure dietary recommendations, and additionally potassium, calcium, magnesium, fish oils, saturated fat and fiber. Specific dietary goals were based on established guidelines.

Results

Mean sodium intake was 2,719 mg, with 34% consuming less than 2,000 mg per day. Patient factors associated with greater sodium intake included male gender, lower education, lower income and no reported diagnosis of hypertension. Mean potassium intake was 2,367 mg/day, with no differences by type of diuretic used or renal disease status. Adherence rates to established guidelines for other nutrients were 13% for calcium, 10% for magnesium, 2% for fish oils, 13% for saturated fat and 4% for fiber.

Conclusions

Dietary quality of persons with self-reported heart failure was poor. Public health approaches and clinical dietary interventions are needed for persons with this increasingly prevalent clinical syndrome.

### The relationship of diuretics and dietary sodium in patients with heart failure: an analysis of the SODIUM-HF trial [^a1d7111f]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

SODIUM-HF was a large clinical trial testing dietary sodium restriction compared to usual care in patients with heart failure that showed no reduction in clinical events. It has been suggested that diuretic doses in response to dietary sodium modification may have influenced the trial results.

Objective

We assessed the effects of baseline diuretic dose and diuretic dose changes on clinical outcomes in the SODIUM-HF trial.

Methods

Diuretics were converted to furosemide-equivalent diuretic total daily doses. Furosemide dose was treated as a continuous variable and also stratified into 0mg, 1mg to 39mg, 40mg, 41mg to 80mg, and > 80mg daily. The baseline diuretic dose and change in diuretic dose were assessed and correlated with dietary sodium restriction and changes in dietary sodium intake. We then examined the relationship between diuretic dosing and the primary outcomes of SODIUM-HF (cardiovascular-related emergency department visit, cardiovascular-related hospitalization, and all-cause mortality).

Results

Of the 806 patients enrolled in the SODIUM-HF trial, 784 had known diuretic status at baseline: 209 patients (26.7%) with 0mg, 134 patients (17%) with 1mg to 39mg, 205 patients (26.1%) with 40mg, 118 patients (15.1%) with 41mg to 80mg, and 118 patients (15.1%) with > 80mg. No correlation was found between dietary sodium intake and diuretic dose, either at baseline or change throughout the study (P > .05). For the primary outcomes, the 2-year risk of primary outcomes was strongly correlated with diuretic dose at baseline across the overall SODIUM-HF population (P < .001). No significant association was found between the treatment arm and the risk of primary outcomes, within each baseline diuretic dose range or with change in diuretic dose (both P > .05).

Conclusions

Although a higher baseline diuretic dose was associated with worse clinical outcomes, no association was found between dietary sodium restriction, baseline or change in diuretic dose and the primary outcomes.

A prespecified patient-level pooled analysis (n = 11 007) of the DAPA-HF (NCT03036124) and DELIVER trialsfound that the benefits of dapagliflozin were similar regardless of LVEF. Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the composite of HF hospitalizations or CV death (Panel B), and of CV death alone (HR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76–0.97; P = 0.01), death from any cause (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82–0.99; P = 0.03), total hospitalizations for HF (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.65–0.78; P < 0.001), and MACE (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80–0.99; P = 0.02). In this patient-level meta-analysis, there was no evidence that the effects of dapagliflozin differed by LVEF.

Several papers addressed the issue of diuresis, renal function, sodium, and potassium.

The issue of sodium restriction in HF has been disputed for long, and the study of dietary intervention under 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF) was designed to test whether or not a reduction in dietary sodium reduces the incidence of future clinical events.SODIUM-HF enrolled 806 patients with chronic HF receiving guideline-directed medical treatment, and randomized them to either usual care according to local guidelines or a low sodium diet (LSD) of < 100 mmol (this is < 1500 mg/day). The median sodium intake decreased from 2286 mg/day (interquartile range 1653–3005) to 1658 mg/day (1301–2189) in the low sodium group and from 2119 mg/day (1673–2804) to 2073 mg/day (1541–2900) in the usual care group. By 12 months, the primary composite endpoint of CV-related admission to hospital, CV-related emergency department visit, or all-cause death had occurred in 15% of patients in the LSD group and 17% in the usual care group (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.63–1.26; P = 0.53). So, a dietary intervention to reduce sodium intake does not reduce clinical events.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^12570e63]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Advanced heart failure (HF) — management of fluid status includes that control of fluid retention may require progressive increments in the loop diuretic dose and frequently the addition of a second diuretic that has a complementary mode of action (e.g., metolazone). If volume overload persists despite these measures, hospitalization is generally required for further adjustment of therapy, possibly including intravenous dopamine or dobutamine, and ultrafiltration or hemodialysis may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention; the use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of loop diuretics. In general, patients should not be discharged from the hospital until a stable and effective diuretic regimen is established, and ideally, not until euvolemia is achieved, after which the patient's dry weight can guide dose adjustments; many patients are able to modify their own diuretic regimen in response to changes in weight that exceed a predefined range. The restriction of dietary sodium (to 2 g a day or less) can greatly assist in the maintenance of volume balance, and patients with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction and high-dose diuretic use may benefit from review of fluid intake and restriction to 2 liters daily; the ongoing control of fluid retention may be enhanced by enrollment in an HF program.

Step III: Adjust diuretic doses

If the above first measures are not sufficient, HFrEF treatment should then be adjusted.

The first step is to assess the total extracellular volume in order to determine whether it is possible to lower the dose of diuretics. Clinical, biological, or ultrasound (lung and/or cardiac) signs of congestion should be identified, or congestion scores used 13 to attain this goal.

In the absence of congestive signs, 13 diuretics should be carefully decreased and their replacement by an MRA (or MRA up‐titration) can even be considered in some cases. Only a few trials have targeted the decrease in diuretics. 45 A controlled randomized trial has recently been reported and confirmed the feasibility of this approach in stable HFrEF patients. 50, 51 Serial monitoring of stable natriuretic peptide concentrations may be useful during diuretic titration to provide reassurance that congestion is not worsening significantly.

Salt intake should also be assessed. Indeed, low salt intake could participate in low extracellular volume, such that, in some cases, salt intake could be increased cautiously. If significant congestive signs and severe hypotension are present, this should be considered as a state of acute cardiogenic pre‐shock or terminal heart disease. The patient should then be referred promptly to a specialized HF management team (HF Team).

In case of failure or inability to adjust the diuretics, and if hypotension or hypotensive symptoms persist, an adjustment of other HFrEF therapeutic classes should be discussed (Step IV).

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Reactions to symptoms need to be adapted to the individual patient. Due to changes in the patients' condition (either HF related to other reasons) the medication regimen might need to be changed (see part on side effects and medication), physical activity level and exercise training decreased, or a (temporary) change in their sodium or fluid intake needed.

Furthermore, diuretic therapy is used to treat signs and/or symptoms of congestion.

The goal of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose. However, clinical assessment of euvolaemia may be difficult and many patients remain congested despite increase in HF therapy. 119 The dose of the diuretic must be adjusted according to individual needs over time. A patient‐directed flexible diuretic dosing schedule based on personalized variation in fluid‐related signs and symptoms is safe in patients with chronic HF. Some patients and families might not feel comfortable making decisions to change medications or lifestyle and need support from the health care providers.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Provide individualized information to support self‐care management to patients and caregivers. Patients may adjust diuretic therapy and/or alert their health care team in case of increasing signs and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, hypotension), or a sudden unexpected weight gain of > 2 kg in 3 days as a rule of thumb; however, this may need to be tailored to the individual patient.
In selected euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be (temporarily) discontinued.
In patients with severe generalized congestion, especially in those with gut oedema, the effect of oral furosemide may be altered due to inadequate gastro‐intestinal absorption. A change in diuretics or a switch to intravenous furosemide is recommended in order to increase diuresis, reduce generalized congestion and gut oedema and re‐establish gastro‐intestinal absorption for oral diuretics.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and diuretic therapy continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalaemia. One or more of these agents may need to be temporarily stopped or its dose reduced during illness. Particularly the diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists migth need to be reduced/temporarily stopped (early).

### Eating a larger number of high-salt foods is not associated with short-term risk of acute decompensation in patients with chronic heart failure [^fa6cc0b8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Risk factors for exacerbation of congestive heart failure have not been consistently validated.

Objective

Our objective was to examine the role of short-term dietary sodium intake in acute decompensated heart failure.

Methods

Patients with chronic congestive heart failure presenting to the Emergency Department for either acute decompensated heart failure (cases) or for other reasons (controls) were included in a case-control study. Cases and controls were compared with respect to age, smoking, recent sodium intake, medication nonadherence, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. A food frequency questionnaire was utilized to estimate recent sodium intake, defined as the number of food types consumed in the previous 3 days from the 12 highest-sodium food categories.

Results

There were 182 patients enrolled. One patient was excluded due to uncertainty about the primary diagnosis. When adjusted for age, smoking, medication nonadherence, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, acute decompensated heart failure was not associated with short-term dietary sodium intake. The odds ratio for acute decompensated heart failure for each increase in the number of high-sodium food types consumed was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.9–1.3; p = 0.3). Acute decompensated heart failure was associated with medication nonadherence, with an odds ratio for decompensation of 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2–5.1; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients with chronic congestive heart failure who presented to the Emergency Department with acute decompensated heart failure were no more likely to report consuming a greater number of high-sodium foods in the 3 days before than were patients with chronic congestive heart failure who presented with unrelated symptoms. On the other hand, those who presented with acute decompensated heart failure were significantly more likely to report nonadherence with medications.

### Effect of a sodium-restricted diet on intake of other nutrients in heart failure: implications for research and clinical practice [^4c6ad8b9]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium restriction is the primary dietary therapy for heart failure (HF) patients. Currently, it is unknown if changing diets to reduce dietary sodium in HF causes secondary changes to the intake of other nutrients in this patient population already at nutritional risk.

Methods and Results

HF patients (n = 16; 52 ± 12 years old; 78% male) followed a sodium-restricted diet for 1 week. Nutritional changes were documented at baseline and after a < 2,000 mg/d sodium-restricted diet, as measured by food records before baseline and each day during the study. After a 49% reduction in dietary sodium (3,626 ± 956 to 1,785 ± 696 mg/d), we observed a significant reduction in calorie (2,467 ± 748 to 1,931 ± 388 kcal/d; P < .016), carbohydrate (293 ± 108 to 232 ± 56 g/d; P = 0.013), calcium (995 ± 496 to 609 ± 208 mg/d; P < .004), thiamine (2.0 ± 0.8 to 1.5 ± 0.8 mg/d; P = 0.020), and folate (412 ± 192 to 331 ± 172 μg/d; P = 0.019) intakes. There was a decrease in saturated fat (32 ± 18 to 21 ± 6 g/d; P = 0.032) and a trend to lower total fat (89 ± 34 to 68 ± 19 g/d; P = 0.066) and higher potassium (1,262 ± 328 to 1,405 ± 268 mg/1,000 kcal; P = 0.055) intakes.

Conclusions

We found multiple unintentional nutritional consequences with dietary sodium reduction in HF patients. These findings highlight the need to consider the whole diet when counseling HF patients to lower sodium intake.

### The wrong white crystals: not salt but sugar as aetiological in hypertension and cardiometabolic disease [^e234386a]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of premature mortality in the developed world, and hypertension is its most important risk factor. Hypertension was implicated as a primary or contributing factor in more than 348 000 deaths in the USA in 2009with costs to the nation in excess of $50 billion annually. Controlling hypertension is a major focus of public health initiatives, and dietary approaches to address hypertension have historically focused on sodium. Nonetheless, the potential benefits of sodium reduction are debatable. Reducing sodium intake may lower blood pressure measurements in some individuals, but average blood-pressure reductions might only be as great as 4.8 mm Hg systolic and 2.5 mm Hg diastolic — being generous (only considering upper confidence limits and only considering persons with hypertension) — and whether there would be a net health benefit from such reductions is unclear. In fact, there is some evidence suggesting that reducing sodium intake could lead to worse health outcomes, such as increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes, and increased hospitalisations and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. More importantly, recent data encompassing over 100 000 patients indicates that sodium intake between 3 and 6 g/day is associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events compared to either a higher or lower level of intake. Thus, guidelines advising restriction of sodium intake below 3 g/day may cause harm.

Strategies to lower dietary sodium intake focus (implicitly if not explicitly) on reducing consumption of processed foods: the predominant sources of sodium in the diet. For instance, the Food and Drug Administration has recently announced that it is drafting guidelines asking the food industry to voluntarily lower sodium levels.

Nonetheless, the mean intake of sodium in Western populations is approximately 3.5–4 g/day. Five decades worth of data indicates that sodium intake has not changed from this level across diverse populations and eating habits, despite population-wide sodium-reduction efforts and changes in the food supply. Such stability in intake suggests tight physiologic control, which if indeed the case, could mean that lowering sodium levels in the food supply could have unintended consequences. Because processed foods are the principal source of dietary sodium, if these foods became less salty, there could be a compensatory increase in their consumption to obtain the sodium that physiology demands.

HF: Medical Nutrition Therapy (2017) — for adults with heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B, C and D), the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should provide medical nutrition therapy (MNT) to treat heart failure and contributing comorbidities, such as hypertension, disorders of lipid metabolism, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Every patient with heart failure should have a clear, detailed, and evidence-based plan of care that ensures the achievement of guideline determined medical therapy (GDMT) goals, effective management of comorbid conditions, timely follow-up with the healthcare team, appropriate dietary and physical activities, and compliance with secondary prevention guidelines for cardiovascular disease. Research reports that medical nutrition therapy resulted in a significant decrease in sodium intake and maintenance of body weight. Rating: Strong; Imperative.

AHA/ACC dietary pattern — fats, oils, and sodium limits indicate that the AHA/ACC diet recommends avoiding trans fats and limiting SFAs to < 6% of total calories; polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids should be substituted for SFAs and trans fat, and an upper limit on total fat was not set but total energy intake should support weight-control efforts. The AHA's recommended eating pattern limits sodium intake to ≤ 2300 mg/d (1500 mg/d) as patient needs dictate, and in general, > 75% of sodium intake is derived from processed and restaurant foods, not salt added at the table.

### Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (cochrane review) [^8687ff09]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of salt reduction report a reduction in the level of blood pressure (BP), the effect of reduced dietary salt on cardiovascular disease (CVD) events remains unclear.

Methods

We searched for RCTs with follow-up of at least 6 months that compared dietary salt reduction (restricted salt dietary intervention or advice to reduce salt intake) to control/no intervention in adults, and reported mortality or CVD morbidity data. Outcomes were pooled at end of trial or longest follow-up point.

Results

Seven studies were identified: three in normotensives, two in hypertensives, one in a mixed population of normo- and hypertensives and one in heart failure. Salt reduction was associated with reductions in urinary salt excretion of between 27 and 39 mmol/24 h and reductions in systolic BP between 1 and 4 mm Hg. Relative risks (RRs) for all-cause mortality in normotensives (longest follow-up-RR: 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58–1.40, 79 deaths) and hypertensives (longest follow-up RR 0.96, 0.83–1.11, 565 deaths) showed no strong evidence of any effect of salt reduction CVD morbidity in people with normal BP (longest follow-up: RR 0.71, 0.42–1.20, 200 events) and raised BP at baseline (end of trial: RR 0.84, 0.57–1.23, 93 events) also showed no strong evidence of benefit. Salt restriction increased the risk of all-cause mortality in those with heart failure (end of trial RR 2.59, 1.04–6.44, 21 deaths). We found no information on participant's health-related quality of life.

Conclusions

Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of RCTs (665 deaths in some 6,250 participants) there is still insufficient power to exclude clinically important effects of reduced dietary salt on mortality or CVD morbidity. Our estimates of benefits from dietary salt restriction are consistent with the predicted small effects on clinical events attributable to the small BP reduction achieved.

### Education by a dietitian in patients with heart failure results in improved adherence with a sodium-restricted diet: a randomized trial [^7a8ef14d]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) programs reduce hospital readmission and improve clinical outcomes. Although dietitians are often members of such teams, no randomized studies have demonstrated the independent benefit of dietitian-administered dietary counseling for patients with HF. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietitian education on adherence to a sodium-restricted diet in ambulatory patients with stable HF.

Methods

Patients with HF (left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%) were randomized into a dietitian education group (n = 23) or a usual care group (n = 24), then observed for 3 months. Both groups received a 2 g/d dietary sodium prescription. The usual care group received nutrition advice by way of self-help literature, whereas the dietitian education group returned for 2 counseling sessions with a dietitian.

Results

Dietitian education resulted in a significant decrease in sodium intake at 3 months (2.80 ± 0.30 to 2.14 ± 0.23 g/d, P < .05). In contrast, there was no change in sodium intake in the usual care group (3.00 ± 0.31 to 2.74 ± 0.35 g/d, P = ns).

Conclusions

Dietitian-administered counseling was more effective than providing literature in reducing dietary sodium intake in patients with stable HF.

2.1 Effect of high salt intake on hypertension

Hypertension is one of the most common chronic vascular diseases, affecting 1.39 billion adults globally as of 2010. Hypertension was traditionally defined as a persistent systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg. In the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, the diagnostic criterion for hypertension has been reduced to ≥ 130/80 mm Hg with SBP/DBP ranges of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg defined as Stage 1 hypertension, and ≥ 140/90 mm Hg as Stage 2 hypertension. The purpose of this reduction was to promote earlier interventions to reduce CVD risks and prevent major adverse CVD outcomes. However, there has been some controversy concerning BP measurements, BP cut‐offs, the target BP values to strive for, the timing and intensity of antihypertensive treatment, and the benefits of lowering BP targets in different age groups and ethnicities. In view of this, some clinical practice guidelines (ie, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension, the 2019 National Institute of Health and Care Excellence [NICE], and the 2020 International Society of Hypertension guidelines) still use the 140/90 mm Hg cut‐off for hypertension diagnosis. Nevertheless, all the guidelines have substantial accordance in their recommendations. Hypertension can be classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Primary hypertension is by far the most common typeand refers to high BP of unknown, idiopathic origin. Poorly controlled hypertension increases the risk of HF, heart attack, stroke, renal failure and even death. The development of hypertension is influenced by various genetic, environmental and dietary factors, involving complex neuronal and hormonal regulation. High salt intake is strongly associated with the development of hypertension. In light of this, understanding the underlying mechanisms of salt‐induced hypertension is an important area in cardiovascular health. Multiple factors have been studied and established as playing important roles in salt‐induced hypertension, including increased activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS), endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity, impaired renal and intestinal ion transport, altered natriuretic peptides (NPs) and others. As salt‐induced hypertension has been reviewed in depth in previous reports, here we describe some updates regarding these mechanisms that mediate salt‐induced hypertension.

Diuretics in heart failure — patient selection and dosing advises that diuretics should be prescribed to all patients who have evidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, fluid retention and should generally be combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker, as few patients with HF will be able to maintain dry weight without diuretics; for initiation and maintenance, the most commonly used loop diuretic is furosemide, though some respond to torsemide due to superior absorption and longer duration of action; outpatient therapy is commonly started with low doses and increased until urine output rises and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily, with further dose or frequency escalations (i.e., twice-daily dosing) possibly required; the ultimate goal is elimination of clinical evidence of fluid retention, and diuretics are generally combined with moderate dietary sodium restriction (3 to 4 g daily).

In this population, there were no studies identified that reported on the effect of medical nutrition therapy by a registered dietitian nutritionist on quality measures (Grade V), and despite the intervention in dietitian education groups there were no significant differences in quality of life or body weight (Grade III).

### Low-versus moderate-sodium diet in patients with recent hospitalization for heart failure: the PROHIBIT (prevent adverse outcomes in heart failure by limiting sodium) pilot study [^bf7db4db]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility, on-study retention, trends in natriuretic peptide levels, quality of life, and safety of a 12-week feeding trial with 1500- versus 3000-mg daily sodium meals in high-risk patients with heart failure.

Methods

Of 196 patients with recent (≤ 2 weeks) hospitalization for heart failure, ejection fraction ≤ 40%, on optimal medical therapy, functionally independent, and able to communicate, 83 (47%) consented to participate. Of these, 27 (age, 62 ± 11 years; 22 men; 20 white; ejection fraction, 26 ± 8%) had 24-hour urine sodium ≥ 3000 mg and agreed to randomly receive either 1500-mg (N = 12) or 3000-mg (N = 15) sodium meals.

Results

On-study retention at 12 weeks was 77% (82% versus 73%; P = 0.53); 6 patients (2 in 1500-mg, 4 in 3000-mg arm) withdrew before study completion. Food satisfaction questionnaires indicated that both diets were well tolerated. Quality of life improved in the 1500-mg arm at 12 weeks but did not change in the 3000-mg arm. Average compliance with meals was 52% (based on urinary sodium) and was not significantly different between arms (42% versus 60%; P = 0.25). Study meals reduced 24-hour urinary sodium by 137 ± 21 mmol (1500-mg arm) and 82 ± 16 mmol (3000-mg arm), both P < 0.001; between-arms difference was 55 mmol (95% CI, 3–107; P = 0.037). NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) was not affected. Hospitalizations and low blood pressure events did not differ significantly between arms. Serum creatinine decreased more (by 0.17 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.06–0.28]; P = 0.003) in the 1500-mg arm. Creatinine increases > 0.5 mg/dL over baseline only occurred in 1 patient in the 3000-mg arm.

Conclusions

Even with prepared meals, investigating optimal dietary sodium in heart failure comes with challenges, including need for extensive screening, reluctance to participate, and compliance issues. Because both diets reduced urinary sodium without adverse safety or quality of life signals, a larger trial, with modifications to improve participation and compliance, would be ethical and feasible.

### Effect of lower sodium intake on health: systematic review and meta-analyses [^0761c2a7]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

According to the GRADE criteria, the evidence for a decreased sodium intake reducing blood pressure in adults was of high quality (table 4). The evidence for no effect of reduced sodium intake on blood lipids, catecholamine levels, and renal function was also high quality. The quality of the direct evidence for a positive association between sodium intake and risk of stroke from cohort studies was very low when all outcomes were combined, and of low quality when incident events and fatal incident events were analysed separately. The quality of evidence of a direct relation between sodium intake and fatal coronary heart disease events was also low. The low and very low quality of this evidence reflects that the GRADE methodology defines observational evidence from cohort studies as low quality. Recognising the limitations of any biomarker, the current review considered data from change in systolic blood pressure as indirect evidence for the effect of sodium intake on risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Blood pressure is recognised as a reliable biomarker for estimating risk of cardiovascular diseasebecause of the well established causal relation between increasing blood pressure and increasing risk of cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease and stroke.

### Dietary interventions for heart failure in older adults: re-emergence of the hedonic shift [^6b9a0d8a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Dietary non-adherence to sodium restriction is an important contribution to heart failure (HF) symptom burden, particularly in older adults. While knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward sodium restriction are important, sodium intake is closely linked to the ability to taste salt. The 'hedonic shift' occurs when sodium restriction induces changes in an individual's salt taste that lower subsequent salt affinity. Older adults often have compromised salt taste and higher dietary salt affinity due to age-related changes. Older HF patients may have additional loss of salt taste and elevated salt appetite due to comorbid conditions, medication use, and micronutrient or electrolyte abnormalities, creating a significant barrier to dietary adherence. Induction of the hedonic shift has the potential to improve long-term dietary sodium restriction and significantly impact HF outcomes in older adults.

### Heterogeneity in treatment effects in the reduction of dietary sodium to less than 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF): a secondary post hoc analysis [^92fbbf75]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

SODIUM-HF (Study of Dietary Intervention of Sodium Under100 mmol in Heart Failure) compared usual care with dietary sodium restriction in patients with heart failure (HF) and produced neutral results for the primary endpoint. Heterogeneity in treatment effects (HTE) analysis could enhance the original findings.

Objective

Explore the presence of HTE in the SODIUM-HF trial using a risk-effect-based approach.

Methods

HTE was assessed using a risk-based approach based on the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic (MAGGIC) HF risk score. Interaction between MAGGIC quartiles and outcomes was assessed using a Bayesian regression model with neutral priors. The primary endpoint was the same for the original trial (composite of cardiovascular-related admission to hospital, cardiovascular-related emergency department visit, or all-cause death within 12 months in the intention-to-treat population); KCCQ was the secondary endpoint.

Results

Were included 806 patients. MAGGIC quartiles used for the risk-based analyses were 0.036 to 0.102 (low), > 0.102 to 0.147 (medium-low), > 0.147 to 0.209 (medium-high), and > 0.209 to 0.591 (high). There was very strong evidence for the interaction between MAGGIC quartile and intervention (Bayes factor of 68). There was a strong suggestion of association between intervention arm and a lower occurrence of the primary endpoint for the medium-low MAGGIC quartile (> 0.98 probability), and a suggestion that the intervention was associated with more frequent occurrence of the primary endpoint in the high MAGGIC quartile (probability of benefit of 0.06). Suggestion of HTE was also found for KCCQ with a strong suggestion of benefit for the intervention for those in the lowest MAGGIC quartiles.

Conclusions

HTE effects in the SODIUM-HF trial is probable. Further trials in sodium retention may benefit by incorporating this information.

### Long-term effects of dietary sodium intake on cytokines and neurohormonal activation in patients with recently compensated congestive heart failure [^a045847c]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A growing body of evidence suggests that the fluid accumulation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) and that the inflammatory and neurohormonal activation contribute strongly to the progression of this disorder.

Methods and Results

The study evaluated the long-term effects of 2 different sodium diets on cytokines neurohormones, body hydration and clinical outcome in compensated HF outpatients (New York Heart Association Class II). A total of 173 patients (105 males, mean age 72.5 ± 7) recently hospitalized for worsening advanced HF and discharged in normal hydration and in clinical compensation were randomized in 2 groups (double blind). In Group 1, 86 patients received a moderate restriction in sodium (120mmol to 2.8g/day) plus oral furosemide (125 to 250mg bid); in Group 2, 87 patients: received a low-sodium diet (80mmol to 1.8g/day) plus oral furosemide (125 to 250mg bid). Both groups were followed for 12 months and the treatment was associated with a drink intake of 1000mL daily. Neurohormonal (brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, plasma rennin activity) and cytokines values (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6) were significantly reduced with a significant increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 at 12 months in normal, P < .0001) than low-sodium group. The low-sodium diet showed a significant activation of neurohormones and cytokines and worsening the body hydration, whereas moderate sodium restriction maintained dry weigh and improved outcome in the long term.

Conclusions

Our results appear to suggest a surprising efficacy of a new strategy to improve the chronic diuretic response by increasing Na intake and limiting fluid intake. This counterintuitive approach underlines the need for a better understanding of factors that regulate sodium and water handling in chronic congestive HF. A larger sample of patients and further studies are required to evaluate whether this is due to the high dose of diuretic used or the low-sodium diet.

### Nutrient deficiencies in heart failure: a micro problem with macro effects? [^31bbeb01]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Current HF guidelines recognize that although nutrition is likely important, more data are needed to provide adequate dietary guidance. 15 Work centered on single micronutrient deficiency and supplementation in HF has produced mostly neutral results in clinical trials. 3 This fact, along with increasing controversy related to dietary sodium restriction, 16 has led to growing interest in overall dietary quality. In the Women's Health Initiative cohort, participants with HF who had greater adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating pattern had slightly lower mortality over a median of 4 years, with a similar trend for Mediterranean diet adherence. 17 However, even the best observational studies can be limited by the logistical challenges and accuracy of nutrient measurement, and resulting associations between diet and outcomes can be affected by unmeasured confounders. 18

A few small clinical trials have moved beyond dietary risk assessment in cohort studies and the supplementation of single micronutrients to directly assess the effects of nutritional support in HF. The PICNIC (Nutritional Intervention Program in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure Who Are Malnourished) study randomized 120 Spanish inpatients with HF at risk for nutritional complications to a multidisciplinary dietary intervention. The program involved tailored dietary recommendations delivered through monthly in‐person nutrition‐focused visits. With this intensive support, 27% of patients died or were hospitalized for HF over 12 months of follow‐up, versus 61% in the usual care group. 19 The recently published GOURMET‐HF (Geriatric Out‐of‐Hospital Randomized Meal Trial in Heart Failure) pilot study randomized 66 US patients with HF at hospital discharge to 4 weeks of home‐delivered, low‐sodium, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension–compliant meals compared with usual care. Although the primary outcome of disease‐specific quality of life did not differ between groups, secondary analyses showed a trend toward reduction in HF symptoms and 30‐day readmissions in the group receiving meals. 20

The study by Lennie and colleagues 7 provides another important link between micronutrient deficiencies and outcomes in patients with HF. The findings promote much‐needed thinking beyond sodium restriction or individual nutrient supplementation toward maintaining overall dietary quality. The time is right to conduct larger clinical trials of comprehensive dietary support in HF, which hold strong potential to improve quality of life and outcomes in this vulnerable population.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization worldwide. Volume overload plays an important role in these admissions, being the primary cause of a patients signs and symptoms. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines classify the use of loop diuretics in the acute and chronic management of congestion as class 1 A of recommendation. However, the optimal dose and monitoring strategy of loop diuretics to maximize diuresis in AHF remain controversial.

Traditional but imprecise methods of monitoring diuresis, such as weight changes, may overestimate fluid loss, leading to residual volume overload. This has been associated with increased rehospitalization and mortality rates among heart failure (HF) patients. A recent ESC consensus statement highlights that the primary goal of therapy in AHF is to achieve complete decongestion and restore euvolemic state. In this context, urinary sodium measurement has emerged as a potential tool to optimize diuretic therapy, especially within the first 24 h. ESC proposed measurement of urinary sodium two hours after the initial diuretic dose, with a result > 50 mmol indicating an effective dose of loop diuretics.

Most evidence supporting the use of urinary sodium to guide diuresis comes from non-randomized studies or small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), lacking sufficient power to establish definitive clinical benefits. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy compared to standard management in patients with AHF.

### Sodium, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease: further evidence supporting the American Heart Association sodium reduction recommendations [^7eb8f25c]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Recent reports of selected observational studies and a meta-analysis have stirred controversy and have become the impetus for calls to abandon recommendations for reduced sodium intake by the US general population. A detailed review of these studies documents substantial methodological concerns that limit the usefulness of these studies in setting, much less reversing, dietary recommendations. Indeed, the evidence base supporting recommendations for reduced sodium intake in the general population remains robust and persuasive. The American Heart Association is committed to improving the health of all Americans through implementation of national goals for health promotion and disease prevention, including its recommendation to reduce dietary sodium intake to < 1500 mg/d.

Avoiding repeated hospital admissions — The heart failure (HF) specialist should be thoroughly familiar with the transition of care at the time of hospital discharge and identify patients likely to decompensate and require readmission; this allows management of frequent follow-up visits, careful medication adjustment, and development of a strategy for surveillance of electrolytes and renal function. The HF specialist should provide comprehensive education to both patient and family about the disease process, nonpharmacological therapy and elements of self-management, including dietary sodium restriction, and adherence to the medication regimen and follow-up appointments. The guidelines recommend multidisciplinary disease management programs for patients at risk of clinical deterioration or readmission to address barriers to adherence and reduce hospitalization; if a program is not available at the clinician's institution, the HF specialist should be familiar with and establish a referral relationship with a disease management program elsewhere. The HF specialist should facilitate integration and coordination of care with primary care physicians, internists, and other groups, including cardiac rehabilitation and home nursing services.

### Salt and nutritional content of foods advertised during televised professional football games [^a5fb604e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Modest restriction of dietary sodium intake for individuals with heart failure (HF), including those with concomitant kidney failure and advanced disease, may improve symptoms and quality of life. A registered dietitian- or nurse-coached intervention with 2 to 3 g/d sodium restriction improved New York Heart Association functional class and leg edema in individuals with HF with reduced ejection fraction. However, excess dietary intake is frequent with ingestion of processed and prepared foods, including those from high-volume restaurants or other food establishments. Additionally, excess fat and caloric intake may influence the natural history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and other conditions. Since advertising by the food and restaurant industry influences consumer behavior and meal option selections, we analyzed advertisements transmitted during televised professional football games in the US to assess the nutritional content by serving.

### Dietary interventions in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: a scoping review [^96cbcd5c]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern encourages intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and promotes intake of nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy, and lean protein. Hummel et al studied the effects of a sodium-restricted DASH diet (1,500 mg sodium/2,100 kcal) in 13 well-compensated patients with HFpEF and treated hypertension. After 21 days, the study diet substantially lowered clinic and ambulatory blood pressure and indices of left ventricular diastolic function, large-arterial stiffness, ventricular-arterial coupling, and 6MWT distance improved. The GOURMET-HF (Geriatric OUt-of-hospital Randomized MEal Trial in Heart Failure) study randomized 66 older patients to receive low-sodium, DASH-compliant home-delivered meals for 4 weeks posthospital discharge. In participants with HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%), the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score (physical limitations and symptoms domains) improved between baseline and 4 weeks in the patients receiving meals (41 ± 24 points to 57 ± 17 points, P = 0.01), but not in the usual care group (43 ± 20 points to 49 ± 24 points, P = 0.28). Larger trials of the DASH sodium-restricted diet are needed to investigate the impact of this dietary pattern on hospitalization and mortality.

### The role of diet and nutrition in heart failure: a state-of-the-art narrative review [^0fa69616]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure (HF) incidence is increasing steadily worldwide, while prognosis remains poor. Though nutrition is a lifestyle factor implicated in prevention of HF, little is known about the effects of macro- and micronutrients as well as dietary patterns on the progression and treatment of HF. This is reflected in a lack of nutrition recommendations in all major HF scientific guidelines. In this state-of-the-art review, we examine and discuss the implications of evidence contained in existing randomized control trials as well as observational studies covering the topics of sodium restriction, dietary patterns and caloric restriction as well as supplementation of dietary fats and fatty acids, protein and amino acids and micronutrients in the setting of pre-existing HF. Finally, we explore future directions and discuss knowledge gaps regarding nutrition therapies for the treatment of HF.

### Marital failure and subsequent heart failure: a prospective study [^85241457]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Every 2 years, participants in our study were surveyed about their daily salt intake, which was classified as low, moderate, or high. Intake < 6 g/d was considered low (< 2400 mg/d sodium intake), 6 to 10 g/d as moderate (2400 to 4000 mg/d sodium intake), and > 10 g/d as high (> 4000 mg/d sodium intake). These categories followed the standards cited in previous research. Despite the low category exceeding the World Health Organization's recommended maximum of < 5 g/d, it was consistent with typical dietary habits in China. All measurements adhered to the standard protocol described earlier by our group. Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, and body mass index, which was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were both measured twice using a mercury sphygmomanometer with the participant seated, and the average of the 2 measurements was used for analysis. Blood samples were collected from the anterior tibial vein in the early morning after overnight fasting and analyzed within 4 hours using a Hitachi 7600 autoanalyzer in the central laboratory of Kailuan General Hospital, with fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, C‐reactive protein, and serum creatinine concentrations determined. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the creatinine equation of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration. Hypertension was defined with a measured systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, use of antihypertensive medication, or self‐reported or physician‐diagnosed history of hypertension. Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, taking antihyperglycemic medication, or a self‐reported or diagnosed history of diabetes. History of myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and cancer was confirmed by medical record review.

Lifestyle score was calculated by assigning 1 point for each of the following criteria: never smoking, never drinking, low or moderate salt intake (where salt intake serves as a surrogate of diet quality, as previously validated), a body mass index < 24, and always engaging in physical activity; otherwise, 0 points were assigned. The total lifestyle score ranged from 0 (least healthy) to 5 (healthiest).

### Sodium intake and incident atrial fibrillation in individuals with vascular disease [^1d2119f8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Low sodium intake, at levels consumed by less than 3% of the population in our study, was associated with increased AF risk when early AF events were included. Low sodium intakes could lead to AF through orthostatic hypotension, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as increased adrenaline excretion. Besides observational studies that have reported J- or U-shaped associations between sodium intake and cardiovascular outcomes, there are also data from interventional studies, including a recent meta-analysis showing an increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with heart failure on sodium-restricted diets in clinical trialsand data showing an inverse correlation between country-level sodium intake and life expectancy. Despite this, current guidelines recommend lowering sodium intake to a goal of between less than 1.50 g/d to less than 2.40 g/d. Our study found no evidence to support low sodium intakes (< 3.00 g/d) compared with moderate levels (ie, at the population mean of 3.00–5.00 g/d), and there may be a higher risk of AF with low compared with moderate sodium intakes.

### Nutritional interventions in heart failure: a systematic review of the literature [^a1897f86]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a major health care burden and there is a growing need to develop strategies to maintain health and sustain quality of life in persons with HF. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the components of nutrition interventions and to establish an evidence base for future advances in HF nutrition research and practice.

Methods and Results

Cinahl, Pubmed, and Embase were searched to identify articles published from 2005 to 2015. A total of 17 randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Results were divided into 2 categories of nutrition-related interventions: (1) educational and (2) prescriptive. Educational interventions improved patient outcomes such as adherence to dietary restriction in urine sodium levels and self-reported diet recall. Educational and prescriptive interventions resulted in decreased readmission rates and patient deterioration. Adherence measurement was subjective in many studies. Evidence showed that a normal-sodium diet and 1-liter fluid restriction along with high diuretic dosing enhanced B-type natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-6 markers.

Conclusions

Educational nutrition interventions positively affect patient clinical outcomes. Although clinical practice guidelines support a low-sodium diet and fluid restriction, research findings have revealed that a low-sodium diet may be harmful. Future research should examine the role of macronutrients, food quality, and energy balance in HF nutrition.

### Micronutrient deficiency independently predicts time to event in patients with heart failure [^bfe09eff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Dietary micronutrient deficiencies have been shown to predict event-free survival in other countries but have not been examined in patients with heart failure living in the United States. The purpose of this study was to determine whether number of dietary micronutrient deficiencies in patients with heart failure was associated with shorter event-free survival, defined as a combined end point of all-cause hospitalization and death. Methods and Results Four-day food diaries were collected from 246 patients with heart failure (age: 61.5 ± 12 years; 67% male; 73% white; 45% New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III / IV) and analyzed using Nutrition Data Systems for Research. Micronutrient deficiencies were determined according to methods recommended by the Institute of Medicine. Patients were followed for 1 year to collect data on all-cause hospitalization or death. Patients were divided according to number of dietary micronutrient deficiencies at a cut point of ≥ 7 for the high deficiency category versus < 7 for the no to moderate deficiency category. In the full sample, 29.8% of patients experienced hospitalization or death during the year, including 44.3% in the high-deficiency group and 25.1% in the no/moderate group. The difference in survival distribution was significant (log rank, P = 0.0065). In a Cox regression, micronutrient deficiency category predicted time to event with depression, NYHA classification, comorbidity burden, body mass index, calorie and sodium intake, and prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, or β-blockers included as covariates. Conclusions This study provides additional convincing evidence that diet quality of patients with heart failure plays an important role in heart failure outcomes.

### In patients with heart failure, a low-sodium diet does not… [^37df5d76]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

American Family Physician associate editor Barry Weiss, MD discussed several studies showing that a low-sodium diet produced no benefits and increased mortality compared to a normal diet in heart failure patients in the outpatient and inpatient settings. Consequently, he advised that "based on current evidence and until further studies are completed, patients with heart failure should probably be discouraged from reducing their sodium consumption to less than 2, 300 mg per day". Last month, the Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure trial, with 806 participants from 26 sites in Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and New Zealand reported its primary findings. All participants in this pragmatic randomized trial were receiving optimally tolerated guideline-directed medical treatment for chronic heart failure. Participants were randomly assigned to usual care or a low sodium diet of < 100 mmol/day.

The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular-related hospitalization, emergency department visit, and all-cause mortality within 12 months. Median sodium intake decreased in the low-sodium group from 2, 286 mg to 1, 658 mg/day and in the usual care group from 2, 119 mg to 2, 073 mg/day by the end of the trial. However, in an intention-to-treat analysis, researchers found no statistical differences between the groups in the composite outcome or in each of the individual outcomes. As Dr. Weiss cautioned in his AFP editorial, "the possibility that aggressive sodium restriction may lead to unfavorable outcomes in patients with heart failure should not. be misconstrued as meaning that we should lose our focus on reducing sodium intake in the general population. " Indeed, there is good evidence that population-level interventions are effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, including a large Chinese randomized trial of a salt substitute that Dr.

Jennifer Middleton discussed in a previous AFP Community Blog post. That's why recent guidance for industry from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration that aims to reduce the average American's daily sodium intake from 3, 400 mg to 3, 000 mg/day over the next few years could also have a positive public health impact.

Common noncardiovascular comorbidities in HFrEF — suggested actions include the following. Diabetes: consider consult with endocrinologist; monitor serum creatinine and albuminuria at least yearly; treat with SGLT inhibitor for management of hyperglycemia; treat according to the current ACC ECDP on Novel Therapies for CV Risk Reduction in Patients with T2D and ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes. Chronic kidney disease: optimize RAAS inhibitor therapy; use hydralazine/ISDN if an ARNI/ACE inhibitor/ARB cannot be used; treat with SGLT inhibitor if GFR allows; consider nephrology consult. Sleep disordered breathing: refer for sleep study to confirm diagnosis; treat obstructive sleep apnea; consider referral to sleep medicine specialist; note that in patients with symptomatic HFrEF and central sleep apnea, adaptive servo-ventilation is harmful. Iron deficiency (with or without anemia): consider intravenous iron replacement for symptom improvement. Malnutrition: poor nutrition may result in worse HF outcomes; a low salt, plant-forward diet has robust evidence to aid in the management of HFrEF patients, including their common morbidities. Anemia: evaluate secondary causes; consider transfusion in severe cases; note that in patients with HF and anemia, use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents is harmful. Hyperkalemia: recommend dietary modifications; consider treatment with patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. Obesity: data are suggestive of symptomatic benefit from treatment of obesity using glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists-1 in HFrEF; however, additional data are needed regarding safety and efficacy of weight-loss agents in HFrEF.

AHA dietary sodium reduction and fat substitution — reduction of sodium intake to < 2300 mg/d, with further reduction to 1500 mg/d as needed for enhanced blood pressure (BP) lowering, is described, and "Sodium reductions by at least 1000 mg/d are recommended even if the desired daily sodium intake is not yet achieved". Excessive saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake should be replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids without exceeding energy needs, and currently " > 80% of people in the United States consume > 2300 mg/d of sodium".

### Sodium intake and cause-specific mortality among predominantly low-income black and white US residents [^f911f740]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The role of dietary sodium in increasing the risk of death, particularly from CVD, has been consistently reported. A meta-analysis of 23 cohort studies and 2 follow-up studies of randomized clinical trials reported a 16% increase in all-cause mortality associated with high sodium intake and a 9% risk reduction associated with low sodium intake. The third NHANES study showed 20% higher all-cause mortality per 1000-mg increase in daily sodium intake. Also, diets high in sodium were associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure among overweight Americansand an increased risk of death among patients diagnosed with ambulatory heart failure. Meanwhile, a 10-year follow-up study of 2642 elderly Americans found nonsignificant positive associations between consuming more than 2300 mg/d of sodium and all-cause mortality, incident CVD, or incident heart failure. Another systematic review and meta-analysis showed that sodium intake was positively associated with deaths from CHD (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13–1.53) and stroke (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.27–2.10), but null associations were found for all-cause mortality or incident CVD and CHD. It is worth noting that low-SES individuals and Black adults are disproportionately exposed to low-quality diets and have a higher risk of premature death than others; however, they are relatively underrepresented in epidemiologic studies on this matter to date. Findings from the current study of predominantly low-income Black and White Americans not only demonstrated their substantially higher exposure to excessive sodium intake, but provided compelling evidence of the association between excessive sodium and CVD-related deaths in this underserved population.

### Diuretic treatment in heart failure [^b252c856]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diuretic treatment in heart failure:

- **Definition**: Diuretic treatment in HF is used to promote renal sodium and water excretion, thereby reducing intravascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and elevated filling pressures. Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are the cornerstone of therapy, with thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics added for additional effect when needed. The primary goal is to achieve rapid symptomatic relief and restoration of euvolemia while avoiding excessive volume loss, renal dysfunction, or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Pathophysiology**: In HF, neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems causes sodium and water retention, leading to increased venous pressures and pulmonary or systemic congestion. Diuretics counteract these effects by lowering preload and reducing ventricular filling pressures, which alleviates dyspnea and edema. However, excessive diuresis can decrease renal perfusion and stimulate further neurohormonal activation, diminishing long-term efficacy.
- **Disease course**: Diuretic therapy provides rapid improvement in symptoms, often within hours of initiation, particularly in acute decompensated HF. Treatment usually begins with intravenous loop diuretics, titrated according to urine output, weight reduction, and renal function. Thiazide-type diuretics may be combined with loop agents in cases of diuretic resistance. Once euvolemia is achieved, therapy is transitioned to the lowest effective oral dose while guideline-directed agents for HF are optimized.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with HF and fluid retention to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, enhance exercise capacity, and reduce the risk of hospital readmission. In HFrEF, early and effective decongestion improves QoL and functional status, although diuretics do not confer a direct survival benefit. Prompt administration in acute HF may shorten hospitalization and lower in-hospital mortality, provided the diagnosis of volume overload is certain. Combination therapy with a thiazide such as metolazone is reserved for patients unresponsive to high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction.

### Optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of cardiac transplant candidates: approaches to be considered prior to transplant evaluation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of cardiac transplant candidates – 2006 [^71e9c91a]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Heart failure diuretic therapy and fluid management — key directives and observations include that measures to control or avoid fluid retention include fluid and salt intake restriction and the use of diuretic drugs, and fluid status should be monitored roughly by daily weights. Limited fluid intake (1.5 to 2 liters/day for severe heart failure) limits edema formation and avoids hyponatremia. In advanced stages of heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV) diuretics form the mainstay of symptomatic therapy, and as diuretics may induce further activation of the RAAS, diuretics should always be combined with an ACEI or ARB. In advanced heart failure, diuretic resistance may develop; management includes salt and volume restriction, increased dosing or intravenous application of diuretics, combination therapy of loop diuretic with thiazide or metolazone, and institution of inodilatory therapy with dopamine, dobutamine, or milrinone. Rapid restoration of euvolemia, usually via intensified diuretic therapy, achieves symptomatic relief, and in therapy-resistant cases hemofiltration or hemodialysis may be required. In the Congestive Heart Failure (TORIC) trial, a significant survival advantage was demonstrated for patients treated with torsemide vs furosemide.

### Reduced salt intake for heart failure… [^8bd9a880]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the evidence that reduced dietary salt intake benefits adults with heart failure. Findings In this systematic review of 9 unique studies of 479 unique patients with heart failure, an overall paucity of robust high-quality evidence was available to support or refute the use of reduced dietary salt intake. Meaning Despite broad advocacy, uncertainty about the robustness of advice to reduce salt intake in patients with heart failure remains. Importance Recent estimates suggest that more than 26 million people worldwide have heart failure. The syndrome is associated with major symptoms, significantly increased mortality, and extensive use of health care. Evidence-based treatments influence all these outcomes in a proportion of patients with heart failure. Current management also often includes advice to reduce dietary salt intake, although the benefits are uncertain.

Objective To systematically review randomized clinical trials of reduced dietary salt in adult inpatients or outpatients with heart failure. Evidence Review. Several bibliographic databases were systematically searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. The methodologic quality of the studies was evaluated, and data associated with primary outcomes of interest and secondary outcomes were extracted. Findings Of 2655 retrieved references, 9 studies involving 479 unique participants were included in the analysis. None of the studies included more than 100 participants. The risks of bias in the 9 studies were variable.

None of the included studies provided sufficient data on the primary outcomes of interest. For the secondary outcomes of interest, 2 outpatient-based studies reported that NYHA functional class was not improved by restriction of salt intake, whereas 2 studies reported significant improvements in NYHA functional class. Conclusions and Relevance Limited evidence of clinical improvement was available among outpatients who reduced dietary salt intake, and evidence was inconclusive for inpatients. Overall, a paucity of robust high-quality evidence to support or refute current guidance was available. This review suggests that well-designed, adequately powered studies are needed to reduce uncertainty about the use of this intervention. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.
