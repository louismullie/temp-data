## Question

Causes of muscle spasm tetany on exertion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of muscle spasm/tetany on exertion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and whether the user truly means tetany versus exertional cramps. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism, including electrolyte disturbances, neuromuscular fatigue, metabolic myopathies, and infectious or toxic causes. Next, I will prioritize the most likely and dangerous causes, outline a practical diagnostic approach, and finally synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Tetany refers to sustained, involuntary muscle contractions due to neuromuscular irritability, classically from hypocalcemia or alkalosis, whereas exercise-associated muscle cramps are painful, brief, involuntary contractions linked to fatigue and altered neuromuscular control; I need to keep both in mind and specify which fits the clinical picture better [^5c56d0e8] [^05945f54].

> I will now examine electrolyte disturbances as a leading cause of exertion-related tetany. Hypocalcemia lowers the excitation threshold and can precipitate carpopedal spasm, laryngospasm, and diffuse tetany; exertion can unmask this by increasing neuromuscular demand, and cases of severe hypocalcemia with rhabdomyolysis illustrate the severity of neuromuscular irritability in this setting [^e69dd96d] [^a6ead57b]. Wait, let me verify the role of magnesium and potassium, because hypomagnesemia impairs parathyroid hormone action and can cause secondary hypocalcemia, while hypokalemia contributes to muscle irritability and can precipitate rhabdomyolysis; both can present with tetany or cramping on exertion, and Gitelman syndrome with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia is a classic example where exertion can trigger tetany despite normal total calcium [^5f507bec] [^f9f4a0e4] [^5e1238bf]. I should also note that phosphate loading or bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia can precipitate tetany, reminding me to check medication and nutrition history carefully [^22e4d06f] [^84bad308].

> Next, I should review exertional neuromuscular fatigue as a driver of cramps, even if not true tetany. The altered neuromuscular control hypothesis posits that fatigue shifts the balance toward excitatory spindle drive and away from inhibitory Golgi tendon organ input, producing cramps during or after exertion; stretching and fatigue-delay strategies are effective acutely, which aligns with clinical experience and supports this mechanism over simple dehydration or electrolyte depletion in most athletes [^05945f54] [^bd68b9c9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — dehydration and electrolyte loss can still contribute in some contexts, but prospective data have not consistently supported them as primary drivers of exertional cramps, reinforcing fatigue-related neuromuscular imbalance as the principal mechanism in healthy athletes [^bd68b9c9].

> I need to check for metabolic myopathies when exertion consistently triggers cramps, weakness, or rhabdomyolysis. Glycogenolytic and fatty acid oxidation defects, as well as mitochondrial disorders, can lower the exercise threshold for muscle breakdown and present with exertional cramps, myalgia, or episodic weakness; RYR1-related disorders are a notable subset with both exertional rhabdomyolysis and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, and the RHABDO mnemonic helps flag who needs genetic evaluation after an episode [^ea3a005f] [^8482ca75] [^7ea3bdbb]. But wait, what if the patient reports stiffness that worsens with continued activity and cold exposure? That pattern suggests paramyotonia congenita or other channelopathies, where myotonia can mimic cramping and is provoked by exertion and cold, so I should ask about temperature sensitivity and family history [^1b901d56].

> I should confirm that I'm not missing infectious or toxic causes that can masquerade as exertional tetany. Tetanus produces generalized rigidity and stimulus-induced spasms due to tetanus toxin blocking inhibitory neurotransmission; although not "exertional" per se, physical activity can exacerbate spasms, and the diagnosis is clinical with wound history guiding suspicion and management, including antitoxin, antibiotics, and supportive care [^05fd6073] [^088951b7]. Hold on, I should verify the differential when tetanus is suspected — strychnine poisoning and hypocalcemic tetany can look similar, so a careful history, wound exam, and electrolyte panel are essential to distinguish them at the bedside [^38df8994].

> Let me consider endocrine and medication-related contributors so I don't overlook reversible drivers. Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency can both cause cramping and neuromuscular irritability, and a medication review should include agents that cause hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or direct myotoxicity; tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for example, can precipitate electrolyte disturbances and cramps, and bariatric surgery patients are at risk for calcium and vitamin D deficiency with secondary hyperparathyroidism and tetany [^2b9747a5] [^df84f215] [^a7440b67]. I should double-check for phosphate-containing enemas or other iatrogenic phosphate loads that can acutely drop calcium and provoke tetany, especially in vulnerable patients [^22e4d06f].

> Now, I will prioritize the most likely and dangerous causes in a practical hierarchy. In patients with true tetany on exertion, severe hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia are the most critical and treatable causes to exclude emergently; in athletes with exertional cramps, fatigue-driven neuromuscular imbalance is most common; in those with recurrent exertional symptoms, rhabdomyolysis, or family history, metabolic myopathy should be considered; and in the right epidemiologic context, tetanus must be kept in mind given its morbidity and the need for rapid antitoxin and supportive care [^e69dd96d] [^05945f54] [^ea3a005f] [^05fd6073].

> Next, I should review a focused diagnostic approach so I don't overtest or miss time-sensitive treatments. History should quantify exertion type, hydration, diet, supplements, medications, and family history; the exam should distinguish cramping from sustained tetany, look for Chvostek and Trousseau signs, and assess for myopathic or neuropathic features; labs should include calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphate, creatinine, and CK, with PTH and vitamin D if hypocalcemia is found; and in recurrent or severe exertional rhabdomyolysis, I should escalate to exercise testing, muscle MRI, or targeted genetic panels guided by phenotype, using the RHABDO criteria to select patients for screening [^7ea3bdbb] [^02f2641c]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not ordering routine electrolytes for simple nocturnal or exertional cramps in otherwise healthy patients — guidelines advise against routine labs in idiopathic cramps, reserving testing for atypical or persistent cases [^cd6b8d8c].

> I will now examine immediate management principles that vary by cause. For hypocalcemic or hypomagnesemic tetany, parenteral replacement is indicated with careful monitoring; for exertional cramps, stretching the involved muscle and addressing fatigue and conditioning are first-line; for suspected tetanus, urgent antitoxin, wound care, antibiotics, and supportive measures are essential; and for metabolic myopathies, acute rhabdomyolysis care includes aggressive hydration, electrolyte correction, and avoidance of triggers, with long-term counseling on safe exercise and anesthesia precautions when RYR1-related disease is suspected [^5f507bec] [^05945f54] [^088951b7] [^84f68fbc].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Muscle spasm or tetany on exertion arises from three broad mechanisms: electrolyte-driven neuromuscular irritability (notably hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia), fatigue-related neuromuscular control imbalance causing cramps, and underlying metabolic myopathies that lower the threshold for muscle breakdown; less commonly, toxic or infectious causes like tetanus or strychnine poisoning present with rigidity and spasms that can be provoked by activity, so I need to align the phenotype with the mechanism and the urgency of treatment accordingly [^e69dd96d] [^05945f54] [^ea3a005f] [^05fd6073].

Muscle spasm/tetany on exertion is most often due to **electrolyte disturbances** (hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia) [^2b9747a5] [^5f507bec], **neuromuscular fatigue** from overuse or inadequate conditioning [^05945f54], and **metabolic myopathies** such as McArdle disease or mitochondrial disorders [^01abac17] [^ea3a005f]. Less common causes include tetanus [^05fd6073], hypothyroidism [^2b9747a5], and medications (e.g. statins, diuretics, beta-agonists) [^3b48422e] [^ed2b88cb]. Evaluation should include **serum calcium, magnesium, potassium, creatine kinase, and thyroid function**; consider genetic testing or muscle biopsy if myopathy is suspected [^7ea3bdbb]. Management focuses on correcting electrolytes, pacing activity, and treating underlying causes [^5f507bec] [^05945f54].

---

## Electrolyte disturbances

Electrolyte imbalances are a **common cause** of muscle spasms and tetany during exertion:

- **Hypocalcemia**: Low ionized calcium increases neuromuscular excitability, causing tetany, carpopedal spasms, and paresthesia [^e69dd96d]. Exertion can precipitate symptoms by increasing calcium demand [^notfound].

- **Hypomagnesemia**: Magnesium deficiency impairs calcium handling and increases neuromuscular irritability, leading to tetany and cramps [^5f507bec].

- **Hypokalemia**: Potassium loss from sweating or diuretics can cause muscle cramps and weakness during exertion [^5e1238bf].

---

## Neuromuscular fatigue and overuse

Fatigue-related mechanisms are a **major contributor** to exertional muscle spasms:

- **Altered neuromuscular control**: Fatigue disrupts the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, causing cramps [^05945f54] [^bd68b9c9].

- **Inadequate conditioning**: Poor fitness or sudden increases in intensity/duration predispose to cramps [^3b48422e].

- **Dehydration**: Fluid loss concentrates electrolytes and impairs muscle function, increasing cramp risk [^notfound].

---

## Metabolic myopathies

Inherited metabolic muscle diseases can cause **exertional spasms and tetany**:

- **Glycogen storage diseases (e.g. McArdle disease)**: Impaired glycogen breakdown causes cramps, stiffness, and fatigue with exertion [^notfound].

- **Mitochondrial myopathies**: Defective oxidative phosphorylation leads to exertional intolerance, cramps, and myalgia [^c5ce6d6a].

- **Fatty acid oxidation disorders**: Impaired lipid metabolism causes cramps and rhabdomyolysis with prolonged exertion [^notfound].

---

## Endocrine disorders

Endocrine dysfunction can **impair muscle function** and cause spasms:

- **Hypothyroidism**: Reduces muscle metabolism and increases cramp susceptibility [^2b9747a5].

- **Hyperparathyroidism**: Chronic calcium loss can cause tetany and neuromuscular irritability [^notfound].

---

## Infectious and toxic causes

Certain infections and toxins can **provoke tetany** or severe cramps:

- **Tetanus**: Causes sustained muscle spasms and rigidity via toxin-mediated inhibition of inhibitory neurotransmitters [^05fd6073] [^58d09c35].

- **Strychnine poisoning**: Mimics tetanus with violent convulsions and tetany [^38df8994].

---

## Medications and substances

Several drugs can **precipitate exertional spasms**:

- **Statins**: Cause myalgias, cramps, and rhabdomyolysis, especially with exertion [^ed2b88cb].

- **Diuretics**: Induce electrolyte losses (K+, Mg2+) and cramping [^5f507bec].

- **Beta-agonists**: Increase muscle excitability and cramp risk [^3b48422e].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured evaluation is essential to identify the cause:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** |
|-|-|
| History | - Onset <br/> - Duration <br/> - Intensity <br/> - Hydration <br/> - Diet <br/> - Medications <br/> - Family history [^7ea3bdbb] |
| Examination | - Muscle strength <br/> - Tone <br/> - Reflexes <br/> - Signs of tetany (Chvostek, Trousseau) [^e69dd96d] |
| Laboratory tests | - Calcium <br/> - Magnesium <br/> - Potassium <br/> - Creatine kinase <br/> - Thyroid function <br/> - Consider genetic testing if myopathy suspected [^7ea3bdbb] |
| Imaging | Not routine; consider muscle MRI or biopsy if myopathy suspected [^7ea3bdbb] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Electrolyte correction**: Replace calcium, magnesium, and potassium as indicated [^5f507bec].

- **Activity modification**: Gradual conditioning, hydration, and pacing to prevent fatigue-related cramps [^05945f54].

- **Treat underlying disorders**: Address endocrine, metabolic, or infectious causes [^05fd6073].

- **Medication adjustment**: Stop or switch offending drugs when possible [^ed2b88cb].

---

Muscle spasm/tetany on exertion reflects a **multifactorial interplay** of electrolyte disturbances, neuromuscular fatigue, metabolic myopathies, endocrine disorders, infections, toxins, and medications. A focused history, exam, and targeted labs guide diagnosis, and management centers on correcting the cause and modifying activity.

### Muscle cramps and contractures: causes and treatment [^72827615]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps are painful, sudden, involuntary muscle contractions that are generally self-limiting. They are often part of the spectrum of normal human physiology and can be associated with a wide range of acquired and inherited causes. Cramps are only infrequently due to progressive systemic or neuromuscular diseases. Contractures can mimic cramps and are defined as shortenings of the muscle resulting in an inability of the muscle to relax normally, and are generally myogenic. General practitioners and neurologists frequently encounter patients with muscle cramps but more rarely those with contractures. The main questions for clinicians are: (1) Is this a muscle cramp, a contracture or a mimic? (2) Are the cramps exercise induced, idiopathic or symptomatic? (3) What is/are the presumed cause(s) of symptomatic muscle cramps or contractures? (4) What should be the diagnostic approach? and (5) How should we advise and treat patients with muscle cramps or contractures? We consider these questions and present a practical approach to muscle cramps and contractures, including their causes, pathophysiology and treatment options.

### The athlete with muscular cramps: clinical approach [^3b48422e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps are involuntary, painful, spasmodic contractions of the skeletal muscle. Although cramps are a common clinical complaint, their etiology and management have not been well established. Exercise-associated muscle cramps occur during or immediately following exercise, and they are associated with muscular fatigue and shortened muscle contraction. The main challenges for treating physicians are to identify whether the complaint represents a true muscle cramp as well as to rule out the presence of an underlying serious clinical condition. Muscle cramps may be a symptom of any of several conditions, including radiculopathies, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, vascular problems, electrolyte disorders, and metabolic myopathies. Cramps also may occur as a side effect of certain drugs (eg, lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensives, beta-agonists, insulin, oral contraceptives, alcohol). Most athletes who experience exercise-associated muscle cramps are healthy individuals without systemic illness. Therapy should focus on preventing premature fatigue by means of appropriate nutrition and adequate training.

### Muscle cramps [^b9116cd0]. Muscle & Nerve (2005). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps are a common problem characterized by a sudden, painful, involuntary contraction of muscle. These true cramps, which originate from peripheral nerves, may be distinguished from other muscle pain or spasm. Medical history, physical examination, and a limited laboratory screen help to determine the various causes of muscle cramps. Despite the "benign" nature of cramps, many patients find the symptom very uncomfortable. Treatment options are guided both by experience and by a limited number of therapeutic trials. Quinine sulfate is an effective medication, but the side-effect profile is worrisome, and other membrane-stabilizing drugs are probably just as effective. Patients will benefit from further studies to better define the pathophysiology of muscle cramps and to find more effective medications with fewer side-effects.

Pathophysiology

The defining features of tetanus — muscular rigidity, spasms, and autonomic instability — stem directly from tetanus toxin (TeNT). Previously termed tetanospasmin, TeNT targets inhibitory interneurons in the CNS. Understanding the toxin mechanism (Figure 2) is essential for interpreting symptoms, anticipating complications, and guiding treatment.

C. tetani spores, ubiquitous in soil and animal faeces, including human excrement, are remarkably resilient, withstanding boiling, freezing and disinfectants, including ethanol. Inoculation may occur via farming or gardening injuries; in road traffic accidents; or falls, particularly with foreign body retention. Other routes include animal bites, burns, injections, and unclean surgical procedures, notably circumcision and termination of pregnancy. Once introduced, spores germinate, and bacilli secrete two key toxins: tetanolysin and TeNT. While the role of tetanolysin remains unclear, it may promote anaerobic conditions for bacterial proliferation.

TeNT binds to peripheral motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction and undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the spinal cord and brainstem, similar to the rabies virus. Within the CNS, TeNT targets presynaptic glycine- and GABA-ergic interneurons, cleaving its substrate, synaptobrevin-2, and disrupting the SNARE complex essential for neurotransmitter release. The resultant failure of inhibitory neurotransmission leads to unchecked downstream motor activity, manifesting as muscle rigidity, spasms, and hyperreflexia. This also affects reflex circuits; unopposed motor activity within reflex arcs underlies stimulus-induced spasms of agonist and antagonist muscles. TeNT may spread through the lymphatics, bloodstream, and trans-synaptically within the CNS. Unlike TeNT, botulinum toxin type B — a closely-related neurotoxin that also targets synaptobrevin — acts peripherally without retrograde transport, and therefore engenders a dramatically different neurological syndrome characterised by rapidly-progressive descending flaccid paralysis, with a short incubation period. Autonomic dysfunction in severe tetanus is thought to be caused by disinhibition of autonomic neurons, resulting in dysregulated catecholamine release.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^6c6e89cb]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Currently a rarity in high-income countries, tetanus is a diagnosis not to miss. Deaths from tetanus fell by almost 90% between 1990 and 2019, largely reflecting the success of the World Health Organization's Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus elimination campaign. However, deaths amongst children and adults have plateaued, and tetanus remains an important vaccine-preventable cause of morbidity and mortality, notably in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Tetanus results from infections with spore-forming Clostridium tetani bacteria, usually acquired via contaminated wounds and burns. C. tetani releases a potent neurotoxin, causing muscle spasms, rigidity, and dysautonomia. Important complications include laryngeal spasm, leading to airway obstruction and respiratory arrest; nosocomial infections; and sequelae of prolonged immobility. Tetanus is a clinical diagnosis, but microbiological tests may serve as useful adjuncts. Treatment is multifaceted, requiring source control, antibiotic therapy, and antitoxin administration. With prolonged, quality intensive care, many patients survive with good functional outcome. However, due to challenges in leveraging routinely-collected healthcare data and performing high-quality trials in resource-constrained settings, several key questions remain unanswered and optimal treatment strategies are contested. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of global tetanus epidemiology; its clinical features and differential diagnosis; principles of management; and prognosis.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^373262bc]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Causes of rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis can be divided into non-exertional and exertional causes (box 1), although certain non-exertional causes are due to generalised muscle overactivity, such as alcohol withdrawal, status epilepticus or tetany. Some causes, such as statin medications, may be obvious but others need more careful thought, as in case 2. A detailed history of the preceding activity is required, particularly for certain metabolic myopathies where events can be triggered by non-exertional muscle contraction, including emotional situations.

Box 1
Causes of rhabdomyolysis

Non-exertional causes

Drug Amphetamines, cocaine, cyclosporine, fibrates, isoniazid, lithium, neuromuscular blocking agents, propofol, quetiapine, statins, zidovudine.
Toxic Alcohol, heavy metal poisoning, snake venom.
Metabolic Alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothyroidism, serotonin syndrome, status epilepticus.
Inflammatory Dermatomyositis, polymyositis.
Infection Coxsackie, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, HIV, malaria, tetanus, other viruses.
Local muscle damage Crush injury, compartment syndrome, muscle ischaemia.

Exertional causes

Heat-related injuries (table 1, case 1) Heat stroke, heat injury.
Metabolic myopathies Glycogenolytic disorders. Fatty acid metabolism disorders. Mitochondrial disorders. Structural myopathies (eg, dystrophinopathies).

### Tetanus [^05fd6073]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease that still commonly occurs in many low-income and middle-income countries, although it is rare in high-income countries. The disease is caused by the toxin of the bacterium Clostridium tetani and is characterised by muscle spasms and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Global vaccination initiatives have had considerable success but they continue to face many challenges. Treatment for tetanus aims to control spasms and reduce cardiovascular instability, and consists of wound debridement, antitoxin, antibiotics, and supportive care. Recent research has focused on intravenous magnesium sulphate and intrathecal antitoxin administration as methods of spasm control that can avoid the need for ventilatory support. Nevertheless, without access to mechanical ventilation, mortality from tetanus remains high. Even with such care, patients require several weeks of hospitalisation and are vulnerable to secondary problems, such as hospital-acquired infections.

Diagnosis

Tetanus is a clinical diagnosis. Specific diagnostic tests, such as rapid immunoassays, lack standalone confirmatory utility, and may be inaccessible in resource-constrained settings where tetanus is most common. Local or national case definitions aid early recognition and treatment. At the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, tetanus is defined as 'presence of trismus, dysphagia and continuous generalised muscle rigidity or spasms, in the presence of a normal conscious level and without fever at onset'. In contrast, the UK Health Security Agency defines tetanus as an 'acute illness with muscle spasms or hypertonia, and a diagnosis of tetanus made by a healthcare provider'.
The differential diagnosis for generalised tetanus (Table 1) includes hypocalcaemic tetany, NMS, drug-induced dystonias, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, stiff-person syndrome, cerebral malaria and strychnine poisoning. Although banned across the European Union and Canada, strychnine-based rat poison is widely available in the USA and many low- and middle-income countries. Strychnine, a competitive glycine receptor antagonist, produces a clinical syndrome virtually indistinguishable from tetanus when accidentally or deliberately consumed. Cephalic tetanus may mimic brainstem stroke, Bell's palsy, myasthenia gravis, or botulism.

Basic tests help rule out differentials and identify complications. All suspected cases should undergo urinalysis to assess for haematuria (a proxy for myoglobinuria) to exclude spasm-induced rhabdomyolysis alongside serum creatine kinase (CK) level where available. Urine is also the preferred sample type for suspected strychnine poisoning.

Other blood tests, including serial full blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), renal, liver and bone profiles, magnesium, and blood gas analysis are also useful. Mild leukocytosis is common; neutrophilia is a poor prognostic indicator.CRP is usually moderately elevated, but may be normal; a marked rise may signify concurrent bacterial infection (typically cellulitis or sepsis at first presentation, and nosocomial infection later). Renal profile may identify AKI, bone profile can exclude hypocalcaemic tetany, and serum magnesium monitoring is useful during IV replacement.

### Positive muscle phenomena – diagnosis, pathogenesis and associated disorders [^3fb1e3c5]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Positive muscle phenomena arise owing to various forms of spontaneous muscle hyperactivity originating in motor neurons or in the muscle itself. Although they are common in a wide range of neurological and non-neurological diseases, clinical and scientific data on these phenomena are limited, and their presence is sometimes overlooked. This gap in our knowledge hampers effective diagnosis and treatment. In this article, we review the clinical characteristics and approach to diagnosis of the various positive muscle phenomena, and discuss their genetic underpinnings and pathophysiological mechanisms. Finally, we outline an algorithm to discriminate between the different positive muscle phenomena.

### A summary of spasticity management – a treatment algorithm [^4c7169ec]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The muscle overactivity seen in spasticity results in limb stiffness and muscle spasm, to which there is both a neurogenic and a biomechanical component. Spasticity does not always cause harm and can assist in the rehabilitation process enabling a patient to stand when their limb weakness would not otherwise allow it. When it does cause harm, however, treatment is required. This aims to (i) prevent provocative factors (ii) treat muscle overactivity; and (iii) prevent complications. Untreated, limb contracture, pain and other complications occur and early management can be most effective. Treatment is essentially physical, but, when this is inadequate, pharmacological intervention may be required. A strategy has been devised which shows that the first choice pharmacological treatment of focal spasticity is botulinum toxin. Over the past decade, the choice of treatment has become more ambitious with the establishment of new technologies. Good management now depends on an understanding of their role and application in relation to the needs of individual patients. To this end, a treatment algorithm which covers the salient facts in patient assessment and gives the indications for the range of available treatments, is the best approach. The indications and limitations of the available treatments are discussed, along with their place in the overall management of the patients. The evidence base for much of what is done is not strong and this summary examines the activities of proven value and of consensus view.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism: a series of three cases and an unusual presentation of ocular tetany [^a04a57ef]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, increased serum parathormone and insensitivity to the biological activity of parathormone. These patients may present for incidental surgery, procedures related to kidney stones, cataract removals and renal transplants. No particular anaesthetic agent or technique is indicated except that respiratory alkalosis should be avoided as it may further decrease ionised calcium levels and thereby precipitate tetany. In this report, we present the peri-operative management of three patients with this rare condition and describe an unusual presentation of hypocalcaemic extra-ocular muscle spasm.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^8482ca75]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

What are the new findings

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ERM) may be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease that lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown.
Consider a genetic cause of the ERM in case of recurrent episodes; high creatine kinase (CK) levels (> 50×upper limit of normal) or persisting hyperCKaemia; absence of unaccustomed exercise; absence of (recreational or medical) drugs; or a positive family history of rhabdomyolysis or other exertional symptoms.
Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1) mutations have been recently recognised to account for a substantial proportion of patients presenting with ERM.
Participants with a genetic predisposition to ERM need specific guidance when they recommence exercise and sporting activities.

### A rare case of tetanus with early manifestation of apnea but without trismus [^fc4e82ca]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tetanus is a life-threatening disease caused by tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) produced by Clostridium tetani. Early symptoms of tetanus are trismus and muscle stiffness, both caused by spasticity. TeNT mainly exerts its effect by impairment of inhibitory neurons in the spine and brainstem, resulting in the hyperactivity of motor neurons, which causes spasticity and muscle spasms. Apnea is not a symptom that is predicted to occur in the early stages.

Case Report

We present a rare case of severe tetanus with an early manifestation of apnea but without trismus. We believe that apnea was caused by spasms of the intercostal muscles and its early manifestation was due to a high load of TeNT, considering that the speed of disease progression is related to disease severity. We hypothesize that the absence of trismus was also due to a high load of TeNT, exerting toxic effect at the neuromuscular junction and causing flaccid paralysis of the masseters. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Since there is no diagnostic laboratory test for tetanus, emergency physicians must be well aware of symptoms that may or may not appear in tetanus. Tetanus should be considered as a differential diagnosis for patients arriving at the emergency department with apnea as an early symptom. The absence of trismus should not rule out the possibility of tetanus.

### Tetanus in pregnancy [^a550ddb3]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Tetanus remains a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. It is caused by the release of two toxins produced by Clostridium tetani, a noninvasive gram-positive anaerobic bacillus. Tetanospasmin is taken up by the neuronal end plates and prevents neurotransmitter release at the synaptic junction. This leads to spasms and is irreversible. Recovery requires the formation of new neurons and may take months. Generalized muscle spasm, respiratory compromise, and autonomic dysfunction are all common clinical manifestations. Diagnosis is based mainly on history and clinical examination. The management of the pregnant woman is similar to the nonpregnant individual. The main objectives are prompt prevention of further toxin absorption, wound debridement, antibiotic therapy, and aggressive supportive care. Primary and secondary prevention protocols are important worldwide because tetanus is a preventable disease. The tetanus toxoid vaccine can be given in pregnancy.

Calcium deficiency — physiology, bariatric surgery patterns, monitoring, and supplementation: Calcium is a mineral necessary for proper nerve transmission, muscle contraction, bone structure, and cellular function, calcium deficiency may result in decreased bone mineralization, osteopenia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and severe hypocalcemia can lead to tetany (e.g., muscle contractions, spasms, or paresthesia). Relative calcium deficiency sometimes occurs with gastric sleeve and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass when assessed by elevated parathyroid levels (even if calcium levels are within normal limits), calcium deficiency commonly occurs after BPD-DS, and calcium deficiency can occur as the result of vitamin D deficiency with clinical surveys suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is common after bariatric surgery. When clinically relevant calcium deficiency occurs after bariatric surgery, 25-hydroxy-(OH)-vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone are often monitored post-operatively, and calcium and vitamin D supplements are commonly administered after bariatric surgeries, beyond a high-quality bariatric multivitamin/mineral/trace element supplement.

### A patient with speechlessness and rhabdomyolysis: a rare presentation of severe hypocalcaemia [^e69dd96d]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We present a patient with a plethora of peculiar findings caused by hypocalcaemia. The most striking symptoms were his hoarse voice and episodes of complete speechlessness, indicating an atypical presentation of laryngospasm or spasm of vocalising muscles due to severe hypocalcaemia.

Hypocalcaemia causes neuromuscular irritability, which can manifest as muscle cramps and paraesthesia of the hand and feet and in severe cases as carpopedal spasms, laryngospasms and seizures. Laryngospasm, usually presenting with dyspnoea and stridor, is a rare but known and life-threatening sequela of hypocalcaemia traditionally seen in infants. Stridor and dyspnoea have been described in adults as well. However, both cases presented patients with stridor and non-specific problems of the throat, like hoarseness, were not described.

Another striking symptom our patient presented with were oesophageal spasms, leading to direct vomiting after drinking cold water. To the best of our knowledge, oesophageal spasms have not been described before in patients with severe hypocalcaemia. Those spasms are probably the result of neuromuscular irritability of the oesophagus triggered by the ingestion of cold water.

Our patient presented with more peculiar findings that require some additional attention.

First, our patient presented a concomitant rhabdomyolysis which resolved after treatment of his hypocalcaemia, suggesting the hypocalcaemia caused his rhabdomyolysis whereas his (moderate) physical exercise may have aggravated muscle cell loss. Our hypothesis was supported by repeated episodes of hypocalcaemia during follow-up, all accompanied by rhabdomyolysis, disappearing after normalisation of plasma calcium.

One might speculate that increased levels of muscle enzymes are associated with muscle cell damage through the ischaemia that occurs in tetanic spasms as a result of hypocalcaemia. This phenomenon has indeed been described in patients suffering from tetanus. However, the mechanisms of raised CK concentrations due to hypocalcaemia are not well understood, since not all patients with hypocalcaemia develop clinically evident myopathy.

### Cause of exercise associated muscle cramps (EAMC) – altered neuromuscular control, dehydration or electrolyte depletion? [^bd68b9c9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exercise Associated Muscle Cramps (EAMC) is one of the most common conditions that require medical attention during or immediately after sports events. Despite the high prevalence of this condition the aetiology of EAMC in athletes is still not well understood. The purpose of this review is to examine current scientific evidence in support of (1) the "electrolyte depletion" and "dehydration" hypotheses and (2) the "altered neuromuscular control" hypothesis in the aetiology of EAMC. In this review, scientific evidence will, as far as possible, be presented using evidence-based medicine criteria. This is particularly relevant in this field, as the quality of experimental methodology varies considerably among studies that are commonly cited in support of hypotheses to explain the aetiology of EAMC. Scientific evidence in support of the "electrolyte depletion" and "dehydration" hypotheses for the aetiology of EAMC comes mainly from anecdotal clinical observations, case series totalling 18 cases, and one small (n = 10) case-control study. Results from four prospective cohort studies do not support these hypotheses. In addition, the "electrolyte depletion" and "dehydration" hypotheses do not offer plausible pathophysiological mechanisms with supporting scientific evidence that could adequately explain the clinical presentation and management of EAMC. Scientific evidence for the "altered neuromuscular control" hypothesis is based on evidence from research studies in human models of muscle cramping, epidemiological studies in cramping athletes, and animal experimental data. Whilst it is clear that further evidence to support the "altered neuromuscular control" hypothesis is also required, research data are accumulating that support this as the principal pathophysiological mechanism for the aetiology of EAMC.

### Pathophysiologic and anesthetic considerations for patients with myotonia congenita or periodic paralyses [^47af5a46]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Myotonia congenita and periodic paralyses are hereditary skeletal muscle channelopathies. In these disorders, various channel defects in the sarcolemma lead to a severely disturbed membrane excitability of the affected skeletal muscles. The clinical picture can range from severe myotonic reactions (e.g., masseter spasm, opisthotonus) to attacks of weakness and paralysis. Provided here is a short overview of the pathomechanisms behind such wide-ranging phenotypic presentations in these patients, followed by recommendations concerning the management of anesthesia in such populations.

### A narrative review of exercise-associated muscle cramps: factors that contribute to neuromuscular fatigue and management implications [^05945f54]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Although exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMC) are highly prevalent among athletic populations, the etiology and most effective management strategies are still unclear. The aims of this narrative review are 3-fold: (1) briefly summarize the evidence regarding EAMC etiology; (2) describe the risk factors and possible physiological mechanisms associated with neuromuscular fatigue and EAMC; and (3) report the current evidence regarding prevention of, and treatment for, EAMC. Based on the findings of several large prospective and experimental investigations, the available evidence indicates that EAMC is multifactorial in nature and stems from an imbalance between excitatory drive from muscle spindles and inhibitory drive from Golgi tendon organs to the alpha motor neurons rather than dehydration or electrolyte deficits. This imbalance is believed to stem from neuromuscular overload and fatigue. In concert with these findings, the most successful treatment for an acute bout of EAMC is stretching, whereas auspicious methods of prevention include efforts that delay exercise-induced fatigue.

### Clinical overview of tetanus… [^686ae1f4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Clostridium tetani bacteria produce potent toxins and can cause tetanus. C. tetaniare common in the environment and infect people through breaks in the skin.
- Not being up to date with tetanus vaccines is the biggest risk factor for infection.
- Diagnostic tests aren't useful in supporting or ruling out tetanus.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Cause Tetanus is an infection caused by C. tetani spores. In anaerobic conditions, including those within the body, the spores germinate. The bacteria produce very potent toxins that the blood stream and lymphatic system can disseminate throughout the body. One of these toxins, tetanospasmin, is responsible for the serious effects of tetanus.

Tetanus toxin Tetanus toxin acts in the sympathetic nervous system and at several sites within the central nervous system:

- Brain
- Peripheral motor end plates
- Spinal cord Tetanus toxin causes the typical clinical manifestations of tetanus by interfering with the release of neurotransmitters and blocking inhibitor impulses. This leads to unopposed muscle contractions and spasms. Risk factors Most U. S. tetanus cases today are among adults who either
- Never received a tetanus vaccine
- Didn't stay up to date with their 10-year tetanus booster shots Other risk factors for tetanus include:

- Being 80 years or older
- Having diabetes
- Immunosuppression
- Using intravenous drugs. Risk during natural disasters Disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis generally don't raise the level of tetanus in the environment. However, the number of tetanus cases may increase during natural disasters because of injuries leading to tetanus exposure.

There may also be delays in or lack of medical services and supplies. Diagnosis Tetanus is a clinical syndrome. Healthcare providers diagnose tetanus based on clinical presentation, in the absence of a more likely cause. Clinical presentation of tetanus includes:

- Trismus
- Spasms
- Muscle rigidity
- Difficulty swallowing or breathing
- Other findings consistent with tetanus Diagnostic tests aren't useful in supporting or ruling out tetanus. Keep ReadingClinical Care of Tetanus.

### Hypercalcaemia to hypocalcaemia: tetany as a side effect of intravenous bisphosphonate treatment [^84bad308]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s with advanced bladder cancer was admitted to hospital with hypercalcaemia of malignancy. Initially, she presented with non-specific symptoms of malaise, fatigue and general deterioration. She was treated with intravenous fluids and zoledronic acid in order to bring her calcium levels down, but subsequently developed significant hypocalcaemia. This manifested as tetany in the hands in the form of bilateral carpopedal spasm. She also reported perioral paraesthesia. Bloods during her admission revealed deranged electrolytes, and her vitamin D level was on the lower scale of normal (25nmol/L). The patient's symptoms improved with electrolyte replacement and oral baclofen for her symptomatically distressing wrist and hand muscle spasms. This case report is a reminder that bisphosphonates can cause significant hypocalcaemia with symptoms of tetany, even when they are given for initial hypercalcaemia. Baclofen worked well to improve symptoms.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) supportive care — Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; however, in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury with unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk. Rasburicase is given as a single dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg; the maximum dose is 6 mg and it should be repeated only if necessary based on laboratory values, and if used, blood samples for uric acid must be placed on ice to avoid spuriously low levels. Hyperkalemia management per Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) removes exogenous potassium sources, with frequent potassium checks (every 4–6 hours), continuous cardiac monitoring, and oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate recommended; glucose plus insulin or beta agonists can be temporizing measures, and calcium gluconate may be used to reduce dysrhythmia risk while awaiting hemodialysis and/or hemofiltration, which most effectively remove potassium. Hyperphosphatemia is managed with a phosphorus-restricted diet and consideration of phosphate binder such as sevelamer; do not use calcium carbonate in patients at risk for TLS, especially if the calcium phosphate product is > 60 mg²/dL². For hypocalcemia, correct hyperphosphatemia and avoid calcium supplementation unless symptomatic with tetany, muscle spasm, or Trousseau/Chvostek signs. Consider hemodialysis/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for worsening renal function when electrolyte abnormalities do not correct with medical management. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Calcitonin salmon (Miacalcin) [^f67d3ba4]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

Because postmarketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Miacalcin injection.

Allergic / Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving calcitonin salmon injection, e.g., bronchospasm, swelling of the tongue or throat, anaphylactic shock, and death due to anaphylaxis.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria

Hypocalcemia: Hypocalcemia with tetany (i.e. muscle cramps, twitching) and seizure activity have been reported.

Body as a Whole: influenza-like symptoms, fatigue, edema (facial, peripheral, and generalized)

Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain

Cardiovascular: hypertension

Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea

Urinary System: polyuria

Nervous System: dizziness, headache, paresthesia, tremor

Vision: visual disturbance

6.3	Immunogenicity

Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of medicinal products containing peptides, administration of Miacalcin may trigger the development of anti-calcitonin antibodies. Circulating antibodies to calcitonin salmon after 2 to 18 months of treatment have been reported in about one-half of the patients with Paget's disease in whom antibody studies were done. In some cases, high antibody titers are found; these patients usually will have a loss of response to treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive antibody test result may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of antibodies among different calcitonin salmon products may be misleading.

### Cramps, muscle pain, and fasciculations: not always benign? [^89b1f4a2]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Fasciculation and cramps without weakness or muscle atrophy are recognized as a benign syndrome. The authors report a patient with cramp and fasciculation, which persisted for 1 year without abnormal motor unit morphology on EMG before progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and EMG abnormalities developed. This observation raises the possibility that lower motor neuron hyperexcitability may precede motor neuron death in motor neuron disease.

### Airway management of tetanus after the Haitian earthquake: new aspects of old observations [^ede71149]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Two men developed severe tetanus after the 2010 Haitian earthquake. They were admitted to the United States Naval Ship Comfort, a hospital ship sent to provide humanitarian relief. Severe masseter and intercostal muscle spasm impaired airway access and ventilation. Propofol and sevoflurane relieved the tetany, allowing airway control and ventilation without intubation or neuromuscular blocking drugs during wound debridement. Presynaptic impairment of inhibitory neurotransmitter release by tetanospasmin toxin is countered by enhancement of spinal cord postsynaptic inhibitory receptor activity by general anesthetics. Avoidance of tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation during anesthesia may be desirable in the settings of limited resources in which tetanus usually presents.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^53c5ed44]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

What is ERM?

Background

In muscle tissue, the process of neuronal signal transduction leading to muscle contraction is called excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). During ECC, presynaptic acetylcholine release induces postsynaptic depolarisation of the sarcolemma, resulting in activation of the voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (also known as dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs)). Unlike in cardiac muscle, it is not this calcium influx itself but rather the direct interaction between DHPRs and RyR1s that causes the opening of RyR1 Ca²⁺ channels, leading to a rapid release of Ca²⁺ from the intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stores. The increased myoplasmic Ca²⁺ (from about 10⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁵ M) induces the effective interaction between thick and thin filaments by binding to troponin C, and this ultimately leads to muscle contraction. After contraction, calcium needs to be restored. This happens through active transport facilitated by the Ca²⁺-ATPase, an active process that on the molecular level takes 10⁵ times longer than does RyR1-induced calcium release but is compensated for by the large number of Ca²⁺-ATPases on the surface of the SR membrane.

Irrespective of its cause(s), the pathophysiological events in rhabdomyolysis follow a common pathway. Normally, ion pumps and channels in the sarcolemma maintain a low intracellular Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ and a high intracellular K⁺ concentration. Unaccustomed exercise may cause direct injury to the sarcolemma (eg, in eccentric exercise) and/or lead to failure of energy production with subsequent pump dysfunction of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and Ca²⁺-ATPase (eg, in prolonged training beyond the limit of fatigue). Both processes lead to increased cellular permeability to sodium ions and, consequently, increased intracellular calcium concentrations, with concordant muscle contraction increasing the energy deficit. This increased intracellular calcium concentration also enhances the activation of calcium-dependent proteases and phospholipases, which contributes to destruction of myofibrillar, cytoskeletal and membrane proteins. Subsequently, large quantities of intracellular electrolytes, metabolites (potassium, phosphate and urate) as well as intracellular proteins (aldolase, myoglobin, CK, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase) leak into the circulation. The resulting free calcium will only add to the contraction of the already overactivated surrounding myocytes, resulting in a vicious circle (figure 1).

### Pain assessment and treatment in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system [^c57db218]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Spasticity, muscle spasms, and dystonia in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system (SNI) may coexist with or be influenced by chronic pain sources, and a multimodal approach may be beneficial. In children with SNI and recurrent pain behaviors, it can be unclear whether associated spasticity or dystonia are the direct cause of pain behaviors or if a chronic pain source is triggering observed changes in tone and movement, and when pain behaviors coexist with spasticity or dystonia, children with SNI may benefit from a multimodal approach, including interventions directed at chronic pain sources as well as spasticity or dystonia. Spasticity is defined as hypertonia in which stretching the muscle at increasing speed results in higher tone or resistance to externally imposed movement, is often not painful but over time can result in painful musculoskeletal injury, and intense muscle spasms can result in intermittent pain, with spasticity and muscle spasms increased by acute illness and pain. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that lead to repetitive twisting movements and/or abnormal postures, is not typically painful, and pain from any source can increase movements associated with dystonia.

### Pregnancy with cytochrome oxidase-deficient mitochondrial myopathy [^c5ce5d6a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cytochrome oxidase-deficient mitochondrial myopathies represent a heterogeneous group of muscle disorders. Physical stress can cause life-threatening risks related to rhabdomyolysis or respiratory compromise.

Case

A 21-year-old primigravida with cytochrome C oxidase-deficient mitochondrial myopathy who presented for obstetric care at 8 weeks' gestation complained of muscle fatigue and spasm after exertion. The increased metabolic demands of pregnancy led to worsening pain, muscle fatigue, and ultimately complete immobility.

Conclusion

Cytochrome oxidase-deficient mitochondrial myopathies are rare but serious complications of pregnancy.

### Generalised weakness in a young patient: a cause for concern? [^907bdf94]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Muscular weakness in young patients is usually due to mild, self-limiting causes. Nonetheless, it is important to remember other, more serious aetiologies which can cause this clinical picture. Thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (THPP) is a rare disease in Europe and the USA, with fatal cardiovascular and respiratory complications. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of generalised muscular weakness, especially in the legs, with an associated hypokalaemia and hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, laboratory tests and an ECG. Early treatment focused on cautious correction blood potassium and non-cardiac selective β-blockers. Additionally, it is imperative to normalise thyroid function to prevent relapses. We present a young, healthy man to the emergency department with episodes of intermittent leg weakness. The history and the ECG findings allowed for the diagnosis of THPP to be reached with early treatment causing remission.

### A case of tetanus infection in an adult with a protective tetanus antibody level [^c7c061da]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani and most commonly presents as trismus or other muscle spasms. Despite the development of the tetanus toxoid vaccine, tetanus infection has not been eradicated. Additionally, while there are hypothesized protective levels of tetanus antibody, tetanus infection may still occur in properly vaccinated individuals. We report the case of a 31-year-old male that presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of neck and jaw pain. He reports puncturing his hand with a rusty nail 10 days prior. His reported vaccination history was that he received his last booster vaccination 13 years prior to presentation. In the ED, tetanus vaccine, tetanus immune globulin, and metronidazole were administered. His symptoms improved over the next 2 days and resolved at day 6. Despite his presentation of tetanus infection and rule out of other causes for his symptoms, his tetanus antibody level was reported at 8.4 U/mL, which is considered to be protective. A tetanus antibody level that is adequate for protective immunity should not preclude a patient from treatment of tetanus infection. This case demonstrates that a thorough history, physical exam, and rule out of other causes should guide treatment when there is concern for a tetanus infection.

### Localised normocalcaemic tetany secondary to dehydration in an individual with gitelman syndrome [^f9f4a0e4]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Dehydration is a common presentation to any emergency department with symptoms ranging from lethargy, confusion, oliguria as well as those specific to the underlying cause. In this case we describe a young patient who following a short history of vomiting and abdominal pain developed carpopedal spasm and distal parasthesia on a background of Gitelman syndrome. Biochemical blood analysis showed a marked hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and mild metabolic alkalosis in addition to a prolonged QTc interval of 592 ms seen on ECG. Following fluid replacement and electrolyte correction his clinical symptoms resolved along with QTc normalisation. This case demonstrates a patient with a rare and interesting renal disorder who presented with typical biochemical and ECG abnormalities in addition to tetany in the presence of normal plasma calcium.

### Assessment: symptomatic treatment for muscle cramps (an evidence-based review): report of the therapeutics and technology assessment subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^2b9747a5]. Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps — definition, prevalence, and associated conditions are summarized as follows: Muscle cramps are involuntary, generally painful contractions of a muscle or muscle group. A cross-sectional prevalence study of 365 outpatients aged 65 or older in the United Kingdom reports that 50% of outpatients report frequent cramps, and another review of 515 elderly veterans reports a similar prevalence of 56%, with half having cramps occurring at least once per week. When the motor system is stressed, either by a neuromuscular disease or by a physiologic stress such as dehydration or excessive exercise, cramps become more frequent, and neuropathic conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), peripheral neuropathies, and cramp-fasciculation syndrome are commonly associated. In addition to neurologic conditions, multiple medical conditions such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypothyroidism, and renal or liver dysfunction may be the cause, and cramps are also frequent during the last trimester of pregnancy and in athletes such as marathon runners. When no underlying cause of recurrent muscle cramps can be identified, they are referred to as idiopathic muscle cramps, which are usually most prominent in the lower leg and foot muscles and more evident at night.

### Activation of human nerves by hyperventilation and hypocalcemia… [^5c56d0e8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE SYMPTOMS of irritation in an attack of tetany in adult man consist of tingling, which begins in the face and hands, and, somewhat later, a feeling of tension and spasm in the face and the small muscles of the hand. If the attack is aggravated, the tingling and spasm spread from the hand proximally along the arm. Immediately afterward the same symptoms begin to manifest themselves peripherally in the legs, spreading proximally and finally reaching the trunk. In addition, fascicular twitches in muscles, bordering on spasm, irregularly occur. It was previously shown1 that these symptoms of irritation studied in the arm were caused by spontaneous discharges first and foremost in the proximal part of the longest nerve fibers. The activity starts in the tactile fibers, from which the typical sensation of tingling originates, and, somewhat later, is set up in other afferent fibers, producing a feeling of tension.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^cfa812ba]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Epidemiology of Tetanus

Tetanus is a life-threatening but vaccine-preventable disease caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. The organism is a ubiquitous, spore-forming, motile Gram-positive bacillus found in high concentrations in soil and animal excrement. C. tetani spores enter the body through breaches in the skin or mucous membranes. Germination of C. tetani spores occurs under anaerobic conditions, such as in necrotic tissue that can result from deep puncture wounds or blunt trauma. C. tetani bacilli vegetate and produce tetanospasmin, a powerful exotoxin that binds irreversibly with neural tissue and causes spasms and rigidity of skeletal muscles. Direct person-to-person transmission of C. tetani does not occur.

The incubation period from injury to symptom onset varies from 3 to 21 days (median: 7 days), with extremes of 1 day to several months. The incubation period depends on the severity and site of the wound. Shorter incubation periods are associated with more severe disease and a poorer prognosis; longer incubation periods are associated with injuries furthest from the central nervous system. The course of disease is variable but is usually intense for ≥ 4 weeks before subsiding. The convalescent period is usually protracted and long-term neurologic sequelae and intellectual and behavioral abnormalities might follow recovery. The case-fatality ratio for tetanus is highest in infants and the elderly, and can be as high as 100% without high-quality medical care, but is approximately 10%–20% even in modern health care facilities.

### Current practice in the management of tetanus [^d1f72d48]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The past three decades have seen a marked reduction in the global burden of tetanus, and following the campaign directed at elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus, the World Health Organization estimates that 58,000 newborns died in 2010, a 93% reduction from the situation in the late 1980s. Several countries have successful immunization programs in place, but tetanus still continues to be an important, though hugely preventable, cause of mortality in several regions in the developing world. Although tetanus toxoid was first used extensively in the Second World War, the types of wounds leading to tetanus have shown a recent trend to be less severe and often trivial, possibly because more serious wounds are generally given more expeditious and thorough medical attention.

The best chance of saving lives is by timely diagnosis and impeccable management of tetanus cases, which is a tough ask when physicians may not have experienced cases during their period of training. The issue is compounded by the fact that the diagnosis of tetanus is entirely clinical, with hardly any role for investigative modalities. Moreover, the management of tetanus is a challenge even for most physicians experienced in the care of such patients, and novices and old hands alike should be supported by having access to current recommendations and evidence-based therapeutic strategies.

The principles of management of tetanus include sedation and control of muscle spasms, neutralization of tetanus toxin, prevention of production of tetanus toxin by use of antibiotics to which Clostridium tetani is susceptible and by wound debridement, treatment of complications, including autonomic dysfunction, and supportive care.

The improvement of facilities in ICUs has led to a shift towards deep sedation, total paralysis and ventilator support in patients with severe tetanus. This has, however, resulted in a paradoxical increase in ventilator- associated complications, and renewed interest in sedation and control of muscle spasms by newer and often experimental pharmacological agents. Moreover, facilities for ventilator support are often limited in the very same parts of the world where tetanus is still a bane to contend with.

The narrative review of Rodrigo and colleagues takes a close look at the current evidence base for the use of newer agents for control of muscle spasms, including intravenous magnesium sulfate, intrathecal baclofen, dantrolene and botulinum toxin. The main stumbling blocks preventing widespread use of intrathecal baclofen were found to be the expensive intrathecal drug delivery system, the chance for infection and the need for specialized care in an ICU, due to its propensity to cause cardiorespiratory instability.

### Traditional Chinese rehabilitation exercise (TCRE) for myofascial pain: current evidence and further challenges [^aa98ff42]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The Relationship Between the Fascial Structure and Disease

Current research has shown that myofascial chain-related disorders' characteristics include myofascitis, joint function limitation, pain, or fatigue. During constant movement and friction, muscle-tendon junction and tendon attachment points are easily damaged, including myofascial trigger points (MTrP). Due to the integral nature of mechanical changes with tension structures, when MTrPs are out of treatment for a long time and repeatedly activated often produce a disease characterized by spasms, nodular points, and pain. In addition, the fascia is rich in nerve endings and autonomic nerves, which intensely perceive the force acting on the muscle fibers. Therefore, after the fascia injury, the mechanical effects on the muscle also affect the body's nerve signals transport. As illustrated in Figure 2, the myofascial continuity among components of the musculoskeletal system demonstrates that any aberration at one point can spread to influence others, resulting in pain or dysfunction. The clinical manifestations are (i) Pain: sudden onset of muscle overuse and subsequent short-term pain, chronic pain, and accompanying increased sympathetic activity. (ii) Nodules: pressure pain can be felt in the affected muscle area with tension bands and spastic nodules that trigger local spasms on touch or tingling. (iii) Movement restriction: The affected muscles have a restricted range of motion, retraction, and decreased muscle strength. In addition, the symptoms are aggravated by exertion and sleep deprivation.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^ea3a005f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ERM most often represents a 'physiological' response to extreme physical exercise or to normal exercise under extreme circumstances. In contrast, ERM might also be the first manifestation of a genetic muscle disease, which lowers the exercise threshold for developing muscle breakdown. A genetic cause should always be considered in individuals with repeated episodes of ERM and in those in whom the severity of rhabdomyolysis exceeds the expected response to the exercise performed.

The recognition of a patient with an underlying genetic disorder is essential for acute management as well as (and most importantly) for counselling afterwards. First, in type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1)-related cases of ERM, the specific RyR1 antagonist dantrolene could be administered to limit further muscle breakdown and CK increases and more severe, potentially life-threatening downstream medical complications. Patients with RYR1 -related ERM will have a higher recurrence risk and will have to be specifically advised with regard to subsequent sporting activities. The same patients are also at increased risk of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), a pharmacogenetic response to volatile anaesthetics and/or the depolarising muscle relaxant succinylcholine, with important consequences for affected individuals but possibly also for their relatives carrying the same RYR1 variants. Furthermore, certain genetic myopathies carrying an increased rhabdomyolysis risk may also be associated with cardiac or other systemic symptoms that will have to be screened for. Finally, certain medications may be relatively contraindicated and exercise advice should be individually adapted in case of an underlying genetic cause.

The present review therefore aims to provide a practical guideline for the acute management and postepisode counselling of patients with ERM. The vast majority of the relevant literature until now has focused either on the physiological circumstances of ERM (particularly in publications with an emphasis on sports or military medicine), on general causes of rhabdomyolysis, or on genetic myopathies which may predispose to rhabdomyolysis (particularly in publications with an emphasis on emergency medicine, genetics, neurology and neuromuscular medicine). As a result, physicians working in sports or military and emergency medicine are well updated on the symptoms and management of ERM, but may find it difficult to decide when to consider an underlying genetic disorder. On the other hand, a neurologist may perform unnecessary muscle biopsies in healthy individuals who have suffered from a single episode of ERM after extreme unaccustomed exercise. Therefore, a combined approach is necessary to recognise individuals who are at risk for recurrent rhabdomyolysis and to advise patients with certain genetic disorders on when and how to recommence exercise and sporting activities.

American Academy of Neurology assessment — symptomatic treatment recommendations state that although likely effective (Level A), quinine derivatives should be avoided for routine use in the management of muscle cramps because of the potential of toxicity, but in select patients they can be considered for an individual therapeutic trial once potential side effects are taken into account. Vitamin B complex, Naftidrofuryl, and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem are possibly effective and may be considered in the management of muscle cramps (Level C).

Conclusion

We have presented an overview of clinical and diagnostic aspects of ERM, in a stepwise approach. At each step, it is important to distinguish normal physiological reactions from ERM as the first manifestation of a genetic disorder. It is essential for physicians working at the 'physiological' end (sports medicine/military medicine) and those working at the clinical end of the medical spectrum (emergency medicine, internal medicine, neurology) to consider that ERM can happen to anyone who is exposed to unaccustomed exercise. The threshold, however, is much lower in patients with an underlying genetic disorder. In addition, several other exogenous and endogenous factors also lower this threshold. The most important question is whether the level and type of exercise in combination with other exogenous and endogenous factors is sufficient to explain the rhabdomyolysis episode. If not, screening for an underlying genetic (neuromuscular) disorder needs to be performed.

Future research should focus on defining specific, evidence-based training and exercise advice for patients with various myopathies, in order to prevent recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis while enabling patients to optimise their physical condition or even improve their strength. New treatments to reduce the risk of ERM should be prospectively tested in various cohorts of patients with genetic risk factors for rhabdomyolysis.

### Heatwaves and human sleep: stress response versus adaptation [^03d8612b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

The World Meteorological Organization considers a heatwave as "a period of statistically unusual hot weather persisting for a number of days and nights". Accompanying the ongoing global climate change, sharp heatwave bouts occur worldwide, growing in frequency and intensity, and beginning earlier in the season. Heatwaves exacerbate the risk of heat-related illnesses, hence human morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable elderly and children. Heat-related illnesses present a continuum from normothermic (prickly heat, heat edema, heat cramps, heat tetany) to hyperthermic syndromes (from heat syncope and heat exhaustion to lethal heat stroke). Heat stroke may occur through passive heating and/or exertional exercise. "Normal sleep", such as observed in temperate conditions, is altered during heatwaves. Brisk excessive heat bouts shorten and fragment human sleep. Particularly, deep N3 sleep (formerly slow-wave sleep) and REM sleep are depleted, such as in other stressful situations. The resultant sleep loss is deleterious to cognitive performance, emotional brain function, behavior, and susceptibility to chronic health conditions and infectious diseases. Our group has previously demonstrated that sleep constitutes an adaptive mechanism during climatic heat acclimatization. In parallel, artificial heat acclimation procedures have been proposed in sports and military activities, and for the elderly. Other preventive actions should be considered, such as education and urban heat island cooling (vegetation, white paint), thus avoiding energy-hungry air conditioning.

We will first discuss the pathophysiology of ERM and its typical clinical features, and provide examples of typical physiological ERM. Next, we will propose a structured approach to patients with ERM, based on the following four key questions: (1) is the ERM clinically significant, requiring hospital admission and intravenous fluids administration? (2) What is the risk of developing acute renal failure (ARF)? (3) Is the ERM the (first) manifestation of a genetic disorder? And (4) when and how to restart exercise and sporting activities? We expect that such an approach will be of benefit for a wide range of physicians facing this severe and challenging condition in different medical settings.

Table 3
Cases based on genetic diagnosis of GS with thyroid disease

Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a syndrome caused by the breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers, resulting in the release of intracellular substances into the systemic circulation. Typical laboratory tests of RM show significantly elevated CK more than 4 times the upper limit of normal and abnormal renal function. Muscle trauma is the most common cause of RM, other causes include excessive physical exertion, inherited metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, drugs (e.g. licorice), alcohol, and electrolyte abnormalities (especially hypokalemia). Potassium is crucial for vasodilation and muscle contraction. Hypokalemia-induced muscular ischemia may increase the permeability of cell membrane, raising the intracellular calcium concentration to destroy myofibrillar, cytoskeletal and membrane proteins, thus leading to muscle necrosis and intracellular CK and myoglobin released into the blood circulation. In this case, the patient was admitted with severe hypokalaemia and tetany which can lead to rhabdomyolysis. Also, some patients with hyperthyroidism can develop RM, which may be related to the increased consumption of energy and substrate stores in muscles. However, our proband developed RM under the stable control of thyroid function. Given the clear diagnosis of GS, we speculated RM was due to persistent hypokalaemia associated with GS but not GD. Although hypokalemia is a common clinical manifestation of GS, GS complicated with RM is relatively rare. Compared to the patients of GS alone, the mutation type and site of the SLC12A3 gene in GS with RM patients are not specific.

### Myopathic manifestations across the adult lifespan of patients with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility: a narrative review [^add10a76]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Although some groups have reported a high incidence of abnormal contracture test results in survivors of exertional heat illness, which also demonstrates an association with RYR1 and CACNA1S variants, it is difficult to estimate the risk of MHS individuals to develop exertional heat illness accurately. MHS individuals might avoid activities that pose a risk for exertional heat illness, although some suggest they compensate for increased heat production through adaptive increases in heat dissipation.

Other symptoms in MHS patients include muscle cramps, stiffness, and myalgias that can appear spontaneously or be induced by exercise. MHS individuals can report muscle cramps or myalgia following statin medication, but there are insufficient data to assert whether these symptoms are more common with MHS compared with the general population. We did not find any reports of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis in patients with a personal or family history of MH.

On physical examination, although most MHS patients have normal strength at a younger age, some develop muscle weakness later in life. Muscle hypertrophy is a common finding in patients with a history of exertional rhabdomyolysis or MHS who harbour RYR1 variants, many of whom report increased muscle tone and frequent cramps. These individuals are often perceived to be physically fitter than their peers.

Recent observations in patients and MH-susceptible animal models suggest that individuals with MHS have increased risk of developing hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, and bleeding abnormalities. Although some studies suggest plausible molecular mechanisms, more preclinical and epidemiological evidence is needed to ascertain MHS association with such disorders.

### Managing essential tremor [^cfc6cbf0]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

If a patient is diagnosed with an ET− or ET+ syndrome, the next question is for a possible etiology. Etiologies might be hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, and medication-induced tremors which have to be excluded with careful medical history and lab tests. Table 1 summarizes the etiologies which can on rare occasions be associated with tremor and can be rarely confused with ET. Certainly, the majority of them will only be addressed with further diagnostics if additional symptoms suggest one of these conditions. Most of the patients with the syndromes of ET or ET+, however, will have no identifiable cause. Certainly, causal treatments will be recommended if a treatable etiology is found.

Table 1
List of different tremor entities which can present with an ET− or ET+ syndrome. Untreatable causes include monogenetic causes, and chromosomal aberrations. Much of the following diseases are causally treatable: infectious and inflammatory diseases, autoimmune neuropathies and spinal muscular atrophies, paraneoplasias, endocrine or metabolic diseases, brain lesions of different etiologies, medications, toxins causing tremor, psychoactive drugs associated with tremor and affective changes, and consequences of physical exertion related with tremor

In ET, gender influences the topographic distribution of tremor. Female gender increases the likelihood of being (additionally to the hand tremor) affected from impairing head and/or voice tremor in ET. The association of hand tremor severity with midline tremor is stronger for males than for females.

Natural course of ERM

Among young, physically active patients, the incidence of ERM is low, as is the risk of recurrence. Furthermore, ERM is associated with lower complication rates compared with other causes of rhabdomyolysis, probably because participants do not have other associated diseases or do not take potentially myotoxic treatments. This was shown in a retrospective case series, including population-based and cohort-based analyses in a cohort of 177 patient with rhabdomyolysis at a US army medical centre. There were 44 cases of ERM from a population of 198 399 total military trainees over the study period, or 22.2 cases per 100 000 per year. This was one-third of all cases of rhabdomyolysis in this period; other causes included trauma, use of toxins, infection and heat illness. During the follow-up period (ranging from 20 to 60 months, with a mean of 31.2 months) with return to prior levels of physical activity, there was one recurrence of rhabdomyolysis (at 1-month, following exertion). Hence, long-term risk of recurrence is low. Other reports, including that concerning the football team cited above, also show that the prognosis of ERM without systemic complications is very good. In general, in the young, healthy population performing sports at an intensity that may cause rhabdomyolysis, complication rate is expected to be low.

Hypomagnesemia

Hypomagnesemia is characterized by a serum magnesium concentration below 0.62 mmol/L and is typically more common than hypermagnesemia. The condition typically arises from diminished magnesium absorption or heightened loss via the kidneys or diarrhea. Changes in thyroid hormone activity and the use of specific medications such as pentamidine, diuretics, and alcohol can also contribute to the development of hypomagnesemia. Table 6 shows the etiology of hypomagnesemia. Notably, hypomagnesemia can disrupt the impact of PTH and lead to hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. The manifestations of hypomagnesemia include muscle tremors, tetany, changes in mental state, ocular nystagmus, and cardiac arrhythmias like torsades de pointes. Additional symptoms may encompass seizures, dysphagia, vertigo, and ataxia. A very useful tool to aid in the differential diagnosis of hypomagnesemia is a calculation of the fraction excretion of magnesium (FEMg). The formula for FEMg is (urine Mg x serum creatinine)/(serum Mg x urine creatinine) × 100. While values of < 2% indicate extrarenal losses, FEMg of > 2% points to the renal cause of Mg wasting. The interpretation of magnesium levels and corresponding clinical symptoms is demonstrated in Table 7. The management approach for hypomagnesemia depends on the severity and the patient's clinical condition. Mild cases can be treated with oral replacement therapy, starting with doses of 400–800 mg of elemental magnesium daily, divided into multiple doses to reduce adverse effects and improve tolerance. However, in instances of severe or symptomatic hypomagnesemia, or if malabsorption is suspected as the underlying cause, parenteral therapy or intravenous magnesium replacement can be indicated. Intravenous administration of magnesium sulfate is typically employed with a dosage range of 25–50 mg/kg/dose (max. 2 g) every 4–6 h (or every 8 h in neonates) over a 2–4 h period, ensuring that the rate does not exceed 125 mg/kg/hr. Notably, 10 mL of 10% magnesium sulfate solution contains 1 g of magnesium sulfate and 98.6 mg of elemental magnesium equivalent to 4.06 mmol. In patients with torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest, 50 mg/kg/dose (max. 2 g/dose) of IV push magnesium sulfate should be given over 10 min. The maximum concentration of elementary magnesium should not exceed 60 mg/ml for peripheral line administration and 200 mg/ml overall. Dosing should be reduced in children with renal impairment to avoid magnesium accumulation. Additionally, calcium supplementation is often necessary because individuals with hypomagnesemia often exhibit hypocalcemia as well.

### Characterization of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis: a survey of genetically diagnosed individuals [^1b901d56]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

HyperPP has three clinically distinct manifestations: (1) without myotonia, (2) with clinical or electromyographic (EMG) myotonia, or (3) with paramyotonia congenita (PMC). In all three forms, the course of the paralytic attacks is the same. Electrical myotonia can be demonstrated on EMG in 50–75% of patients with hyperPP, while less than 20% manifest clinically. In those with myotonia, i.e. a tonic spasm of muscle, the myotonia is often mild and can be provoked with percussion or activity in the face, tongue, forearms, and thenar eminence. The myotonia eases with repetitive activity. From birth onwards, those with PMC experience muscle stiffness that increases with continued activity (paramyotonia) and is cold-induced. Paralytic attacks can occur at any time, though often occur spontaneously in the morning prior to breakfast, last up to an hour, and unpredictably subside. Attacks may be provoked or worsened by anesthesia, rest after exercise, potassium loading, cold environments, hunger, emotional stress, glucocorticoids, or pregnancy. During attacks, individuals may be hyperkalemic or normokalemic. The concomitant rise in serum potassium levels can range from upper normal values to those in the cardiotoxic spectrum. After an attack, serum potassium levels may be transiently low due to the elimination of potassium from the kidneys and the reuptake of potassium by muscle. Usually, individuals do not experience cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory insufficiency during attacks. After an attack, individuals may feel pain for up to several days in the involved muscle groups. Between attacks, affected individuals have normal serum potassium levels, normal sensation and muscle stretch reflexes, and normal muscle strength, although they may experience minor myotonia that does not hinder voluntary movement. "Lid lag" secondary to eyelid myotonia may be the only clinical sign present between attacks.

### Treatment recommendations… [^088951b7]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment recommendations Administer tetanus immune globulin Dose Medical experts recommend a single, 500 international unit dose of TIG for tetanus treatment. While the optimal therapeutic dose is uncertain, this dose appears as effective as higher doses. It also causes less discomfort. TIG helps remove unbound tetanus toxin from the body. It can't affect toxin already bound to nerve endings. Administration Administer TIG preparations intramuscularly. TIG preparations available in the United States aren't licensed or formulated for intrathecal or intravenous use. Some medical experts recommend infiltration of part of the dose locally around the wound, although its efficacy hasn't been proven. Alternative treatment If TIG isn't available, healthcare providers can use immune globulin intravenous. Note, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't approved IGIV for this use.

In addition, anti-tetanus antibody content varies by lot. Control muscle spasms Healthcare providers should use sedation and muscle relaxant drugs as indicated to control muscle spasms. Patients may require agents to control autonomic nervous system instability. Maintain an airway Healthcare providers should monitor for airway patency because associated muscle spasms can cause airway loss. Depending on disease severity, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy and mechanically assisted respiration may be lifesaving. Manage wounds and treat infections Clean all wounds. Remove or debride necrotic tissue. Remove any foreign material. Observe wounds for signs of infection. Promptly treat infected wounds. Provide antibiotic therapy Appropriate antibiotic therapy is recommended to reduce the number of tetanus bacteria. Promoting long-term wellness after treatment Vaccinate during recovery Tetanus disease doesn't result in tetanus immunity.

Vaccination, if indicated, is recommended as soon as the patient's condition has stabilized. Healthcare providers should begin or continue active immunization with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.

### Atypical periodic paralysis and myalgia: a novelphenotype [^3f9a3211]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have previously reported a single patient with recessive RYR1 -related MmD with additional episodic muscle weakness/paralysis. Here, we have described 3 additional cases (summarized in the table). One was compound heterozygous for RYR1 nonsense and missense mutations and presented with later development of episodic symptoms in the context of a congenital myopathy, similar to our original patient reported by Zhou et al.who showed a comparable genotype and phenotype. The other 2 patients had an episodic phenotype without myopathy and were either heterozygous for or compound heterozygous for RYR1 missense mutations (putatively) implicated in the MH trait, suggesting tentative genotype-phenotype correlations. In all cases (including our original case), the onset of episodic muscle paralysis was from early adulthood onward, which is later than the onset typically seen in primary PP. Although there were variable triggers, including exertion or rest after exertion, which is a typical trigger for PP, there was no consistent relationship to food or temperature across all the cases. Myalgia or cramp was a universal feature, indicating overlap with the spectrum of RYR1 -related exertional myalgia/rhabdomyolysis, and this, together with the later age at onset, may be a phenotypic clue for future cases.

The first clinical indicator is 'rhabdomyolysis in case of accustomed exercise': if the rhabdomyolysis occurs in a trained athlete who has worked out at a level of intensity that he is used to (in the absence of other provoking factors), the exercise is not 'unaccustomed'. The absence of team-related cases of ERM also points to the exercise that was not unaccustomed to the level of physical fitness. In these cases, there is a greater likelihood of finding an underlying genetic cause. A genetic cause is also more likely when different members of the same family suffer a rhabdomyolysis event simultaneously, for example, during the same intermittent viral illness or during the same sports event, or when onset is in childhood. Finally, an underlying genetic condition should be suspected in patients in whom exercise is the only underlying cause, or in whom other exogenous causes (drugs, medication (including anaesthesia), infection) seem insufficient to explain the severity of the rhabdomyolysis episode.

In order to improve the recognition of patients with an increased risk, we propose the use of the acronym ' RHABDO ': screening for a genetic cause should be considered if any of the criteria below are present (table 5).

### Rhabdomyolysis in an HIV cohort: epidemiology, causes and outcomes [^328142b3]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Data collection and classification of causes

Data extraction occurred through extensive review of the inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records of the eligible patients. Several demographic characteristics were extracted including age, sex, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) serostatus, smoking history, alcohol use, as well as cocaine and heroin use. The latter three were categorized as current, remote or none. Remote status refers to > 1 month before the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis. Several laboratory parameters were abstracted including peak CK level, CD4 cell count and HIV-1 viral load. If the latter two were not up to date during the acute episode, the closest values within 3 months were used. We defined a suppressed viral load as < 400 copies/ml.

Potential etiologies for rhabdomyolysis in each participant were identified. We divided the causes into 14 categories including compression injury, infection, seizure, alcohol, cocaine, medications, cardiopulmonary arrest, surgery, hypokalemia, HIV-associated myositis, physical exertion, ischemic limb, hypothyroidism, unclear and miscellaneous. Compression injuries encompassed those from immobilization, compartment syndrome or direct trauma. Urine toxicology screens during the episode were reviewed on each patient and cocaine was considered a contributing etiology if the toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. Medications were labeled as an etiology if these medications were considered as such by the treating clinicians and if CK levels normalized with discontinuation of the medication (s). Cardiopulmonary arrest was considered an etiology when chest compressions or defibrillation were performed during resuscitation. Surgery was considered an etiology when CK elevation occurred exclusively in the context of prolonged surgery or surgery on a limb in the absence of other identifiable factors. Hypokalemia was considered a contributing etiology if it was reported as an etiology in the medical records, and the potassium level was < 2.8 meq/L. Electromyography reports were reviewed when available. The diagnosis of HIV-associated inflammatory myopathy was based on reported diagnosis, available electromyography or biopsy reports. Miscellaneous causes included heat stroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcemia, hypothermia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, unknown drug overdose, muscle injection, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, muscle spasms, myoclonic jerks, leaky muscle in African American, polyarticular gout and sickle cell crisis. The etiology was labeled as unclear when rhabdomyolysis was not characterized in the medical record and no etiologies were identified by review of the historical documents, laboratory values and follow-up visits. For the eight patients who had recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis, only the first episode was included in the analysis.

### Multifidus dysfunction and restorative neurostimulation: a scoping review [^b7c23c9b]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

By way of illustration, consider a clinical scenario with a nonspecific event that triggers a noxious insult to spinal joint mechanoreceptors and/or paraspinal muscle spindles that can result in joint or muscle overload. In turn, this can lead to an influx of aberrant mechanoreceptive input towards the spinal cord interneurons. Automatically within the spinal pathway, a spinally-induced AMI reflex may occur to subconsciously protect the spinal joint by limiting segmental spinal motion. This limitation in movement further decreases mechanoreceptive discharge to surrounding muscles leading to reflexive tonic contraction and potentially a painful cycle of muscle spasm and muscle overload. Usually, such acute events are self-limiting, and the deleterious effects may be lessened with maintenance of physical activity, despite acute pain. However, if altered sensorimotor feedback persist beyond normal healing time, it may lead to loss of neuromuscular control. Over time if uncorrected, this may lead to persistent multifidus inhibition/dysfunction and the inability to maintain spinal stiffness in the neutral zone, resulting in an augmented environment for functional lumbar instability. Consequently, this may express symptomatologically as nonspecific LBP.

### Chapter 21: tetanus | Pink book… [^d42d2f7b]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance This chapter discusses pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology, vaccination, and surveillance of tetanus. Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an exotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. It is characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive spasms of skeletal muscles. The muscle stiffness usually begins in the jaw and neck and then becomes generalized. Pathogenesis Tetanus Pathogenesis
- Enters body through wound
- Spores germinate in anaerobic conditions
- Toxin binds in central nervous system
- Interferes with neurotransmitter release to block inhibitor impulses
- Leads to unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. The typical clinical manifestations of tetanus are caused when tetanus toxin interferes with the release of neurotransmitters, blocking inhibitor impulses. This leads to unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Seizures may occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be affected.

On the basis of clinical findings, three different forms of tetanus have been described. The most common type is generalized tetanus. The disease usually presents with a descending pattern. The first sign is trismus, or lockjaw, followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of abdominal muscles. Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes. Spasms continue for 3 to 4 weeks. Complete recovery may take months. Localized tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease in which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury. These contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Localized tetanus may precede the onset of generalized tetanus but is generally milder.

Cephalic tetanus is a rare form of the disease, occasionally occurring with otitis media in which. Tetanus Complications
- Laryngospasm
- Fractures
- Hypertension and/or abnormal heart rhythm
- Nosocomial infections
- Pulmonary embolism
- Aspiration pneumonia
- Death Laryngospasm or spasm of the muscles of respiration leads to interference with breathing. Fractures of the spine or long bones may result from sustained contractions and convulsions. Hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system may lead to hypertension or an abnormal heart rhythm.

### A patient with speechlessness and rhabdomyolysis: a rare presentation of severe hypocalcaemia [^a6ead57b]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Calcium plays an essential role in maintaining a normal function of muscles and nerves. For instance, hypercalcaemia can lead to muscle weakness, whereas hypocalcaemia leads to neuromuscular hyperexcitability, often referred to as tetany. However, even in severe hypocalcaemia, tetany can be absent or not the presenting symptom, as was seen in our patient, leading to unrecognised hypocalcaemia and often a delay in treatment. Untreated, hypocalcaemia can cause a prolonged QT interval leading to dysrhythmias and even cardiac arrest.

The presenting symptoms of our patient were speechlessness, a hoarse voice and vomiting, especially after drinking cold water, which are rare first presentations of hypocalcaemia. Therefore, we aim to increase the knowledge of physicians about the diverse presentation of hypocalcaemia, leading to a better understanding and quicker recognition of this potential deadly metabolic disorder.

### Effects of lower limb resistance exercise on muscle strength, physical fitness, and metabolism in pre-frail elderly patients: a randomized controlled trial [^33820175]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Standing on tiptoes was performed to enhance the strength of calves and ankles and make walking more stable. The participants were asked to stand behind a secure chair, hold the chair back to maintain balance, and spread their feet to the shoulders' width. They were then asked to inhale and slowly exhale and to slowly stand on tiptoes as high as possible. The posture was maintained for 1 s, after which the participants were asked to slowly inhale and slowly put down the leg. Each leg was exercised for 10–15 times. The participants were trained three times every week (on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays); there were three groups in each training, and each group included the whole five movements. Each training lasted for 30 min. The intervention lasted 12 weeks. The number of sets and repetitions in training volume and intensity were identical. The nurses were asked to demonstrate the exercises, explain the significant points of the movements, help correct mistakes, and ensure the participants' safety. The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale was used to evaluate exercise intensity. The participants were asked to maintain the self-perceived exertion degree at 11–13 points, which meant that the exercise was a little intense.

The exercise was suspended for participants with the following conditions: unstable blood pressure or blood glucose, dizziness, shortness of breath, pain or constriction in the chest, palpitation, thrombosis, muscle pain, unhealed wound, joint swelling, and retinal hemorrhage or detachment. The exercise was immediately stopped if the patients reported pain or constriction in the chest/neck/shoulder or arms, dizziness or nausea, or muscle spasm during the exercise.

### Association between oral intake magnesium and sarcopenia: a cross-sectional study [^f0ac3540]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcopenia, one of the primary diseases of the elderly population, is a common skeletal muscle disorder that involves the progressive loss of skeletal muscle function and mass. To date, the most widely cited diagnostic criteria is that proposed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and updated as EWGSOP2 in 2019. According to EWGSOP2, muscle strength, muscle quantity and physical performance were measured to evaluate sarcopenia. Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function causes the risk of falls, fractures, physical disability, use of hospital services, poor quality of life, and death. The patients with sarcopenia increase the risk for hospitalization and the cost of care during hospitalization. In 2000, there was approximately $18.5 billion ($10.8 billion in men, $7.7 billion in women) health-care cost in the America due to sarcopenia. Malnutrition plays a key role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. There was a growing evidence base linking nutrition with greater muscle strength and better physical performance outcomes in patient with sarcopenia. However, these articles paid more attention on protein, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, and antioxidant nutrients. Best to our knowledge, no previous data had discussed oral intake electrolyte and sarcopenia.

Magnesium is the second most intracellular cation after potassium in human. Several metabolic pathways and fundamental cellular activities including peptide and DNA synthesis, signal transduction, blood glucose control, stimulus-contraction coupling, stimulus-secretion coupling, and ion channel translocation related to magnesium. Total body magnesium content is mainly located in bone and soft tissue. The recommended daily intake of magnesium is 320 and 420 mg for adult women and men, respectively. Absorption mainly (80–90%) occurs in the jejunum and colon through passive and active transport. Reabsorption of magnesium mainly occurred in the thin ascending limb of Henle (70%) and partially occurred in the proximal tubule and distal collecting tubule. Hypomagnesemia related to several clinical manifestations including neuromuscular and cardiovascular manifestations. Muscle spasms, muscle cramps, tremors, atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias were the specific symptoms of hypomagnesemia. Further, electrolyte and hormone imbalanced including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypoparathyroidism were also associated with hypomagnesemia.

According to a previous study, magnesium deficiency might increase reactive oxygen species and lipid and protein damage and associate with damage of muscle. The purpose of our study was to demonstrate the relation between oral intake magnesium and sarcopenia by EWGSOP2 definition.

### Efficacy and safety of guaifenesin for upper back, neck, and shoulder pain: a phase II proof-of-concept, multicenter, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, parallel-group study [^41fe1dd2]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Musculoskeletal disorders of the upper back, shoulders, and neck are common in many occupations that require physical exertion, repetitive movements, static muscle contraction, prolonged sitting before a computer, or maintaining fixed or extreme postures.–In some instances, muscle fatigue subsequent to overwork or to poor posture results in tension or overactivation of the muscles of the neck. Work-related neck, shoulder, and upper back musculoskeletal disorders include tension neck syndrome, rotator cuff syndrome, upper back pain, and shoulder tendonitis or tenosynovitis.–These conditions may cause deterioration of joints, muscles, and soft tissue, persistent pain in related body areas, and disability.

Workplace interventions (eg, resistance training, stretching exercise programs) may help to prevent and manage mus-culoskeletal disorders. In addition, pharmacologic options, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are used to manage musculoskeletal pain, and muscle relaxants may be used to manage muscle pain, stiffness, and spasm.–Although there are many skeletal muscle relaxants, systemically active products are generally available with prescription and are associated with well-documented adverse effects such as somnolence, dizziness, weakness, and dry mouth.

Guaifenesin, an over-the-counter (OTC) expectorant, has exhibited a muscle relaxant effect in preclinical studies and in patients with cerebral palsy when used in doses higher than those currently available for OTC use. In other preclinical investigations, guaifenesin has shown modest but significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Little is known about the potential mechanism by which guaifenesin produces these effects, but a chemically similar muscle relaxant, mephenesin, has been found to be an antagonist of the excitatory amino acids N -methyl — aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). Whether a true muscle relaxant effect occurs at OTC doses of guaifenesin has not been studied previously. The primary objective of this proof-of-principle study was to explore the efficacy and safety of 2 OTC dose strengths of guaifenesin compared with matched placebos for symptom relief in subjects with acute upper back, neck, or shoulder muscle spasm and pain.

### Metabolic myopathies: clinical features and diagnostic approach [^01abac17]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The rheumatologist is frequently called on to evaluate patients with complaints of myalgia, muscle cramps, and fatigue. The evaluation of these patients presents a diagnostic challenge given the nonspecific and intermittent nature of their complaints, often leading to inappropriate diagnostic testing. When these symptoms are associated with physical exertion, a metabolic myopathy should be suspected Although inflammatory myopathies may present with similar features, such a pattern should prompt a thorough evaluation for an underlying metabolic myopathy. This review discusses the most common causes of metabolic myopathies and reviews the current diagnostic options available to the clinician.

Table 4
Assessment of risk of acute renal failure and other complications

In general, serial physical and laboratory examinations are necessary to manage patients with ERM appropriately. In the acute phase, treatment should be aimed at preserving renal function and restoring metabolic derangements. Early and adequate volume replacement with isotonic sodium chloride solution 0.9% (no potassium-containing or lactate-containing solutions) may directly prevent renal injury by aiding clearance of toxic substances and increasing renal perfusion pressure. Volume expansion increases renal blood flow and, consequently, glomerular filtration and urination. A common goal of treatment is to achieve a urine output of 300 mL/hour. This may require infusion of intravenous fluids by 1–2 L/hour until urine output is stable. Intravenous fluid should preferably be continued until serum CK activity in plasma has declined to 1000 IU/L or below. In patients with little or no urine output despite aggressive hydration, profound acidosis or severe hyperkalaemia, consider peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis and consult a nephrologist. Aggressive hydration may not be appropriate in patients with other comorbidities such as heart failure. Furthermore, if kidney injury is already established, overly aggressive hydration in a patient with already established renal failure may lead to volume overload and pulmonary oedema.

Mannitol leads to an increase in blood flow and glomerular filtration, which reduces the obstruction by myoglobin casts. It must only be given after volume replacement and must be avoided in patients with oliguria. It is not routinely recommended, but may be administered if the target urine output cannot be achieved by other means. Loop diuretics have also been investigated, but published data are too limited to support recommending them routinely. Although not proven by randomised control trials, some experts recommend the addition of bicarbonate. Alkalisation of the urine (target pH 6.5) promotes myoglobulin washout and corrects the metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. A recent systematic review has shown that sodium bicarbonate should only be administered to patients with systemic acidosis.

Monitoring for and treating rhabdomyolysis-related electrolyte abnormalities is an important part of managing patients with ERM. Hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and hyperuricaemia are common in patients with rhabdomyolysis, and should be treated with standard therapy. Although hypocalcaemia is common in early rhabdomyolysis, hypercalcaemia can occur later. Calcium supplementation should only be prescribed for patients with symptomatic hypocalcaemia or severe hyperkalaemia. More research is needed to determine whether allopurinol may be useful for preventing ERM and acute renal damage.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^7ea3bdbb]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Investigating exertional rhabdomyolysis

In general, patients with a clear history of a preceding heat-related illness do not require further investigations; this group is statistically the largest. Further investigations should be considered in patients with no history of heat exposure, or who have recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis. Patients may not have sought medical attention for previous milder episodes; ask about previous episodes of postexertional muscle pain, weakness or dark urine. Almost all patients with metabolic myopathies will have had symptoms since teenage years. Other features requiring further investigation include persistently raised serum CK after 8 weeks, family history of rhabdomyolysis (including after exercise, fasting or illness), exertional muscle cramps or exercise intolerance. The acronym (retronym?) RHABDO has been suggested as an aide-mémoire (box 2).

Box 2
Features suggesting need for further investigation

R — Recurrent episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis

H — HyperCKaemia more than 8 weeks after event

A — Accustomed to exercise

B — Blood creatine kinase (CK) concentration above 50× upper limit of normal

D — Drug ingestion insufficient to explain exertional rhabdomyolysis

O — Other family members affected or Other exertional symptoms

Clinicians should take a general myopathy history, including exercise intolerance, exertional rhabdomyolysis tempo (eg, duration between exercise and onset) and family history. Family history is sometimes forgotten: case 2 had little contact with his sister but recalled she had been diagnosed with something which stopped her exercising; renewed contact revealed her McArdle's disease. Examination for myopathic weakness and electromyography should be delayed until the patient has fully recovered. Further investigations for underlying causes, including exercise testing, muscle biopsy and muscle MRI, depend on the clinical phenotype but are often non-diagnostic until the exertional rhabdomyolysis has resolved. Figure 1 summarises the approach to a new presentation of exertional rhabdomyolysis.
