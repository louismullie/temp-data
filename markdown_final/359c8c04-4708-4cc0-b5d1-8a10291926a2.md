## Question

What is the recommended surveillance interval for patients with adenomatous polyps?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended colonoscopy surveillance intervals for patients with adenomatous polyps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching risk stratification framework and the prerequisite of a high-quality baseline colonoscopy. Then, I should verify the specific intervals for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk adenomas, including special scenarios like piecemeal resection and very high adenoma counts. Next, I will review how surveillance intervals are modified after the first surveillance colonoscopy. After that, I should consider serrated polyps and hyperplastic polyps. Finally, I will double-check implementation caveats, including quality markers, documentation, and when to consider genetic evaluation, and close with a concise summary table to anchor the recommendations [^116m1nai] [^114Z3N1h].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: surveillance intervals depend on baseline polyp features and the quality of the index colonoscopy, including complete cecal intubation, adequate preparation to visualize lesions greater than 5 mm, and confident complete polypectomy; if quality is suboptimal, I need to ensure a repeat high-quality examination before assigning a surveillance interval, because poor prep or incomplete resection can confound risk and lead to interval cancers [^116m1nai] [^114P53v2] [^1165WhdF].

> Now, for low-risk adenomas, I should verify the updated interval. For 1–2 tubular adenomas less than 10 mm with low-grade dysplasia, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommends 7–10 years, reflecting that many such patients have risk similar to average-risk individuals; initially I thought "5–10 years", but wait, let me verify — yes, the 2020 update extended the lower bound to 7 years, and some expert guidance even supports considering 10 years for diminutive lesions, so 7–10 years is correct here [^1149dRXz] [^114k8C4D] [^116i4a5A].

> For intermediate-risk findings, I need to check the nuance. With 3–4 tubular adenomas all less than 10 mm, the interval is 3–5 years, acknowledging very low-quality evidence; emerging data suggest many such patients have low metachronous risk, so the weaker recommendation allows clinician judgment and shared decision-making, especially when all polyps are diminutive and completely removed at a high-quality exam [^116m1nai] [^116NUoC2].

> For high-risk adenomas, I should confirm the 3-year interval. Patients with any adenoma 10 mm or larger, or with villous or tubulovillous histology, or with high-grade dysplasia, or with 5–10 adenomas of any size less than 10 mm, should have repeat colonoscopy in 3 years; this is supported by strong evidence that advanced features at baseline predict higher rates of metachronous advanced neoplasia on follow-up, justifying close surveillance [^116m1nai] [^111BhFZa].

> But wait, what if there are more than 10 adenomas at a single examination? I should double-check that interval. The US Multi-Society Task Force recommends a 1-year repeat colonoscopy for more than 10 adenomas, given concern for missed lesions and possible polyposis syndromes; after piecemeal resection of large sessile lesions 20 mm or larger, a short-interval repeat at about 6 months is advised to assess completeness and manage recurrence risk [^111qBB44] [^116m1nai].

> Next, I should review how surveillance changes after the first post-polypectomy colonoscopy. If baseline was low-risk and the first surveillance is normal, extending to 10 years is reasonable; if baseline was high-risk and the first surveillance is normal, 5 years is typical; if advanced neoplasia is found on surveillance, the clock resets to 3 years; I need to ensure I'm aligning these second-surveillance intervals with the task force tables, which stratify by both baseline and first surveillance findings [^116sBfSW] [^113ByfEp].

> I will now examine serrated polyps, because they influence surveillance differently. For sessile serrated polyps less than 10 mm without dysplasia, many guidelines align with a 3–5 year interval, whereas for sessile serrated polyps 10 mm or larger or with dysplasia, or traditional serrated adenomas, a 3-year interval is recommended; hold on, I should verify the ESGE stance — ESGE 2020 suggests that 1–4 small adenomas or small serrated polyps without dysplasia may not require surveillance and can return to screening at 10 years, which is more conservative than US guidance, so I need to flag this as a guideline difference requiring local policy alignment and shared decision-making [^116ukwRt].

> Hyperplastic polyps deserve a brief check. If the only findings are small, distal hyperplastic polyps, the recommended interval is 10 years, equivalent to a normal colonoscopy in average-risk individuals; if there are numerous or large hyperplastic polyps, or if they are proximal, I should reconsider for a serrated pathway risk and apply serrated polyp rules accordingly [^1172Sojd] [^11199N2F].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation caveats. Endoscopists frequently recommend intervals shorter than guidelines, especially for low-risk adenomas, but studies show no outcome benefit from shortening 7–10 year intervals to 3 years in that group; adherence to guidelines is suboptimal globally, so I need to ensure high-quality prep, adequate withdrawal time, documented adenoma detection rate, and clear communication of the rationale for the interval to both patients and referring clinicians to reduce overuse and interval cancers [^113Ta8G8] [^1176EZrJ].

> I need to ensure we address special populations. These surveillance schemas apply to average-risk adults; they do not apply to hereditary syndromes such as Lynch or familial adenomatous polyposis, where syndrome-specific protocols apply, and they do not apply to post-cancer resection surveillance, which follows a different timeline; if a patient has more than 10 cumulative adenomas or more than 10 at a single exam, I should consider genetic counseling for polyposis syndromes [^116m1nai] [^114tt87V].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency. Risk stratify by number, size, and histology; confirm high-quality baseline colonoscopy with complete polypectomy; assign 7–10 years for 1–2 small tubular adenomas, 3–5 years for 3–4 small adenomas, and 3 years for advanced adenomas or 5–10 adenomas; escalate to 1 year if more than 10 adenomas or after piecemeal resection of large sessile lesions; then modify subsequent intervals based on first surveillance findings, with a bias toward lengthening if no neoplasia is found and maintaining 3-year intervals if advanced neoplasia persists [^116m1nai] [^116sBfSW].

> Finally, to synthesize, I should double-check the key intervals and evidence strength. Low-risk 1–2 tubular adenomas less than 10 mm: 7–10 years; intermediate-risk 3–4 tubular adenomas less than 10 mm: 3–5 years; high-risk features or 5–10 adenomas: 3 years; more than 10 adenomas: 1 year; piecemeal resection of polyps 20 mm or larger: about 6 months; normal colonoscopy or only small distal hyperplastic polyps: 10 years; all contingent on a high-quality baseline exam and complete polypectomy, with second-surveillance adjustments thereafter [^116m1nai] [^114paM38] [^111qBB44] [^1174BWA3].

Surveillance intervals after adenomatous polypectomy are **risk-stratified** by the number, size, and histology of polyps, as well as the quality of the baseline colonoscopy [^116m1nai]. For **low-risk adenomas** (1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm with low-grade dysplasia), repeat colonoscopy in 7–10 years is recommended [^1149dRXz] [^114k8C4D]. For **high-risk adenomas** (≥ 10 mm, villous or high-grade dysplasia, or ≥ 3 adenomas), repeat in 3 years [^114Yfz8v] [^111BhFZa]. If > 10 adenomas are found, repeat in 1 year and consider genetic testing [^111qBB44]. After piecemeal resection of large polyps (≥ 20 mm), repeat in 6 months [^116m1nai]. These intervals assume high-quality baseline colonoscopy with complete polypectomy; shorter intervals are advised if quality is uncertain or polyps are incompletely removed [^114P53v2].

## Risk stratification of adenomatous polyps

Adenomatous polyps are classified by **number, size, histology, and dysplasia grade**, which guide surveillance intervals:

| **Risk category** | **Polyp characteristics** |
|-|-|
| Low-risk | 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm with low-grade dysplasia [^112ntcvG] |
| Intermediate-risk | 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm with low-grade dysplasia [^116ooFxx] |
| High-risk | - ≥ 1 adenoma ≥ 10 mm <br/> - villous or tubulovillous histology <br/> - high-grade dysplasia <br/> - ≥ 5 adenomas [^116m1nai] |
| Very high-risk | > 10 adenomas on a single examination [^111qBB44] |

---

## Recommended surveillance intervals

Based on the **US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (USMSTF)** and the **American College of Gastroenterology (ACG)** guidelines, the following surveillance intervals are recommended:

| **Risk category** | **Recommended surveillance interval** |
|-|-|
| Low-risk (1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm) | 7–10 years [^1149dRXz] [^114k8C4D] |
| Intermediate-risk (3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm) | 3–5 years [^114paM38] |
| High-risk (≥ 10 mm, villous, high-grade dysplasia, or ≥ 5 adenomas) | 3 years [^114Yfz8v] [^111BhFZa] |
| Very high-risk (> 10 adenomas) | 1 year and consider genetic testing [^116m1nai] |
| Piecemeal resection of large polyps (≥ 20 mm) | 6 months [^116m1nai] |

---

## Factors influencing surveillance intervals

Several factors may **influence surveillance intervals**:

- **Quality of baseline colonoscopy**: High-quality colonoscopy with complete polypectomy and adequate bowel preparation is essential. If quality is uncertain, shorter intervals may be recommended [^114P53v2] [^1165WhdF].
- **Patient age and comorbidities**: Older patients or those with significant comorbidities may have individualized intervals based on life expectancy and risk-benefit considerations [^115P1YUc].
- **Family history**: Patients with a family history of colorectal cancer may require shorter intervals based on individualized risk assessment [^1147g7Ng].

---

## Evidence supporting surveillance intervals

Evidence supporting these intervals includes **prospective studies and meta-analyses** demonstrating that patients with advanced adenomas (≥ 10 mm, villous histology, or high-grade dysplasia) have a significantly higher risk of developing metachronous advanced neoplasia, justifying a 3-year surveillance interval [^11589j3x] [^111qkzQy]. In contrast, patients with low-risk adenomas (1–2 small tubular adenomas) have a low risk of advanced neoplasia, supporting longer surveillance intervals (7–10 years) [^1149dRXz] [^114k8C4D].

---

## Consequences of non-adherence to guidelines

Non-adherence to recommended surveillance intervals can lead to **increased risk of interval colorectal cancer**, missed detection of advanced neoplasia, and unnecessary colonoscopies, causing increased healthcare costs and patient anxiety [^11558t54] [^1134imGs].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Low-risk adenomas**: 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm — repeat colonoscopy in 7–10 years [^1149dRXz].
- **Intermediate-risk adenomas**: 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm — repeat colonoscopy in 3–5 years [^114paM38].
- **High-risk adenomas**: ≥ 10 mm, villous histology, high-grade dysplasia, or ≥ 5 adenomas — repeat colonoscopy in 3 years [^116m1nai].
- **Very high-risk adenomas**: > 10 adenomas — repeat colonoscopy in 1 year and consider genetic testing [^116m1nai].
- **Piecemeal resection**: ≥ 20 mm polyps — repeat colonoscopy in 6 months [^116m1nai].

---

Surveillance intervals after adenomatous polypectomy are **risk-stratified** based on polyp number, size, histology, and dysplasia grade, with longer intervals for low-risk and shorter intervals for high-risk lesions. Adherence to these guidelines is essential to balance the risks and benefits of surveillance colonoscopy.

US Multi-Society Task Force — risk stratification and surveillance intervals after polypectomy note that patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm are at lower than average risk for incident and fatal colorectal cancer (CRC) and can undergo colonoscopy at longer intervals, while individuals with advanced neoplasia remain at greater than population risk. Data are emerging to support less frequent surveillance among individuals with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, and 2 studies suggest that exposure to surveillance colonoscopy after baseline polypectomy may reduce risk for incident CRC among high-risk patients. Recommendations are unchanged for advanced adenoma, including those with adenoma ≥ 10 mm, with evidence to support close surveillance in 3 years strengthened. One year, rather than a more general recommendation for < 3-year follow-up colonoscopy for individuals with > 10 adenomas at a single examination, has been recommended to simplify follow-up, although the evidence base has not been markedly strengthened; emerging evidence suggests that individuals with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm are at low risk for metachronous neoplasia.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy — conclusions and interval guidance note that for patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm, a 7- to 10-year, rather than a 5- to 10-year follow-up recommendation is described, and patients, primary care physicians, and colonoscopists will need to engage in shared decision making regarding whether to lengthen the follow-up interval. The conclusions state that CRC incidence and mortality are decreasing secondary to improvements in risk factor exposure, screening, treatment, and perhaps exposure to surveillance among patients with polyps, and that some patients with polyps appear to have persistently increased risk for CRC and may have increased risk for advanced neoplasia on follow-up. Evidence to support best practices for surveillance colonoscopy has strengthened and has helped to support close follow-up for some groups, as well as less intensive follow-up for others, and surveillance colonoscopy to attempt to reduce CRC risk is clinically rational and recommended.

US Multi-Society Task Force update — post-polypectomy surveillance risk stratification states that evidence after normal colonoscopy has strengthened the recommendation to defer repeat screening for at least 10 years and that polyp features guide intervals. Patients with 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm are at lower-than-average risk for incident and fatal CRC and can undergo colonoscopy at longer intervals, whereas individuals with advanced neoplasia remain at greater than population CRC risk; emerging data support less frequent surveillance among those with 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm. A combination of serrated lesions and conventional adenomas appears to confer higher risk for subsequent advanced neoplasia, and 2 studies suggest surveillance colonoscopy after baseline polypectomy may reduce incident CRC among high-risk patients, although more data are needed to prove incremental benefits for incidence and mortality reduction.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American cancer society [^112v1FMQ]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Adenomatous polyps are the most common neoplastic findings discovered in people who undergo colorectal screening or who have a diagnostic work-up for symptoms. It was common practice in the 1970s for these patients to have annual follow-up surveillance examinations to detect additional new adenomas and missed synchronous adenomas. As a result of the National Polyp Study report in 1993, which showed clearly in a randomized design that the first postpolypectomy examination could be deferred for 3 years, guidelines published by a gastrointestinal consortium in 1997 recommended that the first follow-up surveillance take place 3 years after polypectomy for most patients. In 2003 these guidelines were updated and colonoscopy was recommended as the only follow-up examination, stratification at baseline into low risk and higher risk for subsequent adenomas was suggested. The 1997 and 2003 guidelines dealt with both screening and surveillance. However, it has become increasingly clear that postpolypectomy surveillance is now a large part of endoscopic practice, draining resources from screening and diagnosis. In addition, surveys have shown that a large proportion of endoscopists are conducting surveillance examinations at shorter intervals than recommended in the guidelines. In the present report, a careful analytic approach was designed to address all evidence available in the literature to delineate predictors of advanced pathology, both cancer and advanced adenomas, so that patients can be stratified more definitely at their baseline colonoscopy into those at lower risk or increased risk for a subsequent advanced neoplasia. People at increased risk have either 3 or more adenomas, high-grade dysplasia, villous features, or an adenoma 1 cm or larger in size. It is recommended that they have a 3-year follow-up colonoscopy. People at lower risk who have 1 or 2 small (< 1 cm) tubular adenomas with no high-grade dysplasia can have a follow-up evaluation in 5–10 years, whereas people with hyperplastic polyps only should have a 10-year follow-up evaluation, as for average-risk people. There have been recent studies that have reported a significant number of missed cancers by colonoscopy. However, high-quality baseline colonoscopy with excellent patient preparation and adequate withdrawal time should minimize this and reduce clinicians concerns. These guidelines were developed jointly by the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer and the American Cancer Society to provide a broader consensus and thereby increase the use of the recommendations by endoscopists. The adoption of these guidelines nationally can have a dramatic impact on shifting available resources from intensive surveillance to screening. It has been shown that the first screening colonoscopy and polypectomy produces the greatest effects on reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with adenomatous polyps.

### Surveillance recommendation for colonoscopy after polypectomy [^113WGKt1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) have declined over the past several decades, largely due to improvement and uptake in screening, particularly with colonoscopy. The US Multi-Society Task Force on CRC published guidelines for surveillance after polypectomy in 2012, which were updated in 2020 with some important changes, and this review will provide an updated overview of evidence and outcomes of surveillance after polypectomy. Notable modifications to surveillance guidelines include increasing interval time between colonoscopies from 5 to 7 to 10 years for 1 to 2 low-risk adenomas (< 10 mm) and from 3 years to 3 to 5 years when 3 to 4 low-risk adenomas are identified.

### Incidence of advanced adenomas at surveillance colonoscopy in patients with a personal history of colon adenomas: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^113GjwiS]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines stratify patients with a personal history of adenomas as low risk (ie, 1–2 small [< 10 mm] adenomas at index colonoscopy) or high risk (≥ 3 small adenomas or advanced adenoma at index colonoscopy) for recurrent advanced adenomas. Guidelines recommend longer intervals between surveillance colonoscopies for low-risk patients, but physicians frequently perform surveillance colonoscopy at shorter intervals for these patients.

Objective

Our purpose was to perform a meta-analysis about the incidence of advanced adenomas at 3-year surveillance colonoscopy among high- and low-risk patients.

Methods

Computer searches of MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and EMBASE were performed to identify appropriate studies. Study selection criteria were (1) study design — prospective or registry-based study, (2) study population — patients with a personal history of adenomas, and (3) intervention — completion of surveillance colonoscopy at an interval of ≥ 2 years. Data were extracted on (1) incidence of advanced adenomas at surveillance colonoscopy, (2) interval between colonoscopies, and (3) risk factors associated with recurrent adenomas. After the validity of study design was assessed and independent, duplicate data extraction was performed from selected trials, summary relative risks (RR) for the incidence of advanced adenomas at 3-year colonoscopy were calculated.

Results

Fifteen studies met study selection criteria, but only 5 studies stratified surveillance colonoscopy results according to findings at the index colonoscopy. Patients with ≥ 3 adenomas at index colonoscopy were more likely to have recurrent advanced adenomas than were patients with 1 to 2 adenomas: RR 2.52, 95% CI 1.07–5.97. Patients with adenomas with high-grade dysplasia at index colonoscopy were also at increased risk for recurrent advanced adenomas: RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.06–3.19. In the individual studies, increasing size of adenomas and increasing number of adenomas at index colonoscopy were the most commonly reported risk factors associated with recurrent advanced adenomas. No studies stratified surveillance colonoscopy results according to the definitions of low risk and high risk used in current guidelines.

Conclusion

Few published studies stratify the incidence of advanced adenomas at surveillance colonoscopy according to index colonoscopy findings. In the future, large prospective studies or studies using pooled data from existing randomized controlled trial databases or polyp registries should be used to better define which patients are at low risk for advanced adenoma recurrence.

### Screening intervals for colonic neoplasia [^115DQKWo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Surveillance examinations after detection of an adenoma are one of the largest contributors to the cost of colorectal cancer screening. Screening colonoscopy, beginning at the age of 50 years, is increasing in frequency and becoming part of the zeitgeist. Given the high rate of adenomatous polyp detection on colonoscopy, the amount of time spent and costs consumed by surveillance are likely to grow to significant levels in the coming years. Guidelines for surveillance examinations vary across specialty organizations. Individuals with advanced adenomas are at increased risk for recurrent advanced adenomas. The impact of multiple nonadvanced adenomas or a single nonadvanced adenoma on subsequent risk of an advanced adenoma or cancer is less clear. Recommended surveillance after colorectal cancer has greater consensus, but concerns remain. Studies that predict the need and the needed timing of surveillance remain an important research priority.

### Factors associated with shorter colonoscopy surveillance intervals for patients with low-risk colorectal adenomas and effects on outcome [^1147g7Ng]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Endoscopists do not routinely follow guidelines to survey individuals with low-risk adenomas (LRAs; 1–2 small tubular adenomas, < 1 cm) every 5–10 years for colorectal cancer; many recommend shorter surveillance intervals for these individuals. We aimed to identify the reasons that endoscopists recommend shorter surveillance intervals for some individuals with LRAs and determine whether timing affects outcomes at follow-up examinations.

Methods

We collected data from 1560 individuals (45–75 years old) who participated in a prospective chemoprevention trial (of vitamin D and calcium) from 2004 through 2008. Participants in the trial had at least 1 adenoma, detected at their index colonoscopy, and were recommended to receive follow-up colonoscopy examinations at 3 or 5 years after adenoma identification, as recommended by the endoscopist. For this analysis we collected data from only participants with LRAs. These data included characteristics of participants and endoscopists and findings from index and follow-up colonoscopies. Primary endpoints were frequency of recommending shorter (3-year) vs longer (5-year) surveillance intervals, factors associated with these recommendations, and effect on outcome, determined at the follow-up colonoscopy.

Results

A 3-year surveillance interval was recommended for 594 of the subjects (38.1%). Factors most significantly associated with recommendation of 3-year vs a 5-year surveillance interval included African American race (relative risk [RR] to white, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.75), Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity (RR to white, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.22–2.43), detection of 2 adenomas at the index examination (RR vs 1 adenoma, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27–1.71), more than 3 serrated polyps at the index examination (RR = 2.16, 95% CI, 1.59–2.93), or index examination with fair or poor quality bowel preparation (RR vs excellent quality, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.66–2.83). Other factors that had a significant association with recommendation for a 3-year surveillance interval included family history of colorectal cancer and detection of 1–2 serrated polyps at the index examination. In comparisons of outcomes, we found no significant differences between the 3-year vs 5-year recommendation groups in proportions of subjects found to have 1 or more adenomas (38.8% vs 41.7% respectively; p = 0.27), advanced adenomas (7.7% vs 8.2%; p = 0.73) or clinically significant serrated polyps (10.0% vs 10.3%; p = 0.82) at the follow-up colonoscopy.

Conclusions

Possibly influenced by patients' family history, race, quality of bowel preparation, or number or size of polyps, endoscopists frequently recommend 3-year surveillance intervals instead of guideline-recommended intervals of 5 years or longer for individuals with LRAs. However, at the follow-up colonoscopy, similar proportions of participants have 1 or more adenomas, advanced adenomas, or serrated polyps. These findings support the current guideline recommendations of performing follow-up examinations of individuals with LRAs at least 5 years after the index colonoscopy.

### Systematic literature review and pooled analyses of risk factors for finding adenomas at surveillance colonoscopy [^11589j3x]. Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aim

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines recommend surveillance after polypectomy. There is variation in the surveillance intervals that are being advised. This variation also affects adherence. Surveillance intervals need to be based on risk factors at index. We therefore aimed to systematically review risk factors of adenoma findings at surveillance colonoscopy.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed up to September 2009. Studies that reported on follow-up colonoscopy findings with stratification for index characteristics were included. Pooled relative risks (RR) were calculated using random effects models, and heterogeneity was determined by means of the I2-statistic.

Results

A total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria. The most important risk factors for adenoma findings were the presence on index colonoscopy of the following: advanced adenomas (RR: 1.81), ≥ 3 adenomas (RR: 1.64), size ≥ 10mm (RR: 1.66), and age ≥ 60 years (RR: 1.65). The presence of villous adenomas, high grade dysplasia, proximal adenomas, and male gender were associated with less profound increases in RR. Marked variation in study design and substantial heterogeneity between studies was observed.

Conclusions

Convincing evidence exists that patients with advanced adenomas, ≥ 3 adenomas, adenomas ≥ 10mm, or age ≥ 60 years have an increased risk of adenoma recurrence. The evidence for other baseline findings for an increased risk of adenoma recurrence is inconclusive. Marked variation and consistently lower RRs in studies of medium or low quality emphasize the necessity for well performed and well reported studies. Given the high impact of surveillance on patients and service providers, there is need for further assessment of the risk(s) of adenoma recurrence.

### Post-polypectomy colonoscopy surveillance: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline-update 2020 [^116ukwRt]. Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The following recommendations for post-polypectomy colonoscopic surveillance apply to all patients who had one or more polyps that were completely removed during a high quality baseline colonoscopy. 1: ESGE recommends that patients with complete removal of 1–4 < 10mm adenomas with low grade dysplasia, irrespective of villous components, or any serrated polyp < 10mm without dysplasia, do not require endoscopic surveillance and should be returned to screening. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. If organized screening is not available, repetition of colonoscopy 10 years after the index procedure is recommended. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends surveillance colonoscopy after 3 years for patients with complete removal of at least 1 adenoma ≥ 10mm or with high grade dysplasia, or ≥ 5 adenomas, or any serrated polyp ≥ 10mm or with dysplasia. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends a 3–6-month early repeat colonoscopy following piecemeal endoscopic resection of polyps ≥ 20mm. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. A first surveillance colonoscopy 12 months after the repeat colonoscopy is recommended to detect late recurrence. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 4: If no polyps requiring surveillance are detected at the first surveillance colonoscopy, ESGE suggests to perform a second surveillance colonoscopy after 5 years. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. After that, if no polyps requiring surveillance are detected, patients can be returned to screening. 5: ESGE suggests that, if polyps requiring surveillance are detected at first or subsequent surveillance examinations, surveillance colonoscopy may be performed at 3 years. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. A flowchart showing the recommended surveillance intervals is provided (Fig.1).

### Does colon polyp surveillance improve patient outcomes? [^111vBHh5]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Colon polyp surveillance now accounts for 25% of all colonoscopies performed. The evidence that colonoscopy surveillance reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence or mortality is weak. The biology of the baseline lesions and quality of the baseline exam are two primary factors contributing to post-colonoscopy CRC. Prior recommendations for surveillance were based largely on the likelihood that patients with adenomas would develop advanced adenomas, a surrogate for CRC. There is now evidence that baseline colonoscopy findings are strongly associated with the risk of incidence or death from CRC. This evidence provides a basis for updated evidence-based recommendations for surveillance. In addition, there is also growing evidence that the quality of the baseline exam is an important predictor of the likelihood of developing post-colonoscopy CRC.

### Adherence to recommended intervals for surveillance colonoscopy in average-risk patients with 1 to 2 small [^114qpKAf]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Among average-risk patients, repeat colonoscopy in 5 years is recommended after 1 to 2 small (< 1 cm) adenomas are found on screening colonoscopy or in 10 years if hyperplastic polyps are found. However, sparse quantitative data are available about adherence to these recommendations or factors that may improve adherence.

Objective

To quantify adherence to recommended intervals and to identify factors associated with lack of adherence.

Design

Retrospective endoscopic database analysis.

Setting

Tertiary-care institution and Veterans Affairs Health System.

Patients

Average-risk individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy found to have 1 to 2 small polyps on screening colonoscopy.

Main Outcome Measurements

Frequency of recommending repeat colonoscopy in 5 years if 1 to 2 small adenomas are found and in 10 years if hyperplastic polyps are found.

Results

Of 922 outpatient screening colonoscopies with 1 to 2 small polyps found, 90.2% received appropriate recommendations for timing of repeat colonoscopy. Eighty-four percent of patients with 1 to 2 small adenomas and 94% of patients with 1 to 2 hyperplastic polyps received recommendations that were consistent with guidelines. Based on logistic regression analysis, patients aged > 70 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.0–5.7), fair bowel preparation (OR 12.7; 95% CI, 7.3–22.4), poor bowel preparation (OR 10.0; 95% CI, 4.3–23.6), and the presence of 2 small adenomas versus 1 small adenoma (OR 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2–6.0) were factors associated with "overuse" or recommendations inconsistent with guidelines.

Limitations

Retrospective study design.

Conclusion

More than 90% of endoscopists' recommendations for timing of surveillance colonoscopy in average-risk patients with 1 to 2 small polyps are consistent with guideline recommendations. Quality of preparation is strongly associated with deviation from guideline recommendations.

In patients with > 10 nonadvanced adenomas, colonoscopy surveillance in < 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y, with outcomes including detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC, reduction CRC incidence, and reduction CRC mortality. In patients with high adenoma volume, colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 5 or 10 y. In patients with baseline nonadvanced adenoma and normal colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 10 y. In patients with baseline advanced adenoma and normal colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 10 y. In patients with baseline advanced adenoma and advanced adenoma colonoscopy at first surveillance, colonoscopy surveillance at 3 y is compared with colonoscopy surveillance at 5 y.

Surveillance interval and risk modifiers after 1–2 small/nonadvanced adenomas < 10 mm: In pooled prospective surveillance data, metachronous advanced neoplasia risk was higher with a history of polyps (absolute risk, 11.5%) or with concurrent distal and proximal small adenomas (absolute risk, 11.0%), and in a separate study of 4496 patients proximal-only vs distal-only lesions had similar incident CRC risk (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.7–2.8); the authors considered a recommendation of 10 years alone rather than a range of 7- to 10-year follow-up after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm in size, but state that The 7- to 10-year range was chosen due to uncertainty and possible surveillance effects, note that many such patients previously had a prior documented recommendation for a 5-year examination or other interval shorter than 7–10 years, and anticipate that characteristics such as size < 6 mm may help guide choosing a shorter 7-year vs longer 10-year surveillance interval.

### AGA clinical practice update on strategies to improve quality of screening and surveillance colonoscopy: expert review [^116i4a5A]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — surveillance intervals after colonoscopy — patients harboring advanced precancerous lesions should have a follow-up colonoscopy ≤ 3 years after the index examination. In contrast, average-risk patients who undergo a high-quality colonoscopy negative for precancerous polyps or with only small distal hyperplastic polyps have a very low risk of future neoplasia and should not be rescreened for 10 years. There is also increasing evidence that patients with 1–2 small adenomas (and especially 1–2 diminutive adenomas) are not at significantly elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population, and endoscopists should consider assigning a 10-year follow-up interval for this group as well.

Colorectal cancer surveillance after colonoscopy — Section 1 PICO questions specify comparisons and outcomes related to follow-up intervals. In patients with normal colonoscopy, repeat colonoscopy at 10 y versus earlier surveillance and no repeat colonoscopy versus colonoscopy at 10 y or earlier are evaluated with outcomes including detection of adenoma, advanced adenoma, and/or CRC, reduction CRC incidence, and reduction CRC mortality. For patients with 1–2 small (< 10 mm) nonadvanced adenomas, the questions ask whether surveillance is preferred to no surveillance and whether surveillance at 5 y is preferred to surveillance at 10 y. For sessile serrated adenoma/polyp, comparisons evaluate surveillance at 3 y versus surveillance at 5 or 10 y when size ≥ 10 mm and/or with dysplasia and when size < 10 mm with no dysplasia. For advanced adenoma and for patients with any advanced neoplasia defined as adenoma with ≥ 10 mm, villous histology, and/or high-grade dysplasia, the questions compare surveillance at 3 y versus at 5 or 10 y. Additional comparisons ask whether surveillance at 3 y is preferred to 5 or 10 y in patients with adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size and in those with adenoma containing high-grade dysplasia.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^113ByfEp]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for polyp surveillance after first surveillance colonoscopy — For baseline LRA, the interval for second surveillance is 3 years if first surveillance shows HRA, 5 years if LRA, and 10 years if no adenoma; for baseline HRA, the interval for second surveillance is 3 years if first surveillance shows HRA, 5 years if LRA, and 5 years if no adenoma (footnote a applies). We believe that patients with LRA at baseline and negative findings at first surveillance can have their next surveillance examination at 10 years, while patients who have HRA at any examination appear to remain at high risk and should have shorter follow-up intervals for surveillance. HRA is defined as 3 or more adenomas, tubular adenoma ≥ 10 mm, adenoma with villous histology, or HGD, and LRA is defined as 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm. If the findings on the second surveillance are negative, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.

Colonoscopy surveillance after colorectal cancer resection — We recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection of colon or rectal cancer receive their first surveillance colonoscopy 1 year after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing perioperative colonoscopy). We recommend that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (i.e., 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) and then 5 years (i.e., 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy). Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy, and if neoplastic polyps are detected, intervals should follow published polyp surveillance guidelines; these intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Post-polypectomy colonoscopy surveillance: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^114mFkRd]. Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Main Recommendations

The following recommendations for post-polypectomy endoscopic surveillance should be applied only after a high quality baseline colonoscopy with complete removal of all detected neoplastic lesions.1 In the low risk group (patients with 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm with low grade dysplasia), the ESGE recommends participation in existing national screening programmes 10 years after the index colonoscopy. If no screening programme is available, repetition of colonoscopy 10 years after the index colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 2 In the high risk group (patients with adenomas with villous histology or high grade dysplasia or ≥ 10 mm in size, or ≥ 3 adenomas), the ESGE recommends surveillance colonoscopy 3 years after the index colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Patients with 10 or more adenomas should be referred for genetic counselling (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 3 In the high risk group, if no high risk adenomas are detected at the first surveillance examination, the ESGE suggests a 5-year interval before a second surveillance colonoscopy (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). If high risk adenomas are detected at first or subsequent surveillance examinations, a 3-year repetition of surveillance colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).4 The ESGE recommends that patients with serrated polyps < 10 mm in size with no dysplasia should be classified as low risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). The ESGE suggests that patients with large serrated polyps (≥ 10 mm) or those with dysplasia should be classified as high risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).5 The ESGE recommends that the endoscopist is responsible for providing a written recommendation for the post-polypectomy surveillance schedule (strong recommendation, low quality evidence).

### Adherence to post-polypectomy surveillance guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Ta8G8]. Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major worldwide cause of cancer-related mortality. Colonoscopy programs based on guideline-recommended surveillance intervals have been put in place to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CRC. We were interested to evaluate clinical practice adherence to guideline-recommended surveillance intervals, the potential extent of early repeat colonoscopies, and causes of nonadherence to guideline recommendations.

Methods

We performed a literature search for articles reporting on guideline adherence for surveillance colonoscopies. Exclusion criteria included inflammatory bowel disease and hereditary CRC syndrome cohorts. Primary outcome was correct interval assignment in patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. Groups were assessed for adherence according to their respective guideline recommendations (North American or European).

Results

16 studies were included in the analysis. The mean colonoscopy surveillance interval adherence rate was 48.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37.3–60.4). For North American guidelines, surveillance interval assignments were adherent to guideline recommendations in 44.7% (95%CI 24.2–66.3) of patients after detection of low risk lesions and in 54.6% (95%CI 41.4–67.4) after detection of high risk lesions. For European guidelines, surveillance interval assignments were adherent to recommendations in 24.4% (95%CI 1.1–63.4) of patients after detection of low risk lesions and in 73.6% (95%CI 35.5–98.8) after detection of high risk lesions.

Conclusions

The worldwide adherence to surveillance colonoscopy guidelines was low, with more than 50% of patients undergoing repeat colonoscopies either too early or too late. Early repeat colonoscopies occurred with the highest frequency for patients in whom only hyperplastic polyps or low risk adenomas were found.

### Dealing with uncertainty: surveillance colonoscopy after polypectomy [^1159dziu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Post-polypectomy surveillance is often done sooner than guideline recommendations. This practice is driven by physician intolerance of uncertainty. The accompanying article by Brenner et al. supports the recommendation to wait 5 years or longer following adenoma removal before performing surveillance colonoscopy. This is particularly true for patients with 1 or 2 small adenomas. Unnecessarily aggressive post-polypectomy surveillance exposes patients to excessive risk of colonoscopy complications without clinical benefit. It also diverts colonoscopy resources away from the more valuable practice of primary screening.

### Surveillance after positive and negative colonoscopy examinations: issues, yields, and use [^112MUkch]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

As colorectal cancer screening gains acceptance by the public, the use of colonoscopy will increase. The frequency of surveillance examinations after detection of an adenoma is one of the largest contributors to the cost of colorectal cancer screening. Ten years after the publication of the landmark National Polyp Study, the issue of when to perform surveillance examinations and how often to expect advanced findings remains acute. Current guidelines for surveillance vary across specialty organizations. Individuals with advanced adenomas are at increased risk for recurrent advanced adenomas. The impact of multiple nonadvanced adenomas or a single nonadvanced adenoma on subsequent risk of an advanced adenoma or cancer is less clear. Still less is known about findings on repeat examinations after an initial negative examination, whether after colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. The yield after a negative examination is an important consideration in determining the recommended interval for screening colonoscopy. For example, the data supporting a 10-yr interval for screening colonoscopy is only indirect. What little we do know about the yield after negative examinations comes from selected, nonrepresentative populations. Of concern, evidence from several polyp prevention trials demonstrates higher yields for subsequent cancer than would be expected, despite a relatively high use of surveillance procedures in follow-up. Further population-based research on the frequency of use and yield of surveillance examinations is needed. Studies that examine the need and the needed timing of subsequent surveillance are essential to containing costs for screening as well as to informing the public better about what endoscopic screening can and cannot accomplish.

Colonoscopy surveillance — lifestyle factors do not change intervals based on current evidence. There is considerable new evidence that risk of recurrent adenomas may be reduced by taking aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; however, we believe there is insufficient evidence to recommend any change in surveillance intervals in patients who are taking these medications.

US Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) — post-resection colonoscopy schedule: We recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection of colon or rectal cancer receive their first surveillance colonoscopy 1 year after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing perioperative colonoscopy), with strength rated as strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. After that examination, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (ie, 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) and then 5 years (ie, 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy), and subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. If neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals between colonoscopies should be in accordance with published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals, and these intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome; the strength for this recommendation is again strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Surveillance colonoscopy after removal of adenoma — impact varies by risk features. Surveillance after baseline removal of adenoma with high-risk features (eg, size ≥ 10 mm) may reduce incident colorectal cancer (CRC), but impact on fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). After removal of adenoma with low-risk features (such as 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm), the incremental impact on incident and fatal CRC is uncertain (Low quality of evidence). In a UK cohort of 11,944 patients with intermediate-risk adenoma, defined as 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, at median 7.9 years follow-up 42% did not receive surveillance, and exposure to 1 or 2 surveillance examinations was associated with a 43%–48% relative reduction in incident CRC risk (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40–0.80; and HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.84).

### Rationale and design of the European polyp surveillance (EPoS) trials [^111scnZX]. Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend surveillance colonoscopies after polyp removal depending on the number and characteristics of polyps, but there is a lack of evidence supporting the recommendations. This report outlines the rationale and design of two randomized trials and one observational study investigating evidence-based surveillance strategies following polyp removal. Study design and endpoints: The EPoS studies started to recruit patients in April 2015.EPoS study I randomizes 13746 patients with low-risk adenomas (1–2 tubular adenomas size < 10mm, low-grade dysplasia) to surveillance after 5 and 10 years, or 10 years only. EPoS study II randomizes 13704 patients with high-risk adenomas (3–10 adenomas or adenoma ≥ 10mm in diameter, or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or > 25% villous features) to surveillance after 3, 5, and 10 years, or 5 and 10 years only. EPoS study III offers surveillance after 5 and 10 years to patients with serrated polyps ≥ 10mm in diameter at any location, or serrated polyps ≥ 5mm in diameter proximal to the splenic flexure. All polyps are removed before patients enter the trials. The primary end point is colorectal cancer incidence after 10 years. We assume a colorectal cancer risk of 1% for patients in EPoS I, and 2% for patients in EPoS II. Using a noninferiority hypothesis with an equivalence interval of 0.5% for EPoS I and 0.7% for EPoS II, the trials are 90% powered to uncover differences larger than the equivalence intervals. For EPoS III, no power analyses have been performed.

Conclusions

The present trials aim to develop evidence-based strategies for polyp surveillance, thereby maximizing effectiveness and minimizing resources.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^113iLfBg]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance — baseline finding of one or more tubular adenomas ≥ 10 mm retains the "3-year interval" from the 2006 recommendation with "No change" in 2012 and "High – evidence stronger than 2006". New evidence shows higher risk with larger polyps, including 10–19 mm (15.9% vs 7.7%; OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.84–2.78) and ≥ 20 mm (19.3%; OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.24–4.00), and in the VA Cooperative Study 380 baseline adenomas > 10 mm had 15.5% advanced neoplasia vs 2.4% with no neoplasia within 3.5 years (RR, 5.01; 95% CI, 2.10–11.96). The recommendation states that patients with one or more adenomas ≥ 10 mm have increased risk and "There is no basis for changing the recommended 3-year surveillance interval", assuming a high-quality examination with complete removal; if there is question about completeness (ie, piecemeal resection), "early follow-up colonoscopy is warranted".

Ongoing colonoscopic surveillance intervals — We recommend that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (ie, 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy), and then 5 years (ie, 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy). Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals, until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy, and if neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals between colonoscopies should be in accordance with the published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals; these intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome.

### Further defining the 2012 multi-society task force guidelines for surveillance of high-risk adenomas: is a 3-year interval needed for all patients? [^112QAnZo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Goals

We set out to determine whether variation from this 3-year follow-up interval was associated with the finding of subsequent high-risk adenoma (HRA).

Background

HRAs include the following: (1) an adenoma measuring ≥ 10mm, (2) ≥ 3 adenomas found during a single procedure, and (3) an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or villous architecture. The current Multi-Society Task Force guideline for timing of surveillance colonoscopy after removal of a HRA is 3 years.

Study

In 2016, we analyzed 495 patients who had a HRA removed during a 2008 colonoscopy. We compared the frequency of finding another HRA at follow-up intervals. We used the current guidelines as our referent group and performed logistical regression to identify whether any patient characteristics, procedural factors, or type of HRA predicted the development of HRAs on follow-up colonoscopy.

Results

Individuals who followed-up at a median of 4.5 years did not have more HRA on follow-up compared with those who followed-up at 3 years (25.2% vs. 21.0%, P = 0.062). These groups had similar baseline characteristics. Older individuals, male gender, having a history of polyps, and piecemeal resection of an HRA predicted future HRAs. The removal of ≥ 3 adenomas in 2008 as well as a combination of multiple, large, and advanced polyps showed a higher risk of future HRAs.

Conclusions

The 2012 Multi-Society Task Force recommendation of 3-year follow-up after removal of HRAs may not apply to all patients. We showed that a combination of patient demographics, procedural factors, and pathology best determines the surveillance colonoscopy interval.

### Post-polypectomy surveillance interval and advanced neoplasia detection rates: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study [^11558t54]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be prevented by removing premalignant polyps (PMPs). Patients prone to developing metachronous polyps or CRC are recommended to undergo surveillance, usually by colonoscopy, to reduce CRC incidence and mortality. Surveillance should be performed at the minimum frequency to achieve these aims because it is costly, demanding on endoscopy resources, and carries a risk of complications for patients.

National surveillance guidelines classify patients' risk by baseline polyp characteristics. The UK, US, and European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines were updated in 2020. The UK guideline defines high risk patients as those with: ≥ 2 PMPs, of which ≥ 1 is a serrated polyp (or adenoma) ≥ 10 mm or with (high grade) dysplasia; ≥ 5 PMPs; or ≥ 1 large (≥ 20 mm) nonpedunculated PMP; surveillance colonoscopy at 3 years is recommended for these patients. Low risk patients without these findings are encouraged to participate in routine CRC screening instead of surveillance. The US and ESGE guidelines recommend surveillance at 3 years for patients with 5–10 PMPs or a PMP ≥ 10 mm or with high grade dysplasia, but generally advise no surveillance or surveillance after a longer interval for patients without these findings; an exception is the US recommendation for surveillance at 3 years in patients with tubulovillous/villous adenomas.

No data exist on the effects of surveillance interval length on long-term post-polypectomy CRC outcomes. A randomized controlled trial examining CRC incidence with different surveillance intervals is underway, although results are not expected before 2029. Longer intervals between baseline and first surveillance are associated with increased odds of detecting CRC or adenomas with advanced features at first surveillance in some studies, but not others. We aimed to elucidate effects of interval length on advanced neoplasia detection at surveillance to inform whether recommendations for no surveillance and a 3-year surveillance interval are appropriate for low risk and high risk patients, respectively.

Colonoscopy surveillance — older age and individualized decisions are emphasized. For patients aged 75–85 years, the USPSTF recommends against continued routine screening but argues for individualization based on comorbidities and findings of any prior colonoscopy, and this age group may be more likely to benefit from surveillance, depending on life expectancy. It is the opinion of the MSTF that the decision to continue surveillance should be individualized, based on an assessment of benefit, risk, and comorbidities.

Small adenomas (1–2, < 10 mm) — in 7 prospective polyp surveillance studies, individuals with a history of polyps had metachronous advanced neoplasia risk of 11.5% and those with concurrent distal and proximal small adenomas had 11.0% absolute risk; in a separate study of 4496 patients with 1–2 nonadvanced adenomas, incident CRC risk was similar for proximal only vs distal only adenomas (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.7–2.8). The authors considered 10 years alone rather than a range of 7- to 10-year follow-up after removal of 1–2 adenomas < 10 mm, but state that the 7- to 10-year range was chosen because of uncertainty about benefit of surveillance and possible contribution of surveillance to observed low risk; they anticipate ongoing work may clarify benefits and whether characteristics such as size < 6 mm can guide choosing a shorter 7-year vs a longer 10-year interval.

### Colorectal cancer screening and surveillance [^112mW66f]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women. The incidence and mortality rate of the disease have been declining over the past two decades because of early detection and treatment. Screening in persons at average risk should begin at 50 years of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine screening after 75 years of age. Options for screening include high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing annually, flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years with high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing every three years, or colonoscopy every 10 years. In 2012, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer updated its surveillance guidelines to promote the appropriate use of colonoscopy resources and reduce harms from delayed or unnecessary procedures; these guidelines provide recommendations for when to repeat colonoscopy based on findings. Adenomatous and serrated polyps have malignant potential and warrant early surveillance colonoscopy. Patients with one or two tubular adenomas that are smaller than 10 mm should have a repeat colonoscopy in five to 10 years. Repeat colonoscopy at five years is recommended for patients with nondysplastic serrated polyps that are smaller than 10 mm. Patients with three to 10 adenomas found during a single colonoscopy, an adenoma or serrated polyp that is 10 mm or larger, an adenoma with villous features or high-grade dysplasia, a sessile serrated polyp with cytologic dysplasia, or a traditional serrated adenoma are at increased risk of developing advanced neoplasia during surveillance and should have a repeat colonoscopy in three years. More than 10 synchronous adenomas warrant surveillance colonoscopy in less than three years. Colonoscopy may be repeated in 10 years if distal, small (less than 10 mm) hyperplastic polyps are the only finding.

### Utilization of surveillance colonoscopy in community practice [^1134imGs]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The recommended timing of surveillance colonoscopy for individuals with adenomatous polyps is based on adenoma histology, size, and number. The burden and cost of surveillance colonoscopy are significant. The aim of this study was to examine the use of surveillance colonoscopy on a community-wide basis.

Methods

We retrospectively queried participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer screening trial in 9 US communities about use of surveillance colonoscopy. Subjects whose initial colonoscopy showed advanced adenoma (AA), nonadvanced adenoma (NAA), or no adenoma (NA) findings were included. Colonoscopy examinations were confirmed by reviewing colonoscopy reports.

Results

Of 3876 subjects selected for inquiry, 3627 (93.6%) responded. The cumulative probability of a surveillance colonoscopy within 5 years was 58.4% (n = 1342) in the AA group, 57.5% in those with ≥ 3 NAAs (n = 117), 46.7% in those with 1–2 NAAs (n = 905), and 26.5% (n = 1263) in subjects with NAs. Within 7 years, 33.2% of subjects with AAs received ≥ 2 surveillance examinations versus 26.9% for those with ≥ 3 NAAs, 18.2% for those with 1 or 2 NAAs, and 10.4% for those with NAs. Incomplete colonoscopy, family history of colorectal cancer, or interval adenomatous findings could explain only a minority of surveillance colonoscopy in low-risk subjects.

Conclusions

In community practice, there is substantial overuse of surveillance colonoscopy among low-risk subjects and underuse among subjects with AAs. Interventions to better align use of surveillance colonoscopy with risk for advanced lesions are needed.

Family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) or high-risk adenoma (HRA) — if colonoscopy is performed and the finding is normal, the recommended interval for repeat screening should be 5 years if the first-degree relative (FDR) was younger than 60 years and 10 years if the FDR was 60 years or older; individuals with an FDR with CRC or HRA have an increased lifetime risk of developing CRC.

### Guidelines for colonoscopy surveillance after screening and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^113fZ2CD]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy surveillance — interval fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) before scheduled surveillance is not advised after an adequate baseline colonoscopy. If the patient has an adequate baseline colonoscopy, surveillance colonoscopy should be based on the current guidelines, and patients should not have interval fecal blood testing if colonoscopy is planned. The task force recommends that interval fecal testing not be performed within the first 5 years after colonoscopy; there is currently insufficient evidence to support this practice, and the likelihood of false-positive test results is high, which would result in unnecessary early colonoscopies. If a fecal blood test is performed in the first 5 years after colonoscopy, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation, and the clinician's judgment to repeat colonoscopy could consider the prior colonoscopy findings, completeness of examination and bowel preparation, and family history.

### Implications of different guidelines for surveillance after serrated polyp resection in United States of America and Europe [^115GHHAz]. Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Because individuals with serrated polyps and adenomas are at increased risk of developing new polyps and colorectal cancer (CRC), surveillance after resection is justified. After adenoma resection, most international guidelines are consistent, but recommendations for surveillance after serrated polyp resection vary. The United States Multi-Society Taskforce on CRC (US-MSTF) base surveillance intervals on serrated polyp subtype (traditional serrated adenoma, sessile serrated polyp, hyperplastic polyps), while the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines do not take serrated polyp subtype into account. We evaluated the implications of this difference in a primary colonoscopy screening cohort.

Methods

We included participants from a large colonoscopy screening trial. In a post-hoc simulation, assuming full protocol adherence, we determined the surveillance interval for each subject based on their polyp burden, using the most recent US-MSTF and ESGE guidelines.

Results

We included 5323 participants, of whom 1228 had one or more serrated polyps. In 5201 of all participants (98%; Cohen's kappa 0.90) and in 1106 of those with serrated polyps (90%; Cohen's kappa 0.80), both guidelines recommended identical surveillance intervals. Recommendations for a 3-year surveillance interval were identical between the two guidelines. All 122 subjects with discordant recommendations would receive a follow-up colonoscopy after 10 years using ESGE guidance and after 5 years using US-MSTF guidance.

Conclusion

Despite the different criteria used to determine surveillance after serrated polyp resection, most individuals are recommended identical colonoscopy surveillance intervals whether following the ESGE or US-MSTF guidelines. This suggests that surveillance recommendations do not need to consider the serrated polyp subtype.

### Adenoma surveillance and colorectal cancer incidence: a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study [^114akYDf]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer morbidity and death in developed countries. Endoscopic removal of adenomas, precursors of most colorectal cancers, reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Patients perceived to be at increased risk after adenoma removal are recommended surveillance colonoscopy.,

National guidelines for adenoma surveillance stratify patients into risk groups based mainly on the detection of advanced neoplasia (adenomas ≥ 10 mm or with advanced pathology, or cancer) in those attending follow-up colonoscopy as a surrogate for long-term colorectal cancer incidence. The risk of advanced neoplasia at follow-up colonoscopy depends on the number, size, and histology of baseline adenomas, as well as the quality of the baseline examination.UK, European Union (EU), and US guidelines define a low-risk group for which no surveillance, or surveillance at intervals of 5–10 years, is recommended, an intermediate-risk or higher-risk group for which surveillance every 3 years is recommended, and a high-risk group for which an additional clearing colonoscopy within either 12 months (UK and EU) or within 3 years (USA) is recommended before continuation with surveillance every 3 years. The recommendation for 3-yearly surveillance is based on the results of a randomised trial that showed that the cumulative advanced neoplasia detection rate was similar between patients who had one or two surveillance colonoscopies within 3 years. Although UK and US criteria for 3-yearly surveillance differ slightly (UK criteria are one-to-two adenomas ≥ 10 mm or three-to-four adenomas < 10 mm, whereas US criteria are 3–10 adenomas or any adenomas ≥ 10 mm, with villous architecture or high-grade dysplasia), advanced neoplasia detection rates at follow-up colonoscopy are similar, at 10% in the UK versus 11% in the United States. The UK guideline recommends stopping 3-yearly surveillance after two consecutive negative colonoscopies (appendix p 1), whereas in the United States, there are no recommended criteria for stopping other than older age.

Adenoma surveillance colonoscopy — incident colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and high-risk subgroups: In intermediate-risk adenoma patients, the absolute risk for incident CRC was 2.3% with vs 2.7% without 1 surveillance examination, and in a higher-risk group defined by incomplete colonoscopy, poor preparation, high-grade dysplasia, proximal adenoma, or adenoma ≥ 20 mm, rates were 2.8% with vs 3.3% without, corresponding to HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.75. Among those not meeting higher-risk criteria, the absolute rate was 0.7% vs 1.1% with a nonstatistically significant reduction (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.20–1.43). In a French cohort of patients with advanced adenoma, at least 1 follow-up colonoscopy yielded SIR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.62–1.82 versus no follow-up SIR, 4.26; 95% CI, 2.89–6.04. Overall, the study states that surveillance colonoscopy in patients with 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm may reduce risk for incident CRC, particularly with baseline incomplete colonoscopy, poor preparation, high-grade dysplasia, adenoma ≥ 20 mm, and/or proximal adenoma.

### Physician adherence to societal guidelines following colonoscopy with polypectomy [^113naack]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most colon cancers develop from benign adenomatous/serrated polyps; however, less than 5% of the polyps become cancer. Transformation of a polyp into an adenocarcinoma is a gradual process that occurs over 5–10 years and involves acquired genetic, epigenetic and molecular changes. This gradual process creates the opportunity for intervention and prevention.

Most CRCs are sporadic and risk factors include family history, age, environmental risk factors, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, and certain foods. A very important risk factor for CRC is the presence of polyps (especially advanced polyps) during the index colonoscopy. Studies have shown that colonoscopy with polypectomy reduces the relative risk of CRC by 53%, reduces the incidence of CRC by 48%, and reduces mortality from CRC by 65%.

Guidelines of gastroenterological societies recommend surveillance following polypectomy, according to the patient's risk of developing additional polyps. The degree of risk is determined by the polyp size, its histological characteristics and the level of dysplasia. These risk factors form the basis for surveillance recommendations. Too stringent recommendations (shorter intervals between colonoscopies) will impose a significant burden on the patient and the healthcare system, while recommendations that are too lenient (long intervals between colonoscopies) can lead to missed pre-cancerous polyps and the development of cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) post-resection colonoscopy surveillance — We recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection of either colon or rectal cancer receive their first surveillance colonoscopy 1 year after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing perioperative colonoscopy). We recommend that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (ie, 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy) and then 5 years (ie, 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy). Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. If neoplastic polyps are detected, then the intervals between colonoscopies should be in accordance with published guidelines for polypectomy surveillance. These intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) resection — colonoscopy surveillance schedule: We recommend that patients with CRC undergo high-quality perioperative clearing with colonoscopy, and the procedure should be performed preoperatively or within a 3- to 6-month interval after surgery in the case of obstructive CRC, with goals of detection of synchronous cancer and detection and complete resection of precancerous polyps. We recommend that patients who have undergone curative resection of either colon or rectal cancer receive their first surveillance colonoscopy 1 year after surgery (or 1 year after the clearing perioperative colonoscopy), and we recommend that, after the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (ie, 4 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy), and then 5 years (ie, 9 years after surgery or perioperative colonoscopy); thereafter, colonoscopy should be performed at 5-year intervals, until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. If neoplastic polyps are detected, the intervals between colonoscopies should be in accordance with the published guidelines for polyp surveillance intervals, and these intervals do not apply to patients with Lynch syndrome.

### Risk of colorectal neoplasia after removal of conventional adenomas and serrated polyps: a comprehensive evaluation of risk factors and surveillance use [^111qkzQy]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Surveillance colonoscopy after polyp removal is recommended to prevent subsequent colorectal cancer (CRC). It is known that advanced adenomas have a substantially higher risk than non-advanced ones, but optimal intervals for surveillance remain unclear.

Design

We prospectively followed 156 699 participants who had undergone a colonoscopy from 2007 to 2017 in a large integrated healthcare system. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression we estimated the subsequent risk of CRC and high-risk polyps, respectively, according to index colonoscopy polyps, colonoscopy quality measures, patient characteristics and the use of surveillance colonoscopy.

Results

After a median follow-up of 5.3 years, we documented 309 CRC and 3053 high-risk polyp cases. Compared with participants with no polyps at index colonoscopy, those with high-risk adenomas and high-risk serrated polyps had a consistently higher risk of CRC during follow-up, with the highest risk observed at 3 years after polypectomy (multivariable HR 5.44 (95% CI 3.56 to 8.29) and 8.35 (95% CI 4.20 to 16.59), respectively). Recurrence of high-risk polyps showed a similar risk distribution. The use of surveillance colonoscopy was associated with lower risk of CRC, with an HR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.98) among patients with high-risk polyps and 0.57 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.92) among low-risk polyps. Among 1548 patients who had high-risk polyps at both index and surveillance colonoscopies, 65% had their index polyps in the proximal colon and 30% had index and interval polyps in the same segments.

Conclusion

Patients with high-risk polyp findings were at higher risk of subsequent CRC and high-risk polyps and may benefit from early surveillance within 3 years. The subsite distribution of the index and recurrent high-risk polyps suggests the contribution of incomplete resection and missed lesions to the development of interval neoplasia.

### Post-polypectomy surveillance interval and advanced neoplasia detection rates: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study [^117JBXhK]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

No data exist on the effects of surveillance interval on long-term post-polypectomy CRC outcomes. Therefore, while our findings support recommendations for surveillance at 3 years in high risk patients, it remains unknown whether a 3-year interval is superior to longer intervals in terms of long-term protection against CRC. A randomized controlled trial examining long-term CRC incidence with different surveillance intervals will help address this knowledge gap.

Our study has limitations due to its observational and retrospective nature. We were unable to classify the risk of ~1800 patients owing to missing information on baseline polyp characteristics. Classification of serrated polyps was complicated by the evolution in detection and terminology used for these polyps over the study duration. We had incomplete data on reasons for attendance at follow-up examinations and so counted examinations performed within ≤ 6.5 years after the previous visit as surveillance; this might have captured some examinations performed for symptoms. However, our results were robust to changes in our chosen interval cutoff. Some patients might have undergone surveillance at hospitals not included in our study. We had insufficient data to estimate adenoma detection rates for the endoscopists performing the examinations. Associations between interval and neoplasia detection at surveillance might be confounded by baseline characteristics, although we reduced this likelihood by multivariable adjustment. As high risk patients attended first surveillance after a median of 2 years, observed detection rates at first surveillance with intervals of ≥ 3 years are likely to be lower than if intervals more closely aligned with UK (2020) recommendations. Our results should be interpreted with caution because we performed multiple testing and some estimates are imprecise due to few outcomes.

Study strengths include the large size and wide coverage of the UK. We had detailed information on characteristics at baseline colonoscopy, and findings at first and second surveillance, with few missing data. The wide variation in surveillance intervals, owing to the study's observational and retrospective nature, enabled examination of neoplasia detection rates at many different surveillance intervals; this feature is unique and unlikely to be seen in future studies when adoption of surveillance guidelines is more widespread. Our findings are applicable to contemporary practice because all analyzed patients had a complete baseline colonoscopy.

When to stop surveillance — There is considerable new evidence that the risk of colonoscopy increases with advancing age, and both surveillance and screening should not be continued when risk may outweigh benefit. The guideline also notes that The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) determined that screening should not be continued.

Baseline examination — no adenomas; distal small (< 10 mm) hyperplastic polyps: Prior and current evidence suggests that distal hyperplastic polyps (HPs) < 10 mm are benign and nonneoplastic, and if the most advanced lesions at baseline colonoscopy are distal HPs < 10 mm, the interval for colonoscopic follow-up should be 10 years. The 2012 recommendation for next examination indicates No change with Quality of evidence Moderate, and new information notes HPs accounted for 50% of polyps 1–5 mm, 27.9% of polyps 6–9 mm, and 13.7% of polyps > 10 mm.

Second surveillance after adenoma — recommended intervals are stratified by baseline and first surveillance findings as follows: For baseline 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, the recommended interval for first surveillance is 7–10 y; if first surveillance finds Normal colonoscopy, the recommended interval for next surveillance is 10 y; if 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, 7–10 y; if 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, 3–5 y; and if Adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size; or adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology; or adenoma with high grade dysplasia; or 5–10 adenomas < 10 mm, 3 y. For baseline 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, the recommended interval for first surveillance is 3–5 y; if first surveillance finds Normal colonoscopy, 10 y; if 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, 7–10 y; if 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, 3–5 y; and if Adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size; or adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology; or adenoma with high grade dysplasia; or 5–10 adenomas < 10 mm, 3 y. For baseline Adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size; or adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology; or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia; or 5–10 adenomas < 10 mm, the recommended interval for first surveillance is 3 y; if first surveillance finds Normal colonoscopy, 5 y; if 1–2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, 5 y; if 3–4 tubular adenomas < 10 mm, 3–5 y; and if Adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size; or adenoma with tubulovillous/villous histology; or adenoma with high grade dysplasia; or 5–10 adenomas < 10 mm, 3 y. Normal colonoscopy is defined as colonoscopy where no adenoma, SSP, or CRC is found.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^117QJxQ7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Surveillance colonoscopy after baseline removal of adenoma with high-risk features (eg, size ≥ 10 mm) may reduce risk for incident CRC, but impact on fatal CRC is uncertain. In a UK cohort of patients with intermediate-risk adenomas defined as 1–2 adenomas ≥ 10 mm or 3–4 adenomas < 10 mm, at median 7.9 years, 42% did not receive surveillance; exposure to 1 or 2 surveillance examinations was associated with reduced incident CRC (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.72 and HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37–0.74). Risk for incident CRC was independently associated with increasing age, adenoma ≥ 20 mm in size, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, proximal adenoma, incomplete baseline examination, and poor bowel preparation. In a higher-risk subgroup, absolute incident CRC was 2.8% with vs 3.3% without surveillance (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36–0.75), whereas among those not meeting higher-risk criteria it was 0.7% vs 1.1% with a nonstatistically significant reduction (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.20–1.43); mortality was not assessed.

### Recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy: a consensus update by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^114Z3N1h]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer — scope and risk framework for follow-up after colonoscopy and polypectomy notes that colonoscopy is used for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, evaluation, and surveillance, and colonoscopists are expected to provide follow-up recommendations; follow-up after normal colonoscopy among age-eligible individuals and post-polypectomy among individuals with polyps are common scenarios needing guidance. Risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia is associated with prior colonoscopy findings; after high-quality colonoscopy, patients with no neoplasia are at the lowest risk, and polyp findings are used to risk-stratify by histology, number, location, and size. The stated aim is to review newly available evidence and update recommendations for follow-up after colonoscopy with or without polypectomy.

Criteria for inclusion/exclusion of titles, abstracts, and articles — study selection for surveillance after colonoscopy was staged: At title and abstract review, the goal was to identify articles examining the relationship between baseline colonoscopy examination and subsequent neoplasia on follow-up, with exclusions including narrative review or editorial, guidelines, focus on high-risk conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, history of CRC, or hereditary CRC syndromes, and focus on children; additional abstract exclusions included abstract only; no associated article, focus exclusively on endoscopic resection method or immediate completeness of resection, and focus other than on post-polypectomy surveillance or normal colonoscopy outcomes. For full-article review, inclusion required relevance to patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions — specifically, relevance to 1 or more PICO questions, examination of baseline colonoscopy findings and detection of CRC or advanced adenoma on follow-up, or examination of surveillance vs no surveillance for individuals after baseline polypectomy.

### Adenoma surveillance and colorectal cancer incidence: a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study [^111mMvWA]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

We conclude from our results that patients diagnosed with intermediate-risk adenomas are at only a small increased risk of developing colorectal cancer after their baseline colonoscopy and polypectomy compared with the general population, especially if they have had a good quality baseline colonoscopy; therefore, it is unclear whether all of these intermediate-risk patients need the currently recommended 3-yearly surveillance by colonoscopy. Among patients in the lower-risk subgroup, surveillance might not be warranted at all if baseline colonoscopy is complete, with good visibility of the bowel mucosa and all lesions completely excised. Patients with a suboptimal quality examination at baseline should have a good quality colonoscopy before their surveillance strategy is determined. In patients for whom a good quality colonoscopy is not possible, an alternative form of surveillance should be sought if appropriate. Patients with large adenomas (≥ 20 mm), high-grade dysplasia, or proximal polyps are likely to benefit significantly from at least one surveillance examination. Future studies should examine whether alternative strategies to surveillance colonoscopy might suffice for some patients. Additionally, future research should aim to define the subgroup of intermediate-risk patients for whom the risk of colorectal cancer after first surveillance is so low that they can stop surveillance altogether.
