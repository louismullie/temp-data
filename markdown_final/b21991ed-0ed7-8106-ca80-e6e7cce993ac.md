## Question

A 13-year-old boy presents to the clinic with a sore throat, fever, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. A rapid antigen detection test is positive for group A streptococcus, and he is treated with a 10-day course of penicillin. At his follow-up visit, he reports complete resolution of symptoms. His mother asks if he needs another throat swab to ensure the infection is gone. The boy has no personal or family history of rheumatic fever.

Based on current guidelines for the primary prevention of rheumatic fever, should a post-treatment throat culture be obtained in this patient? Justify your answer.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a post-treatment throat culture is indicated for a 13-year-old boy with confirmed group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis who completed a 10-day penicillin course and is now asymptomatic, with no personal or family history of rheumatic fever. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is routine care versus a special circumstance. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (IDSA, AAFP, CDC) say about post-treatment testing. Next, I will consider the rationale for and against post-treatment cultures, including the risk of rheumatic fever and the issue of chronic carriage. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and counseling points, making sure I double-check for any exceptions that might apply here.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and risk framing. This is a typical, immunocompetent adolescent with classic GAS pharyngitis who received guideline-concordant therapy and is now clinically cured; importantly, there is no history of rheumatic fever in the patient or family, which places him in a low-risk category for rheumatic complications and makes this a routine, uncomplicated case rather than a special circumstance warranting surveillance testing [^2d839d1c] [^2d54ac5a].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance on post-treatment testing. The IDSA 2012 guideline explicitly recommends not obtaining routine follow-up post-treatment throat cultures or RADTs after appropriate therapy, reserving testing only for special circumstances such as recurrent disease, outbreaks, or a personal/family history of rheumatic fever; routine testing in otherwise low-risk, asymptomatic patients is discouraged [^2d839d1c]. Hold on, I should verify whether AAFP or CDC add anything different; AAFP's 2024 rapid review aligns with IDSA and does not recommend routine post-treatment testing, and CDC guidance similarly focuses on diagnosis and treatment rather than routine post-therapy cultures, reinforcing that follow-up cultures are not indicated in this scenario [^6d22da7c] [^2d54ac5a].

> I will now examine the rationale against routine post-treatment cultures. Wait, let me verify the key points: asymptomatic carriage of GAS is common after treatment and can persist for weeks without indicating treatment failure, so a positive culture in a well, asymptomatic patient can lead to unnecessary retreatment and confusion; moreover, in high-income settings with low rheumatic fever incidence, the risk of rheumatic complications after appropriate therapy is extremely low, so routine post-treatment testing does not meaningfully reduce that risk and may drive overtreatment and resistance pressure [^2d839d1c] [^69cb2ee7]. I should double-check that this applies across pediatric ages; yes, the guidance is generalizable to children and adolescents in low-risk settings, with no age-specific exception here [^2d839d1c].

> But wait, what if the family is concerned about "making sure it's gone"? Let me consider the counterarguments and why they don't change the recommendation. Some might argue that confirming eradication could prevent rare complications; however, in the absence of symptoms or special risk factors, the yield is low and the risk of false positives from carriage is high, which can prompt unnecessary antibiotics without proven benefit in this context [^2d839d1c]. I should confirm that this stance holds even when considering bacteriologic eradication rates; indeed, even though eradication can be imperfect in some studies, routine post-treatment testing still does not improve clinically meaningful outcomes in low-risk, asymptomatic patients after appropriate therapy [^2d839d1c].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any exceptions apply to this case. Special circumstances where post-treatment testing is reasonable include recurrent episodes, suspected treatment failure, outbreaks, or a personal/family history of rheumatic fever; none of those are present here, so this remains a routine case where testing is not indicated [^2d839d1c]. I need to ensure I'm not conflating diagnostic follow-up with post-treatment surveillance; the recommendation to obtain a backup culture after a negative RADT in children is a diagnostic strategy, not a post-therapy test, and does not imply routine post-treatment cultures after successful therapy [^f4c61d05] [^2d54ac5a].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. Based on current IDSA, AAFP, and CDC guidance, a post-treatment throat culture is not indicated for this asymptomatic, low-risk adolescent who completed appropriate penicillin therapy and has no rheumatic history; routine post-treatment testing should be avoided in this scenario [^2d839d1c] [^6d22da7c] [^2d54ac5a]. I should confirm the counseling points: explain that persistent carriage without symptoms is common, that the risk of rheumatic fever after appropriate therapy is very low in this setting, and that unnecessary testing can lead to false positives and overtreatment; advise returning if symptoms recur or new concerning features develop, and reinforce adherence and hand hygiene to limit transmission [^2d839d1c] [^2d54ac5a].

---

Routine post-treatment throat cultures are **not recommended** for asymptomatic patients without a history of rheumatic fever [^2d839d1c] because the risk of rheumatic fever is low and cultures can remain positive due to carriage, leading to unnecessary treatment [^ea6e9de7]. Testing is only indicated if symptoms persist or recur, or if the patient is at **high risk for rheumatic fever** (e.g. personal/family history or living in an endemic area) [^2d839d1c]. In this case, since the patient is asymptomatic and has no rheumatic risk, a post-treatment culture is unnecessary.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) provides clear guidance on this issue: **routine follow-up throat cultures or rapid antigen detection tests are not recommended** after treatment for GAS pharyngitis, except in special circumstances [^2d839d1c]. These special circumstances include:

- **Symptoms persist or recur**: If the patient continues to have symptoms after completing antibiotic therapy, or if symptoms recur shortly after treatment, further evaluation may be warranted [^6d22da7c].

- **High risk for rheumatic fever**: Patients with a personal or family history of rheumatic fever, or those living in communities with a high incidence of rheumatic fever, may require closer follow-up and consideration of post-treatment testing [^2d839d1c].

- **Outbreaks or clusters**: In the setting of outbreaks or clusters of GAS infections, post-treatment testing may be considered to help control the spread of infection [^2d839d1c].

---

## Rationale behind not recommending routine post-treatment cultures

Several reasons support the **IDSA's recommendation** against routine post-treatment cultures:

- **Low risk of rheumatic fever**: In developed countries, the incidence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) following appropriately treated GAS pharyngitis is extremely low, estimated at less than 0.01% [^notfound]. Therefore, routine post-treatment cultures do not significantly reduce the risk of ARF.

- **Persistence of carriage**: Many patients, particularly children, may continue to carry GAS in their throats even after successful antibiotic treatment. This carriage state is typically asymptomatic and not associated with an increased risk of complications. Routine post-treatment cultures can yield positive results in these patients, leading to unnecessary additional antibiotic treatment [^891c043b].

- **Limited clinical utility**: Routine post-treatment cultures rarely change clinical management in asymptomatic patients. Positive results often reflect colonization rather than active infection, and additional antibiotics may not be beneficial [^ea6e9de7].

---

## Evidence supporting the recommendation

A study published in Pediatrics found that **35% of children treated with oral penicillin V and 37% treated with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G had microbiologic treatment failures** at 10–14 or 29–31 days, yet most remained asymptomatic and did not develop complications [^35dae1df]. This highlights the limited clinical significance of persistent carriage and the potential harms of routine post-treatment testing.

Additionally, the Cochrane review on antibiotic treatment for GAS pharyngitis concluded that while antibiotics provide modest benefits in symptom relief and prevention of complications, **routine post-treatment cultures do not significantly improve outcomes** or reduce the risk of complications such as rheumatic fever [^7bd28471].

---

## Clinical scenarios where post-treatment cultures may be indicated

While routine post-treatment cultures are not recommended, certain clinical scenarios may warrant further evaluation:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for post-treatment culture** |
|-|-|
| Persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment | Yes |
| Personal or family history of rheumatic fever | Yes |
| Living in a community with high incidence of rheumatic fever | Yes |
| Outbreaks or clusters of GAS infections | Yes |
| Asymptomatic patient without risk factors | No |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on current clinical guidelines and available evidence, **routine post-treatment throat cultures are not recommended** for asymptomatic patients without a history of rheumatic fever or other risk factors. In this specific case, the patient is asymptomatic, has no personal or family history of rheumatic fever, and resides in a community with a low incidence of rheumatic fever. Therefore, a post-treatment throat culture is not indicated.

If the patient develops recurrent or persistent symptoms, or if new risk factors emerge, further evaluation and testing may be considered. Otherwise, no additional testing is necessary, and the patient can be reassured that the infection has been adequately treated.

### Streptococcal pharyngitis: rapid evidence review [^6d22da7c]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence).  Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

Key points
- Many pathogens can cause pharyngitis.
- Patients with clear viral symptoms don't need testing for group A streptococcal bacteria.
- Confirm a negative rapid antigen detection test with a throat culture for symptomatic children aged 3 years or older.
- Treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Clinical features Acute pharyngitis symptoms It commonly presents with
- Fever
- Pain with swallowing
- Sudden onset of sore throat On clinical examination, patients with group A strep pharyngitis usually have
- Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
- Palatal petechiae
- Pharyngeal and tonsillar erythema
- Tonsillar hypertrophy with or without exudates Patients with group A strep pharyngitis may also present with a scarlatiniform rash. The resulting syndrome is scarlet fever. Keep ReadingClinical Guidance for Scarlet Fever.

Less common symptoms Other symptoms, especially among children, may include:
- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting Subacute illness Respiratory disease caused by group A strep infection in children younger than 3 years of age rarely manifests as acute pharyngitis. Instead, these children usually have what is called “streptococcal fever” or “streptococcosis, ” which involves mucopurulent rhinitis followed by:
- Anorexia
- Fever
- Irritability. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute pharyngitis includes multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in all age groups.

Experts estimate that group A strep, the most common bacterial cause, causes
- 20% to 30% of pharyngitis episodes in children
- 5% to 15% of pharyngitis infections in adults Clinical examination only with viral symptoms Healthcare providers can use history and clinical examination to diagnose viral pharyngitis when clear viral symptoms are present. These patients don't need testing for group A strep bacteria. Testing and diagnosis To confirm group A strep pharyngitis, healthcare providers can use either
- A rapid antigen detection test
- Throat culture RADTs have high specificity for group A strep bacteria but varying sensitivities when compared to throat culture. Throat culture is the gold standard diagnostic test. Positive RADT or culture Healthcare providers can use a positive RADT or throat culture as confirmation of group A strep pharyngitis.

Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed group A strep pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever. All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups. Treatment Patients, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat viral pharyngitis with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat group A strep pharyngitis:
- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Decreases the development of complications.

### Management of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis [^986b23f8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Bacteria are responsible for approximately 5 to 10 percent of pharyngitis cases, with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci being the most common bacterial etiology. A positive rapid antigen detection test may be considered definitive evidence for treatment; a negative test should be followed by a confirmatory throat culture when streptococcal pharyngitis is strongly suspected. Treatment goals include prevention of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, abatement of clinical signs and symptoms, reduction of bacterial transmission and minimization of antimicrobial adverse effects. Antibiotic selection requires consideration of patients' allergies, bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, frequency of administration, duration of therapy, potential side effects, compliance and cost. Oral penicillin remains the drug of choice in most clinical situations, although the more expensive cephalosporins and, perhaps, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium provide superior bacteriologic and clinical cure rates. Alternative treatments must be used in patients with penicillin allergy, compliance issues or penicillin treatment failure. Patients who do not respond to initial treatment should be given an antimicrobial that is not inactivated by penicillinase-producing organisms (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, a cephalosporin or a macrolide). Patient education may help to reduce recurrence.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs).There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

### Pharyngitis [^db807925]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e., group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

Key points
- Skin rash and sore throat are common symptoms of scarlet fever.
- Physical signs of scarlet fever can appear on the tongue or skin and in the throat or neck.
- Complications aren't common after scarlet fever.
- Speak with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about scarlet fever. Signs and symptoms General symptoms Some symptoms of scarlet fever are common to other infections, too. These may include:
- Fever or chills
- Headache or body aches
- Nausea or vomiting
- Sore throat and pain when swallowing
- Stomach pain. Physical signs Some physical signs are typical of scarlet fever. They show in the following areas:
- Skin
- Tongue, throat, and neck Skin Signs of scarlet fever on the skin include:
- A red rash that feels rough like sandpaper
- Brighter red skin in the creases of the underarm, elbow, and groin
- Pale area around the mouth
- Skin peeling as the rash fades.

Tongue, throat, and neck Signs in these areas include: Early in illness: Whitish coating on the tongue Later in illness: "Strawberry" tongue
- Red and swollen tonsils
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- Very red throat
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils. How symptoms change over time Rash appears and spreads One to 2 days after the illness begins, a red rash usually appears. However, the rash can appear before illness or up to 7 days later. The rash may first appear on the neck, underarm, and groin. Over time, the rash spreads over the body. The rash usually begins as small, flat blotches that slowly become fine bumps that feel like sandpaper. Color of skin can vary Although the cheeks might look flushed, there may be a pale area around the mouth.

Underarm, elbow, and groin skin creases may become brighter red than the rest of the rash. Rash fades and skin may peel The rash from scarlet fever fades in about 7 days. As the rash fades, the skin may peel around the fingertips, toes, and groin area. This peeling can last up to several weeks. Complications Complications can occur after having scarlet fever but aren't common. This can happen if the bacteria spread to other parts of the body. Complications can include:
- Abscesses around the tonsils
- Arthritis
- Ear, sinus, and skin infections
- Pneumonia
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
- Rheumatic fever
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Treatment with antibiotics can prevent most of these health problems.

Outcomes

The primary non-inferiority outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment at the test of cure visit for the per protocol population. Clinical cure was defined as complete recovery without major residual symptoms or clinical findings of pharyngotonsillitis or symptomatic relapse. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication according to the culture taken at test of cure; frequency of relapses one month after first diagnosis (given clinical cure at test of cure); frequency of complications and new pharyngotonsillitis during the three month study period; and patterns of adverse events. In addition, we used patient diaries to assess time to relief of fever and throat symptoms graded on a Likert scale (no symptoms, mild, moderate, and severe symptoms). We evaluated patients’ adherence to the study drugs in terms of number of doses, and intake of analgesics according to patient diaries as exploratory outcomes.

Changes of outcomes

We performed an additional sensitivity analysis to evaluate the outcome at fixed time points after randomisation. Because the physicians assessed clinical cure only at the test of cure visit, this sensitivity analysis was based on the patient answering “yes” to the question “Do you consider yourself or your child cured from the current infection?” in the patient diary. We performed this analysis at five, seven, and nine days after randomisation.

In June 2017, we also introduced an exploratory outcome at the one month telephone follow-up to examine patients’ preferences about the study medication regimen.

Sample size calculation

We assumed 90% clinical recovery in both groups, a power of 85%, a level of significance of 5%, two sidedness, and a non-inferiority margin of 10%, which gave a sample size of 324 patients. Assuming that the primary outcome could not be evaluated in 25% of patients, 432 needed to be included in the study.

### Common questions about streptococcal pharyngitis [^77d114f8]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The strongest independent predictors of GABHS pharyngitis are patient age of five to 15 years, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and fever. To diagnose GABHS pharyngitis, a rapid antigen detection test should be ordered in patients with a modified Centor or FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. First-line treatment for GABHS pharyngitis includes a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin. Patients allergic to penicillin can be treated with firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or macrolide antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than acetaminophen and placebo for treatment of fever and pain associated with GABHS pharyngitis; medicated throat lozenges used every two hours are also effective. Corticosteroids provide only a small reduction in the duration of symptoms and should not be used routinely.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^5f3efc37]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus.1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed.2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care.3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered.5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient.

### Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis [^891c043b]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Common signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C), tonsillar exudates, and cervical adenopathy. Cough, coryza, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Available diagnostic tests include throat culture and rapid antigen detection testing. Throat culture is considered the diagnostic standard, although the sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection testing have improved significantly. The modified Centor score can be used to help physicians decide which patients need no testing, throat culture/rapid antigen detection testing, or empiric antibiotic therapy. Penicillin (10 days of oral therapy or one injection of intramuscular benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice because of cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is equally effective and more palatable. Erythromycin and first-generation cephalosporins are options in patients with penicillin allergy. Increased group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) treatment failure with penicillin has been reported. Although current guidelines recommend first-generation cephalosporins for persons with penicillin allergy, some advocate the use of cephalosporins in all nonallergic patients because of better GABHS eradication and effectiveness against chronic GABHS carriage. Chronic GABHS colonization is common despite appropriate use of antibiotic therapy. Chronic carriers are at low risk of transmitting disease or developing invasive GABHS infections, and there is generally no need to treat carriers. Whether tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy decreases the incidence of GABHS pharyngitis is poorly understood. At this time, the benefits are too small to outweigh the associated costs and surgical risks.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^bb484dac]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Historically, bacterial culture is considered the gold standard because it is believed to be both highly sensitive and highly specific. In clinical trials, cultures are generally performed at a central reference laboratory under rigorous procedural oversight and optimized transport conditions to prioritize sensitivity, with limited concern about turnaround times. The sensitivity results in this study (71.8% [62.4–80.0%]) and others (81 and 86.8%) that look at culture under real-world conditions, often with less rigorous procedural oversight, raise questions about its use in routine clinical care, especially in light of the time delay to report results back to providers.

Turnaround time is a high priority for patient care, timely results are necessary for optimal management. This is particularly important for streptococcal pharyngitis, because children are highly contagious until treated and both individual and community health are adversely affected by delays in diagnosis. Parental desire for a timely diagnosis and treatment, along with the additional resources needed to follow-up on culture results and report these results to parents, place additional strains on providers. As a result, clinicians often empirically prescribe antibiotics before receiving the final test results, or treat based on clinical presentation alone, which has low proven specificity. Prudent use of antibiotics by outpatients is necessary to prevent the development and spread of bacterial resistance.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^f8ea8f7e]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated 20–30% of sore throat cases in children. In the United States, the societal cost of GAS pharyngitis is estimated to range from $224 to $539 million per year, with children missing an average of 1.9 days of school/daycare and 42% of parents missing a mean of 1.8 days of work. The timely initiation of antibiotics can effectively treat GAS pharyngitis, prevent the spread of infection to close contacts, reduce the duration of symptoms, and limit rare long-term complications. Acute pharyngitis can be a result of either bacterial or viral pathogens and, as such, current clinical guidelines encourage the use of antibiotics only for confirmed cases of GAS. Despite these recommendations, and the overall rates of documented GAS infections (5–30% of sore throat visits), antibiotics are often prescribed in as many as 60% of patient visits for sore throat. Greater awareness of the development of bacterial resistance resulting from the overprescribing of antibiotics is increasing the urgency to move away from empiric antibiotic treatment for common respiratory infections.

### Notes from the field: group A streptococcal pharyngitis misdiagnoses at a rural urgent-care clinic – Wyoming, March 2015 [^315daa72]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis, implicated in 20%-30% of pediatric and 5%-15% of adult health care visits for sore throat (1). Along with the sudden onset of throat pain, GAS pharyngitis symptoms include fever, headache, and bilateral tender cervical lymphadenopathy (1,2). Accurate diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis is critical for limiting antibiotic overuse and preventing rheumatic fever (2), but distinguishing between GAS and viral pharyngitis clinically is challenging (1). Guidelines for diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)* (1). IDSA recommends that patients with sore throat be tested for GAS to distinguish between GAS and viral pharyngitis; however, IDSA emphasizes the use of selective testing based on clinical symptoms and signs to avoid identifying GAS carriers rather than acute GAS infections (1). Therefore, testing for GAS usually is not recommended for the following: patients with sore throat and accompanying symptoms (e.g., cough, rhinorrhea) that strongly suggest a viral etiology; children aged <3 years, because acute rheumatic fever is extremely rare in this age group; and asymptomatic household contacts of patients with GAS pharyngitis (1). IDSA recommends penicillin or amoxicillin as the treatment of choice based on effectiveness and narrow spectrum of activity. To date, penicillin-resistant GAS has never been documented (1).

Technical information

Patients or their guardians provided signed informed consent. Patients eligible for inclusion were assigned to treatment with penicillin V as an oral tablet, either 800 mg four times daily for five days or 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days. The dosages for children up to 40 kg were adjusted according to weight (10-20 kg: 250 mg per dose, 20-40 kg: 500 mg per dose, irrespective of treatment arm).Physicians prescribed penicillin V and the patients or their guardians obtained the drugs from the pharmacy after the inclusion visit. Patients or their guardians were asked to fill in a patient diary until the test of cure visit, which was scheduled five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. We chose a test of cure visit based on last dose and not a fixed day after randomisation so that the duration without antibiotic protection was similar for both treatment groups.

Physicians’ clinical judgment of throat status at inclusion and at the test of cure visit were recorded. Throat swabs for rapid antigen detection test and culture were performed at study inclusion and at the follow-up visit. To reduce the discomfort for children, we accepted a double swab if rotated against the tonsils. We regarded any growth of group A streptococcus as a positive outcome. A physician recorded adverse events in the case report form at the test of cure visit. Start and stop dates for each event were recorded, and the physician’s assessment of intensity and the relation to the study drug. In addition, patients (or their guardians) self reported adverse events and side effects in the patient diary. Regional study nurses made follow-up telephone calls to patients (or their guardians) one month and three months after completion of antibiotic treatment. Throat symptoms, potential relapses or new tonsillitis, and complications were monitored, in addition to adverse events. When patients had complications, we collected details retrospectively from their medical records. Uppsala Clinical Research Center and the Center for Primary Health Care Research performed monitoring according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^78f725a4]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention: treat acute disease to reduce duration of illness and prevent ARF or other complications of infection

Six studies evaluated diagnostic strategies for patients presenting for treatment of sore throat. All included the benefits of reducing duration of acute illness and preventing ARF and/or quinsy (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, some studies included further down-stream benefits, namely preventing RHD due to preventing ARF.

The earliest of those studies, a study by Neuner et al. published in 2003, was a model-based, cost-utility analysis for pharyngitis treatment among adult patients from a societal perspective. The authors estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life-days (QLADs) lost due to pharyngitis and related complications for five diagnosis and treatment strategies: observation without testing or treatment, empirical treatment with penicillin, throat culture all patients and treat Strep A positive cases, RADT for all patients followed by culture to confirm negative test, and RADT without follow-up culture for all patients. They concluded that performing a throat culture on all patients and treating Strep A positive cases was the least costly and the most effective (least QALDs lost to pharyngitis and complications) strategy. From sensitivity analyses, the authors conclude that observation without testing or treatment would be more effective if the probability of ARF was lower (baseline was 5 in 10,000 adults with Strep A pharyngitis), the probability of anaphylaxis was higher, or the quality of life with pharyngitis was better compared to baseline values. These results are important as there was uncertainty in all parameter estimates, which were derived from few and aging studies from the literature or from unsubstantiated assumptions.

### Unexplained reduced microbiological efficacy of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G and of oral penicillin V in eradication of group a streptococci from children with acute pharyngitis [^35dae1df]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of oral penicillin V and intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) in eradicating group A streptococci from the upper respiratory tract.

Methodology

Two randomized, single-blind, multicenter antibiotic efficacy trials in children using recommended doses of either oral penicillin V or intramuscular BPG for treatment of acute-onset pharyngitis associated with isolation of group A streptococci were conducted. Throat examinations and cultures were obtained at enrollment and on days 5 to 8, 10 to 14, and 29 to 31.

Results

Thirty-five percent of 284 evaluable patients treated with oral penicillin V and 37% of BPG-treated patients were microbiologic treatment failures at either 10 to 14 or 29 to 31 days.

Conclusions

Although these findings do not provide sufficient evidence to change current treatment recommendations or public health policy, important questions are raised about currently recommended penicillin doses, about the role of the carrier state, and possibly about adequate bioavailability of intramuscular BPG. These findings require confirmation.

Secondary outcomes

Table 2 shows the results of bacteriological eradication according to the culture taken at the test of cure evaluation (presence of group A streptococcus or not); frequency of relapses one month after first diagnosis; and frequency of complications or new pharyngotonsillitis during the study period. Twelve of the 15 patients who experienced relapses had bacteriological eradication at test of cure, including six out of eight in the five day group and six out of seven in the 10 day group. Only four patients had complications, all in the 10 day group, which all resolved: three were peritonsillitis and one was psoriasis, probably provoked by streptococci. Two of the three patients with peritonsillitis were referred to a specialist for surgery. According to patient diaries, time to first day of relief of sore throat was significantly shorter in the five day group compared with the 10 day group in the per protocol and modified intention to treat populations (P<0.001, log rank test; fig 2). The median time to relief of sore throat was four days after randomisation for both intervention groups. There was no difference between the groups for time to relief of fever recorded in patient diaries (P=0.48, log rank test).

Fig 2 
Time to first day of relief of sore throat according to patient diaries for five day and 10 day groups (per protocol population, n=381)

No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Most of the adverse events recorded on case report forms (assessed by physicians) were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity: 73% (97/132) and 23% (31/132), respectively, in the five day group and 61% (104/170) and 33% (56/170), respectively, in the 10 day group. The adverse events recorded by physicians were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vaginal discharge or itching. In all three categories, the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events (table 4). Self reported adverse events in the patient diary supported the pattern of events recorded by physicians, but with a slightly higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events in both groups (table 4).

Methods

Study design and patients

The study subjects were children aged older than 3 years, who visited pediatric department at two medical institutions in Japan between October 2015 and September 2016 and were suspected of having acute pharyngeal tonsillitis due to a GAS infection. Clinical diagnoses were made on the basis of reference symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, malaise, and headache with acute onset, whereas the physical findings that suggested the infection included prominent pharyngeal redness, tonsil swelling with exudate, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The study subjects underwent rapid antigen testing with ImunoAce StrepA (Tauns, Shizuoka, Japan), using a throat swab and isolation culture tests, in which GAS was detected. Patients with a history of penicillin allergies or those who received antibacterial drugs within the previous 4 weeks were excluded from this study. For all subjects, amoxicillin was administered at a dose of 40 to 50 mg/kg/day with an upper limit of 1000 mg/day, divided into one (QD), two (BID), or three (TID) daily doses, for 10 days. Patient families determined daily times of antibiotic dose administration according to their lifestyle. No antimicrobial agent other than amoxicillin was given to patients enrolled in this study. The main outcomes were the negative rate and a number of GAS copies determined by PCR in throat swabs collected after the start of treatment. Differences in these parameters were compared between QD, BID, and TID regimens. The clinical course after the treatment was examined during outpatient visits at later dates. All subjects were educated as to the symptoms of relapse and complications. They were also instructed to come for re-examination if any of these symptoms were suspected.

Sampling and detection of GAS

Throat swab samples were collected using FLOQ double swabs (Copan, Brescia, Italy) at three time points: during visit 1 (before the start of the treatment), visit 2 (1 to 3 days after the treatment), and visit 3 (9 to 11 days after the treatment). One swab sample was seeded on blood agar medium and cultured at 36 °C for 24–48 h to check for the development of colonies exhibiting β hemolysis. Then, the latex agglutination test (Strept LA, DENKA SEIKEN Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was used to identify GAS. The other swab was cryopreserved at − 80 °C until DNA extraction.

### Preceding group A Streptococcus skin and throat infections are individually associated with acute rheumatic fever: evidence from New Zealand [^fcf985dd]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

In New Zealand, rapid testing for GAS is not recommended, with GAS detected using laboratory swab culturing, which usually requires around 48 hours. Consequently, an empiric antibiotic prescription is recommend for people at high risk of ARF, where GAS pharyngitis is clinically suspected, with the patient instructed to cease taking antibiotics if the throat swab culture result turns out to be GAS negative.When diagnosing ARF, hospitalisation is standard-of-care for all suspected cases. A throat swab is routinely collected as part of the diagnostic workup.Around half of all national ARF cases reside in the Auckland region.An intensive ARF prevention programme has been operating there since 2012, which focuses on sore throat management. Here, throat swab culturing is used to detect GAS pharyngitis, with prompt antibiotic dispensing to treat the infection before ARF occurs, free of charge to eligible individuals.

The high incidence of ARF in the Auckland region of New Zealand and the active sore throat management programme operating in that region, combined with highly integrated, routinely collected administrative health data, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the risk of ARF following a GAS-positive throat or skin swab. The aim of this study was to quantify the risk of ARF following a GAS-positive throat or skin swab by linking routinely collected administrative data.

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^b7c98b51]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Upper respiratory tract infections such as acute pharyngitis represent a substantial portion of the cases seen in primary care. Although the cause of acute pharyngitis in the majority of patients is viral, approximately 5% to 17% is caused by a bacterial infection, often β-haemolytic streptococci. A number of serotypes of β-haemolytic streptococci can cause pharyngitis in humans, however, antibiotics are only recommended in US and UK guidelines for treating patients with group A β-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. Antibiotics reduce the risk of complications (for example, peritonsillar abscess, bacteraemia, acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever), as well as reducing the duration of symptoms and spread of the disease [-].

Throat cultures are currently considered to be the 'reference standard' for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. This test has a number of limitations in practice; it is relatively expensive; the laboratory tests take 1-2 days leading to delays in starting treatment; and excessive false positive results in asymptomatic pharyngeal carriers may lead to over treatment. To enhance the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics without performing cultures on all patients a number of clinical prediction rules (CPRs) have been developed over the last 40 years to distinguish streptococcal pharyngitis from pharyngitis by other causes [-]. CPRs are evidence-based tools that allow clinicians to stratify patients according to their probability of having a particular disorder. They can also be used to provide a rational basis for treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^8dd5df1b]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Defining and documenting throat infection for tonsillectomy candidacy emphasizes accurate episode tracking and required sore throat symptoms. Clinicians are told it is “incumbent … to accurately describe individual episodes of throat infection and to document the frequency of these events,” with “Supportive documentation … [including] absences from school, spread of infection within the family, and a family history of rheumatic heart disease or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.” “The presence of sore throat was a necessary entrance criterion in all randomized controlled trials,” and “no claim can be made that tonsillectomy is effective” if sore throat is absent “even when GABHS is identified.” For children repeatedly positive for GABHS, it “is desirable to rule out streptococcal carriage,” and “streptococcal carriage is strongly suggested by positive strep cultures or other strep tests when the child lacks signs or symptoms of acute pharyngitis.”

### Defining the optimum treatment regimen for azithromycin in acute tonsillopharyngitis [^40b1c163]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting children. Group A streptococci are the leading bacterial cause of pharyngitis in children and adults. Because inappropriate antibiotic treatment for pharyngitis is becoming a major issue, only true group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections, proven by rapid antigen test or culture, should be treated with antibiotics. GABHS pharyngitis is often a mild and self-limiting infection in the absence of antimicrobial therapy. However, antimicrobial treatment must be administered to eradicate the pathogen from the throat, limit the spread of the infection and prevent possible progression to rheumatic fever, suppurative disease or toxin-mediated complications. Penicillin V for 10 days is the standard therapy and is effective in the management of GABHS pharyngitis. However, there are drawbacks to penicillin V therapy, including the length of the dosing regimen, which are leading to decreasing penicillin prescription rates in many countries. In addition bacteriologic treatment failures have been documented in up to 35% of GABHS patients treated with penicillin V, particularly in children <6 years old. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for these failures, but poor compliance with the standard 10-day penicillin treatment is likely to be a major factor. There is growing evidence to suggest that children with GABHS pharyngitis can be effectively treated with non-penicillin V antibiotics, which have the advantage of simpler and shorter dosing regimens compared with penicillin V. Among the antibiotics that have been tested clinically, azithromycin is the most widely studied. A total dose of 60 mg/kg azithromycin, given either as 12 mg/kg once daily for 5 days or 20 mg/kg once daily for 3 days, provides the best rate of GABHS eradication. Thus a total dose of 60 mg/kg azithromycin given during 3 or 5 days constitutes an alternative treatment to standard penicillin therapy in cases of penicillin hypersensitivity, when patient nonadherence to a 10-day penicillin regimen is suspected or for patients who fail therapy with a beta-lactam.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a low prescribing country. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two thirds were labelled as tonsillitis, of which 80% received an antibiotic prescription.Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat, but other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens.The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment.These patients have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus.In Sweden the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days.This duration of treatment is similar to other countries,but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high.The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is mainly to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis.These conditions are currently extremely rare in high income countries.Today the main reason for treatment in high income countries is to speed up clinical resolution of symptoms,but treatment also prevents rare complications such as peritonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.

### A longitudinal study of group A streptococcal colonization and pharyngitis in US children [^bf1527fd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This 2-year longitudinal, prospective, cohort study assessed GAS throat colonization and pharyngitis incidence in US children at 9 clinical sites following the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all parents/legal guardians (with the child’s assent as applicable) prior to study enrollment, following local Institutional Review Board approval of study documents.

Study Participants

Eligible participants were healthy children 3–12 years old at enrollment. Children with a history of culture-confirmed invasive streptococcal disease, RHD, glomerulonephritis, confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis or impetigo within the preceding month, bleeding disorder, known/suspected immunodeficiency condition or receipt of immunoglobulins within the past year were ineligible.

Assessments

At study entry, a physical examination was performed, and a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample were taken.

GAS Pharyngeal Carriage

At healthy visits (months 3, 6, 9 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24), a pharyngeal swab for microbiological culture was obtained. Healthy visits could not occur until ≥6 weeks after any sick visit.

GAS Pharyngitis

An episode of sore throat triggered sick visit 1, which was followed by 2 subsequent sick visits (sick visits 2 and 3), depending on the initial evaluation (Fig. 1 A).

FIGURE 1. 
A: Sequence of sick visits and assessments following a sore throat episode. B: Subject disposition. ICF indicates informed consent form.

Sick visit 1 included physical examination, temperature recording and examination of pharynx, tonsils and cervical nodes. Two throat swabs for rapid antigen detection test (RADT) and culture and a blood sample were collected. Children with pharyngitis and a positive RADT/throat swab culture received antibiotic treatment as per local guidelines and returned for sick visit 2.
Sick visit 2 occurred 7–10 days after antibiotic completion and included a physical examination with examination of pharynx, tonsils and cervical nodes and collection of a throat swab and a blood sample.
Sick visit 3 (convalescent, 4–6 weeks after sick visit 1) included collection of a throat swab for culture and a blood sample.

### Initial antibiotic choice in the treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and return visit rates [^64e8ef08]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Our objectives were to describe the incidence of return visits for children with Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis (ie, clinical treatment failure) and to assess whether initial treatment with amoxicillin or penicillin was associated with the rate of retreatment for GAS pharyngitis.

Methods

This analysis was a retrospective cohort study of 5533 children 0-17 years from a multisite practice. Eligible visits (n = 6585) were associated with a positive test for GAS, receipt of antibiotics within 7 days, no allergies to penicillins or cephalosporins, and no codiagnoses requiring antibiotic treatment. Retreatment for GAS pharyngitis was defined as an index visit followed by another visit within 1-4 weeks. Five hundred episodes (250 treatment failures and 250 controls) were randomly selected for chart review to validate cases.

Results

Amoxicillin or penicillin was the initial antibiotic treatment at 76.1% of visits, and retreatment for GAS pharyngitis occurred after 5.8% of initial visits. Children initially prescribed amoxicillin or penicillin had higher odds of retreatment of GAS pharyngitis even after adjusting for age, sex, symptoms, and community-level covariates such as race, income, and education (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.13).

Conclusions

Retreatment for GAS pharyngitis was uncommon and associated with receipt of amoxicillin or penicillin, although the impact of GAS carriage is unknown. Recommendations for initial treatment of GAS pharyngitis should reflect both individual and societal considerations, including the potential impact on antibiotic resistance in the community.

### Prevalence of group ain primary care patients and the utility of C-reactive protein and clinical scores for its identification in Thailand [^69cb2ee7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

A 2016 Cochrane review compared antibiotic treatment against placebo for sore throats and found some reduction in symptom severity. However, average symptom duration was reduced by only 16 hours.Reducing the risk of complications is often used as a justification for antibiotic treatment, but a large cohort study from 2006 to 2009, albeit from a high-income setting (UK), found the risk of suppurative complications (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy, and cellulitis) to be around 1% with or without antibiotic treatment. There were no cases of acute rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.Nonetheless, these findings may not be applicable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is higher. The 2015 global burden of disease study found a high burden of rheumatic heart disease in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub-Saharan Africa. The burden is lower in Southeast Asia, and Thailand is considered non-endemic for rheumatic heart disease.Current guidelines recommend antibiotics for pharyngitis caused by GAS and that narrow-spectrum penicillins are most suitable. Concern is growing about increasing levels of GAS resistance to macrolide antibiotics.

It is important to identify those most likely to benefit from antibiotic use and to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to limit AMR; to achieve this, a variety of methods have been used, but with limited success. The best current reference standard for diagnosis of GAS is culture, although the length of time required to generate results limits its use to affect management decisions in primary care. Alternatives for use in primary care include rapid antigen testing, clinical scores such as Centor and FeverPAIN, and biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Studies assessing CRP’s performance in identifying the presence of GAS in patients presenting to primary care with sore throats or pharyngitis have produced mixed results, with some studies finding CRP predictive, – whereas others have not.– Rapid molecular tests for GAS are also being developed and have proved valuable in settings such as northern Australia, where a high burden of GAS, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and acute rheumatic fever is evident.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^ed6dc241]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3-4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0-2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3-4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.

### Short-term late-generation antibiotics versus longer term penicillin for acute streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^b20c9500]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The standard duration of treatment for children with acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis with oral penicillin is 10 days. Shorter duration antibiotics may have comparable efficacy.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence regarding the efficacy of two to six days of newer oral antibiotics (short duration) compared to 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration) in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short duration oral antibiotics to standard duration oral penicillin in children aged 1 to 18 years with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors scanned the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations and applied the inclusion criteria. We retrieved included studies in full, and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. The updated search did not identify any new eligible studies; the majority of studies were at high risk of bias. However, the majority of the results were consistent. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment studies had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to -0.14) and throat soreness (MD -0.50 days, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20) or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment studies (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications. Out of 8135 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis, only six cases in the short duration treatment versus eight in the standard duration treatment developed long-term complications in the form of glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64).

Authors' Conclusions

Three to six days of oral antibiotics had comparable efficacy compared to the standard duration 10-day course of oral penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. . In areas where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high, our results must be interpreted with caution.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^a73bb84e]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is commonly caused by the gram positive bacteria, streptococcus. Given the potential morbid complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics are critical. One of the rarer complications is pulmonary-renal syndrome (PRS), defined as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. PRS is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, making swift diagnosis and treatment imperative for survival. More common causes of PRS are tied to autoimmune diseases. This case describes a novel progression of PRS caused by streptococcus. A 26-year-old male with no significant medical history presented to our emergency department with streptococcal group A-positive sore throat. After discontinuing amoxicillin due to pruritus, the patient returned one month later with persisting hematuria and dysuria, diagnosed with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Despite receiving another antibiotic prescription, it was not filled. He returned six days later with worsening symptoms, leading to ICU admission due to hemoptysis requiring subsequent intubation. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was confirmed with bronchial washings. Negative autoimmune laboratory results and clinical symptoms suggest streptococcal pharyngitis induced pulmonary-renal syndrome. Although only the sixth case of streptococcal induced PRS, it is imperative to consider when treating patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, due to its possible mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis is crucial for PRS resolution. Laryngoscope, 135:1940-1942, 2025.

Abstract

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main outcome measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n=433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n=215) or 10 day (n=218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n=181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n=182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n=156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n=165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^4f477fb3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found that penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The bacterial eradication rate was lower in the five day treatment group, but the time to symptom resolution was shorter. We did not find any statistically significant difference in the number of relapses within one month between the groups. At the last follow-up there were fewer new pharyngotonsillitis cases and fewer complications reported in the five day treatment group. Additionally, there were fewer adverse events and shorter durations of adverse events reported in the five day group.

Comparison with other studies

Previous studies have compared long treatment regimens with short treatment regimens with the same daily dosage.In this study, we took into account that the efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration. A similar total daily dose but more frequent dosing regimen would give longer time above the minimum inhibitory concentration and would be more aggressive, therefore treatment would not need to be as long.Interestingly, the sensitivity analysis at fixed time points after randomisation supports the hypothesis that more frequent dosing favours faster resolution of symptoms. However, this difference between the treatment groups equals out towards the test of cure visit, when both groups have been without antibiotic protection for about a week. Therefore, patients with shorter treatment duration might be at slightly higher risk of having an early relapse and need additional antibiotic treatment. It is important to bear in mind that this sensitivity analysis is based on patients’ self assessment of cure rather than physicians’ clinical judgment at test of cure. Additionally, the five day group diaries had a larger portion of missing data than the 10 day group diaries.

Methods

This phase IV, randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority, multicentre study with two parallel groups compared penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days with penicillin V 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days.

Study population and procedures

Consecutive patients with sore throat were assessed for inclusion in the study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 6 years and over with three or four Centor criteria (fever >38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils (for children inflamed tonsils), and absence of cough), and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. These criteria have been used in other studies in which the efficacy of the reference treatment has been established.The Centor criteria and the rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus are well known to primary care physicians in Sweden and have been used for several years in treatment guidelines. Before the start of the study, we did not provide any additional training about the use of Centor criteria or the rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. The primary healthcare centres used the same rapid antigen detection test that they used in their normal clinical practice.

Patients were not eligible for inclusion when they showed signs of serious illness or had hypersensitivity to penicillins; when they were receiving immunomodulating treatment corresponding to at least 15 mg prednisolone; when they had received antibiotics for pharyngotonsillitis in the past month (relapse); or when they had received any antibiotic treatment within 72 hours of inclusion. We recruited patients from 17 primary healthcare centres in urban and rural regions of Sweden: Skåne, Kronoberg, Västra Götaland, and Södermanland.

### Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis: where are we now [^6fde0c6c]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA) is well described, but no diagnostic criteria have been agreed on, and there are no guidelines for management or duration of subsequent penicillin prophylaxis. The case presented here illustrates the non-specific nature of the presenting symptoms, with discussion of its management.

### Role of non-group a streptococci in acute pharyngitis [^9c033d2d]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The role of non-group A streptococci (non-GAS) as pathogens of acute pharyngitis is controversial. Data are limited and conflicting on whether these bacteria are true pathogens of pharyngitis and whether treatment is indicated in all cases or just select cases. However, non-GAS are well-documented as being pathogens of other diseases, including neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis, and urinary tract infections. If non-GAS are pathogens of acute pharyngitis, treatment may speed recovery as well as prevent complications. The objective of this study was to determine whether, in cases of pharyngitis in which non-GAS is identified on culture, the clinical signs and symptoms resemble those of group A streptococcal pharyngitis thus implicating them as true pathogens or if they resemble culture-negative pharyngitis, suggesting these cases are viral in etiology.

Method

This was a 3-group retrospective case-control study (N=915; mean age, 26 years). Cases included all patients with non-GAS identified on culture (n=180). The control group 1 consisted of all patients with GAS infection identified by a rapid strep test or culture (n=145); control group 2 included all patients with a negative rapid strep test and culture (presumed viral pharyngitis; n=584). Multivariate analysis was used to compare the prevalence of 5 clinical features among the groups.

Results

The presence of headache and fever was significantly associated with streptococcal infection, with no difference between GAS and non-GAS infection. Exudates and lymphadenopathy were also significantly associated with both GAS and non-GAS infection compared with viral infection. When 2 criteria were present, the risk of any streptococcal infection rose to 55% (27% for non-GAS or GAS); when 3 or more criteria were present, the rate of any streptococcal infection rose to 81% (non-GAS infection, 34%; GAS infection, 47%).

Conclusion

In this predominantly young, adult population with acute pharyngitis, non-GAS infection was as common as GAS infection and was associated with the same clinical features typically associated with GAS. Although the benefits of treating non-GAS pharyngitis in terms of either symptomatic relief or prevention of sequelae are unproven, clinicians may want to consider treating patients with proven or presumptive non-GAS pharyngitis who fail to respond to symptomatic therapy or who are at increased risk for sequelae of group B or group C streptococcal infections, such as those patients who are or have close contact with pregnant women, neonates, and elderly or immunocompromised persons. Further study is needed to determine whether patients with non-GAS pharyngitis benefit from targeted antibiotic treatment.

### A reappraisal of the minimum duration of antibiotic treatment before approval of return to school for children with streptococcal pharyngitis [^ff3e78c9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a single dose of amoxicillin administered to a symptomatic child with confirmed strep throat might allow the child to return to school as little as 12 hours later.

Methods

We enrolled 111 evaluable children with sore throat plus a positive streptococcal rapid antigen detection test (RADT) as well as a positive result for group A Streptococci (GAS). After throat swab specimens were obtained, all participants received a single dose of amoxicillin (50 mg/kg). Twelve to 23 hours after the first dose of amoxicillin, all participants returned in the morning of day 2 for a second throat swab specimen. At the day 2 visit, a nurse or medical assistant obtained an interval history, tympanic membrane temperature, and a pediatrician or nurse practitioner examined the oropharynx.

Results

On the morning of day 2, only 10 of 111 participants continued to have a positive RADT result, confirmed by overnight throat culture. GAS were not detectable on the day 2 throat specimen by RADT and also by culture in 91% of the study participants (confidence interval: 86-96%). Seven of 10 failures had a marked decrease in number of β-hemolytic colonies, which were 3+ to 4+ on the initial overnight culture plate and decreased to 1+ on the follow-up (obtained on day 2) throat culture plate. Two participants continued to have 3+ or 4+ GAS after incubation of the second throat culture specimen.

Conclusions

Even in the late afternoon, a full dose of amoxicillin (50 mg/kg) administered after notification of positive RADT results for GAS resulted in nondetection of GAS in 91% of children the next morning. All children treated with amoxicillin for "strep throat" by 5 PM of day 1 may, if afebrile and improved, attend school on day 2.

### Severe acute pharyngitis caused by group C Streptococcus [^07932f4a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adult group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis has a prevalence of approximately 5%. It can present with a broad spectrum of severity.

Case Report

We report a 30-year-old woman who presented with severe Group C streptococcal pharyngitis.

Discussion

She presented with a 9-day history of progressive symptoms, including fever, sore throat, neck swelling, and recent onset of hoarseness. In the 9 days before the emergency room (ER) presentation, the patient had visited the ER twice complaining of a sore throat. At both visits, the physicians performed rapid antigen strep testing. Each time her test was negative and the physicians recommended symptomatic therapy. Her symptoms continued to worsen leading to her repeat presentation. At this time she had severe pharyngitis with markedly enlarged tonsils. Neck CT excluded peritonsillar abscess. Rapid strep testing was again negative, but her throat culture grew group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Conclusion

This presentation illustrates the importance of a systematic approach to evaluating patients with negative rapid strep tests and worsening pharyngitis.

### A 7-year-old boy with acute onset of breathing difficulty [^d15cbbc2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a major bacterial pathogen affecting children globally. Approximately 15% of school-age children experience a symptomatic episode of GAS culture-positive pharyngitis each year. Although the incidence of invasive GAS disease under these circumstances is low (0.5%-2%), an increasing number of invasive GAS cases have been reported over the last 2 decades. This report describes a 7-year-old boy who, after being treated for GAS pharyngitis, developed a fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to primary prevention (chronic GAS carriers), IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to recognize that recurrent episodes of pharyngitis in patients with laboratory evidence of group A streptococcal infection may represent either:

- multiple episodes of bona fide recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis at close intervals, or

- multiple episodes of viral pharyngitis in chronic pharyngeal group A streptococcus carriers.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^30936eb8]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and criteria

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients seen at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH) who had a RADT and/or streptococcal throat culture performed in an outpatient setting (hospital-affiliated primary care or urgent care clinic or emergency department [ED]) from August 1, 2011 to July 31, 2012. The first 50 patients meeting inclusion criteria in each month of the study period were evaluated. Patients were excluded if they were < 3 or > 18 years of age, were diagnosed with another bacterial infection during the visit, had a medical condition likely to cause deviation from typical pharyngitis management (e.g. neutropenia, airway compromise), were already taking antibiotics, or had been treated for GAS pharyngitis within the previous 30 days. Patients were also excluded if there was no visit documentation associated with the test; these included patients seen at local pediatric offices that use the BCH laboratory but have separate medical record systems. Information was obtained through review of chart documentation, including notes, vital signs, lab results, and prescriptions. The study was approved by the Committee on Clinical Investigation at BCH.

Data collection

Data abstracted from medical records included information about the visit (month, day of week, time, and location), the patient (age, gender, antibiotic allergies, comorbid illnesses, reason(s) for visit, maximum reported temperature in the previous 48 h, history of cough, concurrent antibiotics, and treatment for GAS pharyngitis within the previous 30 days), physical exam findings (temperature, tonsillar exudate and/or enlargement, cervical lymphadenopathy), test results (RADT, throat culture), and management (including antibiotic prescription details). Statements regarding treatment and management decisions were also recorded.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^83db0753]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is commonly caused by the gram positive bacteria, streptococcus. Given the potential morbid complications of untreated streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics are critical. One of the rarer complications is pulmonary‐renal syndrome (PRS), defined as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. PRS is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, making swift diagnosis and treatment imperative for survival. More common causes of PRS are tied to autoimmune diseases. This case describes a novel progression of PRS caused by streptococcus.

A 26‐year‐old male with no significant medical history presented to our emergency department with streptococcal group A‐positive sore throat. After discontinuing amoxicillin due to pruritus, the patient returned one month later with persisting hematuria and dysuria, diagnosed with post‐streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Despite receiving another antibiotic prescription, it was not filled. He returned six days later with worsening symptoms, leading to ICU admission due to hemoptysis requiring subsequent intubation. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was confirmed with bronchial washings. Negative autoimmune laboratory results and clinical symptoms suggest streptococcal pharyngitis induced pulmonary‐renal syndrome.

Although only the sixth case of streptococcal induced PRS, it is imperative to consider when treating patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, due to its possible mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis is crucial for PRS resolution. Laryngoscope, 135:1940–1942, 2025

### Management of contacts of patients with severe invasive group A streptococcal infection [^1c2ebb61]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Conflicting recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for contacts of patients with invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infection exist. Close contacts of patients with such severe and rapidly progressive disease often strongly appeal to the treating clinicians for antimicrobial treatment to prevent additional cases. We aimed to use an approach based on pharyngeal culture testing of contacts and targeted antibiotic prophylaxis.

Methods

A large throat swab survey including 105 contacts was undertaken after a fulminant and fatal case of GAS necrotizing fasciitis. GAS strains were characterized by emm typing and antimicrobial susceptibility to 7 antibiotics. The presence of 30 virulence determinants was determined by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.

Results

The GAS isolate recovered from the index patient was an M1T1 GAS clone susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. The same clone was present in the throat of 36% of close contacts who had exposure to the index patient (family households and classroom contacts) for >24 hours/week, whereas the strain was present in only 2% of the other contacts.

Conclusions

Although the study does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn as to whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective, we describe a practical approach, including an educational campaign and targeted antibiotic treatment to close contacts who have been exposed to an index patient for > 24 hours/week before the initial disease onset.

### How Connecticut primary care physicians view treatments for streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis [^f5e0dbd9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Inappropriate antibiotic treatment of respiratory infections has been reported to be common; however, the specifics of this inappropriate treatment are not completely defined.

Objective

The aim of this study was to gather data to determine whether physicians consider the national guidelines of treating group A B-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) pharyngitis with penicillin (BID or TID) and not using antibiotics to treat nonstreptococcal pharyngitis.

Methods

In this pilot survey, a 1-page questionnaire was sent to a random sample of Connecticut primary care physicians (PCPs) that included emergency physicians, family physicians, internists, and pediatricians. Two short hypothetical scenarios were presented: (1) an untreated male patient aged 18 years (who is not penicillin allergic) was seen the day before with fever and pharyngitis. He returns because he is still symptomatic and his throat culture (TC) is positive for GABHS; and (2) same scenario but this second patient's TC is negative for GABHS. Physicians were asked how they would treat the patients in both scenarios.

Results

Of the 642 (representing approximately 15% of all Connecticut PCPs) questionnaires sent, 386 (60%) were returned. Seventy-five of the responding physicians had not seen patients with pharyngitis within the last year and were excluded; the following results were from 311 physicians. Scenario 1: 191 of 311 physicians (61%) indicated a willingness to treat the GABHS with penicillin. Pediatricians were significantly less likely, compared with the other PCPs, to prescribe penicillin (P = 0.01) in this scenario. Seventy-seven of the 191 physicians (40%) indicated a willingness to prescribe the penicillin QID. Seven PCPs who responded to scenario 1 did not respond to scenario 2. Scenario 2: 98 of the 304 physicians (32%) indicated a willingness to prescribe antibiotics for the patient with no: streptococcal pharyngitis. Pediatricians were significantly less likely, compared with the other PCPs, prescribe antibiotics for the patient with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis in the second scenario (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

This pilot survey found that 61% of Connecticut PCPs might treat GABHS with penicillin according to existing guidelines although the penicillin might be prescribed QID instead of the recommended BID or TID. Thirty-two percent of these PCPs reported they would use antibiotics to treat non-GABH pharyngitis.

### Macrolide therapy of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 10 days of macrolide therapy (clarithromycin) is more effective in streptococcal eradication than 5 days (azithromycin) [^e61c8ac0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We compared recommended doses of 2 oral macrolide antibiotics (10 days of clarithromycin, 5 days of azithromycin) for eradicating group A streptococci from the throats of individuals aged > or = 12 years with symptomatic pharyngitis and a positive throat culture. Patients received either clarithromycin (250 mg b.i.d. for 10 days [n=260]) or azythromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg q.d. for 4 days [n=265]). Follow-up throat cultures were obtained both at 13--19 days and at 28--38 days. We evaluated 392 patients (median age, 26 years; clarithromycin, 194 patients; azyithromycin, 198 patients). Ten days of clarithromycin therapy was more effective than 5 days of azithromycin therapy in eradicating the organism (91% [176/194] vs. 82% [162/198]; P=.012). More than 97% of all streptococcal isolates were macrolide-sensitive. Whether these bacteriologic eradication rates were the result of the 2 macrolides compared or were due to differences in duration of therapy could not be determined, but the statistically significant difference in eradication of group A streptococci does raise additional questions about shortened courses of macrolide therapy for this common infection.

### A rare sequela of untreated Streptococcus pharyngitis: a case report [^5f926450]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CASE REPORT

A 26‐year‐old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 1‐day history of sore throat. He endorsed recent exposure to a relative diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis. In the ED, a rapid streptococcal Group A nucleic acid amplification test was positive. The patient was prescribed a 10‐day course of amoxicillin and was discharged.

One month later, the patient returned to the ED with persisting sore throat, new cough, and hematuria, having only taken one dose of amoxicillin due to pruritus. He was febrile at 100.5 °F with another positive rapid streptococcal test. Urinalysis revealed significant hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria, and positive nitrites. Complete blood count showed an elevated white blood cell count of 20 K/mcL and a slightly elevated creatine phosphokinase. Based on the lab work and clinical picture, he was diagnosed with post‐streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). He received cefdinir for better tolerance and steroids. The patient was discharged with a 10‐day course of cefdinir and instructed to follow up at the PCP clinic.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^a4f0a238]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CASE STUDY: PHARYNGITIS

One week into the new school year, an 8-year-old girl experiences acute onset of sore throat. Her mother notes the presence of fever (103.5°F) and a bright red throat. The following morning the patient is seen in an urgent care clinic. The health care provider confirms the aforementioned signs and symptoms as well as an abdomen that is slightly tender to palpation. Tonsillar enlargement/exudates and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy are absent. The provider, suspecting acute bacterial pharyngitis, performs a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for group A Streptococcus (GAS)—the result is negative. A throat swab sample is sent to a clinical microbiology laboratory for culture-based confirmation. The mother is informed that a prescription will be provided if the culture is positive. Twenty-four hours later the laboratory notes the presence of β-hemolytic colonies suggestive of GAS embedded within normal flora. The suspicious colonies require subculturing for isolation. At forty-eight hours, isolated colonies are confirmed to be GAS using traditional microbiology methods. The provider receives the positive test result, electronically transmits the antibiotic prescription to the pharmacy of choice and notifies the mother to pick up the prescription. This process delays diagnosis and treatment, which increases the days the child is symptomatic, potentially spreading infection to others, and the risk of infection-associated complications, such as invasive head and neck infection.

This case highlights the challenges experienced by health care providers in outpatient/urgent care clinics and emergency departments that do not have access to rapid, near-patient diagnostic testing. Traditional culture-based confirmatory testing delays patient management by 24 to 48 hours. Even when considering new, state-of-the art clinical microbiology laboratories that incorporate total laboratory automation with real-time monitoring of culture growth and mass spectrometry-based pathogen identification directly from the culture plate, confirmatory testing will take a minimum of 16 hours. This approach, although promoting appropriate antibiotic utilization, negatively impacts operational efficiency of health care organizations, leads to additional school day absences, and lost wages for parents caring for ill children. Due to these testing delays, most physicians treat empirically in the outpatient setting. As such, antibiotic overuse is a much more common problem than delayed treatment or undertreatment.

1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes in adults and pediatric patients 12 years or older. (1)

Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in adults and pediatric patients 12 yrs and older.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of MOXATAG and other antibacterial drugs, MOXATAG should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Once-daily amoxicillin versus twice-daily penicillin V in group A β-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis [^be9f93ef]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatic fever is a preventable chronic disease preceded by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis.

Objective

To test the non-inferiority of once-daily (QD) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice-daily (BID) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis.

Methods

This was a randomised non-inferiority trial carried out in a school-based clinic in New Zealand. Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD (or 750 mg if bodyweight was <or=30 kg) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID (or 250 mg if bodyweight was <or=20 kg) for 10 days. Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence.

Outcome

Eradication of GABHS, determined with follow-up throat cultures on days 3-6, 12-16 and 26-36. GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish bacteriological treatment failures (and relapses) from new acquisitions. Non-inferiority was defined as an upper 95% confidence limit (CL) for the difference in success of eradication in the amoxicillin and penicillin V treatment groups of <or=10%.

Results

353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to amoxicillin (n = 177) or penicillin V (n = 176). The upper 95% CL for the differences in positive cultures between the antibiotics was 4.9% at days 3-6, 6.5% at days 12-16 and 8.5% at days 26-36. Treatment failures (including relapses) occurred at each visit in 5.8%, 12.7% and 10.7% of amoxicillin recipients and 6.2%, 11.9% and 11.3% of penicillin V recipients, respectively. No significant differences in resolution of symptoms were noted between treatment groups. One case of unsubstantiated acute rheumatic fever occurred after 7 days of amoxicillin.

Conclusion

In this adequately powered study, once-daily oral amoxicillin is not inferior to twice-daily penicillin V for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis.

### Signs and symptoms of group A versus non-group A strep throat: a meta-analysis [^484daf68]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Both non-Group A streptococcal (non-GAS) pharyngitis and Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis are commonly found in patients with sore throat. It is not known whether or not they present with similar signs and symptoms compared to patients with non-streptococcal pharyngitis.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated using a bivariate random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for key signs and symptoms.

Results

Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Tonsillar exudate had the highest LR+ for both GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis (1.53 versus 1.71). The confidence intervals of sensitivity, LR+, LR-, and DOR for all signs, symptoms, and the Centor score between two groups overlapped, with the relative difference between sensitivities within 15% for arthralgia or myalgia, fever, injected throat, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar exudate. Larger differences in sensitivities were observed for sore throat, cervical adenopathy, and lack of a cough, although the difference for lack of a cough largely due to a single outlier.

Discussion

Signs and symptoms of patients with GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis are generally similar. No signs or symptoms clearly distinguish GAS from non-GAS infection. Further work is needed to determine whether Group C streptococcus is a pathogen that should be treated.

### Treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with once-daily compared with twice-daily amoxicillin: a noninferiority trial [^381dfff1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Two relatively small previous studies comparing once-daily amoxicillin with conventional therapy for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis reported similar rates of bacteriologic success for each treatment group. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate once-daily amoxicillin for GAS pharyngitis in a larger study.

Methods

In a single pediatric practice, from October through May for 2 consecutive years (2001-2003), we recruited children 3 to 18 years of age who had symptoms and signs suggestive of GAS pharyngitis. Patients with a positive rapid test for GAS were stratified by weight (<40 kg or >or=40 kg) and then randomly assigned to receive once-daily (750 mg or 1000 mg) or twice-daily (2 doses of 375 mg or 500 mg) amoxicillin for 10 days. We determined bacteriologic failure rates for GAS in the pharynx from subsequent swabs taken at 14 to 21 (visit 2) and 28 to 35 (visit 3) days after treatment initiation. We conducted a randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, noninferiority trial to evaluate whether amoxicillin given once daily would have a bacteriologic failure rate no worse than that of amoxicillin given twice daily within a prespecified margin of 10%. GAS isolates were characterized to distinguish bacteriologic failures from new acquisitions. Adverse events were described and adherence was evaluated by review of returned daily logs and dosage bottles.

Results

Of 2139 potential study patients during the 2-year period, we enrolled 652 patients, 326 into each treatment group. Children in the 2 groups were comparable with respect to all demographic and clinical characteristics except that children <40 kg more often presented with rash in each treatment group. At visit 2, failure rates were 20.1% (59 of 294) for the once-daily group and 15.5% (46 of 296) for the twice-daily group (difference, 4.53%; 90% confidence interval [CI], -0.6 to 9.7). At visit 3, failure rates were 2.8% (6 of 216) for the once-daily group and 7.1% (16 of 225) for the twice-daily group (difference, -4.33; 90% CI, -7.7 to -1.0). Gastrointestinal and other adverse events occurred in the once-daily treatment group with a frequency comparable to that in the twice-daily treatment group. Presumed allergic reactions occurred in 0.9% (6 of 635). More than 95% (516 of 541) of patients complied with 10 days of therapy with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions

We conclude that amoxicillin given once daily is not inferior to amoxicillin given twice daily. Gastrointestinal and other events did not occur significantly more often in the once-daily treatment group. From the data in this large, investigator-blinded, controlled study, once-daily amoxicillin appears to be a suitable regimen for treatment of GAS pharyngitis.

### Appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infection in adults: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians and the centers for disease control and prevention [^2001cd74]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for patients with ARTI. This article presents best practices for antibiotic use in healthy adults (those without chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions) presenting with ARTI.

Methods

A narrative literature review of evidence about appropriate antibiotic use for ARTI in adults was conducted. The most recent clinical guidelines from professional societies were complemented by meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized clinical trials. To identify evidence-based articles, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched through September 2015 using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: "acute bronchitis," "respiratory tract infection," "pharyngitis," "rhinosinusitis," and "the common cold."

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should test patients with symptoms suggestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for example, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with antibiotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (>39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening).

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should not prescribe antibiotics for patients with the common cold.

### Nonrheumatic myopericarditis post acute streptococcal pharyngitis: an uncommon cause of sore throat with ST segment elevation [^a75bd9c0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Nonrheumatic myopericarditis is an uncommon complication of acute pharyngitis caused by Group A Streptococcal infection (GAS). While the natural history of carditis complicating acute rheumatic fever is well established, the incidence, pathophysiology and clinical course of nonrheumatic myopericarditis are ill defined. Advances in rapid bedside testing for both myocardial injury and GAS pharyngitis have allowed for increasing recognition of this uncommon complication in patients presenting with a sore throat with associated chest discomfort. We describe a case of a 34years old man with GAS pharyngitis complicated by acute myopericarditis who presented with chest pain, ST segment elevation on electrocardiogram, and elevated cardiac biomarkers.

Clinical cure at test of cure evaluation was 89.6% in the five day group (181/202) and 93.3% in the 10 day group (182/195). The study showed that penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days was non-inferior to penicillin V 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days in the main analysis population (the per protocol population). The point estimate showed a difference in the rate of clinical cure of −3.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2) with advantage to the 10 day intervention group. The results of non-inferiority for the five day treatment were supported by supplementary analyses of the modified intention to treat population with imputed values as clinical cure (table 2). We confirmed the results by using supplementary analyses of the modified intention to treat population with imputed values as not clinical cure; and analyses of the per protocol population when we excluded patients with only telephone follow-up (n=14) and patients outside the follow-up visit window (n=17). For two supplementary analyses, modified intention to treat without imputation (n=403) and when patients who received oral solution of penicillin V by mistake (n=7) were excluded, the 95% confidence interval crossed the non-inferiority line (−10.04 to 1.9 and −10.01 to 2.2, respectively). The patients who received oral solution were all clinically cured.

MITT=modified intention to treat; PP=per protocol.

The sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, performed by assessing the patients’ judgment of being cured at five, seven, and nine days after randomisation, showed a faster resolution in the treatment arm with four daily doses compared with patients who received three daily doses (table 3).

### Penicillin V potasium [^adce40d5]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma.

General

Prescribing penicillin-VK in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

The oral route of administration should not be relied upon in patients with severe illness, or with nausea, vomiting, gastric dilatation, cardiospasm, or intestinal hypermotility.

Occasional patients will not absorb therapeutic amounts of orally administered penicillin.

In streptococcal infections, therapy must be sufficient to eliminate the organism (10-day minimum); otherwise the sequelae of streptococcal disease may occur. Cultures should be taken following completion of treatment to determine whether streptococci have been eradicated.

Prolonged use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including penicillin-VK should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When penicillin-VK is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by penicillin-VK or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Samples were subsequently frozen. Laboratory-based NAATs and sequencing were conducted on the thawed specimens later that same winter.

The overall sensitivity, specificity, and percentage agreement between the different testing methods and the respective 95% CIs (via Clopper–Pearson, exact) were calculated. A minimum enrollment requirement of 60 patients positive for GAS, whereby the lower 95% CI for sensitivity and specificity would be > 90%, was estimated. This cutoff was based on the reported 98.3% sensitivity and 94.2% specificity of the cobas Liat Strep A test and the 97.1% sensitivity and 60.5% specificity of the QuickVue Strep A test (clinical site validation study; data on file) in order to demonstrate a statistically significant performance difference between the 2 tests.

Samples with discordant results were re-tested using the cobas Liat Strep A system because the additional pre-analytic steps (2 vortexing steps and 1 incubation step) required for the reference method increase the likelihood of GAS being detected when low levels of bacteria were present. Low-positive results were monitored by noting the PCR cycle threshold values. Samples with discordant results between the initial cobas Liat Strep A test and the retest were analyzed separately. Bacterial culture was originally defined as the reference method for comparison of the assays; however, due to the unexpectedly low sensitivity rates observed during the study, routine laboratory NAATs were initiated for all samples in addition to culture.

Evaluation of clinical management of GAS using different assays

Although both the POC PCR and RADT assays were performed in real time within the clinic, only 1 assay result was provided to the clinician for patient management—these results were alternated on a weekly basis throughout the study period. Details of the clinical management of the patient based on clinical judgement and the results of the POC test were documented and subsequently collected from the electronic medical record for the entire care episode; differences in antibiotic prescribing (treatment changes, additional tests ordered, hospital admissions, and follow-up appointments) were compared between POC testing methods. The appropriate use of antibiotics was defined as either a final positive GAS result plus initiation of antibiotics or a final negative GAS result and no antibiotics prescribed; all other uses were considered inappropriate. The proportions of appropriate antibiotic use between the 2 management arms (POC PCR and POC RADT plus confirmatory culture) were compared using Fisher’s exact test at a significance level of 0.05.

### Preceding group A Streptococcus skin and throat infections are individually associated with acute rheumatic fever: evidence from New Zealand [^e855a21b]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Statistical analyses

Data analysis was performed using SAS V.9.4, GraphPad Prism V.9.0.0 and Microsoft Excel. Risk of initial ARF hospitalisations per 100 000 swabs were calculated with 95% CIs by culture result. When investigating differences between reported proportions, the χ 2 test was used. Findings were considered statistically significant if p<0.05. The risk ratio (RR) of initial ARF hospitalisation following a GAS-positive throat or skin swab was calculated across specified time periods, demographic and microbiological features. The comparison group was initial ARF hospitalisations for patients with an associated swab that was negative for GAS and group C/G streptococci (‘GAS negative’). Where both a GAS-positive throat swab and a GAS-positive skin swab (14-days either side of one another) preceded initial ARF during the period of interest, these cases were identified and excluded from further analysis.

Our analyses focus on GAS pharyngitis or skin infection where swab collection preceded the initial ARF hospitalisation by 8–90 days for children in the highest risk age group. Restricting analyses to this time period and age group maximised the sensitivity for detecting potentially causative infections.
