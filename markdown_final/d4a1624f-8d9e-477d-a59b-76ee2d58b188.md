## Question

Which antiepileptic medication reverses ALS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiepileptic medication reverses ALS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "reverses ALS" should mean in clinical trials and practice. Then, I need to identify which antiepileptic agents have actually been tested in ALS and the quality of evidence. Next, I will evaluate efficacy and harms agent-by-agent, reconcile with guideline recommendations, ensure I do not misclassify non-antiepileptics like riluzole, and finally synthesize conclusions and clinical implications for care pathways.

> Let me first confirm what constitutes "reversal" of ALS rather than mere slowing; that would require sustained improvement in motor function (e.g. ALSFRS-R increases from baseline), biological restoration (not just transient excitability changes), and survival extension clearly beyond the modest benefit with riluzole; and I need to remember that small short-term "reversals" occur naturally in a minority of patients and are not evidence of disease reversal, so any claim must exceed natural history variability and be shown in controlled trials [^111fwnzT] [^111Uz6s8].

> I will now examine which antiepileptic drugs were actually studied; wait, let me verify the list from the documents: valproic acid, perampanel, gabapentin, and retigabine were evaluated with ALS-relevant outcomes; levetiracetam appears in guidelines for symptom control (cramps), lamotrigine is mentioned historically in the context of antiglutamatergic failures, and lithium carbonate — though not an antiepileptic — was trialed in a similar neuroprotective repurposing framework; I should be careful to keep lithium separate from classical antiepileptics while still considering its negative ALS data [^113VnsEK] [^1136mXED] [^113K4rTD] [^114D454W] [^114ZBgt9] [^114dS6ty].

> Starting with valproic acid, I need to check survival and function endpoints; the randomized sequential trial in 163 patients showed no benefit on survival and no attenuation of ALSFRS-R decline, indicating no disease-modifying effect, much less reversal; importantly, the survival curves did not favor VPA at 12 or 16 months, which argues against any clinically meaningful improvement trajectory [^113VnsEK].

> Perampanel next; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions just because AMPA antagonism targets excitotoxicity; in the phase 2 randomized, double‑blind trial, the 8 mg dose was actually associated with a significantly greater decline in ALSFRS-R, driven by bulbar worsening, and serious adverse events were more frequent; the open‑label pilot in 6 patients was halted due to a high rate of behavioral adverse events; a second report underscores potential detriment at higher doses, so rather than reversal, we see possible harm despite mechanistic appeal [^1136mXED] [^115SvFpz] [^11526QAU].

> For gabapentin, I should double‑check primary and secondary outcomes; the phase III randomized trial with 3,600 mg/day showed no benefit on arm strength decline, no advantage on ALSFRS-R, survival, or other secondary measures, and pooled analyses even suggested a faster decline in FVC in the gabapentin arms, again offering no signal of reversal [^113K4rTD].

> Retigabine is tricky; wait, let me verify the endpoint structure: the crossover study examined acute changes in nerve excitability biomarkers after a single dose and showed reductions in strength‑duration time constant and refractoriness, but this was not a progression or survival study and did not demonstrate sustained symptomatic or functional improvement; I need to ensure we do not mistake acute biomarker shifts for clinical disease reversal, which was not shown here [^114D454W].

> Lithium carbonate deserves mention for completeness; although not an antiepileptic, the phase II historical control study found faster ALSFRS-R decline and more adverse events in the lithium arm, reinforcing the broader pattern that neuromodulatory repurposing attempts have failed to reverse ALS and in some cases worsened trajectories; I should confirm that this aligns with other negative lithium trials referenced by guidelines as lacking benefit [^114dS6ty] [^1172gjot].

> Synthesizing across agents, I see a consistent pattern: antiepileptic drugs tested in ALS have not produced sustained functional improvements or survival advantages beyond standard care, and in some cases produced harm; to avoid overinterpreting noise, I must factor in that small ALSFRS-R "reversals" occur transiently in natural history datasets and are equally present in placebo cohorts, so any true reversal claim would need to exceed these background rates in controlled trials, which has not occurred for antiepileptics [^1136mXED] [^113K4rTD] [^113VnsEK] [^111fwnzT].

> Now, a potential pitfall: at first glance, I might conflate riluzole's sodium channel modulation with an antiepileptic class effect, but wait, I should verify classification; riluzole is not classified as an antiepileptic and confers only modest survival benefit without reversing disease, while edaravone shows benefit in a narrowly defined early ALS subgroup; neither represents an antiepileptic reversing ALS, and both set the benchmark against which putative reversal claims must be judged [^113XNGGB] [^116jnj63].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment; EFNS/AAN‑aligned recommendations explicitly state insufficient evidence for disease modification with agents such as gabapentin and list antiepileptics, when mentioned, primarily for symptom control; levetiracetam may be considered for cramps, and gabapentin can be considered for distressing fasciculations, but these are symptomatic strategies, not disease reversal endorsements; more recent EAN guidance continues to focus on comprehensive multidisciplinary and palliative planning rather than proposing antiepileptics as disease‑reversing therapies [^1172gjot] [^114ZBgt9] [^117N3Taa] [^114i3g2u].

> Therefore, I should conclude clearly: no antiepileptic medication has been demonstrated to reverse ALS; randomized trials of valproic acid and gabapentin were negative, perampanel at higher doses worsened ALSFRS‑R and was poorly tolerated, and mechanistic or biomarker‑level effects such as those seen with retigabine have not translated into sustained clinical benefit; current disease‑modifying management relies on riluzole and carefully selected edaravone use, with antiepileptics reserved, when used at all, for specific symptom control within multidisciplinary care frameworks [^113VnsEK] [^113K4rTD] [^1136mXED] [^114D454W] [^113XNGGB] [^116jnj63].

No, there is **no seizure medication** that reverses ALS [^1172gjot]. Riluzole, the only approved ALS drug, modestly prolongs survival but **does not reverse disease**. Antiseizure drugs such as gabapentin [^113K4rTD], valproic acid [^113VnsEK], and perampanel [^1136mXED] have been tested and have not demonstrated benefit in ALS. Retigabine acutely reduces motor neuron hyperexcitability [^114D454W] but has not demonstrated clinical reversal of ALS. ALS remains a progressive, fatal disease with **no cure or reversal** from any medication.

---

## Current ALS treatments and their effects

Among current treatments, **Riluzole** is the only approved medication for ALS, modestly prolonging survival by about 2–3 months [^114XyEcM]; it **does not reverse disease progression**. Edaravone is an antioxidant that may slow functional decline in early-stage ALS [^116jnj63] but **does not reverse the disease**.

---

## Seizure medications studied in ALS

Several **seizure medications** have been studied for potential therapeutic effects in ALS, including [^1148mYLR]:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical trial outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Gabapentin | - GABA analog <br/> - Reduces excitatory neurotransmission | - No benefit [^113K4rTD] <br/> - Faster FVC decline in treated patients |
| Valproic acid | - GABAergic <br/> - Histone deacetylase inhibitor | No survival or functional benefit [^113VnsEK] |
| Perampanel | AMPA receptor antagonist | - No benefit <br/> - Possible harm at high doses [^1136mXED] |
| Retigabine | - Potassium channel opener <br/> - Reduces hyperexcitability | - Acute reduction in hyperexcitability [^114D454W] [^1156tDJi] <br/> - No clinical reversal demonstrated |

## Detailed analysis of seizure medications

### Gabapentin

Gabapentin, a GABA analog, was evaluated in a phase III randomized trial of 204 patients with ALS [^113K4rTD]. There was **no significant difference** in the rate of decline in muscle strength, vital capacity, survival, or ALS functional rating scale scores between gabapentin and placebo. Additionally, a pooled analysis of phase II and III trials showed a significantly faster decline in forced vital capacity with gabapentin.

---

### Valproic acid

Valproic acid, a GABAergic medication and histone deacetylase inhibitor, was evaluated in a randomized sequential trial of 163 patients with ALS [^113VnsEK]. It showed no significant effect on survival or functional decline, indicating **no therapeutic benefit**.

---

### Perampanel

Perampanel, an AMPA receptor antagonist, was studied in a randomized phase 2 clinical trial involving 66 ALS patients [^1136mXED]. The trial found **no evidence of neuroprotective effects**; at higher doses, perampanel was associated with a significant decline in ALS functional rating scale scores, particularly worsening bulbar function, suggesting potential harm.

---

### Retigabine

Retigabine, a potassium channel opener, was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial involving 18 ALS patients [^114D454W]. The study demonstrated significant, acute reductions in motor neuron hyperexcitability, a pathogenic feature of ALS; however, this **did not translate into clinical reversal**. Longer-term studies are needed to evaluate its impact on disease progression and survival.

---

## Conclusion

No seizure medication has been shown to **reverse ALS** [^1172gjot]. Riluzole remains the only approved medication, modestly prolonging survival without **reversing disease progression**. Seizure medications such as gabapentin, valproic acid, and perampanel [^1136mXED] have not demonstrated therapeutic benefits in ALS, and some may even be detrimental. Retigabine reduces motor neuron hyperexcitability [^114D454W] but has not shown clinical reversal. ALS remains a progressive, fatal disease with no medication proven to cure or reverse it [^11623hjL] [^115dU7RU].

### Acute effects of riluzole and retigabine on axonal excitability in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^114D454W]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Increased excitability of motor neurons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be a relevant factor leading to motor neuron damage. This randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover, placebo-controlled study evaluated peripheral motor nerve excitability testing as a biomarker of hyperexcitability and assessed the effects of riluzole and retigabine in 18 patients with ALS.

We performed excitability testing at baseline and twice after participants had received a single dose of either 100 mg riluzole, 300 mg retigabine, or placebo. Between- and within-day repeatability was at least acceptable for 14 out of 18 recorded excitability variables. No effects of riluzole on excitability testing were observed, but retigabine significantly decreased strength-duration time constant (9.2%) and refractoriness at 2 ms (10.2%) compared to placebo.

Excitability testing was shown to be a reliable biomarker in patients with ALS, and the acute reversal of previously abnormal variables by retigabine justifies long-term studies evaluating the impact on disease progression and survival.

### Randomized sequential trial of valproic acid in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113VnsEK]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

To determine whether valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that showed antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties and reduced glutamate toxicity in preclinical studies, is safe and effective in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using a sequential trial design, the following methodology was applied.

Between April 2005 and January 2007, 163 ALS patients received VPA 1,500 mg or placebo daily. The primary endpoint was survival, while the secondary outcome measure was the decline of functional status measured by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale. Analysis was conducted by intention to treat and according to a sequential trial design. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00136110).

Results showed that VPA did not affect survival. The cumulative survival probability was 0.72 in the VPA group (standard error [SE], 0.06) compared to 0.88 in the placebo group (SE, 0.04) at 12 months, and 0.59 in the VPA group (SE, 0.07) versus 0.68 in the placebo group (SE, 0.08) at 16 months. Additionally, the rate of decline of functional status was not affected by VPA intake, and no serious adverse reactions were caused by VPA.

These findings suggest that VPA, at a dose used in epilepsy, does not exhibit a beneficial effect on survival or disease progression in ALS patients. This has implications for future trials involving histone deacetylase inhibitors in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The use of a sequential trial design allowed for the inclusion of only half the number of patients required for a classic trial design and prevented patients from unnecessarily continuing potentially harmful study medication.

### Randomized phase 2 study of perampanel for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1136mXED]. Journal of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of perampanel in patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS), this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 clinical study was conducted at 12 sites. Patients with probable or definite ALS, as defined by revised El Escorial criteria, were enrolled. Sixty-six patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive placebo, 4 mg perampanel, or 8 mg perampanel daily for 48 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the trial period. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score after 48 weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: One patient withdrew before starting the treatment. Of 65 patients included, 18 of 22 patients randomized to placebo (82%), 14 of 22 patients randomized to 4 mg perampanel (64%), and 7 of 21 patients randomized to 8 mg perampanel (33%) completed the trial. There was a significant difference in the change of ALSFRS-R scores [-8.4 (95% CI -13.9 to -2.9); p = 0.015] between the placebo and the perampanel 8 mg group, primarily due to worsening of the bulbar subscore in the perampanel 8 mg group. Serious AEs were more frequent in the perampanel 8 mg group than in the placebo group (p = 0.0483).

- **Conclusions**: Perampanel was associated with a significant decline in ALSFRS-R score and was linked to worsening of the bulbar subscore in the 8 mg group.

### Phase III randomized trial of gabapentin in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113K4rTD]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Preclinical and clinical studies of gabapentin in patients with ALS led the authors to undertake a phase III randomized clinical trial.

- **Methods**: Patients were randomly assigned, in a double-blinded fashion, to receive oral gabapentin 3,600 mg or placebo daily for 9 months. The primary outcome measure was the average rate of decline in isometric arm muscle strength for those with two or more evaluations.

- **Results**: Two hundred four patients enrolled, 196 had two or more evaluations, and 128 patients completed the study. The mean rate of decline of the arm muscle strength was not significantly different between the groups. Moreover, there was no beneficial effect upon the rate of decline of other secondary measures (vital capacity, survival, ALS functional rating scale, timed walking) nor was there any symptomatic benefit. Analysis of the combined data from the phase II and III trials revealed a significantly more rapid decline of forced vital capacity in patients treated with gabapentin.

- **Conclusion**: These data provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of gabapentin on disease progression or symptoms in patients with ALS.

### European Academy of Neurology (EAN) guideline on the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in collaboration with European Reference Network for Neuromuscular Diseases (ERN EURO-NMD) [^1148mYLR]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The guideline mapping effort identified the NICE ALS guideline, which also used the GRADE methodology and contained overlapping research questions. The guideline from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) did contain overlapping research questions, but it did not use the GRADE methodology. Several research questions were not yet covered in the NICE ALS guideline and the AAN ALS guideline as they deal with new treatment options in the field.

The research questions were divided into nine sections, with 26 individual review questions, including three questions with subquestions.

- **Research questions and results**: For eight research (or sub-) questions, we adapted evidence from existing NICE recommendations. For eight questions, we used evidence from existing systematic reviews or updated existing systematic reviews, and for 16, we conducted a review de novo. Of these, seven of the conducted reviews were empty, and the recommendations are based on expert opinion.

An extensive overview of the research questions, the evidence, the EtD, and justifications for the recommendations can be found in Online Supplement S1. An overview of the evidence, the risk of bias assessment, the data analysis, and the GRADE summary of findings is available in Online Supplement S2.

Abbreviations: ADOLOPMENT, approach that combines adoption, adaptation, and de novo development of recommendations; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; GRADE, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

### Can we eliminate placebo in ALS clinical trials [^1112BKN1]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease with limited treatment options. Controlled studies are a necessary part of Phase II and Phase III assessments of proposed therapies. Due to the relatively small number of patients with ALS, several study designs have been proposed to improve the efficiency of Phase II studies. Some of these advocate the use of historical controls in place of placebo controls. However, the characteristics of historical controls may not mirror those of patients in the treatment group. Novel study designs can be used to decrease the number of patients required for Phase II studies. The use of placebo controls rather than historical controls in these novel study designs likely leads to better predictions of treatments that will be successful in Phase III studies. There is general agreement on the necessity of placebo controls in Phase III studies.

### Structural basis for the rescue of hyperexcitable cells by the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug riluzole [^117S9nbn]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Neuronal hyperexcitability is a key element of many neurodegenerative disorders, including the motor neuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), where it occurs associated with elevated late sodium current (Iₙₐₗ). Iₙₐₗ results from incomplete inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) after their opening and shapes physiological membrane excitability. However, dysfunctional increases can cause hyperexcitability-associated diseases.

- **Mechanism of action**: Here we reveal the atypical binding mechanism which explains how the neuroprotective ALS-treatment drug riluzole stabilizes VGSCs in their inactivated state to cause the suppression of Iₙₐₗ that leads to reversed cellular overexcitability. Riluzole accumulates in the membrane and enters VGSCs through openings to their membrane-accessible fenestrations. Riluzole binds within these fenestrations to stabilize the inactivated channel state, allowing for the selective allosteric inhibition of Iₙₐₗ without the physical block of Na+ conduction associated with traditional channel pore-binding VGSC drugs.

- **Application to disease variants**: We further demonstrate that riluzole can reproduce these effects on a disease variant of the non-neuronal VGSC isoform Nav1.4, where pathologically increased Iₙₐₗ is caused directly by mutation.

Overall, we identify a model for VGSC inhibition that produces effects consistent with the inhibitory action of riluzole observed in models of ALS. Our findings will aid future drug design and support research directed towards riluzole repurposing.

### Antioxidant treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / motor neuron disease [^115EJXyB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Free radical accumulation and oxidative stress have been proposed as contributing factors to the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease. A range of antioxidant medications are available and have been studied.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of antioxidant medication in the treatment of people with ALS.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (July 2003), MEDLINE (from January 1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (from January 1980 to July 2003), and other sources.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of antioxidant treatment for ALS were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria, assessed study quality, and two reviewers performed independent data extraction.

- **Main results**: The search identified 21 studies for consideration, but only eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Only two studies used our predetermined primary outcome measure (survival at 12 months of treatment). Sufficient data were available from three studies to allow analysis of the primary outcome measure, and a meta-analysis was performed. In the individual studies, no significant effect was observed from vitamin E 500 mg twice daily; acetylcysteine 50 mg/kg daily subcutaneous infusion; or a combination of L-methionine 2 g, vitamin E 400 IU, and selenium 3 × 10⁻⁵ g three times daily (Alsemet). No significant effect on the primary outcome measure was observed in a meta-analysis of antioxidants.

### Are generic drugs really inferior medicines [^114h1ooT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

In this issue, Gagne et al. report an elegant case-crossover study of seizures in patients on antiepileptic drugs. They found that a dispensation episode approximately triples the risk of having a seizure within 21 days, but the risk is not statistically different whether the dispensation was of the same brand-name or generic drug as previously used, or a switch from brand-name to a generic or from a generic to a brand name. The cause of the seizure might be a delay in taking medication or late redispensation, among others, but apparently, the nature of the product dispensed is not relevant in this study; this may alleviate some of the concerns about generic drugs and epilepsy.

### EFNS guidelines on the clinical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MALS) - revised report of an EFNS task force [^114ZBgt9]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, specifically in the management of muscle cramps, the EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend considering the use of levetiracetam for patients with ALS. If levetiracetam is unsuccessful or causes side effects, consider offering quinine sulfate (200 mg BID) as an alternative.

### A placebo arm is not always necessary in clinical trials of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^111dT8AE]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Riluzole is currently the only approved medication for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While other potential neuroprotective agents have been tested in clinical trials, none has been effective, and few symptomatic treatments have been studied. Randomized placebo-controlled trials are necessary to establish the effectiveness of a drug, but an increasing number of potential therapies combined with limited resources means that only a few drugs at a time can be tested for efficacy in ALS. Therefore, priority must be given to agents that show an advantage in early phase trials before proceeding to Phase III efficacy trials.

New strategies are being used to screen different agents, along with their correct dose, in a variety of neurological illnesses, including ALS. Early phase trial designs conducted without a placebo arm improve efficiency, reduce cost, and appeal to patients. Dose-ranging, futility, and selection trials are examples of Phase I and II trial designs that can be conducted without placebo groups.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^116N1y6e]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, particularly in the management of sialorrhea, the American College of Chest Physicians 2023 guidelines recommend considering a therapeutic trial of an anticholinergic medication as first-line therapy. Continued use should occur only if the benefits outweigh the side effects, for the management of sialorrhea in patients with neuromuscular diseases.

### Oral edaravone demonstrated a favorable safety profile in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis after 48 weeks of treatment [^112W32ow]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). High credibility.

Adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment were monitored throughout the study. A total of six treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to death were reported during the first 24 weeks, and 13 TEAEs leading to death in 12 patients were recorded during the 48-week treatment period. By week 48, TEAEs leading to death were reported as follows: respiratory failure (n = 4), worsening of ALS (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), with the following reported by one patient each: acute respiratory failure, lung disorder, diabetic ketoacidosis, feeding disorder, and suicide. None of the TEAEs leading to death were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

By weeks 24 and 48, 36 (19.5%) and 46 (24.9%) patients, respectively, reported TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. By week 24, the most common TEAEs related to the study drug were fatigue (n = 6), dizziness (n = 5), headache (n = 4), and nausea (n = 3). By week 48, the most common TEAEs related to the study drug were fatigue (n = 6), dizziness (n = 5), headache (n = 4), and constipation (n = 4). No serious TEAEs related to the study drug were reported during the 48-week study period.

As expected, forced vital capacity (FVC) gradually declined during the study period. The baseline mean FVC was 93.0% ± 15.4%, and 46 patients (24.9%) had FVC < 80% of predicted at baseline. The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in FVC at week 24 was −11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: −14.5%, −9.2%), and at week 48 was −25.1% (95% CI: −28.9%, −21.2%).

No trends were observed in the number of patients with shifts from normal to abnormal values for most safety laboratory assessments.

Regarding the medical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, specifically in the management of excessive bronchial secretions, the EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend considering the use of combinations of β-blockers and a nebulizer with saline and/or anticholinergic bronchodilators, mucolytics, and/or furosemide. Mucolytics should be offered only if sufficient cough flow is present.

Regarding medical management for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, specifically in managing dyspnea, the EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend relieving anxiety and offering lorazepam (0.5–2.5 mg sublingually) for short dyspneic bouts. For longer phases of dyspnea lasting more than 30 minutes, morphine (2.5 mg PO or SC) is recommended.

### Early initiation of riluzole may improve absolute survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112FgBFv]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

It could be suggested that inferences of this analysis are trivial and do not change practice. We argue that they are meaningful. First, our observations provide a useful estimate of the magnitude of survival gain from early treatment. More importantly, a strong argument for early treatment, and therefore, for urgent diagnosis of ALS is made. This argument applies to riluzole, and potentially also to other treatments.

### Tauroursodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114XyEcM]. European Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment of upper and lower motor neurons. Degeneration of lower motor neurons leads to progressive muscular atrophy. A number of complex biochemical and regulatory pathways are probably involved in the pathogenesis of ALS, and these different pathways interact with each other, eventually leading to selective cell death or apoptosis. In addition, recent evidence suggests a role for mitochondrial dysfunction.

The development of a disease-modifying therapy that may reverse the progression of disability is a high priority in ALS research. Thus far, only riluzole has shown a modest disease-modifying efficacy, as it prolonged survival by three months after 18 months of treatment. Unfortunately, the benefit is modest, leading to an increase in survival of perhaps 10%–20%.

Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a hydrophilic bile acid that is normally produced endogenously in humans in the liver, through the conjugation of taurine to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). It is commonly used for treatment of chronic cholestatic liver diseases and for gallstones. TUDCA possesses many additional ancillary features, including the inhibition of mitochondrial-associated apoptosis through different mechanisms. Results of experimental studies suggest that the cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic action of TUDCA may be responsible for potential neuroprotective activity for a variety of chronic neurodegenerative conditions.

### How common are ALS plateaus and reversals [^111fwnzT]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Figure 1 shows longitudinal ALSFRS changes. Over longer intervals, fewer participants were available for analysis. For the 6-month analysis, there were 3,132 participants available, and 25% did not decline. For the 12-month analysis, there were 2,105 participants available, and 16% did not decline. For the 18-month analysis, there were 1,218 participants available, and 7% did not decline. ALS plateaus, especially of short duration, are thus not uncommon.

- **Figure 1**: Natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progression in PRO-ACT. These histograms show the natural history of Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) participants' Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Score (ALSFRS) changes at intervals of 6 months (A), 12 months (B), and 18 months (C).

- **ALS reversals**: Least-squares analysis showed that 14% of 1,343 participants had a 180-day interval where their ALSFRS-R slope was greater than zero. Plotting periods of ALSFRS-R improvements of 1–4 points vs the length of those periods out to 360 days confirmed that small ALS reversals are not uncommon, especially over shorter follow-up intervals (data not shown). Large sustained ALS reversals, however, are rare. Fewer than 1% of patients with ALS ever experienced reversals of 4 or more ALSFRS-R points lasting 12 months. Repeating these analyses in only placebo-treated participants showed no significant differences in the frequencies of ALS reversals, thus these are unlikely to be related to a previously undetected treatment effect.

### Treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — what is the next step [^114cfCmB]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease which was thought to be untreatable. However, recent evidence in both experimental animals and men indicates that antiglutamatergic strategies are the first to have an influence on its pathogenesis and slow down the disease process. Since the effect of drugs is still small, this progress cannot only be seen as a success of the present but must also be acknowledged as a basis for future developments.

- **Designing future studies**: Future studies will need to consider the presumably long preclinical period of the disease and utilize a number of novel compounds and treatment strategies that have shown effectiveness in transgenic animal models. This approach suggests that a combination of therapies is likely to be used, with an emphasis on early treatment.

- **Clinical attitude and diagnosis**: Early treatment will necessitate a novel clinical attitude toward the diagnosis of ALS and the development of new markers for both the preclinical period and the longitudinal course of the disease.

### The management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113zNA4F]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The terms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND) refer to a condition characterized by motor system degeneration with relative preservation of other pathways. Although there have been advances in symptomatic treatment, ALS remains an incurable condition. Advances in ALS management prolong survival but simultaneously raise challenging ethical dilemmas for physicians, patients, and their families. This review examines practice in the management of ALS, including pharmacological treatment, nutritional management, respiratory care, and evolving strategies in the management of cognitive impairment.

Regarding the medical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, particularly therapies lacking evidence of benefit, the EFNS 2012 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the following:

- **Vitamins and antioxidants**: Vitamins, testosterone, antioxidants (such as co-enzyme Q-10, ginkgo biloba)

- **Immunotherapies and peptides**: IVIG, cyclosporin, interferons, glatiramer acetate, KDI tripeptide

- **Neurotrophic factors**: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, IGF-1, mecasermin rinfabate

- **Other therapies**: Ceftriaxone, creatine, gabapentin, minocycline, stem cells, lithium

### Canadian best practice recommendations for the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^117M7nFY]. CMAJ (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, specifically with respect to follow-up, the ALSSC 2020 guidelines recommend regularly reviewing medications and considering discontinuation of any nonessential medications. Symptom management medications should be continued. Primary prevention medications should be discontinued if their duration of effect is longer than the expected survival. Statins should be considered for discontinuation based on the patient's expected survival and cardiovascular risks.

### Medication use and risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-a systematic review [^111oD2KH]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Although there is currently no strong evidence to link any medications with a higher risk of ALS, it appears that statins, aspirin, OCs/HRT, antihypertensives, and antidiabetics are unlikely to be related to a higher risk of ALS. This might provide evidence for the continued use of these medications among individuals at high risk of ALS. However, interpretation of these results should be done with caution, as most of the studies examined broad categories of these medications, leaving the potentially harmful role of specific drug classes unraveled.

The positive association noted for antibiotics, antidepressants, and skeletal muscle relaxants might, on the other hand, be attributable to prodromal ALS symptoms or reverse causation due to diagnostic delay.

### Medication use and risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-a systematic review [^115sdM67]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Globally, approximately 4.5 per 100,000 people live with this disease, and 1.9 per 100,000 are newly diagnosed with ALS each year. As there is currently no effective treatment, patients with ALS typically die within 3–5 years after the onset of symptoms. The cause of ALS remains unknown; however, various risk factors have been proposed. Established risk factors include older age, male gender, family history, and specific genetic mutations.

A significant area of research in ALS focuses on medication use, aiming to enhance the understanding of disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets, such as through drug repurposing. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature to provide a comprehensive view of the knowledge concerning the roles of different medication uses on the subsequent risk of ALS.

### Biomarker discovery and development for frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114UeFMW]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

- **Neurofilament heavy chain**: As the NfH chain is phosphorylated, most studies have targeted phosphorylated NfH (pNfH). CSF pNfH has been shown to be elevated in frontotemporal dementia compared to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pNfH was elevated in serum, plasma, and CSF. In this study, pNfH levels in all biofluids positively correlated with increases in disease progression. Both NfL and pNfH are also elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis CSF and serum before symptom onset from nine months to 3.5 years. Receiver operating characteristics showed that CSF pNfH could differentiate amyotrophic lateral from amyotrophic lateral mimics. While further research is required, pNfH exhibits promise as a biomarker for both frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

- **Neurofilament medium chain**: NfM is the least explored neurofilament biomarker so far. A recent study, based on antibody-suspension bead arrays, demonstrated that NfM is elevated in frontotemporal dementia CSF. Furthermore, in an earlier study, high levels of NfM were observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis plasma. Further research is required to establish any potential utility of NfM as a biomarker for frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Review [^117NGmG7]. Seminars in Neurology (2015). High credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease associated with a wide range of symptoms and genetic factors. It can manifest as nasal speech, frontotemporal dementia, and TARDBP gene mutations. Typically, it affects individuals aged 55–75 years. Common symptoms include muscle fasciculations, emotional lability, hyporeflexia, dysphagia, malnutrition, and apathy. Patients may experience muscle spasms, morning headaches, and behavioral or personality changes.

- **Respiratory symptoms**: ↓ O2 saturation, orthopnea, dyspnea, and increased PaCO2.
- **Neurological symptoms**: Tongue fasciculations, increased jaw jerk reflex, dysarthria, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and cognitive impairment, potentially leading to a loss of empathy.
- **Genetic associations**: SOD1, FUS, and ANG gene mutations.
- **Muscular symptoms**: Muscle weakness, atrophy, cramps, and Beevor's sign. Both upper and lower motor neuron lesions contribute to these symptoms.
- **Psychological symptoms**: Depression, anxiety, speech disturbances, and fatigue.
- **Challenges in daily living**: Difficulty in chewing, dysphagia, speech disturbance, and falls.

Additionally, the condition can cause sleeping disorders leading to excessive daytime sleepiness, along with hyperreflexia and a tendency for rapid weight loss. Elevated serum neurofilament light chain is another associated biomarker.

### How do we get from hyperexcitability to excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1156tDJi]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

It has become increasingly evident that a key pathophysiological event in the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the induction of hyperexcitability of the motor cortex. Studies of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have converged upon the conclusion that early motor cortex hyperexcitability, as defined by measures of cortical network function — such as reduced short intracortical inhibition and increased motor evoked potential amplitude — is a pathogenic feature. Such findings have significantly contributed to our understanding of this rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease and have strengthened support for the 'dying forward' hypothesis. This hypothesis traditionally describes pathological spread as a feed-forward process that relies on glutamate excitotoxicity (see Shaw and Ince and King et al. for more detailed reviews).

Much attention has been turned towards the development of therapies that aim to suppress activation of neurons by glutamate as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, apart from riluzole, most of these treatments have failed to extend patient lifespans or effectively treat their symptoms. Despite frequent glimmers of hope, the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research field has a history of therapeutic trials targeting excitotoxicity that fail to reach efficacy, beginning with lamotrigine and dextromethorphan close to 30 years ago. There are many possible explanations for why the efficacy of new treatments targeting glutamate-mediated hyperexcitability is not consistently effective, such as the long delay.

### Efficacy and safety of ravulizumab, a complement C5 inhibitor, in adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A randomized clinical trial [^115dU7RU]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

- **Participant disposition**: Figure 1 shows the participant disposition. Other reasons for exclusion included withdrawn consent, not meeting the 28-day screening period, having Candida albicans of the tongue, gastrointestinal disturbance, leukemia and neutropenia, or not being provided with medication in the sponsor's window period.

- **Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the full analysis set population**: Overall function, as assessed by mean (SD) total ALSFRS-R score, was 36.1 (5.2) points for the ravulizumab group and 35.4 (5.0) points for the placebo group. Mean respiratory function, measured by mean (SD) SVC percent predicted, was 84.5% (16.0%) for the ravulizumab group and 84.5% (15.3%) for the placebo group. Most participants had received riluzole treatment prior to screening (ravulizumab group, 223 [87.5%]; placebo group, 110 [86.6%]), while a smaller proportion had received edaravone (ravulizumab group, 36 [14.1%]; placebo group, 18 [14.2%]). The mean (SD) baseline progression rate of ALSFRS-R was similar between treatment groups (ravulizumab group, −0.7 [0.5] points; placebo group, −0.7 [0.4] points). Mean (SD) baseline NfL levels were 90.5 (73.10) pg/mL for the ravulizumab group and 81.7 (50.02) pg/mL for the placebo group.

### Disease modification in partial epilepsy [^114CL5XA]. Brain (2002). Low credibility.

With the growth in antiepileptic drug treatment, the question arises as to what extent we are merely treating the symptom (i.e. the seizures) rather than the underlying disease process (i.e. epileptogenesis). Epileptogenicity can be considered as the process whereby structural and functional changes occur following an insult that, in some cases, result in epilepsy. Epileptogenicity also describes some of the changes and processes that contribute to the progression observed in some epilepsies.

These processes have been modeled in animals mostly by the kindling model of epilepsy, in which repetition of subconvulsive stimuli results in a progressive epileptic state and eventually leads to spontaneous seizures. However, it is not clear that kindling has a human correlate. Therefore, models in which an initial insult (status epilepticus, hyperthermia, hypoxia, trauma) is followed by the development of a lowered seizure threshold and, in some instances, spontaneous seizures have been used.

These models seem to support the "second hit" hypothesis, in which there is an initial insult resulting in a lowered seizure threshold, followed by a later insult, the "second hit", that results in the expression of epilepsy. These models also support the concept of a latent period during which there could be targeted therapies to prevent the epileptogenic process. Although the occurrence of neuronal damage is one such target, neuronal damage is not necessary for epileptogenesis, and other mechanisms are at play.

At present, it is not known whether targeted therapies may also affect compensatory processes.

### Rethinking phase 2 trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116LCdsC]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

These observations should warrant careful reflection on the optimal duration of phase 2 trials, including both placebo-controlled and open-label extension (OLE) periods. While the optimal duration is unknown and will almost certainly vary based on the selected primary and secondary outcome measures, we suggest that phase 2 trials of 6 months' duration are likely sufficient when go/no-go decisions will be driven primarily by biomarker data. However, it may be prudent to extend the duration of the double-blind phase beyond 6 months if the intent is to rely primarily on clinical outcome measures such as the ALSFRS-R. Additionally, selection biases and loss to follow-up occurring in the OLE period could be minimized by combining the double-blind and extension periods into a single study protocol. This approach would remove the need to reconsent patients after switching treatments.

### High-fat and ketogenic diets in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113cG1HS]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Epidemiologic data suggest that malnutrition is a common feature in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and being overweight or obese confers a survival advantage in this patient population. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse models, a high-fat diet has been shown to lead to weight gain and prolonged survival. However, little research has been conducted to test whether nutritional interventions might ameliorate the disease course in humans. Here, we review the currently available evidence supporting the potential role of dietary interventions as a therapeutic tool for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Ultimately, determining whether a high-fat or ketogenic diet could be beneficial in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis will require large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.

### Lamictal [^1151mjUz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

One trial (n = 216) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 24-week treatment period. Patients could not be on more than two other anticonvulsants, and valproate was not allowed. Patients were randomized to receive either a placebo, a target dose of 300 mg/day of Lamictal, or a target dose of 500 mg/day of Lamictal. The median reductions in the frequency of all partial-onset seizures relative to baseline were 8% in patients receiving placebo, 20% in patients receiving 300 mg/day of Lamictal, and 36% in patients receiving 500 mg/day of Lamictal. The seizure frequency reduction was statistically significant in the 500 mg/day group compared with the placebo group, but not in the 300 mg/day group.

A second trial (n = 98) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 14-week treatment periods (the last two weeks of which consisted of dose tapering) separated by a 4-week washout period. Patients could not be on more than two other anticonvulsants, and valproate was not allowed. The target dose of Lamictal was 400 mg/day. When the first 12 weeks of the treatment periods were analyzed, the median change in seizure frequency was a 25% reduction on Lamictal compared with placebo (P < 0.001).

### Reldesemtiv in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Results from the COURAGE-ALS randomized clinical trial [^111ffKkw]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

- **Change in ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R)**: During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of the trial, there were 15 deaths, with 9 (2.8%) in the reldesemtiv group and 6 (3.7%) in the placebo group. Through weeks 24 to 48, an additional 15 deaths (4.6%) occurred in those originally assigned to reldesemtiv, and 6 deaths (3.7%) occurred in those originally assigned to the placebo group. The most common cause of death was respiratory failure/arrest (12 [2.5%]), followed by assisted suicide/euthanasia (9 [1.9%]) and ALS (7 [1.4%]). Notably, no deaths were attributed to the study drug.

### Placebo-controlled, randomized double-blind N-of-1 trial to study safety and potential efficacy of TJ-68 for improving muscle cramps in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A pilot study [^116WUXcR]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps affect 74%–95% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and are among the most common symptoms of ALS. In some patients, muscle cramps are the presenting symptom, preceding muscle weakness. Despite their prevalence, there have been few clinical trials specifically focused on treating muscle cramps in ALS. In clinical practice, only a few drugs are available to treat cramps. Quinine, the most commonly used medication internationally, is advised against by the FDA despite its evidence base. Off-label medications, such as gabapentin, baclofen, and tizanidine, are used in clinical practice, despite sedation and fatigue being common side effects. Furthermore, there have been no formal studies assessing the benefits and side effects of these medications for the treatment of muscle cramps in ALS.

Over a little more than a decade, two clinical trials with mexiletine demonstrated a reduction in muscle cramps in ALS, but disease-modifying benefits could not be demonstrated. Although mexiletine has an FDA class of drug-related black box warning related to cardiac arrhythmia, no such events have been reported in these studies. While mexiletine can be tried with caution, ranolazine is often used, based on limited evidence with an ongoing confirmatory study (NCT06527222).

This underscores a clear need for the development of safe and effective medications for the symptomatic treatment of muscle cramps in ALS.

### Effect of RNS60 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A phase II multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116zbzkm]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex, resulting in muscle atrophy and paralysis. Respiratory complications are the most common cause of death, developing due to the progressive paralysis of the diaphragm and the accessory muscles that support ventilation. Riluzole and edaravone are the only two available disease-modifying medications on the market, and they both have only modest effects on disease outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more treatments for people living with ALS.

In recent years, multiple lines of evidence have supported a critical role for neuroinflammation in ALS pathophysiology. This includes in vivo imaging studies in mouse ALS models, ex vivo analyses revealing astrocyte and microglia activation even in pre-symptomatic phases, and recent discoveries showing involvement of several genes directly linked to the immune response. Defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS and are being considered as potential therapeutic targets.

Regarding medical management for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, specifically concerning the management of depression and anxiety, the EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend offering appropriate antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, SSRIs, or mirtazapine, for managing depression in patients with ALS. SSRIs should be considered preferable for elderly or cognitively impaired patients.

### European Academy of Neurology (EAN) guideline on the management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in collaboration with European Reference Network for Neuromuscular Diseases (ERN EURO-NMD) [^114i3g2u]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Offer the person with ALS the opportunity to discuss their preferences and concerns about care at the end of life at trigger points such as at diagnosis, if there is a significant change in respiratory function, or if interventions such as gastrostomy or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) are needed. Be sensitive about the timing of discussions and take into account the person's communication ability, cognitive status and mental capacity, and coping ability. Be prepared to discuss end‐of‐life issues whenever people wish to do so. Provide support and advice on advance care planning for end of life.

- **Discussion topics for end-of-life care**:
	- Topics to discuss may include what could happen at the end of life, for example, how death may occur. Providing anticipatory medicines in the home is also important.

- **Advance care planning**:
	- This includes advance decisions to refuse treatment, do not attempt resuscitation orders, and lasting power of attorney (a legal authorization for a designated person to make decisions about another person's property, finances, or medical care).

- **Ensuring availability of advance care plans**:
	- Ensure that these plans are available when needed, for example, by including the information on the person's Summary Care Record.

- **When to involve specialist palliative care**:
	- Identifying areas that people might wish to plan for, such as what they want to happen (e.g. their preferred place of death) and what they do not want to happen (e.g. being admitted to hospital).

- **Representation and contingencies**:
	- Identify who will represent their decisions if necessary, and what should happen if they develop an intercurrent illness.

Invasive ventilation is a new recommendation added by the European Academy of Neurology guidelines.

### Preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Insights from pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases [^117R1XCL]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

The recognition of earlier clinical presentations of Alzheimer's disease, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline, has pushed back the clinical detection threshold, allowing for earlier intervention in clinical trials. Based on the assumption that targeting the underlying disease process earlier is more likely to succeed, early detection of clinical features has become crucial. Several trials are currently underway involving participants who are amyloid-positive but cognitively unimpaired. These disease-modifying trials will provide insights into the potential prevention of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.

### Statin use and risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disorders [^112gQNfb]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Use of statins has been associated with an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like syndrome in two analyses of overlapping surveillance databases recording adverse events potentially related to prescription drug use. We assessed whether statin use is associated with the occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron disorders.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a population-based case-control study in Northern Denmark, with a population of 1.8 million. From the Danish National Registry of Patients, we identified incident cases coded with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other motor neuron syndromes during the period from 1999 to 2008. We selected ten population control subjects matched to cases on sex, birth year, and calendar time. Statin use was ascertained in the prescription database in the region — recorded before diagnosis — and associated with disease occurrence by conditional logistic regression adjusting for covariates. We identified 556 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other motor neuron syndromes and 5,560 population control subjects. The odds ratio associating disease occurrence with statin use was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.28). Recent users of statins, former users, and users of short or long duration had similarly near-null associations.

- **Conclusions**: Any risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with statin use is probably small, so outweighed by the important clinical advantages of statin medications to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases.

### What has changed with riluzole [^115J5rqT]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Riluzole, following two significant trials, was introduced as the first standard treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the early '95s. After five years, what has changed in the field of ALS?

In basic science, riluzole as an active drug has significantly contributed to stimulating research on the possible role of glutamate in the genesis of ALS. However, the apparent simplicity of the relationship between the drug and its mechanisms should be reconsidered, especially in light of negative results from other trials (e.g. gabapentin) and the discovery of additional mechanisms involved in both the disease and the compound. Possible relations with other putative mechanisms of ALS, such as oxidative stress or growth factors, could also be involved.

- **Clinical trials**: Riluzole has an impact on survival rates, a topic that has been widely debated. Comparisons with historical databases support the results of the two initial trials. Additional publications bolster the claim of the drug's potential effect on muscle strength decline, which remains a controversial issue. These findings reinforce the initial data and provide further justification for using riluzole as a standard treatment for patients.

- **Patient care**: In daily care, riluzole provides a real and unique hope for ALS sufferers. Although its effectiveness is not as comprehensive as patients might expect, it offers hope for slowing down disease progression and dispels the myth of "no hope, no cure" that previously dominated patient care. We must better define the mode of administration concerning the clinical status of the patient.

### Dexpramipexole versus placebo for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (EMPOWER): A randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial [^11623hjL]. The Lancet Neurology (2013). High credibility.

In a phase 2 study, dexpramipexole (25–150 mg twice daily) was well tolerated for up to 9 months and showed a significant benefit at the high dose in a combined assessment of function and mortality in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dexpramipexole in a phase 3 trial of patients with familial or sporadic disease.

- **Methods**: In our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (EMPOWER), we enrolled participants aged 18–80 years, with the first amyotrophic lateral sclerosis symptom onset 24 months or less before baseline, at 81 academic medical centers in 11 countries. We randomly allocated eligible participants (1:1) with a centralized voice-interactive online system to twice-daily dexpramipexole 150 mg or matched placebo for 12–18 months, stratified by trial site, area of disease onset (bulbar vs other areas), and previous use of riluzole. The primary endpoint was the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) score, based on changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) total scores and time to death up to 12 months. We assessed the primary endpoint in all participants who received at least one dose and had at least one post-dose ALSFRS-R measurement or died. We monitored adverse events in all participants.

- **Findings**: Between March 28, 2011, and Sept 30, 2011, we enrolled 943 participants (474 randomly allocated to dexpramipexole, 468 randomly allocated to placebo, and one withdrew).

### Antioxidant treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / motor neuron disease [^111vkbCW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Free radical accumulation and oxidative stress have been proposed as contributing to the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or motor neuron disease). A range of antioxidant medications are available and have been studied.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of antioxidant medication in the treatment of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (July 2003), MEDLINE (from January 1966 to July 2003), EMBASE (from January 1980 to July 2003), and other sources.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of antioxidant treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The reviewers independently applied the selection criteria, assessed study quality, and two reviewers performed independent data extraction.

- **Main results**: The search identified 21 studies for consideration, but only eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Only two studies used our predetermined primary outcome measure (survival at 12 months of treatment). Sufficient data were available from three studies to allow analysis of the primary outcome measure, and a meta-analysis was performed. In the individual studies, no significant effect was observed of vitamin E 500 mg twice daily; acetylcysteine 50 mg/kg daily subcutaneous infusion; or a combination of L-methionine 2 g, vitamin E 400 International Units, and selenium 3 × 10⁻⁵ g three times daily (Alsemet). No significant effect on the primary outcome measure was observed in a meta-analysis of antioxidant treatments.

### A 40-week phase 2B randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of memantine in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113MYAMx]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

We enrolled 99 participants, with 10 screen failures, resulting in 89 randomized participants (Figure 1) between the ages of 24 and 83 years. Enrolled participants included a male-to-female ratio of approximately 3:2 (men n = 60), and the majority were Caucasian (n = 90, 91%).

- **Study flow diagram**: Ninety-nine subjects were enrolled, and 89 subjects were randomized to memantine versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Primary endpoint analysis was performed on subjects that had greater than one Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score.

For the 89 randomized participants, baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the treatment and placebo groups. A total of 36 (40%) participants dropped out of the study due to adverse experiences (n = 19, 21%), death (n = 6), patient request (n = 6), and lost to follow-up (n = 5). An additional subject (n = 1) discontinued the study treatment but continued follow-up through 40 weeks.

Three deaths were the result of ALS progression and complications: one from pneumonia, one from cardiac arrest, and one from respiratory failure. In the memantine group, the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation was dizziness (n = 4). Primary endpoint analysis was performed on participants who had more than one ALSFRS-R performed.

### An open label pilot study of the safety and tolerability of perampanel in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115SvFpz]. Muscle & nerve (2021). Low credibility.

Perampanel, a selective noncompetitive α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) antagonist, is capable of slowing the progression of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) phenotype and increasing the number of anterior horn cells in transgenic mice. Trials of perampanel in epilepsy showed a favorable tolerability profile. In this study, we aimed to determine the tolerability and safety of perampanel in patients with ALS.

- **Methods**: Enrolled subjects were started on 2 mg/day of perampanel, and the dose was increased by 2 mg/day every week to a maximum dose of 8 mg/day. Our primary outcome measure was tolerability, evaluated by monitoring adverse events. The secondary outcome measure was clinical progression, assessed using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and spirometry.

- **Results**: Six participants were enrolled. All had adverse events, mostly behavioral. Two completed the trial, and the other four withdrew due to adverse events. All participants reported resolution of these events after discontinuation of the drug. The trial was halted due to the large number of adverse events.

- **Discussion**: The use of perampanel in this study of ALS was limited by its poor tolerability.

### The challenge and promise of anti-epileptic therapy development in animal models [^1116PERq]. The Lancet Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Translation of successful target and compound validation studies into clinically effective therapies is a major challenge, with potential for costly clinical trial failures. This situation holds true for the epilepsies — complex diseases with different causes and symptoms. Although the availability of predictive animal models has led to the development of effective antiseizure therapies that are routinely used in clinical practice, showing that translation can be successful, several important unmet therapeutic needs still exist.

Available treatments do not fully control seizures in a third of patients with epilepsy and produce substantial side effects. No treatment can prevent the development of epilepsy in at-risk patients or cure patients with epilepsy. Moreover, no specific treatment for epilepsy-associated comorbidities exists. To meet these demands, a redesign of translational approaches is urgently needed.

### Randomized phase 2 study of perampanel for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^11526QAU]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

This trial did not support a neuroprotective effect of perampanel but suggests instead a potential detrimental effect at high doses. Since there was a high percentage of patients discontinuing the treatment, as well as considerable variability of change in the ALSFRS-R score at 48 weeks from baseline among the individuals in each group, including virtual non-progression in some participants in the perampanel groups, the clinical benefit of perampanel in SALS patients needs further study.

### Nuedexta [^116vGCgi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of Nuedexta was demonstrated in one trial in patients with pseudobulbar affect (PBA), wherein these patients had underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). Other trials at higher doses (dextromethorphan 30 mg/quinidine 30 mg) provided supportive evidence.

In the Nuedexta trial, patients with PBA were randomized to receive Nuedexta dextromethorphan 20 mg/quinidine 10 mg (N = 107), dextromethorphan 30 mg/quinidine 10 mg (N = 110), or placebo (N = 109) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure, laughing and crying episodes, was statistically significantly lower in each dextromethorphan/quinidine arm compared to placebo, as shown by the analysis of the sums of the episode counts over the double-blind phase.

The secondary endpoint was the Center for Neurologic Studies Lability Scale (CNS-LS), a seven-item self-report questionnaire with three items assessing crying and four assessing laughter. CNS-LS was analyzed based on the difference between the mean scores on day 84 and baseline, and was also statistically significantly lower in each dextromethorphan/quinidine arm compared to placebo. There were no clinically important differences between Nuedexta and the dextromethorphan 30 mg/quinidine 10 mg arm.

### Treatment for spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease [^111BZgMK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Spasticity commonly affects patients with motor neuron disease and likely contributes to worsening muscle dysfunction, increased difficulty with activities of daily living, and deteriorating quality of life.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review is to systematically review all types of treatments for spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialized trials register (searched January 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2003), AMED (January 1985 to January 2003), and LILACS (January 1982 to January 2003) for randomized controlled trials. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomized trials identified and contacted trial authors and known experts in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: We included quasi-randomized or randomized controlled trials of participants with probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to the El Escorial diagnostic criteria (or a revised version) or the Airlie House revision. We would have included trials of physical therapy, modalities, prescription medications, non-prescription medications, chemical neurolysis, surgical interventions, and alternative therapies. Our primary outcome measure was the reduction in spasticity at three months or greater, as measured by the Ashworth (or modified Ashworth) spasticity scale. Our secondary outcome measures were based on validated measures, including history, physical examination, and physiological measures.

### Qalsody [^115EtqBS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Qalsody was assessed in a 28-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients 23 to 78 years of age with weakness attributable to ALS and an SOD1 mutation confirmed by a central laboratory (Study 1 Part C, NCT02623699). One hundred eight (108) patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with either Qalsody 100 mg (n = 72) or placebo (n = 36) for 24 weeks, which included 3 loading doses followed by 5 maintenance doses. Concomitant use of riluzole and/or edaravone was permitted for patients.

- **Prespecified primary analysis population**: The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) group (n = 60) had a slow vital capacity (SVC) ≥ 65% of predicted value and met prognostic enrichment criteria for rapid disease progression. This was defined based on their pre-randomization ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R) decline slope and SOD1 mutation type.

- **Non-mITT population**: This group (n = 48) had a slow vital capacity (SVC) ≥ 50% of predicted value and did not meet the enrichment criteria for rapid disease progression.

Baseline disease characteristics in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which combines the mITT and non-mITT populations, were generally similar between patients treated with Qalsody and those who received placebo. Patients in the Qalsody group had a slightly shorter time from symptom onset and higher plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) at baseline. At baseline, 62% of patients were taking riluzole, and 8% were taking edaravone. The mean baseline ALSFRS-R score was 36.9 (5.9) in the Qalsody group and 37.3 (5.8) in the placebo group.

### Safety and efficacy of edaravone in well defined patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116jnj63]. The Lancet Neurology (2017). High credibility.

In a previous phase 3 study in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), edaravone did not show a significant difference in the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score compared with placebo. Post-hoc analysis of these data revealed that patients in an early stage with a definite or probable diagnosis of ALS, as defined by the revised El Escorial criteria, who met a specific set of inclusion criteria, showed a greater magnitude of effect than the full study population. We aimed to substantiate this post-hoc result and assess the safety and efficacy of edaravone in a phase 3 trial that focused on patients with early-stage ALS who met the post-hoc analysis inclusion criteria.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients aged 20–75 years with ALS of grade 1 or 2 in the Japan ALS Severity Classification, scores of at least 2 points on all 12 items of ALSFRS-R, forced vital capacity of 80% or more, definite or probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, and disease duration of 2 years or less were recruited from 31 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients also had a decrease of 1–4 points in the ALSFRS-R score during a 12-week observation period before randomisation. Patients meeting all criteria were then randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 60 mg intravenous edaravone or intravenous saline placebo for 6 cycles (4 weeks per cycle with 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) for a total treatment duration of 24 weeks. In cycle 1, the study drug or placebo was administered once per day for 14 days within a 14-day period.

### Treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - what is the next step [^113Nvkkf]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease which was thought to be untreatable. However, recent evidence in both experimental animals and humans indicates that antiglutamatergic strategies are the first to have an influence on its pathogenesis and slow down the disease process. Since the effect of drugs is still small, this process cannot only be seen as a success of the present but must also be acknowledged as a basis for future developments.

- **Future study design**: Future studies will need to consider the presumably long preclinical period of the disease. They will use a number of novel compounds and treatment strategies that have been shown to be effective in transgenic animal models. This implies that a combination of therapies is likely to be used, and efforts will be made to treat patients early.

- **Clinical implications**: The push for early treatment will demand a novel clinical attitude toward the diagnosis of the disease. It will also necessitate the development of novel markers for both the preclinical period and the longitudinal course of the disease.

### A 40-week phase 2B randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of memantine in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1172Yx8C]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

**Adverse events**: A total of 299 adverse events were reported in 77 participants throughout the duration of the study. There were eight (14%) participants in the memantine group and three (10%) participants in the placebo group with serious adverse events. During the study, there were three (5%) deaths in the memantine group and three (10%) in the placebo group. There were 50 participants (56%) in the memantine group and 23 (74%) participants in the placebo group who experienced adverse events that were not classified as serious adverse events. In the memantine group, the most frequently reported adverse events were fall (26%), dizziness (26%), confusion (17%), and constipation (14%). In the placebo group, fall (16%), constipation (16%), rash (13%), and headache (10%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. The most common reason for drug discontinuation was dizziness, a known complication of the drug.

### Treatment for spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease [^115E3q8s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Spasticity commonly affects patients with motor neuron disease and is likely to contribute to worsening muscle dysfunction, increased difficulty with activities of daily living, and deteriorating quality of life. The objective of this review is to systematically evaluate treatments for spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (January 2003 and January 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2005), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to February 2005), AMED (January 1985 to February 2005), and LILACS (January 1982 to January 2003). Bibliographies of the identified randomized controlled trials were reviewed, and authors and experts in the field were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: We included quasi-randomized or randomized controlled trials of participants with probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis according to the El Escorial diagnostic criteria (or a revised version) or the Airlie House revision. Trials of physical therapy, modalities, prescription medications, non-prescription medications, chemical neurolysis, surgical interventions, and alternative therapies were considered. The primary outcome measure was a reduction in spasticity at three months or greater, as measured by the Ashworth (or modified Ashworth) spasticity scale. Secondary outcome measures included validated measures based on history, physical examination, physiological measures, measures of function, and measures of quality of life.

### Riluzole exerts central and peripheral modulating effects in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115vHHzX]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Riluzole, a benzothiazole derivative, has been shown to be effective in prolonging survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mechanisms by which riluzole exerts neuroprotective effects in ALS remain to be fully elucidated; however, inhibition of glutamatergic transmission and modulation of Na+ channel function have been proposed.

In an attempt to determine the mechanisms by which riluzole exerts neuroprotective effects, particularly to dissect the relative contributions of inhibition of glutamatergic transmission and Na+ channel modulation, the present study utilized a combination of cortical and peripheral axonal excitability approaches. This was done to monitor changes in excitability and function in patients with ALS. Cortical assessment was undertaken by utilizing the threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique combined with peripheral axonal excitability studies in 25 patients with ALS.

Studies were performed at baseline and repeated when patients were receiving riluzole 100 mg/day. At the time of the second testing, all patients were tolerating the medication well. Motor evoked potential and compound muscle action potential responses were recorded over the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. At baseline, features of cortical hyperexcitability were evident in patients with ALS, indicated by marked reduction in short interval intracortical inhibition (P < 0.001) and cortical silent period duration (P < 0.001), as well as an increase in the motor evoked po.

### Phase II screening trial of lithium carbonate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Examining a more efficient trial design [^114dS6ty]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

To use a historical placebo control design to determine whether lithium carbonate slows progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a phase II trial was conducted at 10 sites in the Western ALS Study Group. The trial used similar dosages (300–450 mg/day), target blood levels (0.3–0.8 mEq/L), outcome measures, and trial duration (13 months) as the positive trial. Taking riluzole was not a requirement for study entry. Placebo outcomes in patients matched for baseline features from a large database of recent clinical trials, showing stable rates of decline over the past 9 years, were used as historical controls.

The mean rate of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised was greater in 107 patients taking lithium carbonate (-1.20/month, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.41 to -0.98) than in 249 control patients (-1.01/month, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.92, p = 0.04). There were no differences in secondary outcome measures (forced vital capacity, time to failure, and quality of life), but there were more adverse events in the treated group.

The lack of therapeutic benefit and safety concerns, taken together with similar results from two other recent trials, weighs against the use of lithium carbonate in patients with ALS. The absence of drift over time and the availability of a large database of patients for selecting a matched historical control group suggest that use of historical controls may result in more efficient phase II trials for screening putative ALS therapeutic agents.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A clinical review [^111Uz6s8]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The only European Medicines Agency-approved drug to treat ALS is riluzole, a glutamate antagonist, which has a small but significant effect on survival in ALS. Despite the ever-growing knowledge about the causes and disease mechanisms underlying ALS, more than 40 randomized clinical trials have been negative. There are many potential reasons for this lack of success, but treating ALS as one disease regardless of the underlying cause or disease mechanisms involved may be one of them.

### Amino acids for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease [^115Wa3r7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as motor neuron disease, is a progressive neuromuscular disease that causes disability and eventual death. Various amino acid preparations, including the three branched-chain amino acids (L-leucine, L-valine, and L-isoleucine) or, alternatively, L-threonine, have been used as experimental therapy.

- **Objectives**: To examine the efficacy of amino acid therapies in prolonging survival and/or slowing the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (searched February 2003), MEDLINE (from January 1966 to December 2002), and EMBASE (from January 1980 to December 2002) databases, as well as reports from specialist conferences. Authors of known studies were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized or quasi-randomized trials of participants with a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease treated with all combinations of amino acids. Our primary outcome measure was survival, determined by a pooled hazard ratio of all studies. Our secondary outcome measures were, in order of priority, survival at six and 12 months, muscle strength, any validated rating scale of physical function, quality of life, proportion of patients completing therapy, and proportion of patients reporting adverse events attributable to treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We identified six eligible trials and rejected a further seven because of incomplete data or inadequate duration. Eligible studies were rated for methodological quality.

### Analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as a multistep process: a population-based modelling study [^115zGPfq]. The Lancet Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis shares characteristics with some cancers, such as onset being more common in later life, progression usually being rapid, the disease affecting a particular cell type, and showing complex inheritance. We used a model originally applied to cancer epidemiology to investigate the hypothesis that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a multistep process.

- **Methods**: We generated incidence data by age and sex from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis population registers in Ireland (registration dates 1995–2012), the Netherlands (2006–12), Italy (1995–2004), Scotland (1989–98), and England (2002–09), and calculated age and sex-adjusted incidences for each register. We regressed the log of age-specific incidence against the log of age with least squares regression. We did the analyses within each register and also did a combined analysis, adjusting for register.

- **Findings**: We identified 6,274 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from a catchment population of about 34 million people. We noted a linear relationship between log incidence and log age in all five registers: England r² = 0.95, Ireland r² = 0.99, Italy r² = 0.95, the Netherlands r² = 0.99, and Scotland r² = 0.97; overall r² = 0.99. All five registers gave similar estimates of the linear slope ranging from 4.5 to 5.1, with overlapping confidence intervals. The combination of all five registers gave an overall slope of 4.8 (95% CI 4.5–5.0), with similar estimates for men (4.6, 4.3–4.9) and women (5.0, 4.5–5.5).

The interpretation was incomplete and has been removed for clarity.
