## Question

Lipoma of scalp write a short one paragraph patient message reassuring them

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a short, reassuring one-paragraph patient message about a scalp lipoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and clarifying what a lipoma is. Then, I should verify the benign nature and recurrence risk. Next, I will assess malignant potential and when to escalate workup. After that, I need to outline management options, including when to observe versus excise. I should also consider special variants like spindle cell lipoma and imaging nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, reassuring patient message and ensure it aligns with the evidence base and communication best practices.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and define the entity. A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of mature fat cells that typically presents as a soft, mobile, flesh-colored subcutaneous nodule; on the scalp, it is uncommon but recognized, with historical series noting a small proportion of lipomas arising on the scalp, which helps frame expectations for location-specific counseling [^113ZDLQs].

> Wait, let me verify the benign nature and recurrence risk before reassuring the patient. Lipomas are noncancerous and generally grow slowly; recurrence after complete excision is uncommon, and when it occurs it is usually due to incomplete removal rather than malignant behavior, which supports a conservative, observation-first approach when the lesion is small and asymptomatic [^111kx2bq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about malignancy. I need to check red flags that warrant closer evaluation: rapid enlargement, size greater than about 5–10 cm, deep location, firmness, pain, or skin changes; in such cases, ultrasound is reasonable for superficial masses and MRI is preferred for deep or large lesions to distinguish lipoma from atypical lipomatous tumor or liposarcoma, with biopsy considered if imaging is atypical or the clinical course is worrisome [^115QHLT9] [^115cryLU] [^115yFbPr].

> I will now examine management options. For small, asymptomatic scalp lipomas, observation is appropriate; if symptomatic, cosmetically bothersome, or growing, surgical excision is the definitive treatment and can often be done in the office under local anesthesia, with minimal-scar techniques or suction-assisted extraction as options in selected cases to optimize cosmesis while ensuring complete removal and histopathology review [^116e5Ety] [^111RmEwo] [^116gWT3L].

> But wait, what if the imaging or pathology suggests a variant rather than a classic lipoma. Spindle cell lipoma can occur on the scalp, may show little to no visible fat on imaging, and can mimic sarcoma; careful clinicoradiologic-pathologic correlation is essential to avoid overtreatment, and when correctly identified, standard excision remains curative with excellent outcomes [^114f5sjG] [^111Bbwob].

> Let me consider the patient-facing message and ensure it is both accurate and reassuring. I should confirm that the scalp lipoma is a harmless overgrowth of normal fat under the skin, not cancer, typically grows slowly, and rarely causes problems; if it remains small and painless, no treatment is needed, but if it enlarges, becomes uncomfortable, or affects appearance, a simple outpatient removal can permanently resolve it with very low recurrence when completely excised [^111Gx4ND] [^116gWT3L] [^111kx2bq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "no malignant potential", but I should double-check that nuance. While classic lipomas are benign, rare sarcomatous transformation has been reported in large or longstanding lesions; the risk is extremely low, yet it justifies attention to atypical features and supports imaging or biopsy when red flags are present, which I need to communicate transparently to avoid false reassurance [^113FJikn].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety-netting. I need to ensure the patient knows to return if the lump grows quickly, becomes painful, changes in consistency, or the overlying skin alters, because these changes could signal a different diagnosis or a lipoma variant that merits imaging and possible biopsy; clear return precautions and shared decision-making about timing of excision improve alignment and timely care [^111Gx4ND] [^112vVio3].

> In summary, after verifying the diagnosis, benign behavior, and low recurrence with complete excision, I can confidently reassure the patient that a scalp lipoma is a common, noncancerous fatty growth that usually needs no treatment unless it causes symptoms or cosmetic concern; if removal is desired, a straightforward outpatient procedure provides definitive management with excellent cosmetic results in experienced hands [^111Gx4ND] [^111RmEwo].

A scalp lipoma is a **benign, slow-growing** collection of fat under the skin that is **not cancerous** and does not spread [^115t9Twi]. It is usually soft, mobile, and painless, and only needs removal if it bothers you cosmetically, becomes painful, or grows quickly [^111Gx4ND]. If removed, recurrence is uncommon and the risk of malignancy is extremely low [^111kx2bq] [^115t9Twi]. You can monitor it at home and contact us if you notice rapid growth, pain, redness, or other changes [^1155K8hv].

## Clinical features of scalp lipoma

Scalp lipomas typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Appearance**: Soft, doughy, mobile nodules under the skin, often flesh-colored or slightly yellowish [^111Gx4ND].

- **Size**: Usually small, ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter [^notfound].

- **Growth rate**: Slow-growing, often remaining stable for years [^113ruqAp].

- **Symptoms**: Generally asymptomatic, but may cause cosmetic concerns or mild discomfort if large [^1122YEEE].

- **Location**: Commonly found on the occipital or frontal regions of the scalp [^notfound].

---

## Causes and risk factors

The exact cause of scalp lipomas is **unknown**, but several factors may contribute to their development:

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history of lipomas may increase the risk [^116gWT3L].

- **Trauma**: Minor injuries or trauma to the scalp may trigger lipoma formation [^115t9Twi].

- **Hormonal factors**: Hormonal imbalances may play a role in some cases [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis of scalp lipoma is **primarily clinical**, based on physical examination findings. Imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI may be used to confirm the diagnosis, assess the size and extent of the lesion, and differentiate it from other soft tissue tumors [^115cryLU] [^1122YEEE]. In rare cases, a biopsy may be performed to exclude malignancy [^1155K8hv].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment of scalp lipomas **depends on the size, location, and patient preference**. Options include:

- **Observation**: Small, asymptomatic lipomas may be monitored without intervention [^113ruqAp].

- **Surgical excision**: Complete removal of the lipoma is the definitive treatment, especially if the lesion is large, symptomatic, or cosmetically concerning [^112szV61].

- **Minimally invasive techniques**: Techniques such as minimal-scar segmental extraction or suction-assisted lipectomy may be used for cosmetic reasons [^111RmEwo] [^116gWT3L].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The prognosis for scalp lipomas is **excellent**. Recurrence after complete surgical excision is rare, and malignant transformation is extremely uncommon [^115t9Twi] [^113FJikn]. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor for recurrence or complications [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Although scalp lipomas are benign, potential complications include:

- **Cosmetic disfigurement**: Visible lumps may cause aesthetic concerns [^116e5Ety].

- **Infection**: Rarely, secondary infection may occur, particularly if the lipoma is traumatized [^notfound].

- **Recurrence**: Minimal risk of recurrence after complete excision [^116gWT3L].

---

## Patient education and reassurance

Patients diagnosed with scalp lipomas should be **reassured** that these lesions are benign and non-cancerous [^111Gx4ND]. They should be educated about the slow-growing nature of the tumor and the low risk of complications. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if the lipoma rapidly increases in size, becomes painful, or shows signs of infection [^1155K8hv].

---

Scalp lipomas are **benign, slow-growing** tumors composed of mature fat cells [^1122YEEE]. They are typically asymptomatic and require no treatment unless they cause cosmetic or functional concerns. Surgical excision is the definitive treatment, with a low risk of recurrence and complications [^111RmEwo].

### Fat-free spindle cell lipoma of the scalp: lipoma without a lipogenic component [^114f5sjG]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Spindle cell lipoma (SCL) is a rare, benign subcutaneous neoplasm that typically occurs on the upper trunk or neck of middle-aged men. The diagnosis of SCL is often straightforward due to its characteristic clinical presentation and classic histologic features of admixed mature adipocytes and CD-34 positive bland spindle cells. However, the diagnosis can be elusive when low-fat and free-fat patterns occur. Due to the lack of lipogenic content and morphologic overlap, this rare tumor is often mistaken for other benign and malignant soft tissue tumors. The authors present the case of a middle-aged man with a fat-free SCL of the temporal scalp. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the literature ofa fat-free SCL involving the temporal scalp. With careful attention to the clinical context, histologic features, immunohistochemical profile, and cytogenetic abnormalities, the proper diagnosis of SCL without a lipogenic component can be achieved.

### Benign skin lesions: lipomas, epidermal inclusion cysts, muscle and nerve biopsies [^113okHVD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Lipomas are benign skin tumors composed of mature fat cells and are the most common subcutaneous tumors. Although many of these can be removed in the surgical clinic or minor operating room, some require more advanced preoperative planning and more complicated resection. The diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of benign tumors, and other commonly associated tumors that may require a more substantial workup and operative intervention, are discussed. Muscle and nerve biopsies are used for the diagnosis of a variety of medical problems. Although there are other genetic and biochemical markers now available that can diagnose diseases previously proven by biopsy, these surgical techniques still have appropriate uses. Although the procedures are straightforward, there are important technical issues to assist in getting the best specimen to avoid confounding disease diagnosis.

Lipoma is a common subcutaneous tumour composed of fat tissue. It may occur as a sporadic solitary lesion or as multiple lesions. They often grow very slowly. They vary between 2 and 10cm in size. There are rarely any subjective symptoms. Lipomas do not usually require treatment unless they are big enough to be symptomatic. We reported a 75-year-old man with a rapidly enlarging and ulcerated mass on his right upper thigh.

Deep forehead lipomas are rare in children and may be confused with other more concerning soft tissue masses. We describe four children with deep forehead lipomas, diagnosed between 2 months and 1 year of age, three of them congenital. Notable findings included association with intracranial lipoma and seizures in one patient and the development of marked alopecia overlying the lipoma in another. While deep forehead lipomas may become less visible over time, alopecia and non-syndromic extracutaneous involvement may be important associations.

Introduction

Lipedematous alopecia (LA) and lipedematous scalp (LS) are 2 rare conditions of unknown etiology that are thought by some to be 2 stages on a spectrum of a single scalp disorder.LA was first described by Coskey et alin 1961, and in 2007, the term spongy scalp was used to describe LA and LS. Both LA and LS conditions are characterized by a localized or diffusely thickened, boggy scalp, but LS lacks alopecia. Associated pruritus and soreness can occur with LA, but most LS patients are asymptomatic. Both conditions are characterized pathologically by a measurable hyperplasia of the subcutaneous tissue.

Discussion

What makes this case interesting is the fact that even a benign pathology such as a lipoma progressed into a situation requiring delicate surgical management, both due to the technical aspect of the operation itself, and because of the patient's advanced age.

With no difference in prevalence across genders and a 40–60 years old average age, lipomas are the most frequent benign soft-tissue tumours. Whether isolated or multiple, congenital or post-traumatic, lipomas are frequent in our daily routine; some studies mention the genetic implication in more than 50% of them. Even with minimal risk of malignant evolution, the first step of imaging should be ultrasonography, sometimes associated with MRI for large or deep tumours. Various treatments can be suggested for mechanical or aesthetic concerns. Surgery is the most appropriate treatment, associated with other techniques(suction, soft-tissue reconstruction, flap and so on).

Various pathologies imitating lipomas, such as lipomatosis or lipodystrophy, should be distinguished from it. The WHO gives a standard classification for all types of lipomas.

Giant lipomas are a specific entity as their precise definition is only based on the general aspect of the tumour, with a specific size and weight cut-off given by Sanchez et al. In order for a lipoma to be called 'giant', the lesion must be at least 10 cm in one dimension or weigh a minimum of 1 kg. Based on recent literature, the case we report here is the second largest sub-cutaneous lipoma ever described (table 1).

Learning points

Giant lipomas are above all aesthetics concerns but in advanced form a functional problem.
Benign tumours with low risk of malignant evolution.
Surgery as if aesthetic or functional disorders.
The transformation of a large lipoma (> 10 cm) to a liposarcoma is rare.

### The use of suction-assisted surgical extraction of moderate and large lipomas: long-term follow-up [^116gWT3L]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Solitary lipomas and familial multiple lipomatosis are the most common benign tumors and are very well encapsulated. They are very slow growing and have the potential for recurrence if incompletely excised and a very remote chance for malignant changes. These can be freed from surrounding tissue without difficulty, but because of the fibrous nature of the capsule, its violation is more likely with suction technique and may result in an inadequate resection, possibly leading to recurrence. Furthermore, liposuction alone will not allow histopathological study of the swellings. Therefore, we report here the treatment of moderate (> 4–10 cm) and large (> 10 cm) lipomas with liposuction-assisted surgical extraction of the capsule via the same wound (1 cm in length). This capsule extraction is aimed at avoiding recurrence and evaluating the histopathological nature of these swellings. 16 patients (nine men and seven women) presented with solitary lipomas (in 11 patients) and multiple lipomas (in five patients) have been successfully treated. Methods involved 1-cm incision for both liposuction and surgical removal of the capsule. Another 1-cm counter-incision may be needed in case of large size lipomas. High patient satisfaction was achieved because of the good cosmetic results due to the small postoperative residual scar and the smooth postoperative course. There has been no recorded recurrence in six years postoperative followup.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors [^111Gx4ND]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Patients will experience a wide range of skin growths and changes over their lifetime. Family physicians should be able to distinguish potentially malignant from benign skin tumors. Most lesions can be diagnosed on the basis of history and clinical examination. Lesions that are suspicious for malignancy, those with changing characteristics, symptomatic lesions, and those that cause cosmetic problems may warrant medical therapy, a simple office procedure (e.g., excision, cryosurgery, laser ablation), or referral. Acrochordons are extremely common, small, and typically pedunculated benign neoplasms. Simple scissor or shave excision, electrodesiccation, or cryosurgery can be used for treatment. Sebaceous hyperplasia presents as asymptomatic, discrete, soft, pale yellow, shiny bumps on the forehead or cheeks, or near hair follicles. Except for cosmesis, they have no clinical significance. Lipomas are soft, flesh-colored nodules that are easily moveable under the overlying skin. Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing, squamoproliferative benign tumors that resemble squamous cell carcinomas. Early simple excision is recommended. Pyogenic granuloma is a rapidly growing nodule that bleeds easily. Treatment includes laser ablation or shave excision with electrodesiccation of the base. Dermatofibromas are an idiopathic benign proliferation of fibroblasts. No treatment is required unless there is a change in size or color, bleeding, or irritation from trauma. Epidermal inclusion cysts can be treated by simple excision with removal of the cyst and cyst wall. Seborrheic keratoses and cherry angiomas generally do not require treatment.

### Lipoma on the lower lip [^115cWZud]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat tissue, found frequently in subcutaneous tissues. However, oral manifestations are relatively rare. The present patient illustrates the successful treatment of a lipoma treated by complete excision of the lesion. A female patient, 75 years old, presenting lesion in the right oral vestibule where excisional biopsy was performed. The professional must diagnose this type of injury as soon as possible and treat it so that it does not take large proportions, which can result in esthetic and functional sequelae to the patient.

### Rapid growth of scalp masses during pregnancy: a case report of malignancy diagnosis post-surgery [^1135n6D1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Scalp masses are common scalp lesions, most of which are benign, with a small proportion being malignant. Scalp sarcomas constitute one category of malignant tumors, primarily including fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Among these, scalp leiomyosarcoma is exceedingly rare. This report presents the case of a 37-year-old female patient with a small scalp mass on the vertex persisting for over 4 years, showing no significant growth or symptoms. During pregnancy, the mass underwent rapid enlargement. CT imaging revealed a large subcutaneous soft tissue tumor, which was subsequently excised through neurosurgical intervention. Postoperative histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.

### Presentation, diagnosis, and management options of lipedematous alopecia [^113DytZb]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings of our patient show features consistent with LA. Lipedematous alopecia is a rare, nonscarring alopecia characterized by "an increase in thickness of the subcutaneous layer of the scalp and inability to grow hairs longer than 2 cm". A review by González-Guerra et alin 2008 found that only 17 cases of LA have been reported worldwide. In a review of 47 cases published in 2012 of LA and LS, it was found that 90% of patients were women, and the mean age of onset was 42 years; 39% of patients were white, 32% were black, 24% were Egyptian, and 5% were Asian.

Currently, there is not a reliable link of LA with other symptoms or with genetic mutations. Moreover, the pathogenesis of LA and LS remains a mystery. Leptin, a hormone regulating distribution of adipose tissue, has been postulated as playing a role in causing hyperplasia of subcutaneous fat. Another theory of LA pathogenesis involves metaplasia and displacement of adipose tissue. Because women comprise most patients with LA, hormones may also play a role, although evidence is lacking as to why this phenomenon is observed. Martín et alnoted that lymphatic dilation may be the mechanism of hair loss in lipedematous alopecia.

Diagnosis of LA involves assessing the clinical presentation and excluding conditions such as cutis verticis gyrata (CVG). CVG is a condition also characterized by increased scalp thickness but has a characteristic furrowing of the affected area that resembles the gyri of the brain, distinguishing it from LA. Moreover, CVG occurs more commonly in men, and magnetic resonance imaging will show an increase in the dermis with only a minimal expansion of the subcutaneous tissue.

Histomorphologic criteria of LA and LS include a thickened layer of subcutaneous fat with variable disruption of fatty architecture, no visible panniculitis or lipoma, the absence of inflammation, and normal hair follicles and adnexae. Diagnostic modalities include computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathology. Normal mean thickness of the scalp is between 5 and 8 mm, and pathologic scalp thickness in LA/LS is between 9 and 19 mm. Our patient's scalp thickness was 14 mm. Histology usually finds a normal epidermis and dermis as well as a hyperplasia of the subcutaneous adipose tissue.

### Mesenchymal extratesticular tumors and tumorlike conditions: from the radiologic pathology archives [^116LKLkE]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Both benign and malignant tumors and tumorlike conditions can arise from the nonepididymal extratesticular tissues. Benign tumors are far more common than malignant tumors, with lipoma being the most common lesion found at this site. Several imaging features can help narrow the differential diagnosis of these lesions, including the presence of fat and imaging features suggestive of fibrous tissue. Lesions that contain fat represent lipoma, liposarcoma, or angiomyofibroblastoma (AMF)-like tumor. If enhancing soft tissue is present in conjunction with fat, the differential diagnosis narrows further to just liposarcoma and AMF-like tumor. Lesions that display magnetic resonance imaging characteristics compatible with fibrous tissue are likely to be fibrous pseudotumor. However, many of the lesions in this location have overlapping imaging findings, and surgical excision is most often necessary for accurate diagnosis. The ability to narrow the differential diagnosis with imaging, however, is helpful for the clinician for both treatment planning and patient counseling.

### Common benign skin tumors [^112szV61]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Benign skin tumors are commonly seen by family physicians. The ability to properly diagnose and treat common benign tumors and to distinguish them from malignant lesions is a vital skill for all family physicians. Any lesions for which the diagnosis is uncertain, based on the history and gross examination, should be biopsied for histopathologic examination to rule out malignancy. Lipomas are technically subcutaneous soft tissue tumors, not skin tumors, and controversy exists about whether keratoacanthomas have malignant potential; however, both are discussed in this article because they are common tumors evaluated by family physicians. Diagnosis usually is based on the appearance of the lesion and the patient's clinical history, although biopsy is sometimes required. Treatment includes excision, cryotherapy, curettage with or without electrodesiccation, and pharmacotherapy, and is based on the type of tumor and its location. Generally, excision is the treatment of choice for lipomas, dermatofibromas, keratoacanthomas, pyogenic granulomas, and epidermoid cysts. Cherry angiomas and sebaceous hyperplasia are often treated with laser therapy and electrodesiccation. Common treatments for acrochordons and seborrheic keratoses are cryotherapy and shave excision. Referral is indicated if the family physician is not confident with the diagnostic evaluation or treatment of a lesion, or if a biopsy reveals melanoma.

### Folliculosebaceous cystic hamartoma with prominent adipose tissue resembling spindle cell lipoma [^112F4hKD]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Folliculosebaceous cystic hamartomas (FSCH) are a rare form of cutaneous hamartoma composed of follicular, sebaceous, and mesenchymal elements. These lesions are most often seen in the central face and scalp and rarely exceed 2 cm in size. Here, we report a case of a folliculosebaceous cystic hamartoma with a prominent adipose tissue component resembling a spindle cell lipoma. The patient is a 36-year-old man with a slowly enlarging, flesh-colored, lobulated lesion on his right ala that had been previously biopsied. The clinical differential included a hypertrophic scar or recurrent hamartoma. A full-thickness excisional biopsy was performed, which revealed prominent, large, irregularly shaped, folliculosebaceous structures, including multiple dilated follicles associated with prominent hyperplastic-appearing sebaceous glands, findings consistent with FSCH. The mesenchymal component contained a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells associated with mucin and thickened, ropey-appearing bundles of collagen, features mimicking a spindle cell lipoma. This combination of a folliculosebaceous cystic hamartoma with prominent adipose tissue resembling spindle cell lipoma is unusual and has only been previously reported once in the literature, and therefore, our case contributes to the expanding knowledge of this rare variant of FSCH.

### Lipomatous soft-tissue tumors [^115QHLT9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Lipomatous soft-tissue tumors are the most common neoplasms encountered by physicians. They range from benign lipomas to high-grade liposarcomas. Unplanned excisions of sarcomas are commonly due to the presumptive diagnosis of lipoma and can be avoided by understanding their diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging appearance. Magnetic resonance images should be obtained for all soft-tissue masses that are deep to fascia or those > 5 cm in subcutaneous tissue. Atypical lipomatous tumors present as large deep fatty masses and have a propensity for local recurrence and a small risk of malignant transformation. Well-differentiated liposarcomas are histologically identical to atypical lipomatous tumors but have a markedly worse prognosis secondary to their anatomic location. Masses that lack isointense signal to subcutaneous fat on MRI may represent a sarcoma and require a biopsy before definitive treatment. Large deep lipomatous masses and liposarcomas should be sent to a sarcoma referral center for definitive treatment.

### Aesthetic consideration in a patient with lipomatosis [^112L5s8p]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This is the first report of multiple parosteal lipomas as a late complication of aesthetic procedures. A 70-year-old woman presented with multiple frontal nodules that had grown slowly over 5 years. She underwent forehead-lifting surgery 30 years ago and botulinum toxin injection 3 years ago. Computed tomography showed six low-density nodules measuring 10 to 20mm just above the frontal bone. The tumors were resected via a parietal coronal incision. Histopathological findings revealed parosteal lipoma with foreign bodies. At 1 year postoperatively, there has been no recurrence or complications. The multiple lesions corresponded to the sites of the aesthetic procedures. The mesenchymal cells in the periosteum seemed to be stimulated by cytokines released from a postoperative hematoma or damaged periosteum, resulting in tumorigenesis. When performing aesthetic procedures in the face, care should be taken to avoid unnecessary injury to the periosteum, given the possibility of tumor development. Level of evidence: Level V, case report.

### Uncommon tumor, uncommon location: a dermal-based spindle cell / pleomorphic lipoma [^112oVFQc]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2016). Low credibility.

Spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma is an uncommonly encountered benign neoplasm that is usually found in the subcutaneous tissues. Rare cases reported in the literature have an intradermal location. This lesion usually presents as a subcutaneous nodule on the neck, shoulders, or back of middle-aged to elderly males. Although spindle cell and pleomorphic lipoma are currently considered the same entity, they were historically categorized separately. The authors report a case of hyperpigmented papule with an associated subcutaneous nodule on the left cheek of a 56-year-old man, review the literature, and discuss several important diagnostic pitfalls of spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma.

### The clinical evaluation of soft tissue tumors [^113gLFdy]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Soft tissue tumors range from benign subcutaneous lipomas to malignant deep high-grade sarcomas. Patients are evaluated with a thorough history and physical examination followed by imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice, although radiographs, computed tomography, and other modalities may be of value. Open or closed biopsy can be performed to establish a diagnosis. Treatment depends on the diagnosis and includes observation or marginal excision for benign lesions and wide resection for malignant masses, with radiation therapy or chemotherapy for large, high-grade tumors. An algorithm for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of soft tissue tumors is presented.

### Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (haberland syndrome): a mild case with bilateral cutaneous and ocular involvement [^115RfSiY]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

ECCL or Haberland syndrome was first described as an example of ectomesodermal dysgenesis. The condition does not have a gender, race, or geographic predisposition and is usually diagnosed at birth with nonprogressive cutaneous abnormalities of the face and scalp, along with benign ocular tumors.

Clinically, the hallmark cutaneous finding in a patient with ECCL is a fatty tissue nevus called a nevus psiloliparus that presents in a unilateral, or more rarely bilateral, distribution on the scalp. Nevus psiloliparus can present in various sizes with overlying patches of alopecia, in association with aplasia cutis congenita (didymosis aplasticopsilolipara), or in patchy or linear patterns that follow the lines of Blaschko. Histopathologically, nevus psiloliparus shows absence of mature hair follicles, arrested development of pilosebaceous units, focal areas of dermal fibrosis, increased subcutaneous fat extending into the upper reticular dermis, and orphaned arrector pili muscles within the dermis.,

The most common ophthalmologic manifestations of ECCL are benign ocular tumors called choristomas. These ocular growths include epibulbar or limbal dermoids and lipodermoids. Other less common ocular findings of ECCL include iris dysplasia, coloboma, optic nerve pallor, myopia, and microphthalmia.,

Neurologic symptoms of ECCL are varied and do not automatically correlate with the extent of anatomic involvement. Mental retardation, seizures, and motor impairment may develop over several years with variations in the severity of symptoms.,

Central nervous system manifestations of ECCL include intracranial lipomas commonly found in the cerebellopontine angle, spinal lipomas, arachnoid cysts, asymmetric changes in the cerebrum to include complete or partial atrophy of a hemisphere, porencephalic cysts, calcifications, dilated ventricles, and hydrocephalus. These malformations are commonly diagnosed through MRI and can present clinically as macrocephaly in cases involving hydrocephalus.

Lipomas and its variants are common soft tissue tumors, and however occur infrequently in the oral and maxillofacial region. Their incidence in the oral cavity is low among all oral lesions. Oral lipoma is yellowish and soft to palpation, and histologically can be mistaken by other lipoma variants. The aim of this study is to report a case of a lipoma located at the buccal fat pad which was removed through an extra-oral access. A 43-year-old male is presenting an augmentation in the right buccal region, being a soft consistency mobile lesion with 1.5cm of diameter, asymptomatic, and 2 years of growing. Computed tomography scan showed hypodensity compatible with adipose tissue. The lesion was removed through an extra-oral access. The lipoma described in this clinical report had an unusual location and once the lesion was very superficial an extra-oral access was the first treatment option despite the fact that was a benign tumor.

### Tumour in a tumour: a well-differentiated spindle cell sarcoma within a forearm lipoma [^113FJikn]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Lipomas are common, benign, soft tissue masses in adults. Sarcomatous change within a giant lipoma is a very rare event. We present a case of a woman presenting with a forearm lipoma that subsequently developed a central, well-differentiated, spindle-cell sarcoma within the lipoma. This case underlines the importance of identifying red flags for referral of soft tissue tumours.

Question 2: Which syndrome would you suspect?
A. Muir-Torre syndrome
B. Cowden syndrome
C. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome
D. Tuberous sclerosis
E. Type I neurofibromatosis

Answers:

A. Muir-Torre syndrome — Incorrect. Muir-Torre syndrome is a form of Lynch syndrome and is characterized by sebaceous skin tumors in association with internal malignancies, mainly colorectal cancers.
B. Cowden syndrome — Incorrect. Patients with Cowden syndrome usually develop trichilemmomas on their face along with oral papillomas; they may also have epidermal nevi, lipomas, and café-au-lait spots. These patients have an increased risk of malignancies, including skin squamous cell carcinomas.
C. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome — Correct. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome with numerous adnexal tumors, mainly localized on the scalp and face, histologically corresponding to spiradenomas, cylindromas, and trichoepitheliomas. Malignant transformation of lesions occurs in 5% to 10% of patients, heralded by rapid tumor growth, bleeding, or ulceration.
The occurrence of malignant transformation of trichoepithelioma into basal cell carcinoma is very rare or even questioned by some authors, arguing it actually represents unrecognized cases of basal cell carcinoma or collisions of two independent neoplasms, namely basal cell carcinoma and trichoepithelioma.
Additionally, patients have an increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the salivary glands. Regular clinical follow-up is fundamental, as the risks of malignant transformation and disease severity are not assessable ex ante on the basis of only genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Acral melanoma was a casual association in our case.
D. Tuberous sclerosis — Incorrect. The cutaneous features of tuberous sclerosis are, among others, ash leaf spots, facial angiofibromas, and Koenen periungual tumors.
E. Type 1 neurofibromatosis — Incorrect. Skin findings in type 1 neurofibromatosis include neurofibromas as well as café-au-lait spots and freckles.

### An unusual case of scalp laxity following weight reduction [^113xDacD]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The advent of fast foods, increased mechanization, advanced telecommunication and improved living standards have caused human beings to adopt sedentary life styles leading to lesser means of expending calories, accumulation of body fat and tendency to be obese. Plastic surgery can be of great help in supporting patients in their attempts at weight reduction by removing resistant body fat and excising redundant skin that may not succumb to other means of weight reduction. The authors present an unusual case of a young gentleman who developed a rare laxity of the scalp following a drastic weight reduction. Scalp reduction led to a significant cosmetic improvement and psychological acceptance of body image. A review of literature and discussion on the management of this unusual case follows.

### Lipedematous scalp and lipedematous alopecia: report of three cases in white adults [^1178iMZ1]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Lipedematous scalp (LS) and lipedematous alopecia (LA) are rare conditions of unknown etiology characterized by a thick and boggy scalp due to increase in the subcutaneous fat layer. Besides the changes in the texture of skin, varying degrees of hair loss are seen in patients with LA. In this report, we present two cases with LA and one case with LS in white adults. On examination, a boggy and soft swelling of the scalp was detected in all patients. In addition, the patients with LA had alopecic areas over the boggy scalp. Histopathologic examinations of skin biopsy specimens and magnetic resonance imaging of the scalp showed increased thickness of subcutaneous fat tissue in all patients. The exact etiopathogenesis of LA and LS remain unknown. These conditions may be either reactive or compansatory responses versus yet undetected stimuli, or represent a genetic tendency. Both of the these entities have been initially reported mostly in adult black females, however, we believe that LA and LS may well occur in white subjects and may be more widespread and frequently observed than previously supposed.

### Imaging spectrum of abnormal subcutaneous and visceral fat distribution [^1122YEEE]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Adipose tumors as differential diagnoses

Adipocytic tumors are the most common soft tissue tumors clinically, and radiologists always need to differentiate them from those conditions showing localized abnormal fat distribution discussed above. Here, we illustrate imaging findings of benign and intermediate adipose tumors (lipoma, angiolipoma, spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma, lipomatosis of nerve, and well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumor) which can be major differential diagnoses.

Lipoma accounts for approximately 50% of all soft tissue tumors and the most common subcutaneous neoplasm consists mainly of mature adipose tissue. Lipoma usually demonstrates an encapsulated high signal mass on T2- and T1-weighted images that contain thin septa less than 2 mm, with suppression on fat saturated images (Fig. 16), but some show a non-capsulated pattern. Lipoma commonly manifests as a solitary mass but can also manifest as multiple masses in 5–15% of cases. Those atypical lipomas can resemble non-neoplastic abnormal fat distribution conditions. Lipomas are usually asymptomatic, though local pain, tenderness, or nerve compression is reported when they become large. Abnormal non-neoplastic fat distribution conditions usually show no such symptoms though mechanical obstruction or metabolic dysfunction may also be present. Fat necrosis within a lipoma presents a variable imaging appearance with inflammatory or fibrotic change, and these can be difficult to differentiate from fat accumulation due to mechanical pressure or trauma, other benign adipose tumors, or well-differentiated liposarcoma.

Fig. 16
Superficial lipoma in a 60-year-old woman on the right shoulder. a T1-weighted image and (b) fat-suppressed T2-weighted show a homogeneous fatty mass (arrows) with a similar signal intensity to that of the adjacent subcutaneous fat but with a thin capsule and thin internal septa

Angiolipoma is a benign neoplasm consisted of mature adipose tissue and vascular structures. It represents as well-defined multiple, small subcutaneous mass with tenderness located commonly in the forearm, upper arm, or trunk. The MR imaging features of these lesions are the presence of fat nodules with or without low signal on T1- or T2-weighted images with or without high signal on fat saturated T2-weighted images representing the prominent vasculature (Fig. 17). Lipogranulomas found with post-traumatic lipoatrophy/lipohypertrophy would be the differential diagnosis, though the presence of pain, absence of traumatic history, and normal distribution of surrounding subcutaneous fat demonstrate the different nature of those conditions.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to rare tongue lipoma [^114EL2di]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipomas are benign soft tissue tumors composed of mature adipocytes, commonly found in subcutaneous tissues. Despite their prevalence in various body regions, they are relatively rare in the oral and maxillofacial regions. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and imaging characteristics, as well as the treatment outcomes of 57 patients diagnosed with lipoma. Among these, 42 cases (73.7%) were located in the oral-maxillofacial and head-neck regions, predominantly in areas with relatively abundant adipose tissue, including the facial/cheek area, parotid region, submental/submandibular area, and neck. In addition, this study presents a rare case of tongue lipoma in a 57-year-old male, highlighting the clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and treatment approach. The patient presented with a painless mass on the left side of the tongue that had gradually increased in size over 5 months. Physical examination revealed a firm, well-defined, moderately mobile mass measuring ~3.0×1.5 m. Imaging, including enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, suggested a diagnosis of lipoma, leading to surgical excision. The excised mass was yellowish, encapsulated, and soft. Intraoperative frozen section biopsy confirmed it as a fat-derived tumor consistent with a lipoma, and postoperative pathological examination further identified it as a spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma. The patient experienced a smooth recovery without complications, with normal tongue function restored. This case underscores the significance of including lipoma in the differential diagnosis of tongue masses and demonstrates the efficacy of surgical excision in managing such rare tumor.

### Symptomatic giant lipoma under the latissimus muscle [^1128pk9K]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Lipoma is a common benign tumor derived from stroma that can arise in any location where fat is normally present. Giant lipoma is defined as a lesion that is > 10cm in length and weighs > 1000g. Axillary region might have been exposed to microtraumas with each movement of upper extremity, leading to the development of giant lipoma. In this report, a 56-year-old man visited us because of a soft tissue mass on the left axilla that had been noticed 5 years before. We removed the tumor from the patient under general anesthesia. A lipoma measuring 21cm × 12cm in size was removed, and the weight of the mass was 455g. The case of our patient is very interesting because there have been few reported patients with a diagnosis of a giant lipoma in a sublatissimusdorsi muscle.

### Melanocytic nevus with spindle cell lipomatous metaplasia [^116Wvw53]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Melanocytic nevi can show a great number of morphological, cytoarchitectural, and stromal variations. Some of these histopathological patterns, infrequent or unusual, can occasionally produce diagnostic doubts or problems. A 22-year-old female patient presented a poorly pigmented cutaneous polypoid lesion of the scalp. Histopathological examination showed an intradermal melanocytic nevus composed of aggregates, nests, and cords of benign melanocytes, with collagenous stroma and large lipomatous areas. In the lipidized portion of the lesion, nevus cells, arranged in clusters, nests, and cords, were intimately associated with mature-appearing adipocytes, CD34-positive spindle cells, Alcian Blue-positive fibromyxoid stroma, and eosinophilic collagen bundles, findings resembling those typically seen in spindle cell lipoma. Spindle cell lipomatous metaplasia, rarely observed in some benign nonmelanocytic skin lesions, can be considered an additional unusual, not previously described, stromal variation occurring in melanocytic nevi.

Spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma is a benign, well-circumscribed subcutaneous mass commonly located in the posterior neck or shoulder in middle-aged men with frequent expression of androgen receptor. Histologically, spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma consists of adipocytes with varying proportions of spindle cells with rope-like collagen bundles. Fat is reported to be detectable in 89% of these lesions, ranging from 25% to 75% of the tumor volume on MRI. Non-adipose components are similar to those of skeletal muscle on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on fat-saturated fluid-sensitive sequences (Fig. 18) Intense enhancement of the non-adipose component further supports this diagnosis. The mass is generally firmer than lipomas or most conditions with non-neoplastic localized abnormal fat distribution. When it occurs in atypical locations, it becomes challenging to differentiate from liposarcomas or even other non-adipose soft tissue tumors.

Lipomatosis of a nerve is a rare, not fully understood benign condition, which has been referred to variously as fibrolipomatous hamartoma, perineural lipoma, fatty infiltration of the nerve, or neural fibrolipoma. This condition most commonly occurs in patients before 30 years of age, involving the median nerve of the wrist and hand. Accompanying varying degrees of mesenchymal overgrowth including adipose tissue with frequent sensory symptoms such as paresthesia or numbness, with or without macrodactyly, is the typical presentation (Fig. 19). The location and adipose tissue distribution interspersing nerve bundles are imaging findings distinctive from those of already discussed non-neoplastic abnormal fat distribution conditions.

### Influence of doctor-patient conversations on behaviours of patients presenting to primary care with new or persistent symptoms: a video observation study [^112vVio3]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Potential impact on timely diagnosis

We identified patient behaviours with potentially harmful consequences for timely diagnosis that resulted from both cognitive and emotional misalignments. Examples include non-attendance at follow-up appointments, declaring lack of trust in the primary care doctor to help resolve problems and deciding to seek help elsewhere (see table 2). Here, we discuss some examples of potential impacts on timely diagnosis in certain cases where it was possible to triangulate video, doctor and patient interview data (n = 7).

Table 2
Examples of potential impact on timely diagnosis

One patient attributed very low significance to a long-standing skin symptom. The patient was referred for suspected cancer (melanoma) on an urgent basis; however, to the doctor's surprise, she did not keep her appointment. Interview data with the patient revealed that the non-attendance may have resulted from a competing caring responsibility that was not discussed at the consultation.

In another case, the referral decision (for a breast change) was not clearly communicated, as cancer was not mentioned as a possibility (rather the doctor said they wanted to make sure 'it's not anything sinister') and thus their view of the severity of the problem was not shared with the patient. The patient reported feeling confused in the interview and only remembered the mention of a benign abscess being a possibility, leading to a loss of trust in the doctor. Greater transparency may have helped the patient understand the doctor's concerns.

Finally, a female patient presented with persistent hair loss and headache, which had high personal significance, whereas medical tests did not reveal anything concerning. The consultation did not lead to a mutually acceptable result as the doctor did not take the issue any further (eg, with diagnostic tests or a referral). During the interview, the patient emphasised that her scalp had not been examined, when in fact, the video shows an examination of her scalp. The unresolved discrepancy between the patient's and doctor's view of the significance of presenting problem appears to have left the patient with an overall negative impression of the consultation, which affected which details of the conversation were remembered, as well as the patient's behaviour. In this case, the patient said she would not return to the doctor and would seek help elsewhere.

These examples illustrate how unacknowledged differences between the doctor and patient in their perception of the significance of the patient's presenting problem can influence patient behaviour and experience.

### Perspectives of patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans on diagnostic delays, surgical outcomes, and nonprotuberance [^1155K8hv]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study does have several limitations. No pathologic examination reports or pathologic slides were examined to verify diagnosis, allowing for potential errors by patients completing the survey. The study was not designed with a control group. In addition to the daily FBSG survey advertisements, many PAB members sent private Facebook messages to members of their DFSP FBSG reminding them to participate in the survey, but these reminders were not tracked. Advertisements were posted only to members of private DFSP FBSGs or emailed to patients in the nonprofit organization database, so there may be a selection bias toward patients who are literate, are technologically savvy, and have internet access.

We thought that deceased patients would be represented through surviving family FBSG members. Members of the DFSoP FBSG groups are aware of several FBSG members who died from DFSoP. However, no mortalities were reported in our survey. Deceased patients and those with poor performance status may be underrepresented, creating the possibility of a fit patient selection bias. Women represented 79.0% of respondents, which is larger than the previously reported female DFSoP incidence of 53.1%. Our data likely have a selection bias toward females, skewed by the higher proportion of women using Facebook (77% of female internet users, compared with 66% of men at the time of our survey)and that women are 1.5 times more likely to complete a survey. Furthermore, we did not investigate whether there is a racial bias to our study design.

Recommendations

It is concerning that DFSoP most often clinically mimics a cyst, lipoma, or scar, but removal of those lesions is often considered a cosmetic procedure. We recommend biopsy or removal of lesions in the following scenarios: lesions resembling a cyst but lacking a punctum or history of draining malodorous material, lesions resembling a scar but lacking a history of previous surgery or trauma, and lesions resembling a cyst, scar, or lipoma that are larger than 2.5 cm, are increasing in size over time, or are concerning to the patient. Patients should be counseled that any change in pain, color, size, or shape of their lesion should prompt expedient reevaluation by a clinician; lesions suspicious for sarcoma are ideally referred directly to a comprehensive cancer center. Biopsy with microscopic evaluation of tissue is the only way to be sure of the diagnosis of cyst, lipoma, or scar vs DFSoP or other malignant neoplasms.

### Imaging of spindle cell lipoma [^111Bbwob]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To review the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of spindle cell lipoma (SCL) with emphasis on the location of these tumours and the spectrum of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) appearances.

Materials and Methods

The MRI and CT findings of 27 histopathologically proven SCLs were evaluated retrospectively. Imaging features evaluated included margins, percentage visible fat, MRI signal characteristics, oedema, and contrast enhancement patterns.

Results

Patient ages ranged from 18 to 80 years with an average age of 56.5 years. Men were affected twice as frequently as women (M = 18, F = 9). SCLs ranged in size from 2 to 10 cm, with an average greatest dimension of 5.5 cm. Five lesions (19%) contained no visible fat on CT or MRI, and the leading differential diagnosis of high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma diagnosis was suggested by referring surgeons. Five lesions (19%) had < 50% fatty areas, nine lesions (52%) demonstrated > 50% but < 90% fat at MRI or CT. Only three of 25 lesions (12%) had an appearance of a typical lipoma on unenhanced MRI sequences. All SCLs that were imaged with contrast medium (n = 18) demonstrated some degree of enhancement, with eight (44%) showing marked enhancement, four (22%) showing moderate, and six (33%) minimal enhancement.

Conclusion

SCLs have considerably variable imaging appearances and may have minimal or no visible fat at MRI or CT. Imaging features may make it difficult to distinguish this benign tumour from a potentially higher-grade malignant tumour.

### Minimal-scar segmental extraction of lipomas: study of 122 consecutive procedures [^111RmEwo]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical extirpation of lipomas that occur in cosmetically conspicuous areas of the body leaves a visible scar that is usually disfiguring. Minimal-scar segmental extraction (MSE) employs a much smaller incision and extraction and is particularly useful in exposed parts of the body. It can be easily performed in an office setting.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the merits of MSE in clinical practice. Unlike other reports in the literature that describe, anecdotally, minimally invasive methods of lipoma removal, our study examined a new method by carefully measuring the results in a larger group of consecutive patients treated using this technique.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective study was performed using data from 91 consecutive patients with a total of 122 lipomas that were treated using MSE. MSE of lipomas consists of a small stab incision and blind dissection of the tumor followed by its extraction in a segmental fashion. This procedure involves small instrumentation, minimal dissection with preservation of contour, and complete removal of the lipoma, including substantial portions of the capsule. Clinical data, including complications, outcomes, and recurrence rates, were recorded.

Results

The procedure was well tolerated by patients, who were pleased with the results, particularly the small scar. The incidence of complications was 1.6% (n = 2) and consisted of hematoma (n = 1) and seroma (n = 1). The recurrence rate was 0.8% (n = 1). No long-term morbidity was noted.

Conclusions

The technical ease with which the MSE can be performed, coupled with a low recurrence rate, makes it a very cost-effective operation. The smaller postoperative scars, rapid healing, and low morbidity allow for better patient acceptance. We recognize the advantages and limitations of this procedure and encourage its use in selected patients.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^114HwMac]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Early palliative care assessment — scope and triggers emphasize that prognostication includes the risk of death and the expected functional and cognitive recovery or other outcomes that may be important to the patient, and the "surprise question" is an excellent tool to use as part of a comprehensive palliative care screen. Early palliative care assessment and screening has several purposes, including identifying the health care proxy or surrogate decision maker, identifying any pre-existing advance directives, living will, or do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, understanding the family and social contexts, and assessing prognosis; once this screening is completed and reveals a need, immediately initiate appropriate basic palliative care services and support high-risk patients with comprehensive palliative care, with timelines and goals outlined for comprehensive palliative screening and assessment.

Liver Tumors

In rare cases, combined oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer among women who use combined oral contraceptives. However, liver cancers are rare. There is insufficient data to determine whether POPs increase the risk of liver tumors.

Diabetic Women

Diabetic women taking POPs do not generally require changes in the amount of insulin they are taking. However, your healthcare professional may monitor you more closely under these conditions.

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES (STDs)

WARNING: POPs do not protect against getting or giving someone HIV (AIDS) or any other STD, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital warts or herpes.

SIDE EFFECTS

Irregular Bleeding

The most common side effect of POPs is a change in menstrual bleeding. Your periods may be either early or late, and you may have some spotting between periods. Taking pills late or missing pills can result in some spotting or bleeding.

Other Side Effects

Less common side effects include headaches, tender breasts, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and fatigue. Depression, nervousness, leg pain, vaginal discharge, fluid retention, allergic reactions, jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, loss of scalp hair, rash/itchy rash, weight gain, acne and extra hair on your face and body have been reported, but are rare.

Trials in Patients with Early Parkinson's Disease (without L-dopa)

Trial 1 was a 12-week multicenter trial in which 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were enrolled and 41 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 22 to placebo. Patients had a mean disease duration of approximately 2 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn & Yahr Stage I-IV. This scale, ranging from I = unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to V = confined to wheelchair or bed, is a standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinson's disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score.

Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or 5 mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at trial endpoint was 7.4 mg/day. Mean baseline UPDRS motor score was 18.6 for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 19.9 for patients treated with placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 6).

### Association of Do-not-resuscitate orders and hospital mortality rate among patients with pneumonia [^117SJ9Tb]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hospital quality measures that do not account for patient do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status may penalize hospitals admitting a greater proportion of patients with limits on life-sustaining treatments.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of analytic approaches accounting for DNR status on risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates and performance rankings.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted among adults hospitalized with pneumonia in 303 California hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2011. We used hierarchical logistic regression to determine associations between patient DNR status, hospital-level DNR rates, and mortality measures. Changes in hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates after accounting for patient DNR status and interhospital variation in the association between DNR status and mortality were examined. Data analysis was conducted from January 16 to September 16, 2015.

Exposures

Early DNR status (within 24 hours of admission).

Main Outcomes and Measures

In-hospital mortality, determined using hierarchical logistic regression.

Results

A total of 90,644 pneumonia cases (5.4% of admissions) were identified among the 303 California hospitals evaluated during 2011; mean (SD) age of the patients was 72.5 (13.7) years, 51.5% were women, and 59.3% were white. Hospital DNR rates varied (median, 15.8%; 25th-75th percentile, 8.9%-22.3%). Without accounting for patient DNR status, higher hospital-level DNR rates were associated with increased patient mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for highest-quartile DNR rate vs lowest quartile, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.32), corresponding to worse hospital mortality rankings. In contrast, after accounting for patient DNR status and between-hospital variation in the association between DNR status and mortality, hospitals with higher DNR rates had lower mortality (adjusted OR for highest-quartile DNR rate vs lowest quartile, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70–0.89), with reversal of associations between hospital mortality rankings and DNR rates. Only 14 of 27 hospitals (51.9%) characterized as low-performing outliers without accounting for DNR status remained outliers after DNR adjustment. Hospital DNR rates were not significantly associated with composite quality measures of processes of care for pneumonia (r = 0.11; p = 0.052); however, DNR rates were positively correlated with patient satisfaction scores (r = 0.35; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Failure to account for DNR status may confound the evaluation of hospital quality using mortality outcomes, penalizing hospitals that admit a greater proportion of patients with limits on life-sustaining treatments. Stakeholders should seek to improve methods to standardize and report DNR status in hospital discharge records to allow further assessment of implications of adjusting for DNR in quality measures.

### Coherent movement of error-prone individuals through mechanical coupling [^116BEYfu]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We investigate how reliable movement can emerge in aggregates of highly error-prone individuals. The individuals-robotic modules-move stochastically using vibration motors. By coupling them via elastic links, soft-bodied aggregates can be created. We present distributed algorithms that enable the aggregates to move and deform reliably. The concept and algorithms are validated through formal analysis of the elastic couplings and experiments with aggregates comprising up to 49 physical modules-among the biggest soft-bodied aggregates to date made of autonomous modules. The experiments show that aggregates with elastic couplings can shrink and stretch their bodies, move with a precision that increases with the number of modules, and outperform aggregates with no, or rigid, couplings. Our findings demonstrate that mechanical couplings can play a vital role in reaching coherent motion among individuals with exceedingly limited and error-prone abilities, and may pave the way for low-power, stretchable robots for high-resolution monitoring and manipulation.

### A design strategy for high mobility stretchable polymer semiconductors [^113bQWLQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As a key component in stretchable electronics, semiconducting polymers have been widely studied. However, it remains challenging to achieve stretchable semiconducting polymers with high mobility and mechanical reversibility against repeated mechanical stress. Here, we report a simple and universal strategy to realize intrinsically stretchable semiconducting polymers with controlled multi-scale ordering to address this challenge. Specifically, incorporating two types of randomly distributed co-monomer units reduces overall crystallinity and longer-range orders while maintaining short-range ordered aggregates. The resulting polymers maintain high mobility while having much improved stretchability and mechanical reversibility compared with the regular polymer structure with only one type of co-monomer units. Interestingly, the crystalline microstructures are mostly retained even under strain, which may contribute to the improved robustness of our stretchable semiconductors. The proposed molecular design concept is observed to improve the mechanical properties of various p- and n-type conjugated polymers, thus showing the general applicability of our approach. Finally, fully stretchable transistors fabricated with our newly designed stretchable semiconductors exhibit the highest and most stable mobility retention capability under repeated strains of 1,000 cycles. Our general molecular engineering strategy offers a rapid way to develop high mobility stretchable semiconducting polymers.

### Coherent transfer of Cooper pairs by a movable grain [^116TFoNt]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Superconducting circuits that incorporate Josephson junctions are of considerable experimental and theoretical interest, particularly in the context of quantum computing. A nanometre-sized superconducting grain (commonly referred to as a Cooper-pair box) connected to a reservoir by a Josephson junction is an important example of such a system. Although the grain contains a large number of electrons, it has been experimentally demonstrated that its states are given by a superposition of only two charge states (differing by 2e, where e is the electronic charge). Coupling between charge transfer and mechanical motion in nanometre-sized structures has also received considerable attention. Here we demonstrate theoretically that a movable Cooper-pair box oscillating periodically between two remote superconducting electrodes can serve as a mediator of Josephson coupling, leading to coherent transfer of Cooper pairs between the electrodes. Both the magnitude and the direction of the resulting Josephson current can be controlled by externally applied electrostatic fields.

### Movable type printing method to synthesize high-entropy single-atom catalysts [^117KwNXz]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The controllable anchoring of multiple isolated metal atoms into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities, while the synthesis of catalysts with multiple single metal atoms remains a challenge and has been rarely reported. Herein, we present a general route for anchoring up to eleven metals as highly dispersed single-atom centers on porous nitride-doped carbon supports with the developed movable type printing method, and label them as high-entropy single-atom catalysts. Various high-entropy single-atom catalysts with tunable multicomponent are successfully synthesized with the same method by adjusting only the printing templates and carbonization parameters. To prove utility, quinary high-entropy single-atom catalysts (FeCoNiCuMn) is investigated as oxygen reduction reaction catalyst with much more positive activity and durability than commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work broadens the family of single-atom catalysts and opens a way to investigate highly efficient single-atom catalysts with multiple compositions.

### Long-term unsupervised mobility assessment in movement disorders [^1129GC1Z]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Mobile health technologies (wearable, portable, body-fixed sensors, or domestic-integrated devices) that quantify mobility in unsupervised, daily living environments are emerging as complementary clinical assessments. Data collected in these ecologically valid, patient-relevant settings can overcome limitations of conventional clinical assessments, as they capture fluctuating and rare events. These data could support clinical decision making and could also serve as outcomes in clinical trials. However, studies that directly compared assessments made in unsupervised and supervised (eg, in the laboratory or hospital) settings point to large disparities, even in the same parameters of mobility. These differences appear to be affected by psychological, physiological, cognitive, environmental, and technical factors, and by the types of mobilities and diagnoses assessed. To facilitate the successful adaptation of the unsupervised assessment of mobility into clinical practice and clinical trials, clinicians and researchers should consider these disparities and the multiple factors that contribute to them.

### Legless soft robots capable of rapid, continuous, and steered jumping [^116X1vJ2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Jumping is an important locomotion function to extend navigation range, overcome obstacles, and adapt to unstructured environments. In that sense, continuous jumping and direction adjustability can be essential properties for terrestrial robots with multimodal locomotion. However, only few soft jumping robots can achieve rapid continuous jumping and controlled turning locomotion for obstacle crossing. Here, we present an electrohydrostatically driven tethered legless soft jumping robot capable of rapid, continuous, and steered jumping based on a soft electrohydrostatic bending actuator. This 1.1 g and 6.5 cm tethered soft jumping robot is able to achieve a jumping height of 7.68 body heights and a continuous forward jumping speed of 6.01 body lengths per second. Combining two actuator units, it can achieve rapid turning with a speed of 138.4° per second. The robots are also demonstrated to be capable of skipping across a multitude of obstacles. This work provides a foundation for the application of electrohydrostatic actuation in soft robots for agile and fast multimodal locomotion.

Patients commonly present with cosmetic concerns or symptoms related to compression of surrounding tissue. A single incision or punch excision will generally allow manual expression of the lipoma without difficulty when standard excision is not required.
12. 17 Pyogenic granulomas are yellow to purplish, pulpy vascular lesions often surrounded by a scaly collarette. They are usually removed because of their rapid growth and tendency to bleed. The differential diagnosis includes Spitz nevi, amelanotic melanoma, and squamous or basal cell carcinoma. Treatment options include shave excision with electrodesiccation of the base, and laser ablation 18. Dermatofibromas appear gradually over months and may persist for years. Although multiple dermatofibromas may be present, large numbers are rare. A multiple eruptive variant occurs in only 0.

3% of patients, many of whom are immunocompromised. 19 Diagnosis is based on the appearance of firm, raised, papules or nodules, ranging from tan to reddish brown. They tend to be darker at the center and fade to normal skin color at the margin. Dermatofibromas exhibit dimpling or retraction of the lesion beneath the skin with lateral compression. 20 No treatment is required unless there is a change in size or color, or bleeding or irritation from trauma. A 2012 study found that 73% of patients who underwent laser ablation reported satisfaction with the results.
21. Seborrheic keratoses generally do not require treatment unless they become irritated or the patient has cosmetic concerns. They may be treated with electrodesiccation, laser ablation, curettage, cryosurgery, or shave excision if biopsy is required.

They can be treated effectively with electrodesiccation or laser ablation.
