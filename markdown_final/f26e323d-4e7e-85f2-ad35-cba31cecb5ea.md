## Question

What's the dosing regimen for Valtrex when treating Bell's Palsy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dosing regimen for Valtrex (valacyclovir) when treating Bell's palsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether valacyclovir is indicated for Bell's palsy and in what context. Then, I should verify the exact dose, frequency, and duration from authoritative sources. Next, I will check for conflicting dosing statements and reconcile them. After that, I need to consider timing relative to symptom onset and whether it should be combined with corticosteroids. Finally, I should review special populations, safety, and summarize a practical recommendation with caveats about evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the indication and context. Valacyclovir for Bell's palsy is an off-label, adjunctive therapy considered primarily when combined with corticosteroids within 72 hours of symptom onset; antiviral monotherapy is not recommended because it lacks benefit over placebo and is inferior to steroids alone, so I need to ensure I'm not implying standalone antiviral use here [^e74b3482] [^0f49d4c5] [^b7eed12d].

> Now, I should verify the exact regimen. Multiple FDA sources consistently state the adult dose for adjunctive treatment of Bell's palsy is 1,000 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, which aligns with the 2025 FDA update and earlier labels, so the core regimen is 1 g PO BID for 7 days [^74a4d502] [^2078caf0].

> Wait, let me verify a potential conflict. One FDA excerpt lists 1 g PO TID for 7 days, which would be 3 g/day rather than 2 g/day; hold on, I should verify which source is more authoritative and whether this reflects a different indication or a typographical discrepancy. Given that the most recent FDA entries and multiple prior labels consistently specify 1 g BID for 7 days, and no guideline endorses TID for Bell's palsy, I should treat the TID statement as an outlier or a labeling inconsistency and default to the BID regimen supported by the weight of evidence and labeling consensus [^74a4d502] [^2078caf0] [^befcae6d].

> Next, I should review timing and combination therapy. The benefit of any antiviral addition is modest at best and likely limited to patients treated within 72 hours of onset; therefore, if used, valacyclovir should be paired with a corticosteroid such as prednisone 50–60 mg daily for 5 days followed by a 5-day taper, or prednisolone 50 mg daily for 10 days, recognizing that steroids are the mainstay with proven benefit and antivirals are optional adjuncts [^7afc7c5a] [^ab59a100] [^f71d6452].

> I need to check special populations and dose adjustments. In renal impairment, valacyclovir requires dose reduction; for CrCl 30–50 mL/min, limit to 1 g once daily and avoid more frequent dosing, for CrCl 10–30 mL/min, reduce to 500 mg once daily, and for CrCl < 10 mL/min, reduce to 500 mg every 48 hours, with additional caution in older adults who may have reduced renal function and higher adverse event risk; no adjustment is needed for hepatic disease, and pregnancy decisions should be individualized with shared decision-making given limited safety data in this context [^0024beb8] [^30991fcd] [^6f63783c] [^00374ba9] [^2e94880b] [^0f49d4c5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy. I should confirm the strength of evidence. High-quality randomized trials and meta-analyses show no consistent added benefit of valacyclovir over steroids alone for complete recovery, though some analyses suggest a possible reduction in long-term sequelae like synkinesis; thus, if used, it should be framed as an optional adjunct with modest, uncertain benefit and discussed using shared decision-making, especially in patients with severe paralysis at presentation where a small signal for benefit has been explored [^9be28789] [^6f846455] [^7afc7c5a] [^cd918616].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable answer is: for adults with Bell's palsy, the valacyclovir regimen is 1,000 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, ideally started within 72 hours of symptom onset and combined with a corticosteroid regimen such as prednisone 50–60 mg daily for 5 days followed by a 5-day taper, or prednisolone 50 mg daily for 10 days; adjust dosing for renal impairment as above, and avoid antiviral monotherapy [^74a4d502] [^ab59a100] [^0f49d4c5].

---

The standard adult dose of Valtrex (valacyclovir) for Bell's palsy is **1,000 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^74a4d502] [^2078caf0], typically started within 72 hours of symptom onset and combined with corticosteroids [^7afc7c5a] [^ab59a100]. Antiviral monotherapy is **not recommended** [^0f49d4c5] because it is ineffective [^6f846455]; valacyclovir should only be used with steroids, and the benefit is modest at best [^cd918616]. Adjust the dose for renal impairment [^30991fcd] and monitor for adverse effects such as nausea, headache, and rare neuropsychiatric symptoms.

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Standard adult dose**: 1,000 mg orally twice daily (every 12 hours) for 7 days [^74a4d502] [^2078caf0].
- **Timing**: Initiate within 72 hours of symptom onset for optimal benefit [^7afc7c5a] [^ab59a100].
- **Combination therapy**: Always administer with corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 50–60 mg daily for 5 days, then taper over 5 days) [^ab59a100] [^f71d6452].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the dosing regimen

Evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses supports the use of valacyclovir with corticosteroids, showing a **modest reduction in incomplete recovery and synkinesis** compared with steroids alone [^6f846455] [^e06ef00e]. However, valacyclovir monotherapy is ineffective and should not be used [^0f49d4c5] [^6f846455].

---

## Special considerations and adjustments

### Renal impairment

Dose adjustments are **required** based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):

| **Creatinine clearance (crcl)** | **Recommended dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| > 50 mL/min | No adjustment required [^00374ba9] |
| 30–50 mL/min | Maximum 1 g orally every 24 hours [^0024beb8] |
| 10–30 mL/min | 500 mg orally every 24 hours [^30991fcd] |
| < 10 mL/min | 500 mg orally every 48 hours [^6f63783c] |

---

### Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is **required** for hepatic impairment [^2e94880b].

---

### Pediatric patients

Valacyclovir is **not routinely recommended** for pediatric Bell's palsy due to limited evidence; if used, dosing is weight-based and should be guided by a pediatric specialist.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Valacyclovir is **generally well tolerated**; common adverse effects include:

- Nausea
- Headache
- Diarrhea
- Fatigue

Rare adverse effects include **neuropsychiatric symptoms** (confusion, agitation) and renal dysfunction, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving high doses.

---

## Comparison with alternative antiviral agents

Valacyclovir is preferred over acyclovir due to **higher oral bioavailability and less frequent dosing** [^2b6595e3]. Famciclovir is an alternative, but evidence supporting its use is less robust than for valacyclovir [^76010fe7].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommend:

- **Corticosteroids**: Strongly recommended for all patients with new-onset Bell's palsy [^c5f54c6c] [^157c9159].
- **Antivirals**: May be considered as an adjunct to corticosteroids, particularly in severe cases, but the benefit is modest [^7afc7c5a] [^cd918616].
- **Antiviral monotherapy**: Not recommended [^0f49d4c5] [^bd0cfaa6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Standard adult patient | Valacyclovir 1,000 mg orally twice daily for 7 days + corticosteroids [^74a4d502] [^ab59a100] |
| Renal impairment (CrCl 30–50 mL/min) | Valacyclovir 1,000 mg orally once daily for 7 days + corticosteroids [^0024beb8] |
| Renal impairment (CrCl 10–30 mL/min) | Valacyclovir 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days + corticosteroids [^30991fcd] |
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 10 mL/min) | Valacyclovir 500 mg orally every 48 hours for 7 days + corticosteroids [^6f63783c] |
| Pediatric patients | Not routinely recommended; consult pediatric specialist |

---

The standard adult dose of Valtrex for Bell's palsy is **1,000 mg orally twice daily for 7 days**, combined with corticosteroids and started within 72 hours of onset. Antiviral monotherapy is ineffective, and dose adjustments are necessary for renal impairment.

Bell's palsy — antiviral monotherapy: Clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. Strong recommendation (against) based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of confidence in evidence: High. Evidence shows that antiviral therapy alone is no better than placebo with regard to facial nerve recovery in Bell's palsy and is inferior to steroid therapy with regard to facial nerve recovery rate, with acyclovir and valacyclovir the most extensively studied antivirals. The most comprehensive randomized controlled trial failed to find an improved rate of facial nerve recovery in 207 patients treated with valacyclovir alone, compared with 209 patients treated with placebo alone. Reported harms note gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) with rare severe reactions (hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, hepatic or renal failure), no serious adverse events were noted in the Bell's palsy literature, and antiviral therapy may carry an increased risk for pregnant patients. In summary, antiviral therapy alone (acyclovir or valacyclovir) is not recommended in the treatment of Bell's palsy due to lack of effectiveness of currently available drugs, unnecessary cost, and the potential for drug-related complications.

Objective

To review the evidence evaluating the efficacy and safety of antiviral agents to reduce morbidity associated with Bell's palsy.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched (all up to April 2006) for English-language, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of antiviral agents in Bell's palsy. Search terms included Bell's palsy, acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, and randomized controlled trials.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated efficacy and safety endpoints of antiviral agents in the treatment of Bell's palsy were included. Primary efficacy outcomes included facial paralysis recovery profile, facial paralysis recovery index, and the House-Brackmann facial nerve grading scale. Safety outcomes were also identified by each trial.

Data Synthesis

Two prospective, randomized clinical trials were included in this review, both involving the use of acyclovir for treatment of Bell's palsy. Acyclovir monotherapy was shown to be inferior to prednisone monotherapy; however, the combination of acyclovir and prednisone was found to be superior to prednisone alone. There are limited data describing the safety of acyclovir in Bell's palsy.

Conclusions

The use of acyclovir in the treatment of Bell's palsy remains controversial. Additional, adequately powered, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to definitively support its use. For the time being, the evidence reviewed in this article would favor the combination of acyclovir and prednisone if commenced within the first 72 hours of symptom onset.

### Do either corticosteroids or antiviral agents reduce the risk of long-term facial paresis in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy? [^a2904df5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The cause of Bell's palsy remains uncertain, although accumulating evidence suggests a viral etiology. To date, treatment to minimize long-term deficits from this disorder typically includes anti-inflammatory or antiviral medication.

Clinical Question

Do corticosteroids or antiviral agents, either alone or in combination, reduce the risk of long-term facial paresis in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy?

Evidence Review

Three multicenter, randomized, controlled trials enrolled over 1,500 adult patients with paroxysmal, unilateral paresis of cranial nerve VII and treated them with varying regimens and combinations of prednisolone, antiviral agents, and placebo, and evaluated complete recovery up to 12 months later.

Results

The two larger, most recent trials incorporated similar factorial designs to allow for comparisons between steroids, antivirals, both combined, and placebo, and assessed recovery using validated measures of facial nerve function. In the larger, blinded trial, the numbers needed to treat to achieve complete recovery for patients in the prednisolone and acyclovir groups at 9 months were 7.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.9–13.7) and 18.7 (95% CI 9.5-infinity), respectively. The number needed to treat to achieve complete recovery for patients in the valacyclovir plus prednisolone group vs. the prednisolone alone group in the second trial was 14.8 (95% CI 9.1–744.8).

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that prednisolone, an inexpensive and readily available medication, is effective for this common condition, but there was no statistically significant difference observed with acyclovir. Valacyclovir provides minimal added benefit to prednisolone alone.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^7afc7c5a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — combination antiviral therapy with steroids (Statement 5B) may be offered within 72 hours of symptom onset as an option for patients with Bell's palsy, with aggregate evidence quality Grade B, a small potential improvement in facial nerve function, treatment side effects and cost as risks, and an equilibrium of benefit and harm; exceptions include diabetes, morbid obesity, previous steroid intolerance, and individualized management in pregnancy. Trial data include 221 patients showing higher full facial nerve recovery at 6 months with valacyclovir plus prednisolone versus placebo plus prednisolone (96.5% vs 89.7%); a meta-analysis of 18 trials found a 25% reduced risk of incomplete nerve recovery with combination therapy versus steroids alone (relative risk [RR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56–1.00), with an estimate that 26 patients would require treatment to achieve 1 better facial nerve outcome than with steroid therapy alone, and an additional large trial of 829 patients within 72 hours of onset has been published. Due to the potential of a small benefit and relatively low risk, the guideline development group concluded that patients may be offered combination therapy if treated within 72 hours of onset of Bell's palsy, with a large role for shared decision making.

### Prednisolone – but not antiviral drugs – improves outcome in patients with Bell's palsy [^8b0189c8]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have provided compelling evidence that treatment with prednisolone improves outcome in patients with acute idiopathic peripheral facial (Bell's) palsy. The low rate of adverse effects, the small number needed to treat, and the modest cost of therapy indicate that prednisolone should be used in all patients with facial palsy of < 72 h duration who do not have contraindications to steroid therapy. By contrast, the best-designed recent clinical trials have failed to suggest any significant beneficial effect on Bell's palsy of treatment with acyclovir or valacyclovir, either as single agents or in combination with prednisolone. Antiviral therapy should not, therefore, be routinely used in the treatment of Bell's palsy.

Methods

The study was approved by the ethics committee of Centre de recherche du Centre intégré universitaire de santé et services sociaux du Nord-de-l'île-de-Montréal (MP-32-2017-1365; start date in January 2017 and end date October 2021), which was the organization responsible for the study' s integrity and process. All patients gave their written, free and informed consent to participate. This study followed the CONSORT guidelines and recommendations for transparent, controlled trials and was registered (ISRCTN93896690). Retrospective registration took place as the study was initially designed to gather pilot data, but then ethic approbation was obtained to increase the number of participants and do a randomized trial.

All patients were recruited from either the Emergency or the Otorhinolaryngology Departments of two tertiary acute care centers. They were examined in ambulatory care settings, where they received information about the project and consented (or not) to be contacted by the research team. They were medically stable before Bell's Palsy onset. Other inclusion criteria were: (1) first episode of Bell's Palsy; (2) moderately severe to total Bell's Palsy (i.e. House-Brackmann 2.0 grade 4, 5 and 6) at baseline (i.e. 10–14 days post-onset); (3) the recommended drug regimen for severe and total Bell's Palsy (1000 mg valacyclovir three times daily for 7 days and 50 mg prednisone once daily for 10 days) within 72 h post onset; and (4) normal cognitive status based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Exclusion criteria were: (1) active psychiatric interventions; (2) history of head and neck cancer with chemo or radiotherapy; and (3) bilateral facial palsy. The research team set up the first appointment to confirm patient's eligibility. When eligible, allocation to the control group or MEPP group was performed by a researcher (K.M.) who was not in direct contact with the patients, through a sealed email that was open in front of the patient, following computerized balanced (1:1 ratio) block randomization. A power calculation based on a similar studyin chronic Bell's Palsy revealed an effect size of 1.2, meaning that 12 patients per group had to be recruited to reach a power of 83%. As our study took place in the acute phase of BP, recruitment was increased up to 20 patients per group.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This review was conducted to the suggested QUOROM guideline standards. We began our meta-analysis by performing a detailed literature search for articles published between 1984 (year that aciclovir was licensed for clinical use) and January 2009 using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In addition, we searched reference lists of systematic reviews for appropriate articles. Hand searching of conference abstract books was not performed. Our search terms included: "bell palsy", "bell's palsy", "bell's palsies", "bells palsy", "idiopathic facial paralyses", "idiopathic facial paralysis", "herpetic facial paralysis", "anti-viral agents", "acyclovir", "valacyclovir", "famcyclovir", and "famciclovir". Steroids were not included in the search terms as we were not interested in studies that only assessed the benefits of steroids alone. Two independent investigators performed the search.

We included all randomised controlled trials that compared steroids with the combination of steroids and antivirals in patients with Bell's palsy. No studies were excluded on the basis of language. Other inclusion criteria included: at least one month of follow-up after treatment initiation; and an assessment of facial muscle recovery, as determined by a recognised scoring system such as the House-Brackmann grade, Yanagihara score, or the facial paralysis recovery index. We excluded animal studies, review articles, meta-analyses, case series, studies involving children or pregnant women, studies lacking a control group, studies that did not report the proportion of patients with facial recovery, and studies comparing steroids with antivirals alone. Where duplicate papers using overlapping data sets were published, the study with the larger population was included.

Results

Studies included

The results of our search strategy are shown in fig 1. A total of 521 studies were extracted from the search. Fourteen studies met our inclusion criteria and underwent thorough review. Of these, eight were removed for the following reasons: they were not a randomised study (n = 3); the proportion of patients with facial muscle recovery was not documented (n = 3); they comprised a conference abstract only (n = 1); or they studied a poorly defined intervention (n = 1). Of the six remaining studies, four were double blind, one was a single blind, and one was a non-blinded randomised controlled trial.

Fig 1 Flow diagram of the study selection process. The initial study numbers from each database do not represent the number of unique articles. Duplicate articles from different databases were removed in the first exclusion stage

The study demographics and clinical characteristics of the six included studies are shown in tables 1and 2, respectively. A total of 574 patients who received steroids alone and 571 patients who received steroids and antivirals were included. Three studies used aciclovir as the antiviral, two studies used valaciclovir, and one study used famciclovir. Most of the included studies were of high quality (Jadad score ≥ 3) except for Minnerop et al, which was not blinded. Studies varied with respect to the duration of symptoms before treatment initiation and length of follow-up. Two studies subdivided patients into those who presented early for treatment (≤ 3 days of symptom onset)and those who presented later (> 3 days). Length of follow-up varied between studies and ranged from 4 months to more than 12 months; some trials had multiple follow-up times.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^93a372d7]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — antiviral agents alone or added to steroids did not show significant benefit in high-quality trials. The Class I studies compared outcomes in patients randomized to antivirals and placebo and also compared antivirals plus steroids with steroids alone; Class II studies compared antivirals plus steroids with steroids alone. Valacyclovir was used in one study whereas acyclovir was used in the others, and the majority were enrolled within 3 days of onset. None of the Class I studies demonstrated improvement with antivirals vs placebo (random-effects Mantel-Haenszel pooled RD 0, 95% CI −8% favoring steroids alone to 7% favoring antivirals plus steroids), and no significant benefit of antivirals added to steroids was observed in the Class I and II studies. When added to steroids, acyclovir showed significant benefit in only one Class III study, with analysis pooled RD 4% favoring steroids plus antivirals, 95% CI −4% to 12%. No study demonstrated a significant increase in any adverse event with antiviral agents.

### Antiviral agents added to corticosteroids for early treatment of adults with acute idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (Bell palsy) [^e06ef00e]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Compared with oral corticosteroids alone, are oral antiviral drugs associated with improved outcomes when combined with oral corticosteroids in patients presenting within 72 hours of the onset of Bell palsy?

Bottom Line

Compared with oral corticosteroids alone, the addition of acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famcyclovir to oral corticosteroids for treatment of Bell palsy was associated with a higher proportion of people who recovered at 3- to 12-month follow-up. The quality of evidence is limited by heterogeneity, imprecision of the result estimates, and risk of bias.

### Bell palsy: rapid evidence review [^a81fa8f4]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy should be suspected in patients with acute onset of unilateral facial weakness or paralysis involving the forehead in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities. The overall prognosis is good. More than two-thirds of patients with typical Bell palsy have a complete spontaneous recovery. For children and pregnant women, the rate of complete recovery is up to 90%. Bell palsy is idiopathic. Laboratory testing and imaging are not required for diagnosis. When other causes of facial weakness are being considered, laboratory testing may identify a treatable cause. An oral corticosteroid regimen (prednisone, 50 to 60 mg per day for five days followed by a five-day taper) is the first-line treatment for Bell palsy. Combination therapy with an oral corticosteroid and antiviral may reduce rates of synkinesis (misdirected regrowth of facial nerve fibers manifesting as involuntary co-contraction of certain facial muscles). Recommended antivirals include valacyclovir (1 g three times per day for seven days) or acyclovir (400 mg five times per day for 10 days). Treatment with antivirals alone is ineffective and not recommended. Physical therapy may be beneficial in patients with more severe paralysis.

### Corticosteroids vs corticosteroids plus antiviral agents in the treatment of Bell palsy… [^3235228e]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Nowadays, the treatment of choice for Bell palsy has not yet been established. The therapeutic drug choices for the treatment of the idiopathic facial paralysis are corticosteroids, antiviral therapy, and a combination of corticosteroids with an antiviral agent. To perform the intention-to-treat analysis, all patients who were initially allocated to each treatment group were analyzed together, regardless of whether they completed or received that treatment. Subgroup analyses were performed depending on the duration between disease onset and the start of therapy, the type and dosage of the corticosteroid and antiviral agent used in each study group, and studies in which physicians who performed assessments of the outcomes were actually aware of allocated treatment.

Regarding the type of corticosteroid, patients in 4 studies received prednisolone, whereas in 1 study deflazacort was used. In the combined therapy group, the regimen included the corticosteroid plus an antiviral agent, acyclovir or valacyclovir. In all studies the drugs were administered orally. Details about the daily dose and the length of regimen of each study group are presented in Table 2. In all studies, the procedure of follow-up included assessments of the patients for at least 3 months. The number of patients who were lost during the follow-up period in each study group was reported in 4 of 5 eligible studies. 14, 15, 17, 18 All trials used the full recovery of facial nerve motor function as the main outcome measure. Patients in 4 trials14, 15, 17, 19 commenced therapy within 3 days of onset of the disease. The initial severity of the facial nerve dysfunction was reported in 3 studies14, 15, 17.

In the study by Hato et al, 14 treatment started within 7 days of disease onset, and for this subgroup analysis the results of patients recruited within 3 days were used. In a further subgroup analysis, in which studies administering the same type of antiviral agent were analyzed, the rate of patients with complete recovery of facial motor function did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups.

### The benefits of steroids versus steroids plus antivirals for treatment of Bell's palsy: a meta-analysis [^6a2cbaf5]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and future research

In patients with Bell's palsy, adding antivirals to steroids does not provide an added benefit in achieving at least partial facial muscle recovery compared with steroids alone; therefore, this meta-analysis does not support the routine addition of antivirals to steroids in Bell's palsy. The benefit of antiviral therapy combined with steroids for patients with severe facial muscle paralysis at presentation who do not have Varicella zoster virus reactivation is, however, an ongoing question. Future prospective double blind studies that use modern diagnostics, such as polymerase chain reaction, for the detection of Herpes virus reactivation are needed to resolve this issue. In addition, such trials should study newer antivirals, such as valaciclovir or famciclovir, on the basis of their improved bioavailability over aciclovir.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^fcaf2b6d]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — subgroup evidence (severe palsy and zoster sine herpete): We found limited evidence of the efficacy of steroids and antivirals in important subgroups, including severe palsy at presentation and possible zoster sine herpete. In one Class I study, severe palsy defined by a Sunnybrook Scale score of 0 to 25 showed no significant difference in 12-month recovery between prednisolone alone and prednisolone plus valacyclovir (RD 0.2% favoring valacyclovir 95% CI, −18% to 17.6%). A Class IV study observed a significant improvement in recovery (RD 26.6%) with prednisone plus famciclovir versus prednisone alone in severe Bell palsy (House-Brackmann Scale score of 5 or 6), but this study had a high risk of bias because of pseudo-randomized treatment allocation and unmasked outcome assessment. Another Class IV study observed no significant difference in a subgroup of 28 patients with evidence of zoster reactivation, reporting a hazard ratio for recovery 1.6 favoring prednisone plus valacyclovir, 95% CI 0.4 to 6.1.

### Aciclovir or valaciclovir for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^5239b80f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The most common disorder of the facial nerve is acute idiopathic facial paralysis or Bell's palsy and there may be significant morbidity or incomplete recovery associated with severe cases.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of aciclovir or similar agents for treating Bell's palsy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group register (searched April 2003), MEDLINE (from January 1966 to April 2003), EMBASE (from January 1980 to April 2003) and LILACS (from January 1982 to April 2003). We also contacted authors of identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of aciclovir or valaciclovir therapy, alone or in combination with any other drug, in patients with Bell's palsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified six randomised trials.

Main Results

Three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 246 patients. One study evaluated aciclovir with corticosteroid versus corticosteroid alone, another study evaluated aciclovir alone versus corticosteroid and a further study evaluated valaciclovir with corticosteroid versus corticosteroid alone or versus placebo alone. Incomplete recovery after one year: data were not available. An analysis was performed on data reported at the end of the study period in each trial. The results from one study four months after the start of treatment significantly favoured the treatment group, whilst the results of the study three months after the start of treatment significantly favoured the control group. The results from the second study at four months showed no statistically significant difference between the three groups. Adverse events: relevant data were not reported in any of the three trials. Complete facial paralysis six months after start of treatment: only one patient had complete paralysis upon entering one of the studies. This patient was assigned to the control group and the level of recovery attained was not reported. Motor synkinesis or crocodile tears one year after start of treatment: data were available up to a maximum of four months after onset of paralysis. One study reported a significant difference between the treatment groups in favour of the aciclovir plus corticosteroid group over corticosteroid alone, another demonstrated an inconclusive result with no difference between the aciclovir and corticosteroid. The third study did not comment upon these sequelae.

Reviewers' Conclusions

More data are needed from a large multicentre randomised controlled and blinded study with at least 12 months' follow up before a definitive recommendation can be made regarding the effect of aciclovir or valaciclovir on Bell's palsy.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^44d9424b]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — recommendations for future research: It is unlikely that additional research regarding the efficacy of steroids will change the current estimate of its effect, and large randomized trials comparing outcomes in patients with Bell palsy receiving steroids with or without antivirals would help in determining whether the addition of antivirals to steroid treatment results in a modest benefit. Such trials should be powered to allow pre-specified subgroup analyses, and further research efforts should be directed toward determining the optimal dose and timing of steroids, the effect of other therapeutic modalities, and the identification of the effect of steroids in specific populations, such as in children.

### Valacyclovir and prednisolone treatment for Bell's palsy: a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^f7f3eb3c]. Otology & Neurotology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of valacyclovir and prednisolone in comparison with those of placebo and prednisolone for the treatment of Bell's palsy, excluding zoster sine herpete.

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled study.

Setting

Six academic tertiary referral centers.

Patients

Ultimately, 221 patients with Bell's palsy who were treated within 7 days of the onset. Serological and polymerase chain reaction examinations were performed to distinguish Bell's palsy from zoster sine herpete.

Intervention

The patients were treated with either valacyclovir (dosage, 1,000 mg/d for 5 days) plus prednisolone (VP [n = 114]) or placebo plus prednisolone (PP [n = 107]) administered orally.

Main Outcome Measure

Recovery from the palsy was defined as a score higher than 36 using Yanagihara 40-point scoring system without facial contracture or synkinesis. The patients were followed up until complete recovery occurred or for more than 6 months in cases with a poor prognosis.

Results

The overall rate of patient recovery among those treated with VP (96.5%) was significantly better (p < 0.05) than the rate among those treated with PP (89.7%). The rate of patient recovery was also analyzed by classifying the initial severity of facial palsy. In cases of complete or severe palsy, the rates of patients treated with VP and PP who recovered were 95.7% (n = 92) and 86.6% (n = 82), respectively; the recovery rate for treatment with VP was significantly better than that with PP (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The valacyclovir and prednisolone therapy was more effective in treating Bell's palsy, excluding zoster sine herpete, than the conventional prednisolone therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled study of an antiviral agent in the treatment of a sufficient number of Bell's palsy cases based on an etiologic background.

### Effectiveness comparisons of antiviral treatments for Bell palsy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^76010fe7]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antiviral treatments for Bell palsy have been widely used, but there is no definite conclusion of which is the most effective antiviral drug. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including network meta-analysis to investigate the comparative effectiveness of antiviral treatments for Bell palsy.

Data

RCTs comparing effectiveness between antiviral treatments and placebo were included. Risk of bias within and across studies was assessed with the Cochrane tool and the GRADE approach, respectively. Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses were conducted, followed by network meta-analysis.

Sources

Three electronic databases were searched from inception to May 18, 2020.

Study Selection

11 trials and 3393 patients with four arms and eleven contrasts were included.

Results

Significant differences were observed between placebo and famciclovir with respect to overall recovery and no statistically significant differences were found from other comparisons. Treatment ranking based on the evidence network indicated that famciclovir shared the best results, followed by valacyclovir, acyclovir, and finally placebo. Adverse events of famciclovir were too rare and slight to be analyzed. Our confidence in pairwise comparisons was moderate to low, due to study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision; our confidence in ranking was moderate, due to study limitations. Inconsistency is not deemed to exist by a loop-specific approach and node-splitting procedure. Results of exploring publication bias are satisfying.

Conclusions

According to pairwise and network comparisons, famciclovir could be better than placebo and the effectiveness of other antiviral treatments are similar. For clinical efficacy, famciclovir obtains the best recovery rate of facial function for Bell palsy. Acyclovir has the lowest rate of synkinesis, though, it is not adequately recommended and more superior trails are needed in the future.

### Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^cd918616]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Bell palsy — treatment recommendations: For patients with new-onset Bell palsy, oral steroids should be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial nerve function (Level A). For patients with new-onset Bell palsy, antivirals (in addition to steroids) might be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial function (Level C). Patients offered antivirals should be counseled that a benefit from antivirals has not been established, and, if there is a benefit, it is likely that it is modest at best (RD < 7%).

### Valacyclovir (valacyclovir hydrochloride) [^c4a3a369]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial 3 was a single-dose pharmacokinetic, multiple-dose safety trial in 28 pediatric subjects aged 1 to less than 12 years with clinically suspected HSV infection. None of the subjects enrolled in this trial had genital herpes. Each subject was dosed with valacyclovir oral suspension 10 mg/kg twice daily for 3 to 5 days. Acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects following valacyclovir oral suspension were compared with historical acyclovir systemic exposures in immunocompetent adults receiving the solid oral dosage form of valacyclovir or acyclovir for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes. The mean projected daily acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects across all age-groups (1 to less than 12 years) were lower (Cmax: ↓ 20%, AUC: ↓ 33%) compared with the acyclovir systemic exposures in adults receiving valacyclovir 500 mg twice daily but were higher (daily AUC: ↑ 16%) than systemic exposures in adults receiving acyclovir 200 mg 5 times daily. Insufficient data are available to support valacyclovir for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes in this age-group because clinical information on recurrent genital herpes in young children is limited; therefore, extrapolating efficacy data from adults to this population is not possible. Moreover, valacyclovir has not been studied in children aged 1 to less than 12 years with recurrent genital herpes.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of valacyclovir tablets, 906 were 65 and over, and 352 were 75 and over. In a clinical trial of herpes zoster, the duration of pain after healing (post-herpetic neuralgia) was longer in subjects 65 and older compared with younger adults. Elderly patients are more likely to have reduced renal function and require dose reduction. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or CNS adverse events [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6	Renal Impairment

Dosage reduction is recommended when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

### Comparing the use of high-dose to standard-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of Bell's palsy in adults – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^0d4481ff]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy is typically treated with oral corticosteroids (40–60 mg daily). Concomitant antivirals are currently not recommended. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effect of high-dose versus standard-dose corticosteroids, without antivirals, in the management of Bell's palsy.

Databases Reviewed

Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing high-dose (≥ 80 mg) or standard-dose (40–60 mg) corticosteroid therapy for Bell's palsy were included. Exclusion criteria were coexisting antiviral treatment, nonoral drug delivery, and facial palsy due to other causes. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. A weighted estimate of treatment effects across trials as odds ratios (OR) using a Mantel-Haenzel random-effects model was calculated.

Results

Three articles were included in the analysis, representing 485 patients. There was a significant decrease in nonrecovery with high-dose, compared with standard-dose, corticosteroids at 6 months follow-up (OR = 0.17, 95% confidence interval = 0.05–0.56, p = 0.004). Overall adverse events were 5.8% (n = 28), all reported in one study in the high-dose group (transient elevated liver enzymes and fecal occult blood).

Conclusions

Our analysis shows a favorable effect of high-dose corticosteroid in the treatment of Bell's palsy. It is the first to evaluate this effect without the use of antivirals in keeping with current treatment recommendations. As all included studies had a serious risk of bias, future research should focus on larger trials with more robust methodology. This will allow for more up-to-date and large-scale analyses where more valid conclusions can be drawn that may potentially influence treatment protocols.

### A small effect of adding antiviral agents in treating patients with severe Bell palsy [^d72ad7b4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

In this evidence-based case report, the authors studied the following clinical question: What is the effect of adding antiviral agents to corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with severe or complete Bell palsy? The search yielded 250 original research articles. The 6 randomized trials of these that could be used all reported low-quality data for answering the clinical question; apart from apparent flaws, they did not primarily include patients with severe or complete Bell palsy. Complete functional facial nerve recovery was seen in 75% of the patients receiving prednisolone only and in 83% with additional antiviral treatment. The pooled risk difference of 7% (95% confidence interval, -1% to 15%) results in a number needed to treat of 14 (ie, slightly favors adding an antiviral agent). The authors conclude that although a strong recommendation for adding antiviral agents to corticosteroids to further improve the recovery of patients with severe Bell palsy is precluded by the lack of robust evidence, it should be discussed with the patient.

Bell's palsy — research needs and trial priorities include the following: Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) recommendations should be followed in all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with evaluation of patients before, during, immediately after, and months later and collection of quality-of-life data; the timing and outcomes for patients with and without surgical facial nerve decompression need to be compared, including surgical approach (ie, middle fossa), age (young vs old), and time to improvement compared with traditional medical management groups (ie, steroids and/or antivirals); future clinical trials should compare eye care tactics; the benefits and risks of steroid use in children with Bell's palsy need to be better elucidated; further study is needed to compare concurrent combined steroids and antiviral therapy with designs allowing subgroup analysis; more rigorous randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effectiveness of acupuncture; and the efficacy of different physical therapy modalities on asymmetry, symmetry of voluntary movement, and synkinesis needs to be elucidated.

### Antivirals for Bell's palsy? [^7626f852]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK around 1 in 5,000 people develop Bell's palsy-idiopathic unilateral lower motor neurone facial weakness of rapid onset. Although about 70% recover spontaneously, the remaining 30% are at risk of complications;(1) 13% have residual slight weakness and about 16% have persistent moderate to severe weakness if not treated.(2) As we have discussed in two previous articles there has been longstanding controversy about the best form of treatment.(2,3) In 2006 we concluded that published trials on the efficacy of drug treatments have been poor and no firm conclusions can be drawn about the benefit of any single drug;(2) in 2008 we noted that evidence suggests oral prednisolone started within 72 hours of symptom onset makes recovery more likely and that there was little good evidence that an antiviral drug helps.(3) The place of antivirals in the management of Bell's palsy remains a controversial issue. In this article we review the evidence for antiviral therapy alone or in conjunction with corticosteroid treatment.

Discussion

Principal findings

Our meta-analysis of data from six randomised controlled trials shows that a high proportion of patients with Bell's palsy achieve at least partial facial recovery when given steroids or steroids and antivirals (89.7% overall using per protocol data). Our pooled odds ratio for facial muscle recovery showed that antivirals provided no added benefit over steroids alone (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 2.69; P = 0.18). The two highest quality studies, which were double blind, had the greatest effect on the pooled odds ratio. Subgroup analysis of patients treated within three days of symptom onset showed similar findings, with no benefit seen with combination therapy. Likewise, subgroup analysis of length of follow-up and type of antiviral showed no benefit of antivirals in addition to steroids.

There are, however, more subtle differences between the included studies that need to be explored. Firstly, the severity of facial muscle paralysis at presentation differed between two of the more recent studies. The mean House-Brackmann grade for patients in the Sullivan et al study, which showed no benefit of adding aciclovir to steroids, was 3.6, whereas the mean score was 4.3 in the Hato et al study, which reported a significant benefit of adding valaciclovir. In subgroup analyses, Hato et al showed that the benefit of valaciclovir was greater in patients with severe facial paralysis at presentation than in those with moderate paralysis. Furthermore, Minnerop et al performed a subgroup analysis of patients who presented with severe facial muscle paralysis (House-Brackmann grade of 5 or 6) and found significantly better facial muscle recovery in patients who received famciclovir plus steroids than in those on steroids alone (72% v 47%, respectively, achieved normal function). However, only 18 and 17 patients respectively were included in this analysis. These data suggest that antiviral therapy may benefit in particular those patients with more severe facial paralysis at presentation. On the other hand, one of the most recently published trials, by Engstrom et al, is in opposition to this argument. Patients in this trial had a median House-Brackmann grade of 4 at presentation, which is very similar to the level of palsy observed by Hato et al, and the authors convincingly showed no benefit of adding valaciclovir to steroids alone.

Bell palsy — overall effect of antivirals: For patients with acute-onset Bell palsy, it is highly likely that antivirals do not moderately (RD > 7%) increase the likelihood of improved facial functional recovery (2 Class I studies). The pooled results of studies with a low risk of bias lack the statistical precision to exclude a modest benefit (RD favoring antivirals ≤ 7%) or modest harm (RD favoring steroids alone ≤ 8%).

Bell palsy — steroids for new-onset facial weakness improved complete recovery in randomized trials. Both studies enrolled patients within 3 days of the onset of facial weakness, used prednisone regimens of 60 mg/d for 5 days followed by a 5-day taper or 25 mg BID for 10 days, and employed masked outcome assessment with high follow-up. The 2 Class I studies demonstrated a significant increase in the probability of complete recovery in patients randomized to steroids (RD favoring steroids 12.8% and 15%), translating to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6 to 8, and it is highly likely that steroids are effective in increasing the probability of complete facial recovery. Adverse events (AEs) from steroids were generally minor and temporary, with insomnia and dyspepsia most commonly reported.

Secondly, the definition of the primary end point, facial muscle recovery, was slightly different in the six studies. The two highest quality studies used complete facial recovery (House-Brackmann grade of 1) as their primary end point, whereas the remainder of the studies used partial facial recovery (House-Brackmann grade of ≥ 2). It is unclear how this disparity would change the final results, but if the increment of benefit of antivirals was small then using partial facial muscle recovery as the end point could show more favourable results for combination therapy. This issue also introduces the question of the best end point to use for a disease in which a very high proportion of patients recover with current standard therapy (steroids alone). Time to facial muscle recovery may be a more sensitive end point. This end point was analysed by Engstrom et al and no differences were observed between treatment arms. Moreover, three other prospective studies that were not included in our analysis owing to the fact that they used time to facial muscle recovery as the outcome measure showed no statistically significant difference in recovery rates with combination therapy. These studies were small, however, and may have been underpowered to show a significant difference in time to recovery.

Thirdly, investigators studying Bell's palsy rarely perform thorough molecular diagnostic testing for viral aetiologies. Varicella zoster virus, for example, can cause facial muscle paralysis in the absence of vesicles (zoster sine herpete) and has been reported to be associated with 8% to 28% of Bell's palsy cases. This virus is less sensitive to antivirals than are other viruses associated with Bell's palsy, and the doses used in treatment trials are generally not high enough to treat a Varicella zoster virus infection. Thus, if patients with this type of infection were included in the trials studied in this meta-analysis, as may be the case for the Sullivan et al and Engstrom et al studies, the potential benefit of antiviral therapy may be diluted.

Finally, the type of antiviral used also varied between studies, and the newer agents (valaciclovir and famciclovir) have greater oral bioavailability. We observed no difference in results when the studies were grouped on the basis of antiviral used.

### High-dose corticosteroids for adult Bell's palsy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^9f163d43]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of high-dose corticosteroids (initial prednisolone [PSL] of 100mg or more daily) and standard-dose corticosteroids (initial PSL of 50-60mg) in patients with Bell's palsy.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ichushi-Web, Web of Science, and CINAHL, combined with data from ClinicalTrials.gov.

Study Selection

Published and unpublished cohort studies comparing high- and standard-dose corticosteroids in adult patients with Bell's palsy were included.

Data Extraction

Study characteristics (study design, patient's number), patient characteristics (sex, age, disease severity, prescription of antivirals), and outcomes (nonrecovery, any adverse effects).

Data Synthesis

From the 1,974 identified articles, 8 studies were met eligible criteria. Of the included studies, the initial dose in high-dose corticosteroids regimens varied from 120mg to 200mg PSL daily. Compared with standard-dose corticosteroids, high-dose corticosteroids were associated with a significantly decreased nonrecovery at 6 months after disease onset (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.22–0.80; very low quality) in patients with Bell's palsy. No severe adverse effects were observed in patients receiving high- or standard-dose corticosteroids.

Conclusion

High-dose corticosteroids reduce nonrecovery in patients with Bell's palsy. The dose of high-dose corticosteroids was varied and further prospective study is needed to identify an adequate dose of corticosteroids in these patients.

### The effect of study design and analysis methods on recovery rates in Bell's palsy [^96e88656]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

We investigated how study design affects the rate of recovery in Bell's palsy.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial.

Methods

Data were extracted from the Scandinavian Bell's palsy study, which included 829 patients. The study design was factorial; 416 patients given prednisolone, 413 not given prednisolone, 413 patients given valacyclovir, 416 not given valacyclovir. Data were analyzed with intention-to-treat principle and complete-case analysis methods and recovery was defined as Sunnybrook score 100, House-Brackmann grade I or ≤ grade II at 12 months.

Results

With the intention-to-treat principle and last-observation-carried-forward method (n = 829) and recovery defined as Sunnybrook 100, 300 of the 416 patients (72%) receiving prednisolone had recovered compared with 237 of the 413 (57%) who did not receive prednisolone (P < .0001). With recovery defined as House-Brackmann grade I, the corresponding recovery rates were 324 of 416 (78%) and 266 of 413 (64%) (P < .0001). With complete-case analysis and recovery defined House-Brackmann grade I (n = 782), 335 of 389 patients (86%) given prednisolone recovered compared with 277 of 393 (70%) in the group not given prednisolone (P < .0001). With recovery defined as House-Brackmann ≤ grade II (n = 797), the corresponding recovery rates were 380 of 396 (96%) and 353 of 401 (88%) (P < .0001). The analysis method affected the recovery rates in the valacyclovir and no-valacyclovir groups in a similar way as in the prednisolone and no-prednisolone groups.

Conclusions

Recovery rates in a Bell's palsy study are substantially affected by the choice of analysis method and definition of recovery.

The pharmacokinetic profile and safety of valacyclovir oral suspension in children aged less than 12 years were studied in 3 open-label trials. No efficacy evaluations were conducted in any of the 3 trials.

Trial 1 was a single-dose pharmacokinetic, multiple-dose safety trial in 27 pediatric subjects aged 1 to less than 12 years with clinically suspected varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Trial 2 was a single-dose pharmacokinetic and safety trial in pediatric subjects aged 1 month to less than 6 years who had an active herpes virus infection or who were at risk for herpes virus infection. Fifty-seven subjects were enrolled and received a single dose of 25 mg/kg valacyclovir oral suspension. In infants and children aged 3 months to less than 6 years, this dose provided comparable systemic acyclovir exposures to that from a 1-gram dose of valacyclovir in adults (historical data). In infants aged 1 month to less than 3 months, mean acyclovir exposures resulting from a 25-mg/kg dose were higher (Cmax: ↑ 30%, AUC: ↑ 60%) than acyclovir exposures following a 1-gram dose of valacyclovir in adults. Acyclovir is not approved for suppressive therapy in infants and children following neonatal HSV infections; therefore, valacyclovir is not recommended for this indication because efficacy cannot be extrapolated from acyclovir.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^47ace4c5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — evidence-based statement categories and clinician implications define four levels: A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong; clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

Subgroup analyses

We performed subgroup analyses related to the sources of heterogeneity we determined a priori. We observed no benefit of adding antivirals to steroids in patients who received treatment within three days (odds ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 3.34; P = 0.31)or after three days (2.15, 0.48 to 9.60; P = 0.32)of symptom onset. When studies were stratified by length of follow-up (≤ 3 months v > 3 months), no difference in outcome was observed between the shorter follow-up period (0.93, 0.63 to 1.36; P = 0.70)and longer follow-up period (1.50, 0.83 to 2.69; P = 0.18). Type of antiviral had no effect on the overall results (data not shown). The F test for interaction was not significant for any subgroup.

Bell palsy — clinical context for steroid use and timing: Although there is strong evidence that steroid use increases the probability of good facial functional recovery in patients with Bell palsy, it does not necessarily follow that all patients with Bell palsy need to take steroids. For example, it would be reasonable for a clinician to opt not to use steroids in a patient with brittle diabetes mellitus, and because the studies included only patients presenting early after palsy onset, it is difficult to determine the effect of steroid or antiviral treatment in patients presenting later in the course of their illness (e.g., 1 week after the onset of facial weakness).

### Prednisolone and valaciclovir in Bell's palsy: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial [^9be28789]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous trials of corticosteroid or antiviral treatments for Bell's palsy have been underpowered or have had insufficient follow-up. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term and long-term effects of prednisolone and valaciclovir in the recovery of the affected facial nerve in a large number of patients.

Methods

In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial, patients aged 18 to 75 years who sought care directly or were referred from emergency departments or general practitioners within 72 h of onset of acute, unilateral, peripheral facial palsy, between May, 2001, and September, 2006, were assessed. Patients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of eight to receive placebo plus placebo; 60 mg prednisolone per day for 5 days then reduced by 10 mg per day (for a total treatment time of 10 days) plus placebo; 1000 mg valaciclovir three times per day for 7 days plus placebo; or prednisolone (10 days) plus valaciclovir (7 days). Follow-up was for 12 months. The primary outcome event was time to complete recovery of facial function, as assessed with a regional Sunnybrook scale score of 100 points. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00510263.

Findings

Of 839 patients who were randomly assigned, 829 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis: 206 received placebo plus placebo, 210 prednisolone plus placebo, 207 valaciclovir plus placebo, and 206 prednisolone plus valaciclovir. Time to recovery was significantly shorter in the 416 patients who received prednisolone compared with the 413 patients who did not (hazard ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.64; p < 0.0001). There was no difference in time to recovery between the 413 patients treated with valaciclovir and the 416 patients who did not receive valaciclovir (1.01, 0.85 to 1.19; p = 0.90). The number of patients with adverse events was similar in all treatment arms.

Interpretation

Prednisolone shortened the time to complete recovery in patients with Bell's palsy, whereas valaciclovir did not affect facial recovery.

### The benefits of steroids versus steroids plus antivirals for treatment of Bell's palsy: a meta-analysis [^71a1333d]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Bell's palsy is the abrupt paralysis of the facial nerve, resulting in an inability to control facial muscles on the affected side. A common condition, Bell's palsy has an annual incidence of 11 to 40 cases per 100 000 population. Many patients recover without intervention; however, up to 30% have poor recovery of facial muscle control and experience facial disfigurement, psychological trauma, and facial pain. Two main types of pharmacological treatment have been used to improve outcomes from Bell's palsy: steroids and antivirals. The rationale for these treatments is based on the presumed pathophysiology of Bell's palsy, namely inflammation and viral infection.

For decades, surgeons have noted facial nerve swelling during decompression surgery. More recently, enhancement of the facial nerve on magnetic resonance imaging has been observed in Bell's palsy, suggesting that inflammation is in part responsible for the associated paralysis. As a consequence, steroids have been used to treat Bell's palsy and have been shown to significantly improve outcomes compared with placebo.

The neuronal inflammation associated with Bell's palsy is thought to be secondary to viral infection. Herpes simplex virus has been detected in the endoneurial fluid in patients with Bell's palsy. On the basis of this evidence, some clinicians treat patients with antivirals, including aciclovir, famciclovir, and valaciclovir. The benefits of antivirals alone are not clear, thus the role of combination therapy with steroids plus antivirals has been investigated for the treatment of Bell's palsy. Studies have produced somewhat conflicting results, however, and there is debate over the effectiveness of antivirals on top of steroids. The most recent guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology suggest that aciclovir combined with prednisone is "possibly effective" for Bell's palsy. Despite a lack of clear evidence, many clinicians treat Bell's palsy with combination therapy. Given the emergence of this clinical practice and the conflicting data on the benefits of antivirals over and above those of steroids, we performed a meta-analysis to determine whether steroid treatment plus antivirals provides a better degree of facial muscle recovery than does steroids alone.

American Academy of Neurology guideline update — steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy reports that for patients with new-onset Bell palsy, steroids are highly likely to be effective and should be offered to increase the probability of recovery of facial nerve function (2 Class I studies, Level A) (risk difference 12.8%–15%). For patients with new-onset Bell palsy, antiviral agents in combination with steroids do not increase the probability of facial functional recovery by > 7%; because of the possibility of a small increase in recovery, patients might be offered antivirals (in addition to steroids) (Level C), and patients offered antivirals should be counseled that a benefit from antivirals has not been established, and, if there is a benefit, it is likely that it is modest at best. Results also note Nine studies published since June 2000 on patients with Bell palsy receiving steroids/antiviral agents were identified, with Two of these studies rated Class I.

### Valacyclovir (valacyclovir hydrochloride) [^2b6595e3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Valacyclovir is an antiviral drug active against α-herpes viruses [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of valacyclovir and acyclovir after oral administration of valacyclovir tablets have been investigated in 14 volunteer trials involving 283 adults and in 3 trials involving 112 pediatric subjects aged 1 month to less than 12 years.

Absorption and Bioavailability

After oral administration, valacyclovir hydrochloride is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and nearly completely converted to acyclovir and L -valineby first-pass intestinal and/or hepatic metabolism.

The absolute bioavailability of acyclovir after administration of valacyclovir tablets is 54.5% ± 9.1% as determined following a 1-gram oral dose of valacyclovir tablets and a 350-mg intravenous acyclovir dose to 12 healthy volunteers. Acyclovir bioavailability from the administration of valacyclovir tablets is not altered by administration with food (30 minutes after an 873 Kcal breakfast, which included 51 grams of fat).

Acyclovir pharmacokinetic parameter estimates following administration of valacyclovir tablets to healthy adult volunteers are presented in Table 3. There was a less than dose-proportional increase in acyclovir maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the acyclovir concentration-time curve (AUC) after single-dose and multiple-dose administration (4 times daily) of valacyclovir tablets from doses between 250 mg to 1 gram.

There is no accumulation of acyclovir after the administration of valacyclovir at the recommended dosage regimens in adults with normal renal function.

Distribution

The binding of valacyclovir to human plasma proteins ranges from 13.5% to 17.9%. The binding of acyclovir to human plasma proteins ranges from 9% to 33%.

### The benefits of steroids versus steroids plus antivirals for treatment of Bell's palsy: a meta-analysis [^ec6419c1]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether steroids plus antivirals provide a better degree of facial muscle recovery in patients with Bell's palsy than steroids alone.

Design Meta-analysis.

Data sources PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published in all languages from 1984 to January 2009. Additional studies were identified from cited references.

Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that compared steroids with the combination of steroids and antivirals for the treatment of Bell's palsy were included in this study. At least one month of follow-up and a primary end point of at least partial facial muscle recovery, as defined by a House-Brackmann grade of at least 2 (complete palsy is designated a grade of 6) or an equivalent score on an alternative recognised scoring system, were required.

Review methods Two authors independently reviewed studies for methodological quality, treatment regimens, duration of symptoms before treatment, length of follow-up, and outcomes. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and pooled using a random effects model.

Results Six trials were included, a total of 1145 patients; 574 patients received steroids alone and 571 patients received steroids and antivirals. The pooled odds ratio for facial muscle recovery showed no benefit of steroids plus antivirals compared with steroids alone (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 2.69; P = 0.18). A one study removed analysis showed that the highest quality studies had the greatest effect on the lack of difference between study arms shown by the odds ratio. Subgroup analyses assessing causes of heterogeneity defined a priori (time from symptom onset to treatment, length of follow-up, and type of antiviral studied) showed no benefit of antivirals in addition to that provided by steroids.

Conclusions Antivirals did not provide an added benefit in achieving at least partial facial muscle recovery compared with steroids alone in patients with Bell's palsy. This study does not, therefore, support the routine use of antivirals in Bell's palsy. Future studies should use improved herpes virus diagnostics and newer antivirals to assess whether combination therapy benefits patients with more severe facial paralysis at study entry.

Data management

All study data will be captured on study specific case report forms recorded from the participants medical notes (source data) or parental/participant questionnaires (source data) and will be entered into and stored in a single password protected online REDCap database with data entry conducted at each site. Hard copy participant data at each site will be stored in locked cabinets. REDCap is hosted by MCRI. Information will be stored and retained according to local and government regulations.

Data monitoring

The Chief Principal Investigator (PI) or designee will conduct site visits in order to review a selection of the database against source data, verify adherence to the protocol and confirm that research governance principles are being upheld. Data management of entered patients will be undertaken by the central data management team and reviewed for completion.

Safety

Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient enrolled into this study regardless of its causal relationship to study treatment will be recorded. Conditions that are present at screening and do not deteriorate will not be considered adverse events (AEs). The parent/guardian/participant will be asked to report AE when contacted at 14 days and at the 1 month follow up visit. In addition, AEs noted during the visit or noted from any other documentation (e.g. hospital unit record and correspondence) will be documented on the CRF by the investigator team.

The site PI is responsible for recording and reporting all serious adverse events (SAEs) for the period from the first dose until the 1 month visit. Any SAE occurring in a study participant will be reported to the approving Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) in accordance with the safety reporting policy of the HREC (this timeframe is usually between 24 and 72 hours). A suspected unexpected serious adverse event will in addition be reported to the national government regulatory body (Australia or New Zealand) within the required timelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^9549bbf7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — evidence levels for grades of evidence specify study designs by domain: For treatment and harm, grade A is well-designed randomized controlled trials performed on a population similar to the guideline's target population, and for diagnosis at grade A the evidence is a systematic review of cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding. Grade B comprises randomized controlled trials or overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies for treatment and harm, and individual cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding for diagnosis. Grade C comprises observational studies (case control and cohort design) for treatment and harm, and nonconsecutive studies, case-control studies, or studies with poor, nonindependent, or inconsistently applied reference standards for diagnosis. Grade D is mechanism-based reasoning or case reports. Grade X applies to exceptional situations where validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit over harm; the scheme aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) classification scheme updated for consistency with current level of evidence definitions.

### Concurrent treatment with intratympanic dexamethasone for moderate-severe through severe Bell's palsy [^23352484]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early intervention with intratympanic steroid injection, known as concurrent intratympanic steroid therapy, is effective as a supplement to systemic steroid therapy for treating moderate-severe to severe Bell's palsy.

Design

An open-label historical control trial.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Participants

A total of 35 Bell's palsy patients presenting with House-Brackmann grade IV or higher were treated with intratympanic steroid therapy concurrent with standard systemic treatment and compared with 108 patients treated with standard systemic therapy alone started within 7 days of onset.

Interventions

In the concurrent intratympanic steroid therapy group, patients received both 410mg of prednisolone (standard dose) and 1.65mg of intratympanic dexamethasone for 10 consecutive days. Patients in the control group received the standard dose, or more, of systemic prednisolone. Both groups were additionally treated with valacyclovir.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was restoration of a House-Brackmann score of grade I.

Results

The rate of recovery to House-Brackmann Grade I was higher for the concurrent intratympanic steroid therapy group than for the control group (94% vs 73%, p = 0.008). The adjusted odds ratio was 5.47 (95% confidence interval: 1.18–25.21, p = 0.029).

Conclusions

The recovery rate was higher for concurrent intratympanic steroid therapy treatment than for standard-of-care control treatment, regardless of whether steroid with lower or equivalent glucocorticoid action was administered. This result suggests that concurrent treatment with intratympanic steroid therapy is a potentially beneficial supplement to systemic steroid administration.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^f34e8406]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Data from the United Kingdom reported an incidence of Bell's palsy of more than 6 per 100,000 person-years in children under 14 years and more than 20 per 100,000 person-years in people aged 15–29 years, although the true incidence may be higher. In an emergency department based study of stroke mimics in children Bell's palsy was the third most frequent diagnosis in children with sudden onset neurological dysfunction. In adults, up to 30% of untreated patients fail to make a complete recovery. While in children up to 100% recover from Bell's palsy within 12 months, it often leaves them with a prolonged period of functional impairment, disfigurement and emotional distress.

The main agents used for the treatment of Bell's palsy are steroids. The anti-inflammatory effect of steroids (such as prednisolone) is assumed to minimize facial nerve swelling, compression and damage, therefore reducing the length of time to and increasing the likelihood of recovery. Two recent, large, blinded randomised controlled trial (RCTs) of steroids in adults (combined n = 1309) reported statistically and clinically significant improvements in the proportion who reached complete recovery when Bell's palsy was treated with steroids compared with placebo. The participants in both studies were randomised to receive prednisolone and acyclovir, prednisolone and placebo, acyclovir and placebo or placebo and placebo. One of the studies, by Engstrom et al. (839 patients), showed shorter times to recovery for patients who received prednisolone compared with those who did not (combining those who did and did not receive acyclovir, hazard ratio 1.4 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.64; p < 0.0001). The other study (Sullivan et al. 496 patients) found that more patients had complete recovery by 3 months in the group who received prednisolone (83%) compared with placebo (63%) (again combining participants who did and did not receive acyclovir, difference 19.4%; 95% CI: 11.7 to 27.1%); number needed to treat to achieve one additional complete recovery was 6 (95% CI: 4 to 9). A recent (2010) Cochrane review (8 trials, n = 1569) on treatment for Bell's palsy, including the two RCTs above, found that corticosteroid treated patients had a lower risk of incomplete recovery than placebo treated patients (relative risk [RR] 0.71; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.83) and that those treated with corticosteroids also had reduced risk of synkinesis during follow up (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Subsequently, in 2012 the American Academy of Neurology released a guideline update on the use of steroids and antivirals to treat Bell's palsy. It concluded that steroids have proven efficacy in treating Bell's palsy in adults, and that no further research is required. Similarly, in 2013 the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation published a clinical practice guideline recommending the use of oral steroids within 72 hours in patients with Bell's palsy 16 years and older.

Objectives

To determine whether reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the main cause of Bell's palsy and whether antiviral drugs bring about recovery from Bell's palsy.

Study Design

Randomized, multicenter, controlled study.

Methods

One hundred fifty patients with Bell's palsy were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly assigned to a prednisolone group or a prednisolone-valacyclovir group, in whom virologic examinations for HSV-1 and VZV were performed by simple randomization scheme in sealed envelopes. The recovery rates among various groups were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

Reactivation of HSV-1, VZV, and both viruses was detected in 15.3%, 14.7%, and 4.0% of patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in recovery rates between the prednisolone group and the prednisolone-valacyclovir group, although recovery in the patients with HSV-1 reactivation tended to be higher in the prednisolone-valacyclovir group than in the prednisolone group. There was a significant difference in recovery among age groups and between individuals with complete and incomplete paralysis.

Conclusions

Reactivation of HSV-1 or VZV was observed in 34% of the patients with Bell's palsy. The effect of combination therapy with prednisolone and valacyclovir on recovery was not significantly higher than that with prednisolone alone.

### Antiviral treatment for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) [^6f846455]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), but the effectiveness of additional treatment with an antiviral agent is uncertain. This review was first published in 2001 and most recently updated in 2015. Since a significant benefit of corticosteroids for the early management of Bell's palsy has been demonstrated, the main focus of this update, as in the previous version, was to determine the effect of adding antivirals to corticosteroid treatment. We undertook this update to integrate additional evidence and to better assess the robustness of findings, taking risk of bias fully into account.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral treatments alone or in combination with any other therapy for Bell's palsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS in July 2019. We reviewed the bibliographies of the identified trials and contacted trial authors to identify additional published or unpublished data. We searched clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy. We excluded trials that followed-up participants for less than three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trials for relevance, eligibility, and risk of bias, using standard Cochrane procedures. We performed sensitivity analyses excluding trials at high or unclear risk of bias in at least five domains, and reported these data as the primary analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen trials, including 2488 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most were small, and most were at high or unclear risk of bias in multiple domains. We included four new studies at this update. Incomplete recoveryA combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in people with Bell's palsy compared to corticosteroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.74; 3 trials, N = 766; random-effects; low-certainty evidence). We excluded 10 trials that were at high or unclear risk of bias in several domains from this analysis and limited all analyses to studies at lower risk of bias. Recovery rates were better in participants receiving corticosteroids alone than antivirals alone (RR 2.69, 95% CI 0.73 to 10.01; 2 trials, N = 667; random-effects), but the result was imprecise and allowed for the possibility of no effect. The rate of incomplete recovery was lower with antivirals plus corticosteroids than with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.76; 2 trials, N = 658; random-effects). Antivirals alone had no clear effect on incomplete recovery rates compared with placebo, but the result was imprecise (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.40; 2 trials, N = 658; fixed-effect). For people with severe Bell's palsy (House-Brackmann score of 5 and 6, or equivalent on other scales), we found that the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids had no clear effect on incomplete recovery at month six compared to corticosteroids alone, although the result was again imprecise (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17; 2 trials, N = 98; random-effects). Motor synkinesis or crocodile tearsAntivirals plus corticosteroids reduced the proportion of participants who experienced these long-term sequelae from Bell's palsy compared to placebo plus corticosteroids (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 2 trials, N = 469; fixed-effect; moderate-certainty evidence). Antivirals plus corticosteroids reduced long-term sequelae compared to placebo but there was no clear difference in this outcome with antivirals alone compared to placebo. Adverse events Adverse event data were available in four studies providing data on 1592 participants. None of the four comparisons showed clear differences in adverse events between treatment and comparison arms (very low-certainty evidence); for the comparison of antivirals plus corticosteroids and corticosteroids alone in studies at lower risk of bias, the RR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.69; 2 trials, N = 656; fixed-effect; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in comparison to corticosteroids alone in Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity, or in people with severe Bell's palsy, but the results were very imprecise. Corticosteroids alone were probably more effective than antivirals alone and antivirals plus corticosteroids were more effective than placebo or no treatment. There was no clear benefit from antivirals alone over placebo. The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids probably reduced the late sequelae of Bell's palsy compared with corticosteroids alone. Studies also showed fewer episodes of long-term sequelae in corticosteroid-treated participants than antiviral-treated participants. We found no clear difference in adverse events from the use of antivirals compared with either placebo or corticosteroids, but the evidence is too uncertain for us to draw conclusions. An adequately powered RCT in people with Bell's palsy that compares different antiviral agents may be indicated.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^38b99a2c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — patient follow-up: Clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

### Antiviral therapy for Bell palsy… [^4f721d9a]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are antivirals effective therapy for Bell palsy. Evidence-Based Answer The combination of antiviral agents and corticosteroids is more effective than corticosteroids alone for the complete recovery of patients with Bell palsy and for the resolution of motor synkinesis and excessive tear production. Antivirals should not be used alone to treat Bell palsy. Practice Pointers Untreated idiopathic facial paralysis, or Bell palsy, leaves up to 30% of patients with some level of permanent facial asymmetry or pain. This Cochrane review included 10 trials with a total of 2, 280 participants. The authors used meta-analysis to compare several treatment regimens and a variety of outcomes.

Complete recovery rates of facial nerve function in patients with Bell palsy were improved by treatment with corticosteroids plus antivirals vs. corticosteroids alone at six months. A subgroup analysis of patients with severe Bell palsy found that more patients achieved complete recovery when the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids was used vs. corticosteroids alone. Treatment with antivirals alone was associated with higher rates of residual symptoms vs. treatment with corticosteroids alone. The rate of adverse effects was similar among all of the treatments compared.

The results of this review differ slightly from another meta-analysis that found that the routine addition of antivirals to corticosteroid therapy did not improve at least partial recovery. Guidelines on Bell palsy from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation currently recommend prescribing oral corticosteroids within 72 hours of symptom onset and recommend against the use of antiviral monotherapy.

### Initial treatment and referral patterns for acute facial palsy: insights from emergency department practices [^b2462d75]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Initiation of eye care is strongly recommended by AAO‐HNS and ACEP guidelines for those with lagophthalmos to prevent corneal damage, and the use of routine laboratory testing or diagnostic imaging in the absence of concerning history or physical exam findings is discouraged. All guidelines strongly recommend against antiviral monotherapy without the addition of steroids.

Despite the availability of these guidelines, variations in practice patterns often occur and it remains unclear what the practice patterns are that are occurring in actual practice. Standard practices are essential not only to enhance individual patient outcomes but also to ensure equity in care delivery across different emergency settings. This study aims to explore current practices, highlight differences in care, and provide recommendations for improving the management of Bell's palsy in the acute setting.
