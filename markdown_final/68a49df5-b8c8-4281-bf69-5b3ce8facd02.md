## Question

during EGD mid esophagus biopsy 14 eosinophils, while z line had 6 eosinophils, together is > 15 does this give patient diagnosis of EoE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with 14 eosinophils per high-power field (hpf) in a mid-esophageal biopsy and 6 eos/hpf at the Z-line meets diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and specifically whether adding counts across sites to reach a combined total of 20 eos/hpf satisfies the ≥ 15 eos/hpf threshold. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal diagnostic criteria for EoE. Then, I should verify how the eosinophil threshold is applied at the specimen and field level. Next, I will apply those rules to the patient's specific counts. After that, I need to consider confounders like GERD and the significance of Z-line eosinophils. Finally, I'll outline the guideline-concordant next steps for sampling, interpretation, and adjunctive testing or empiric therapy if needed.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions: contemporary guidelines define EoE as a clinicopathologic diagnosis requiring symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and peak intraepithelial eosinophil density of at least 15 eos/hpf on esophageal biopsy, after evaluating for other causes of esophageal eosinophilia; importantly, a PPI trial is no longer required to establish the diagnosis, though exclusion of alternative etiologies remains essential [^117RxzeH] [^116Fjc1M] [^111sTqjG].

> Wait, let me verify exactly how the ≥ 15 eos/hpf threshold is applied because this is where aggregation errors often occur: the cutpoint is a peak count per single high-power field within an individual biopsy specimen; EoE is patchy, so we maximize diagnostic yield by sampling multiple levels, but we do not sum eosinophils across specimens or sites to reach 15 eos/hpf; distal and proximal biopsies should be placed in separate jars and each specimen is assessed independently against the threshold [^113P2hkZ] [^1143HK2z] [^116QUZW3]. Hold on, I initially thought that combining 14 and 6 to get 20 might satisfy a "cumulative" threshold — no, that's incorrect because "per hpf" intrinsically refers to the peak count in a single field of a single specimen, not an aggregate across different biopsies or levels; I should correct that assumption now [^117RxzeH] [^114eoA1a].

> I will now apply this to the patient's counts: the mid-esophageal biopsy has a peak of 14 eos/hpf, which is just below the diagnostic cutpoint, and the Z-line biopsy has 6 eos/hpf; since no individual biopsy reaches ≥ 15 eos/hpf, the histologic criterion for EoE is not met at this time, and adding 14 + 6 to equal 20 does not change that because aggregation across specimens is not a recognized diagnostic method [^117RxzeH] [^111sTqjG]. Let me double-check that I'm not missing a wording nuance — guidelines consistently frame the threshold as "peak eosinophils per hpf" on esophageal biopsy, which is assessed per specimen, not cumulatively, so the conclusion stands [^117RxzeH] [^116QUZW3].

> But wait, what about the significance of 6 eos/hpf at the Z-line; could that still implicate EoE? Let me consider the anatomic and pathophysiologic context: mild distal or Z-line eosinophilia can be seen with GERD and is not specific for EoE; distal-predominant eosinophilia may also respond to PPIs, and guidelines stress evaluating alternative causes of eosinophilia, including reflux and PPI-responsive disease, when histology is borderline [^115VzzMz] [^116Fjc1M] [^113ERivu]. I should confirm that symptoms, pH/impedance data if available, and a pragmatic PPI approach are considered to exclude mimics while avoiding the outdated requirement that PPI failure be proven before diagnosing EoE [^116Fjc1M] [^117RxzeH].

> Next, I should review the optimal sampling plan because EoE is patchy and a near-threshold count of 14 eos/hpf raises the concern of sampling error: guidelines recommend obtaining at least six biopsies from at least two esophageal levels (typically distal and either mid or proximal), targeting visible endoscopic abnormalities when possible, and placing levels in separate jars so each can be independently interpreted against the threshold [^113P2hkZ] [^1143HK2z] [^112c5nwP]. Hold on, I should verify that each biopsy is evaluated separately for the ≥ 15 eos/hpf threshold — yes, that is explicitly recommended and aligns with standard pathology practice for peak per-hpf assessment rather than aggregated counts [^116QUZW3] [^114eoA1a].

> I will now examine whether adjunctive tools could help if repeat histology remains borderline or discordant with symptoms: molecular profiling with the EoE Diagnostic Panel from a single distal biopsy can predict proximal inflammation in patchy disease and may flag patients at higher relapse risk despite a histologically negative distal sample, which can be useful in equivocal cases and for prognostication; that said, histologic criteria still hinge on achieving the ≥ 15 eos/hpf threshold in at least one esophageal specimen [^111sTqjG] [^111sTqjG]. Let me reconsider the sampling distribution too — data reinforce that mid-esophageal sampling increases sensitivity in patchy EoE, and recent cohorts highlight discordance across levels, underscoring why multi-level biopsies are key when initial results are borderline [^116NazE3] [^117SP9Qu].

> I need to ensure broader differentials are not overlooked: in patients with marked peripheral eosinophilia or systemic features, guidelines advise evaluating for non-EoE EGIDs and hypereosinophilic syndromes; hematologic workup is indicated in unexplained hypereosinophilia, but that is context-dependent and not usually triggered by low-grade Z-line eosinophilia alone; the immediate priority here is esophageal re-sampling and appropriate GERD/PPI evaluation given the borderline mid-esophageal count [^112pk8m8] [^113Poyvg]. I should also review symptom phenotype and duration, because fibrostenotic risk rises with diagnostic delay, reinforcing the need for timely and adequately sampled histology in suspected EoE [^112GLQ7Z].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line: No, the patient does not meet EoE diagnostic criteria at this time because no single biopsy reached the required peak of ≥ 15 eos/hpf, and summing counts from different sites to meet the threshold is not valid; the appropriate next steps are to repeat endoscopy with at least six biopsies from two levels (distal and mid/proximal), label specimens separately, assess each independently for the per-hpf threshold, correlate with symptoms, and consider a therapeutic PPI approach to address potential reflux or PPI-responsive eosinophilia before re-biopsy if clinically appropriate [^117RxzeH] [^113P2hkZ] [^1143HK2z] [^116Fjc1M].

---

No, the patient does not meet diagnostic criteria for EoE because the **peak eosinophil count is below 15 eos/hpf** in all esophageal biopsies, and the Z-line is not considered esophageal tissue for EoE diagnosis [^117RxzeH] [^112c5nwP] [^1143HK2z]. EoE requires **≥ 15 eos/hpf in at least one esophageal biopsy** plus symptoms and exclusion of other causes [^117RxzeH] [^116Fjc1M]; counts from different sites are not summed, and Z-line counts are excluded [^115GjExt] [^113P2hkZ]. The patient has esophageal eosinophilia but does not meet EoE criteria; further evaluation for GERD, PPI-responsive eosinophilia, and other causes is recommended [^112pk8m8].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for EoE

According to the **ACG 2025 guidelines** [^117RxzeH], EoE is diagnosed when all of the following criteria are met:

- **Symptoms**: Esophageal dysfunction (e.g. dysphagia, food impaction, chest pain, refractory heartburn) [^112GLQ7Z].
- **Histology**: ≥ 15 eos/hpf in at least one esophageal biopsy [^116Fjc1M].
- **Exclusion**: Other causes of esophageal eosinophilia (e.g. GERD, PPI-responsive eosinophilia, infections, systemic eosinophilic disorders) [^112pk8m8].

---

## Histologic threshold and biopsy site considerations

The **histologic threshold** for EoE is **≥ 15 eos/hpf in at least one esophageal biopsy** [^117RxzeH]. Because EoE is patchy, obtain multiple biopsies from different esophageal levels to improve diagnostic yield [^1143HK2z]. Diagnosis relies on the **peak count in a single esophageal biopsy** — counts across sites are not combined [^115GjExt]. The Z-line (squamocolumnar junction) **is not considered esophageal tissue for EoE diagnosis**; eosinophils there may reflect reflux or other non-EoE processes and are excluded from the diagnostic threshold [^113P2hkZ].

---

## Clinical significance of eosinophil counts below the diagnostic threshold

Eosinophil counts below **15 eos/hpf** are nonspecific and may occur in GERD, PPI-responsive eosinophilia, infections, or systemic eosinophilic disorders [^1127nG7V]. Such counts alone **do not establish EoE** and warrant further evaluation to identify the underlying cause [^112pk8m8].

---

## Recommended next steps in clinical evaluation

Given the findings (14 eos/hpf mid esophagus, 6 eos/hpf Z-line), the patient **does not meet EoE criteria** but has esophageal eosinophilia [^117RxzeH]. Next steps include:

- **PPI trial**: High-dose PPI for 8 weeks, then repeat endoscopy with biopsies to assess histologic response and exclude PPI-responsive eosinophilia [^113YVynW].
- **GERD evaluation**: Consider pH monitoring or impedance testing to assess reflux [^112pk8m8].
- **Other causes**: Evaluate for infections, systemic eosinophilic disorders, and other inflammatory conditions [^1153dfKq].
- **Clinical correlation**: Integrate symptoms, endoscopic findings, and histology to guide management [^112GLQ7Z].

## Summary table: diagnostic criteria and clinical implications

| **Criterion** | **Findings in this case** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptoms of esophageal dysfunction | Not specified | Required for EoE diagnosis [^117RxzeH] |
| Peak eosinophil count ≥ 15 eos/hpf in esophageal biopsy | 14 eos/hpf (mid esophagus) | Below diagnostic threshold [^116Fjc1M] |
| Z-line eosinophil count | 6 eos/hpf | Not included in EoE diagnosis [^1143HK2z] |
| Exclusion of other causes | Not specified | Required for EoE diagnosis [^112pk8m8] |
| Diagnosis of EoE | Not met | Further evaluation needed [^117RxzeH] |

---

## Conclusion

The patient **does not meet EoE criteria** because the peak esophageal count is **below 15 eos/hpf**, and Z-line counts are excluded [^117RxzeH] [^1143HK2z]. Further evaluation — including a PPI trial and assessment for other causes — is recommended to determine the etiology of esophageal eosinophilia [^112pk8m8].

Physicians are increasingly confronted with patients presenting with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction resembling eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), but with an absence of significant esophageal eosinophilia. The purpose of this study was to characterize and classify this group of EoE variants.

Patients from six EoE centers with symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, but having peak eosinophil counts of < 60/mm² (< 15/hpf) in esophageal biopsies and absence of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), were included. Clinical, endoscopic, (immuno)-histological, and molecular features were determined and compared with EoE, GERD, and healthy controls.

We included 69 patients with EoE variants. Endoscopic abnormalities were found in 53.6%. We identified three histological subtypes: EoE-like esophagitis (36/69, 52.2%), lymphocytic esophagitis (14/69, 20.3%), and non-specific esophagitis (19/69, 27.5%).

- **Immunohistochemistry**: Revealed, in contrast to EoE, no significant increase in inflammatory cell infiltrates compared with GERD and healthy controls, except for lymphocytes in lymphocytic esophagitis.
- **EoE-typical Th2-response**: Absent in all EoE variants. However, considerable structural changes were detected based on histology and protein expression.

Using next-generation mRNA sequencing, we found the three EoE variants to have distinct molecular fingerprints partially sharing pronounced traits of EoE. Hierarchical sample clustering of RNA sequencing data confirmed the presence of an EoE-like (characterized by eotaxin-3 expression), non-specific, and lymphocytic variant.

### Treatment with high-dose proton pump inhibitors helps distinguish eosinophilic esophagitis from noneosinophilic esophagitis [^114zLckK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a clinical entity that is increasingly recognized in children. The treatment of EE has been debated since its identification as a clinical entity separate from reflux esophagitis. We hypothesize that treatment with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (HDPPI) helps differentiate EE from noneosinophilic esophagitis (NEE).

- **Patients and methods**: Retrospective review of 2,221 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies was undertaken. Sixty-nine patients had more than or equal to 15 eosinophils/high-power field (eos/HPF) in one or more esophageal levels. Of those, 36 were initially treated with HDPPI for 3 months followed by repeat EGD. Patients who demonstrated a histologic response were classified as NEE. Patients with no histologic response were diagnosed as having EE and treated with HDPPI plus swallowed fluticasone for 3 months followed by repeat EGD.

- **Results**: Of the 36 patients, histologic response was seen in 14 (39%) after treatment with HDPPI; 95% confidence interval (0.23–0.54). Swallowed fluticasone was added to the treatment of the 22 patients who did not show a histologic response to HDPPI alone. Of those, 15 patients underwent repeat endoscopies. Seven patients were lost to follow-up or did not have repeated EGDs. Histologic response was observed in 9 of 15 (60%) patients. Of the nonresponders (6 of 15), 5 of 6 (83%) self-reported noncompliance with the swallowed fluticasone. Patients with more than or equal to 15 eos/HPF at all three levels (25 of 36) were less likely to respond to HDPPI alone.

### Characterization of eosinophilic esophagitis variants by clinical, histological, and molecular analyses: A cross-sectional multi-center study [^113ThA9d]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, it has become apparent that the pathogenesis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) goes beyond simple eosinophil infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. EoE is not a "single cell disease". Eosinophil-targeting treatments failed to induce a clinical response despite impressively lowering eosinophil counts, although it cannot be ruled out that this was because the number of esophageal eosinophils was not sufficiently lowered beyond 50%, i.e. not decreasing esophageal eosinophilia below 15 eos/hpf. It is well known that symptom severity and the degree of esophageal eosinophilia show, at best, a modest correlation.

Several other histological changes have been identified in EoE, such as cellular infiltration with mast cells, basophils, and CRTH2 cells, as well as structural alterations like spongiosis and basal zone hyperplasia. Our immunohistochemical and RNA sequencing analyses give further insights into pathogenesis. Although the expression of TSLP, which initiates a Th2-inflammatory response in EoE, is upregulated in one EoE variant (lymphocytic esophagitis), the absence of CRTH2+ on T-cells, a marker of type 2 inflammatory diseases, and RNA sequencing analyses imply an attenuated Th2 signal in EoE variants.

While the absence of both significant eosinophil infiltration and extracellular EPX deposition was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, EPX deposition can still be observed in a subset of patients in each EoE variant. The presence of degranulated eosinophils highlights the potential overlap between these conditions and EoE. There is incongruence between EoE variant classification and immunohistochemical findings.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Immune mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^1138NRP3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

With the rising prevalence and incidence of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and as diagnosis requires the identification of esophageal eosinophilia, an emerging challenge in management is disease monitoring. Symptoms of EoE are not consistently reliable in correlating with disease activity; therefore, disease monitoring often requires repeated endoscopy with biopsies. The development of minimally invasive monitoring tests for EoE is an area of active investigation. Non-invasive tests, such as the esophageal string test and Cytosponge, are currently being evaluated. Furthermore, multiple biomarkers, including plasma EDN, CCL26, and eosinophil progenitor levels, are also under investigation for disease monitoring in EoE.

The focus of EoE treatment remains the alleviation of symptoms and the prevention of complications from fibrostenotic remodeling. Mainstays of effective treatment for EoE include proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), various elimination diets, and topical corticosteroids, such as swallowed fluticasone inhaler and oral viscous budesonide. Dietary and pharmacologic therapies are effective in inducing and maintaining disease remission, reducing the risk of esophageal food impactions, and improving quality of life. Recently, several corticosteroid formulations, including fluticasone orodispersible tablet, budesonide oral solution, and budesonide orodispersible tablet, have been developed to specifically treat EoE. Some of these esophagus-targeted formulations of topical steroids have demonstrated excellent response rates.

### Quantitative analysis of tug sign: An endoscopic finding of eosinophilic esophagitis [^111bt8un]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by esophageal inflammation and dysfunction, with a rising incidence affecting approximately 1:1000 individuals worldwide. Chronic inflammation can lead to tissue remodeling in the esophagus, with fibrosis in the lamina propria being partially responsible for symptoms and complications of EoE. At times, a firmness in the esophagus can be appreciated, with a noticeable force required to obtain biopsies from EoE. This sensation has been described as the "tug" or "pull" sign.

Recently, with the advent of endoscopic functional luminal impedance, the fibroelastic properties of the esophagus, including diminished compliance and distensibility, have been described in patients with EoE. Quantification of these fibroelastic properties of the esophagus may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of EoE. To date, no method to quantitatively measure the "tug sign" has been developed. The primary objective of this study was to determine if a quantifiable difference in force is required to obtain endoscopic esophageal biopsies in patients with EoE compared to those without.

### Esophageal remodeling in eosinophilic esophagitis [^113rsK4F]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of histopathologic fibrosis has proved challenging with most studies using standard forceps, whose biopsies consist mostly of epithelium that contains adequate lamina propria in only ∼50% of samples. This observation has raised concern that esophageal biopsies using standard forceps assess sub-epithelial disease severity incompletely and inadequately in EoE. Lamina propria sampling can be optimized with larger, specialized forceps that allow sampling of subepithelial tissue in > 90% of biopsies. Using this approach, one study of 200 EoE patients showed that correlations between subepithelial and epithelial peak eosinophil counts as well as endoscopic and symptom severity, while significant, were modest. There was also some discordance between epithelial and sub-epithelial findings, with biopsies of 40% of patients with < 15 intraepithelial eosinophils/hpf showing subepithelial peak counts of ≥ 15/hpf. These findings suggest that while the clinical utility of histologic assessment of sub-epithelial alterations needs further investigation, such assessment may be useful in those patients who have ongoing symptoms but who do not fulfill diagnostic cut-offs for EoE based on epithelial eosinophil counts alone. In addition, it is helpful to consider that lamina propria fibrosis can be an early feature of EoE, even in the absence of overt endoscopic findings such as esophageal stricture.

### Age-based differences in the diagnosis and management of esophageal eosinophilia [^1152xq6F]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized by esophageal eosinophilia, defined as more than 15 eosinophils (eos) per high-powered field (hpf). This condition is unresponsive to acid inhibition and presents varied symptoms. EoE consensus guidelines do not discriminate based on age for initiating treatment.

- **Objective**: To evaluate if age-related differences exist in managing esophageal eosinophilia and EoE within a university population.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective cohort study from a referral center, the medical records of 426 pediatric and adult patients with at least one presenting symptom of esophagitis, reflux, or upper gastrointestinal dysfunction, who underwent esophageal biopsy between 2009 and 2011, were analyzed for age-based differences in diagnosing and managing esophageal eosinophilia.

- **Results**: Among these patients, 79.6% (336/426) had ≥ 15 eos/hpf in biopsy specimens, which was not associated with age. Significantly fewer adults than children with ≥ 15 eos/hpf were diagnosed with EoE (P < .001), referred for allergy evaluation (P < .001), started on swallowed steroid therapy (P < .001), or underwent repeated biopsy (P < .001). Increasing age, atopy, and increasing biopsy peak eos count moderated these effects, but the adjusted predicted probabilities for these outcomes were significantly lower among adults. The restriction for an 8-week prebiopsy proton-pump inhibitor trial did not alter the age-based relationships for allergy referral or repeated biopsy.

- **Conclusions**: Numerous age-based differences in the management of symptomatic patients with esophageal eosinophilia existed in this cohort.

### Esophageal remodeling in eosinophilic esophagitis [^112GLQ7Z]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a Th2 immune/antigen-mediated clinicopathologic disorder characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction (usually dysphagia) and an eosinophil predominant inflammation of ≥ 15 eosinophils per high power field in esophageal mucosal biopsies. Several studies support the prevailing theory that untreated, persistent inflammation, such as delays in diagnosis or therapy, can initiate tissue remodeling processes. These processes involve epithelial hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the esophageal smooth muscle, progressing in many, though not all, adults to a fibrostenotic phenotype with strictures and luminal narrowing. Worsening dysphagia and esophageal food impactions requiring endoscopic interventions and the need for esophageal dilations are the most significant complications. They are associated with endoscopic features and, to a certain extent, histopathologic features of fibrostenotic disease.

EoE is a patchy and transmural disease, and peak epithelial eosinophil counts may not be the best or only parameter of disease activity, as they may not reflect the degree of subepithelial activity. Esophagectomy specimens from EoE patients show that deeper layers, including the submucosa, muscularis propria, and adventitia, are also affected. A muscular variant of EoE has been described in patients with hypercontractile esophageal motility disorders undergoing per oral esophageal myotomy with elevated subepithelial eosinophilia despite normal epithelial eosinophils. This review highlights the most recent research findings regarding these topics.

### Potential of blood eosinophils, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eotaxin-3 as biomarkers of eosinophilic esophagitis [^111x5nap]. Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is an increasingly recognized disorder characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the esophageal mucosa, typically requiring serial invasive endoscopic biopsy to document the histological features of the disorder. This study aimed to identify noninvasive biomarkers correlated with disease activity and response to treatment as measured by esophageal eosinophilia.

- **Methods**: A prospective, cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 47 pediatric patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation for possible EE. Blood samples were collected to measure peripheral blood absolute eosinophil count (AEC) and levels of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eotaxin-1, -2, and -3, and interleukin-5. Stool samples were collected for EDN measurement. Biomarker levels were correlated with esophageal eosinophil density, and differences in biomarker levels based on disease activity and treatment were determined.

- **Results**: AEC, plasma EDN levels, and eotaxin-3 levels significantly correlated with esophageal eosinophil density (AEC: r = 0.56, P < .0001; EDN: r = 0.54, P < .0001; eotaxin-3: r = 0.32, P = 0.04), and were increased in patients with active EE versus controls (AEC: 440 vs. 140 eosinophils/µL, P < .05; EDN: 50.3 vs. 31.1 ng/mL, P = 0.01; eotaxin-3: 37.7 vs. 11.5 pg/mL, P = 0.01). Cut-off values were established to maximize the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of these biomarkers alone and in combination. Eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, interleukin-5, and fecal EDN levels did not correlate with the esophageal eosinophil density.

### Imaging findings of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases in adults [^112uHAqY]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are a group of conditions marked by pathologic eosinophilic infiltration of one or multiple locations in the GI tract. Conditions include eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis, eosinophilic enteritis, and eosinophilic colitis. The site and depth of eosinophilic infiltration of the GI tract usually determine clinical presentation. These conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis for several GI symptoms, such as food impaction or dysphagia. Histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosis of eosinophilic disorders. Nevertheless, findings from endoscopy, barium studies, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging can aid in the diagnosis by allowing for earlier detection and proper management. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are typically managed with corticosteroids or dietary elimination. A high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis as it can often be challenging.

### Diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1177wzrj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic infiltrate in the esophageal epithelium in the absence of other potential causes of eosinophilia. EoE is increasing in incidence and prevalence and is a major cause of gastrointestinal morbidity among children and adults. It is thought to be immune-mediated, with food or environmental antigens stimulating a T-helper (Th)-2 inflammatory response.

An increased understanding of the pathogenesis of EoE has led to the evolution of diagnostic and treatment paradigms. We review the latest approach to the diagnosis of EoE and present consensus diagnostic guidelines. We also discuss the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of EoE and challenges to diagnosis. Finally, we present the three major treatment options for EoE: pharmacologic therapy, dietary modification, and endoscopic dilation.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^116mfcJn]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In the absence of secondary causes, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, local, progressive, T-helper type 2 immune-mediated disorder characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation. In the last 20 years, the incidence and prevalence of EoE have risen sharply, and the chances of encountering affected patients in clinics and endoscopy rooms have increased. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the mean diagnostic delay of EoE is 4–6 years in both children and adults. Unfortunately, the longer the disease remains unrecognized, the more likely it is for the patient to have persistent or increased esophageal eosinophilic inflammation, complain of non-resolving symptoms, and develop fibrotic complications. Early detection depends on the recognition of initial clinical manifestations that vary from childhood to adulthood and even among patients of the same age. The disease phenotype also influences therapeutic approaches that include drugs, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. We have herein reviewed epidemiologic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features and therapeutic options of EoE, focusing on differences and similarities between children and adults that may certainly serve in daily clinical practice.

### Reflectance confocal microscopy for the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis: a pilot study conducted on biopsy specimens [^114XhQ9w]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) currently requires endoscopic biopsy and histopathologic analysis of the biopsy specimens to count intraepithelial eosinophils. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an endomicroscopy technology capable of obtaining high-resolution, optically sectioned images of esophageal mucosa without the administration of exogenous contrast.

- **Objective**: In this study, we investigated the capability of a high-speed form of RCM, termed spectrally encoded confocal microscopy (SECM), to count intraepithelial esophageal eosinophils and characterize other microscopic findings of EoE.

- **Design**: A total of 43 biopsy samples from 35 pediatric patients and 8 biopsy samples from 8 adult patients undergoing EGD for EoE were imaged by SECM immediately after their removal and then processed for routine histopathology. Two SECM readers, trained on adult cases, prospectively counted intraepithelial eosinophils and detected the presence of abscess, degranulation, and basal cell hyperplasia on SECM images from the pediatric patients. A pathologist blinded to the SECM data analyzed the same from corresponding slides.

- **Setting**: The Gastrointestinal Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital.

- **Results**: Eosinophils by SECM demonstrated a higher reflectance than the surrounding cells and other inflammatory cells. There was a good correlation between SECM and histology maximum eosinophil counts/high-power field (R = 0.76, P < .0001). Intra- and interobserver correlations for SECM counts were very good (R = 0.93 and R = 0.92, respectively; P < .0001).

### One-hour esophageal string test: A nonendoscopic minimally invasive test that accurately detects disease activity in eosinophilic esophagitis [^117G4scL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

EAP levels from biopsy and EST samples correlate with mucosal eosinophil counts. We first sought to determine whether EAPs measured in samples from mucosal biopsies and the 1-hour EST correlated with peak eosinophil density in mucosal samples. As shown in Figure 1, all EAPs from mucosal biopsy sample extracts correlated significantly with mucosal eosinophil counts, ranging from r = 0.61 for Eot3 to 0.40 for Eot2 (all P < 0.0001). Similarly, there was a significant correlation of all EAPs from 1-hour EST string samples with mucosal eosinophil counts, ranging from r = 0.70 and 0.68 for CLC/Gal-10 and Eot3, respectively, to r = 0.53 for Eot2 (all P < 0.0001). Consistent with our previous study, our results indicate that both mucosal (biopsy) and luminal (EST) concentrations of EAPs can serve as surrogate markers of peak intraepithelial eosinophil counts, the present gold standard for assessing esophageal inflammation in EoE.

### Diagnostic merits of the eosinophilic esophagitis diagnostic panel from a single esophageal biopsy [^115GjExt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a histologically "patchy" disease with uneven eosinophil distribution along the esophagus, posing a dilemma for histologically analyzing endoscopic biopsy samples, especially when biopsy samples are limited to only the distal esophagus.

- **Objective**: We investigated whether molecular mRNA profiling of a distal esophageal biopsy sample predicts eosinophilia in the proximal esophagus.

- **Methods**: Esophageal biopsy samples (n = 507) from subjects with EoE were collected from multiple institutions, spanning adults and pediatric patients. Subjects were grouped on the basis of distinct distal (D) and proximal (P) eosinophil counts (D+ P+, D+ P-, D- P+, and D- P-, with + and - defined as ≥ 15 or < 15 eosinophils/hpf, respectively). Molecular profiles were assessed using the EoE Diagnostic Panel (EDP), a set of 96 esophageal transcripts used to derive the EDP score.

- **Results**: The distal EDP score was correlated with proximal eosinophil levels (r = -0.73; P < .0001). EDP analysis of a histologically negative distal biopsy sample predicted the presence of proximal esophagitis with high sensitivity (85%). In a 2-year follow-up focusing on the cases with discordant histologic and EDP results, histologically negative patients (D- P-) had higher rates of EoE relapse when the EDP was positive than when the EDP was negative (odds ratio = 11; p = 0.003), indicating predictive medicine capacity.

- **Conclusion**: EDP analysis of a single distal esophageal biopsy sample predicts remote inflammation in patients with spatially heterogeneous eosinophilic disease.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for esophageal dysphagia, particularly in the context of differential diagnosis, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend evaluating for non-eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in patients presenting with esophageal symptoms alongside hypereosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count > 1,500 cells/mcL).

### Consultation for elevated blood eosinophils: Clinical presentations, high value diagnostic tests, and treatment options [^1153dfKq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). High credibility.

The workup of a patient found to have eosinophilia should follow a thorough path with a detailed history and physical examination aimed at eliciting eosinophilic organ involvement, followed by histological confirmation whenever possible. The differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia is extensive, but a rational approach beyond the history and physical examination — including serologic, blood, and bone marrow cell analyses, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging — can distinguish many of the causes. Often, input from specialists (e.g. hematology, dermatology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, and neurology) can help narrow down the possibilities and eventually result in a specific diagnosis.

An accurate diagnosis is key to choosing the optimal treatment for a particular condition, and this is certainly true for eosinophilic disorders. Myeloid neoplasms that present with eosinophilia, for example, may respond to medicines that the allergist may be less accustomed to using, such as immunosuppressive agents and kinase inhibitors. Similarly, newly approved biologics that target IL-5 and eosinophils may provide new options for management. What follows is a case-based approach that helps to underscore key features of diagnosis, management, and follow-up when faced with a patient with a potential eosinophil-related disorder.

### What's new in the diagnosis and therapy of eosinophilic esophagitis [^113ZvxKs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a relatively new chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus. This review discusses novel aspects in the diagnosis and treatment of EoE.

- **Recent findings**: The development of diagnostic guidelines consisting of symptoms, endoscopic, and histopathologic criteria has improved clinicians' awareness and the diagnosing of EoE. The clinically challenging discrimination of EoE from gastroesophageal reflux disease has become more apparent, evoking the need for more individualized therapy options. Today, most patients with EoE can be treated successfully with topical corticosteroids; however, no convincing alternative treatment strategies exist for corticosteroid-refractory or corticosteroid-dependent patients. Interestingly, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the eotaxin-3 gene has been linked to increased disease susceptibility for EoE.

EoE is an emerging esophageal disease. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder would improve clinical recognition and diagnostic ability and ultimately provide patients with more optimal treatment options.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for eosinophilia, specifically with regard to FISH, BSH 2017 guidelines recommend investigating patients with an eosinophil count of at least 1.5×10⁹ cells/L with no obvious cause, for a possible hematological neoplasm associated with clonal eosinophilia. This should initially be done by peripheral blood analysis for FIP1L1-PDGFRA using FISH or nested RT-PCR.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^116PUDE4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging disorder whose diagnosis is often delayed. Early detection may lead to anticipating treatment and preventing the disorder, or at least decelerating the development of complications. Treatment options and endpoints should be tailored individually to achieve lasting compliance. This is crucial because EoE is a chronic disease that almost invariably relapses when the treatment is withdrawn.

### Distribution of eosinophils in the gastrointestinal tract of children with no organic disease [^116pNJyL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In examining the eosinophilic distribution across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, a gradual increase in GI tissue eosinophils was observed in the proximal segments, from the esophagus to the ileum. Conversely, in the colon, a gradual decline was observed from the cecum to the rectum. The median (interquartile range, IQR) of peak counts of eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) corresponding to areas of 0.196 mm² and 0.306 mm², as well as the count corresponding to mm² in each segment of the GI tract for the entire cohort, are shown in Figures 1 to 3.

- **Figure 1: Peak numbers of eosinophils in the esophageal and gastric biopsies in the whole cohort of children**. Median (IQR) of peak counts of eosinophils per high-power field at 0.196 mm² and 0.306 mm², and per mm² in the esophagus (111 biopsies) and the stomach (111 biopsies) were as follows: esophagus: 0 (0–0), 0 (0–0), and 0 (0–0), respectively; stomach: 2 (0.6–3.0), 3.1 (1.0–4.7), and 10.2 (3.3–15.3), respectively.

### Longitudinal evaluation of noninvasive biomarkers for eosinophilic esophagitis [^115pYf8m]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) often require multiple endoscopies. Serum biomarkers can be elevated in EoE patients, but their clinical utility in diagnosis and assessing response to treatment is not well established.

- **Goals**: To evaluate serum biomarkers in EoE subjects compared with controls and assess longitudinally in response to treatment.

- **Study**: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adults undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for suspected EoE. After completing an 8-week course of proton-pump inhibitor therapy, esophageal mucosal biopsies were obtained, as well as serum analysis of absolute eosinophil count (AEC), eotaxin-3, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and interleukin-5. Subjects with normal endoscopic and histologic findings constituted controls. Those meeting criteria for EoE underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and biomarker measurements following treatment with topical steroids for 8 weeks.

- **Results**: Median levels of AEC (263.50 vs. 102 cu/mm, P < 0.001), ECP (26.98 vs. 5.20 ng/mL, P < 0.001), and EDN (31.70 vs. 14.18 ng/mL, P = 0.004) were significantly elevated in EoE subjects compared with controls and correlated with esophageal eosinophilia. Levels of AEC (odds ratio 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.64) and ECP (odds ratio 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.23–2.36) were associated with a diagnosis of EoE. Among the 5 biomarkers evaluated, only AEC significantly predicted esophageal eosinophilia following topical steroid therapy in EoE subjects.

### Increased numbers of eosinophils, rather than only etiology, predict histologic changes in patients with esophageal eosinophilia [^112dvkgd]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Differentiating individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) from those with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be challenging. We investigated the differences in histologic and eosinophil patterns, as well as the numbers of mast cells, between patients with these disorders.

- **Methods**: Histologic analyses and immunohistochemical assays for eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), major basic protein (MBP), and tryptase were performed using biopsy samples from 10 patients with GERD (positive results from a pH study and response to proton pump inhibitors), Barrett's esophagus, or EoE (negative results from a pH study and positive response to budesonide). Patients were matched for the degree of eosinophilia.

- **Results**: Samples from patients with EoE, GERD, or Barrett's esophagus showed similar increases in concentrations of eosinophils. There were no differences in the amount of basal zone hyperplasia, microabscesses, spongiosis, eosinophil distribution, maximum eosinophils/high-power field (HPF), or composite histologic scores between patients with GERD or EoE. Samples from all three groups had high levels of EDN and MBP; the levels of eosinophil products were correlated (ρ = 0.93). Extracellular staining for EDN was greater than intracellular staining (2.67 of 3 vs. 1.86 of 3), with levels tending to be greater in samples from patients with EoE than GERD (P = 0.05) or Barrett's esophagus (P = 0.06). Detection of EDN correlated with peak numbers of eosinophils/HPF (ρ = 0.6 for intracellular and extracellular staining). Peak numbers of tryptase-positive mast cells/HPF were significantly greater in samples from…

### Proposed refined diagnostic criteria and classification of eosinophil disorders and related syndromes [^115fzmRn]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

Per the original definition, tissue HE is present when more than one of the following features is documented:

- **The percentage of eosinophils exceeds 20% of all nucleated cells in BM sections**: A pathologist may opine that tissue infiltration by eosinophils is extensive (massive) compared with "normal physiologic ranges".
- **Immunostaining reveals extensive extracellular deposition of eosinophil granule proteins, such as eMBP1 or EPX**: Although immunostaining for eosinophil granule proteins is not routinely available, when observed, it qualifies as a criterion for tissue HE even in the absence of marked (intact) eosinophil infiltration.

Tissue HE can be detected in the absence of PB HE (e.g. in eosinophilic esophagitis or nasal polyposis), although in most instances, mild blood eosinophilia is also present. It is important to state that the original definition of HES required PB HE. In other words, the diagnosis of HES could only be established when both PB HE and HE-related organ damage were documented, irrespective of tissue HE. However, there are cases with tissue HE and associated organ damage resembling HES in which peripheral HE is absent; this occurs most commonly when only a single organ is involved. These patients should be labeled as "tissue-restricted HES" or "organ-restricted (mono-organ) HES", and most should be managed in the same way as those who have classically defined HES.

### The pathology and causes of tissue eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal tract [^1127nG7V]. Histopathology (2017). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract may occur as a primary eosinophilic disorder or as a secondary response with other causes. Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are Th2-mediated allergic diseases that overlap pathogenetically with atopic conditions involving other organs. The pathological diagnosis of primary EGIDs can be challenging, as the quantity of eosinophils considered to be 'abnormal' is difficult to define, and the diagnosis, by definition, requires exclusion of the far more common secondary causes.

Our understanding of the basic biology and natural history of eosinophilic oesophagitis has advanced considerably over the last decade, whereas other EGIDs have proven more difficult to characterize; nonetheless, some recent advances have been made. This review summarizes knowledge regarding the clinical presentation, diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of EGIDs, including eosinophilic oesophagitis. We also draw attention to the numerous secondary causes of tissue eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal tract and suggest a practical approach to the histological assessment, diagnosis, and reporting of EGIDs.

### Determination of esophageal eosinophil counts and other histologic features of eosinophilic esophagitis by pathology trainees is highly accurate [^116QUZW3]. Human Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Many studies of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) use expert pathology review. However, it is unknown whether less experienced pathologists can reliably assess EoE histology. We aimed to determine whether trainee pathologists can accurately quantify esophageal eosinophil counts and identify associated histologic features of EoE, compared with expert pathologists.

We used a set of 40 digitized slides from patients with varying degrees of esophageal eosinophilia. Each of six trainee pathologists underwent a teaching session and used our validated protocol to determine eosinophil counts and associated EoE findings. The same slides had previously been evaluated by expert pathologists, and these results comprised the criterion standard.

Eosinophil counts were correlated, and agreement was calculated for the diagnostic threshold of 15 eosinophils per high-power field as well as for associated EoE findings. Peak eosinophil counts were highly correlated between the trainees and the criterion standard (ρ ranged from 0.87 to 0.92; p < 0.001 for all). Peak counts were also highly correlated between trainees (0.75–0.91; p < 0.001), and results were similar for mean counts. Agreement was excellent for determining if a count exceeded the diagnostic threshold (κ ranged from 0.83 to 0.89; p < 0.001). Agreement was very good for eosinophil degranulation (κ = 0.54–0.83; p < 0.01) and spongiosis (κ = 0.44–0.87; p < 0.01) but was lower for eosinophil microabscesses (κ = 0.37–0.64; p < 0.01).

In conclusion, using a teaching session, digitized slide set, and validated protocol, the agreement between pathology trainees and expert pathologists was substantial for most EoE histological features evaluated.

### Do eosinophil numbers differentiate eosinophilic esophagitis from gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115VzzMz]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although the healthy esophageal mucosa contains no eosinophils, eosinophilic infiltration is observed in two major clinicopathologic settings: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EE). The prevalence of EE is increasing in many countries, and this increase seems only partly due to better awareness of the pathology following the relatively recent description of EE. GERD and EE represent two entities that do not respond to the same treatment modalities and, thus, need to be distinguished. However, diagnostic criteria for EE have been defined arbitrarily, and more recent articles tend to show that the overlap with GERD is probably greater than initially believed. This leads the authors to advise strict exclusion of GERD before considering the diagnosis of EE.

- **Objectives**: To provide pathologists with the currently proposed histologic criteria of GERD and EE, to emphasize the need to combine these criteria with clinical data and endoscopic findings, and to outline the remaining controversies.

- **Data sources**: This review is based on selected articles identified by a PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) search of the literature in English for GERD and EE. It also draws on a recent review by the American Gastroenterological Association (Bethesda), the Proceedings of the First International Gastrointestinal Eosinophil Research Symposium, and the authors' experience.

- **Conclusion**: Proper identification of the etiology of eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus allows accurate medical or surgical treatment.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents: Epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for a type 2 inflammatory disease [^111GcDpF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Discussion

While the first case of EoE was reported in 1970, the disease, as recognized today, was described in only three cases in the early 1990s. Although EoE has been considered a rare condition, it remains a significant cause of morbidity in the upper gastrointestinal tract, resulting in increased healthcare costs. The exact causes of EoE are not completely understood but are believed to be linked to genetic, environmental, and immune factors. Despite being relatively new, the incidence of EoE is on the rise globally, with reports of 1–34 new cases per 100,000 people per year.

Diagnosing EoE can be challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms and the absence of specific biomarkers. Diagnostic tools currently available are not sensitive enough to detect it. A major issue for EoE is diagnostic delay, with an average time from the first symptom to the final diagnosis being 10 years. Factors such as patient-dependent issues and misdiagnosis contribute to this delay, leading to increased EoE severity. In cases where patients report minimal symptoms, clinicians should explore dietary and adaptive behavioral modifications, such as eating slowly, thorough chewing before swallowing, drinking fluids to aid swallowing, and avoiding solid foods. These adjustments help patients adapt to the reduced esophageal distensibility. However, enhancing our understanding of EoE's natural progression and refining clinical management will reduce diagnostic delays and optimize patient care pathways. Incorporating red flags into patient evaluations can enhance EoE diagnosis and management.

### Medical treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis [^116Fjc1M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic antigen-mediated eosinophilic inflammatory disease isolated to the esophagus. As a clinicopathologic disorder, a diagnosis of EoE requires a constellation of clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic findings (at least 15 eosinophils/high-powered microscope field (eos/hpf)). Guidelines no longer require the failure of response to proton pump inhibitor medications to establish a diagnosis of EoE, but continue to suggest the exclusion of other etiologies of esophageal eosinophilia.

The treatment goals for EoE are improvement in clinical symptoms, resolution of esophageal eosinophilia and other histologic abnormalities, endoscopic improvement, improved quality of life, improved esophageal function, minimized adverse effects of treatment, and prevention of disease progression and subsequent complications. Currently, there is no cure for EoE, making long-term treatment necessary. Standard treatment modalities include dietary modifications, esophageal dilation, and pharmacologic therapy. Effective pharmacologic therapies include corticosteroids, rapidly emerging biological therapies, and proton pump inhibitor medications.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical interventions for people with eosinophilic esophagitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP to 3 March 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical intervention or food elimination diet for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.

### Yield of esophageal biopsy patterns for the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis [^117SP9Qu]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The pattern of inflammation in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is patchy, necessitating multiple biopsies to optimize diagnostic yield. Consensus-based guidelines recommend six total biopsy samples at two sites: the distal and either the middle or proximal esophagus, although this recommendation is based on limited data. We aimed to determine whether this biopsy protocol sufficiently captures EoE diagnoses by evaluating the distribution of eosinophilia in a large EoE cohort.

This was a retrospective study of consecutive patients newly diagnosed with EoE with ≥ 2 esophageal segments biopsied. Demographic variables, clinical characteristics/history, endoscopic findings, and histologic results were manually reviewed. Distribution (proximal, middle, and/or distal) of eosinophilia (> 15 eosinophils/high-power field [HPF]) was assessed. Predictors for non-distal disease (< 15 eosinophils/HPF on distal biopsy samples) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.

A total of 511 patients newly diagnosed with EoE with ≥ 2 segments biopsied were included. All patients underwent distal esophageal biopsy. Overall, 286 (56.0%) had ≥ 1 site with < 15 eosinophils/HPF, including 51 (10%) with non-distal disease. Among patients with three segments biopsied (n = 60), 19 (31.7%) had eosinophilia at only one site, including 6 (10%) with isolated midesophageal disease and no isolated proximal eosinophilia. Discordant mid and proximal biopsy results were found in 18 (30%) patients, with 17 of 18 (94.4%) having mid esophageal eosinophilia.

### Childhood esophagitis changes in 30 years at 1 center [^115uGQZb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Eosinophils are nonspecific harbingers of esophageal disease. We report on the incidence and features of esophageal eosinophilia diagnosed at our center in 2011 and compare the findings with previously published results from 1980–1988 and 2000–2002. Eosinophils per high-power field were counted in esophageal biopsies from 675 patients who underwent 710 endoscopic procedures between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. Of these, 209 (33%) patients were infiltrated with eosinophils, while the other 466 (67%) showed no pathological changes. The highest concentrations of eosinophils were observed in the distal esophagus. Our findings also indicate that esophageal eosinophilia fluctuates over time.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, specifically concerning endoscopy and biopsy, the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2024 guidelines recommend performing multiple biopsies. These should include the gastric antrum, gastric body, and duodenum, taken from the involved segments of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as from normal and abnormal appearing areas of the mucosa in patients with symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic gastritis/eosinophilic duodenitis.

### The optimal number of biopsy fragments to establish a morphologic diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis [^111fE3YY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is characterized clinically by symptoms such as dysphagia, chest pain, and food impaction, and morphologically by an increased number of intraepithelial eosinophils and marked basal hyperplasia of the squamous mucosa. The consensus criteria for diagnosing EoE include the presence of ≥ 15 eosinophils per high power field (HPF) in biopsies from both the proximal and distal esophagus in the absence of other causes of esophageal eosinophilia, as well as the lack of clinical response to proton pump inhibitor therapy. Due to the variability in the distribution of intraepithelial eosinophils among biopsy fragments and the absence of standardized biopsy practices, this study aimed to determine the optimal number of esophageal biopsies required from the mid and distal esophagus to reach the minimum morphologic criteria of ≥ 15 eosinophils/HPF.

From January 5, 2009, to September 26, 2011, 771 patients were diagnosed with EoE at our institution. From this population, 102 sequential cases were selected for further study, with biopsies taken from both the mid and distal esophagus. Cases with only gastric mucosa present and biopsies from patients with a previous diagnosis of EoE were excluded. The original H&E-stained slides were reviewed, and the number of biopsy fragments containing squamous mucosa was recorded. Using a ×40 objective and ×10 oculars (field diameter = 0.52 mm, field area = 0.21 mm²), the number of eosinophils per high power field (EOS/HPF) in up to three HPFs was counted in each biopsy fragment.

The EOS/HPF were counted in 1,342 biopsy fragments. The…

### Characterization of eosinophilic esophagitis variants by clinical, histological, and molecular analyses: A cross-sectional multi-center study [^1159MH6p]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results**: We identified 113 patients with typical eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) symptoms and peak eosinophil counts in esophageal biopsies of less than 60 eos/mm² (< 15 eos/hpf) from six EoE referral centers. After histological re-examination, absence of significant esophageal eosinophilia was confirmed in 69 subjects (62 adults, 7 children aged 16 years or younger). For detailed patient distribution per study center, see Table S7. A study flow diagram is provided in Figure 1A. These patients were diagnosed at a mean age of 48.8 years (SD 24.0) and had a median duration of symptoms of 28.1 months (IQR 12.4–74.4). Among them, 37 were female (53.2%), and 61 subjects were of Caucasian descent (88.4%). Atopic comorbidities were reported in 30 patients (43.5%), and a family history of EoE was positive in 16 individuals (23.2%). For further details, see Table 1.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis and the eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases: Approach to diagnosis and management [^1147iaQK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) represent disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that result from the local infiltration and aberrant activity of eosinophils and other immune cells. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is the most well-characterized EGID and is defined by the presence of intraepithelial eosinophils in the esophagus (≥ 15 eosinophils per high-powered field) and clinical symptoms associated with esophageal dysfunction. Other EGIDs are rare and lack strong data regarding pathogenesis and management.

The incidence and prevalence of EoE are increasing, and EoE is now a major cause of upper GI morbidity. Management is multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between gastroenterologists, allergists, pathologists, and dieticians, and is aimed at amelioration of symptoms and prevention of long-term complications such as esophageal stricture. Treatment options for EoE include proton pump inhibitors, swallowed topical corticosteroids, and elimination diets. Esophageal dilation is used when esophageal strictures or fibrostenotic changes are present. Additional therapies targeting eosinophils and other mediators of Th2 inflammation are under development and are promising. Treatment options for other EGIDs typically involve corticosteroids or dietary elimination.

### Diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis: A 5-year retrospective review in a pediatric population [^1173L5YB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnostic criterion based on the number of eosinophils (Eos) per high-power field (HPF) does not appear to capture all patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EE).

- **Objectives**: To determine whether EE has been underrecognized at our institution, clinical variables predicting EE, and whether the Luna eosinophil granule (LEG) stain detects eosinophils better than hematoxylin and eosin (HE).

- **Materials and methods**: Esophageal biopsies of 202 children younger than 18 years old from 2000 to 2004 were reviewed and Eos/HPF was recorded. Clinical variables from charts were reviewed and a marginal logit model was used to determine significance. LEG stains for 60 randomly selected patients were prepared and compared to HE originals.

- **Results**: EE diagnoses have risen from none in 2000 to 23 in 2004. The clinically significant variables that predicted EE were improvement from EE treatment (160 times more likely to have EE; P < 0.0005), final endoscopic diagnosis of EE (31 times; P = 0.004), absence of vascular pattern on endoscopy (20 times; P = 0.008), and vertical furrows on endoscopy (29 times; P = 0.039). LEG stain appeared to be superior to HE in detecting low Eos/HPF (mean 24.82 and 38.53, respectively). Peak counts of eosinophils in the most involved HPF significantly correlated with highest average count of eosinophils per HPF in the most involved specimen (Pearson correlation 0.958).

- **Conclusions**: Misdiagnosed EE cases decreased, but prevalence appeared to increase. LEG potentially can be a more sensitive stain. The key variables that predict EE were typical.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is a recently described disease characterized by the presence of upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms in association with a dense esophageal eosinophilic infiltrate. The awareness and interest of physicians and researchers in this disease has been increasing, as reflected by the number of publications on this topic in the last five years. The aim of this review is to summarize the latest evidence with regard to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of eosinophilic esophagitis, focusing primarily on adults, and selected areas in children.

### Increased expression of eotaxin-3 distinguishes between eosinophilic esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111ZiUzg]. Human Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Differentiating eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is important given their pathogenetic differences and responses to therapy. Eotaxins are a family of chemokines crucial for the activation and recruitment of eosinophils, mediated by their receptor, chemokine receptor-3 (CCR-3). Interleukin 5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine involved in many steps of eosinophil production and recruitment. The aim of this study was to compare the messenger RNA expression of eotaxins, CCR-3, and IL-5 between well-characterized groups of patients with EoE, patients with GERD, and healthy individuals.

This was a retrospective study using esophageal biopsies from 33 patients with EoE, 20 patients with GERD, and 17 healthy controls. Parameters studied included demographic features, presenting symptoms, endoscopic findings, histopathologic features, and messenger RNA levels of eotaxins 1, 2, and 3, CCR-3, and IL-5 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Patients with EoE were predominantly males (M/F = 3:1), with a mean age of 15.9 years and a mean eosinophil count of 55 per ×400 high-power field. Patients with GERD had a mean age of 31.5 years and a mean eosinophil count of 5.8 per high-power field. Total intraepithelial eosinophil and lymphocyte counts, the presence of superficial eosinophil clusters, microabscesses, and basal cell hyperplasia were all significantly associated with EoE.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: The newest esophageal inflammatory disease [^116mw9gh]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic esophageal inflammatory disease of undetermined pathophysiology that results in dense mucosal eosinophilia and esophageal dysfunction. In childhood, vague symptoms associated with GERD and feeding difficulties are the first manifestations of EoE. Adults typically present with dysphagia and food impaction. No pathognomonic features have been identified for EoE; therefore, its diagnosis must be made on both clinical and histological grounds. Effective treatments rely on steroids and dietary exclusions.

### Analysis of midesophageal biopsies increases sensitivity of detection of eosinophilic esophagitis [^116NazE3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is defined by the presence of abundant eosinophils in the squamous epithelium of the esophagus. There has been remarkable progress recently in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of EoE because undiagnosed EoE leads to an increase in fibrostenotic complications, including strictures. Timely diagnosis is critical.

### Distribution of esophageal eosinophilia as a predictor of proton pump inhibitor response in eosinophilic esophagitis [^113ERivu]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The impact of the esophageal eosinophilic distribution pattern on treatment outcomes in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is unclear. We aimed to determine if the eosinophil distribution at index endoscopy predicts proton pump inhibitor (PPI) response in EoE.

- **Methods**: This was a cohort study of newly-diagnosed adult EoE patients from three hospitals. All included patients received a trial of ≥ 8-week PPI and underwent repeat biopsies to assess response. Primary analyses compared PPI response between isolated distal disease (≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf on distal but not proximal biopsies) and proximal/diffuse eosinophilia (≥ 15 eosinophils/hpf on proximal ± distal biopsies). Secondary analyses categorized patients as distal-predominant (distal > proximal eosinophils by ≥ 10/hpf), proximal predominant (proximal > distal eosinophils by ≥ 10/hpf), or an even distribution pattern. Multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: A total of 266 patients (50.8% male, 89.1% white) met the inclusion criteria, including 66 with isolated distal and 200 with proximal/diffuse disease. PPI response was higher among patients with isolated distal disease [histologic remission (< 15 eosinophils/hpf post-PPI): 63.6% vs. 44.5%, p = 0.01; deep remission (< 6 eosinophils/hpf): 54.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.001; symptom improvement: 92.4% vs. 81.0%, p = 0.03]. On multivariable analyses, isolated distal disease remained independently associated with histologic response (adjusted OR: 2.04, CI: 1.10–3.77, p = 0.02), deep remission (adjusted OR: 2.46, CI: 1.33–4.54, p = 0.02), and symptom improvement.

### Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines on childhood eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders beyond eosinophilic esophagitis [^113dBLq6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, specifically in relation to endoscopy and biopsy, the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2024 guidelines recommend considering multiple biopsies. These should be taken from the terminal ileum and from at least three sites: the cecum/ascending colon, transverse/descending colon, and sigmoid/rectum. It is advised to obtain biopsies from both normal and abnormal appearing areas of the mucosa in patients with symptoms suggestive of eosinophilic colitis.

### Toward uniformity in the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): The effect of guidelines on variability of diagnostic criteria for EoE [^114M29ug]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent consensus guidelines for the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) have been published, but whether these guidelines have standardized diagnostic criteria for EoE remains unknown. This study aimed to determine if the EoE guidelines had an impact on the diagnostic criteria reported in the EoE literature and whether the previously observed variability in diagnostic criteria has become more uniform.

Two investigators independently conducted a MEDLINE search from January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2010, for all publications reporting EoE in human subjects. They also searched the proceedings of the 2007–2010 American College of Gastroenterology and American Gastroenterological Association meetings, using a predefined search strategy. Data were extracted from all relevant publications.

Of the 799 publications identified, 149 original reports, 99 reviews, and 165 abstracts were included. Overall, 32 original reports (21%) used diagnostic criteria consistent with each of the three components of the consensus guidelines. There was a significant increase when comparing original articles published after the release of the guidelines with those published earlier (31% vs. 6%, P < 0.001). The proportion of original articles using 15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) as a histological cut-point increased significantly (P = 0.001). However, there was still substantial variability in biopsy protocols and eosinophil count methodology. The majority of original articles did not report microscope high-power field (HPF) area.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^11583f5n]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

When treating patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), it is essential to achieve several treatment endpoints. These include inducing and maintaining remission of eosinophilic inflammation below 15 eosinophils per high-power field (HPF), controlling symptoms to improve quality of life, and preventing and treating complications.

- **Therapeutic options**: Therapeutic options include drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and topical corticosteroids, dietary interventions, and esophageal dilation. Any treatment may be offered as first-line therapy and later interchanged. However, the choice should consider the EoE phenotype (inflammatory versus fibrostenotic), the patient's clinical characteristics, preference and tolerance to treatment, as well as costs and available expertise.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: Diagnostic tests and criteria [^113YVynW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It reviews the diagnostic guidelines for EoE and presents an approach for its diagnosis. Additionally, it highlights selected techniques under development that may be useful for future diagnostics of EoE.

Recently updated guidelines emphasize that EoE is a clinicopathologic condition. Specifically, three criteria must be met to diagnose EoE: clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction; an esophageal biopsy with a maximum eosinophil count of at least 15 eosinophils per high-power microscopy field, with few exceptions; and exclusion of other possible causes of esophageal eosinophilia, including proton-pump inhibitor responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE). A PPI trial is typically required to assess for PPI-REE and evaluate the presence of concomitant gastroesophageal reflux disease.

EoE is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder. Because no single symptom, endoscopic finding, or histopathologic feature is pathognomonic, diagnosis can be challenging. In the future, symptom scores, tissue or serum biomarkers, and genetic testing may play a role in diagnosis. However, these methods have yet to be validated and are not recommended for routine clinical use.

### Characterization of eosinophilic esophagitis variants by clinical, histological, and molecular analyses: A cross-sectional multi-center study [^111sTqjG]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus that is defined clinically by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologically by an eosinophil‐predominant infiltration of the esophageal squamous epithelium with at least 15 eosinophils in at least one high power field (hpf). Recently, several findings — such as the only modest correlation of eosinophil infiltration with symptom severity or the lack of efficacy of eosinophil‐targeting medications — have questioned the role of eosinophils as the main driver of symptoms and inflammation, and therefore as the hallmark of EoE. Moreover, a new EoE‐like phenomenon has been described recently: five patients from four families with known EoE were evaluated for typical EoE symptoms, but without esophageal eosinophilia upon histological examination. These patients showed gene expression abnormalities similar to classical EoE, suggesting a uniform underlying pathogenesis; thus, we hypothesized that EoE is only one phenotype of a broader disease spectrum.

EoE centers around the world are increasingly confronted with patients reporting typical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction resembling EoE, but for whom the diagnosis cannot be established owing to the absence of any significant esophageal eosinophilia. It has yet to be determined whether these patients suffer from a distinct inflammatory entity, a variant of EoE, or an early stage of EoE. Similarly, there are additional chronic inflammatory disorders of the esophagus, such as lymphocytic esophagitis, for which there is…

### Optimal histologic cutpoints for treatment response in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis: Analysis of data from a prospective cohort study [^115Vz61y]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

The aims of this study were to determine a histologic cutpoint that identifies successful treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) by assessing symptomatic and endoscopic improvement, as no prospective studies substantiate 15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf) as an appropriate endpoint for treatment of EoE.

Methods - **Prospective cohort study**: We conducted a study involving 62 consecutive adult patients undergoing outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy at the University of North Carolina from 2009 through 2014. At diagnosis of EoE and after 8 weeks of standard treatment, symptom and endoscopic responses were measured using a visual analogue scale and an endoscopic severity score (ESS), and eosinophil counts were assessed. Receiver operator curves and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the histologic threshold that best predicted symptomatic and endoscopic response. For symptoms, analysis was limited to patients without baseline esophageal dilation.

Results - **Response outcomes**: The mean eosinophil count at diagnosis was 124 eos/hpf, which decreased to 35 eos/hpf after treatment. The mean visual analogue scale decreased from 3.4 at baseline to 1.7 after treatment, and the mean ESS decreased from 3 to 1.6. A total of 29 patients had symptom responses (47%) and 34 had endoscopic responses (55%). Post-treatment eosinophil count thresholds of 8, 15, and 5 eos/hpf best predicted symptom, endoscopic, and combined responses, respectively. On logistic regression, decreasing eosinophil count was significantly associated with the probability of symptomatic (P = 0.01) and endoscopic response (P < .001).

### Joint ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidelines on childhood eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders beyond eosinophilic esophagitis [^113Djuww]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for non-esophageal eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2024 guidelines recommend diagnosing these disorders in pediatric and adolescent patients based on the following criteria:

- **Symptoms and/or signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction**:
	- **Digestive symptoms**: Vomiting, abdominal pain or cramping, bloating, anorexia, early satiety, heartburn, dyspepsia, diarrhea or constipation, abdominal distention
	- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Hematemesis, hematochezia or melena
	- **Systemic signs**: Weight loss, tenesmus, ascites, iron deficiency, protein loss

- **Dense eosinophilic infiltrates**: Found in mucosal or full-thickness biopsies above organ-specific threshold values.

- **Absence of other diseases**: Associated with gastrointestinal mucosal eosinophilic inflammation.

### Italian EoExpert panel recommendation for disease control, switching criteria, and follow-up in eosinophilic esophagitis from pediatric to adult age [^111g6GTX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

One of the most challenging aspects of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is the diagnostic delay, highlighting the need for increased awareness to improve its early detection. It is well demonstrated that early diagnosis improves patients' health status and quality of life (QoL) and may slow the development of complications. Recent data shows that the median diagnostic delay in the Italian EoE population reaches 36 months, with mean patient- and physician-dependent diagnostic delays being 18 and 6 months, respectively. However, previous global data indicated that the average diagnostic delay in childhood rises to 4–6 years, increasing for children under age 6, and decreasing when associated with the presence of food allergy or a family history of EoE. The diagnostic delay can be attributable to both patients, who may adopt adaptive behaviors to cope with symptoms, and clinicians, who are not properly aware of diagnostic guidelines for EoE and have difficulty discerning EoE from other conditions with overlapping symptoms, such as GERD. It is important to underline that each year of symptoms before proper diagnosis corresponds to a 5% increased risk of fibrostenosis.

- **Disease management and criteria definition**: In the EoE management setting, important aspects need to be defined, such as adaptive behaviors potentially responsible for the delayed diagnosis of the disease, a shared definition of criteria for disease control and remission, as well as criteria for switching therapy in the case of inadequate control. In this sense, it becomes mandatory to understand the clinical, histological, and endoscopic characteristics, as well as their accurate evaluation in the diagnosis and management process.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for eosinophilic esophagitis, specifically with respect to esophageal biopsy, ESGE 2021 guidelines recommend taking at least 6 biopsies: 2–4 biopsies from the distal esophagus and 2–4 biopsies from the proximal esophagus, targeting areas with endoscopic mucosal abnormalities in patients with suspected EoE. It is advised to place distal and proximal biopsies in separate containers.

### Markers of eosinophilic inflammation for diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis and proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia: a prospective study [^1174fbkD]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Distinguishing between eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastroesophageal reflux disease, and proton pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) is challenging. We assessed whether immunohistochemical analysis of esophageal tissues for major basic protein (MBP), eotaxin-3, and tryptase can be used for diagnosis of EoE and to differentiate EoE from PPI-REE.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective study of 196 consecutive adults who underwent outpatient endoscopy at the University of North Carolina from 2009 through 2012. Incident cases of EoE were diagnosed per consensus guidelines. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or dysphagia served as controls. PPI-REE was defined as a symptomatic and histologic response to a PPI. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify MBP, eotaxin-3, and tryptase. The maximum density of epithelial staining was determined for each assay; levels were compared between EoE and control groups, and then EoE and PPI-REE groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed.

- **Results**: Esophageal tissues from patients with EoE (n = 50) had a median of 951 MBP-positive cells/mm², whereas those from controls (n = 123) had a median of 2 MBP-positive cells/mm² (P < .001). Samples from patients with EoE had a median of 155 eotaxin-3-positive cells/mm², while those from controls had 18 eotaxin-3-positive cells/mm² (P < .001). Samples from patients with EoE had a median of 249 tryptase-positive cells/mm², compared to 11 tryptase-positive cells/mm² in controls (P < .001).

### Promising modalities to identify and monitor eosinophilic esophagitis [^116gTDzB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergen-mediated condition characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologic evidence of intense eosinophilic inflammation involving the esophagus in the absence of overlapping conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. Since its initial description as a distinct entity approximately two decades ago, there has been a significant increase in the recognition of this clinicopathologic entity.

The approach to diagnose and monitor EoE requires repeated esophagogastroduodenoscopies, with associated sedation/anesthesia, to visualize mucosal abnormalities, obtain multiple biopsy specimens for histologic assessment, and evaluate treatment response. Frequent esophagogastroduodenoscopies with multiple biopsies can increase the risk of procedural complications, place a significant financial burden on families, and escalate healthcare costs.

In addition, this burdensome approach may contribute to delayed diagnosis and suboptimal monitoring, thereby increasing the likelihood of complications such as esophageal narrowing and stricture formation, which may require escalation of care, including endoscopic interventions. Clinical progression and complications associated with EoE can be attenuated through early identification and optimal management. Therefore, developing reliable, safe, less cumbersome, and cost-effective modalities for early diagnosis and effective monitoring of EoE is an area of active research. These efforts have been substantially supported by the development of new biomaterials and analytic methods.

### Dupixent [^114ezCM8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis was studied in adults and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older, with EoE. A total of 239 subjects, weighing at least 40 kg, were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial. This included two 24-week treatment periods (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B), where subjects received either DUPIXENT 300 mg QW or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 2% of the placebo group and 2% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg QW group. Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT, at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in Parts A and B. The safety profile of DUPIXENT in 72 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age, weighing at least 40 kg, and adults in Parts A and B was similar.

Pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age, weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE, were also evaluated. A total of 61 subjects participated in a randomized, blinded, parallel-group, multicenter trial, which included an initial 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part A) and a 36-week extended active treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part B). Subjects in Part A received a weight-based dosing regimen of DUPIXENT or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. All subjects in Part B completed Part A and received active treatment with weight-based dosing regimens of DUPIXENT in Part B (N = 47).

### Incidental gastric eosinophils in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis: Do they matter [^117B82Sp]? Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical features and response to therapy among patients with eosinophilic esophagitis with normal gastric biopsies (EE-N) and those with eosinophilic esophagitis and gastric mucosal abnormalities (EE-A). Some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), characterized by > 15 eosinophils per high-power field on esophageal mucosal biopsies and lack of response to acid suppression and/or normal pH probe study, exhibit incidental eosinophilic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. It remains uncertain whether patients with EE and normal gastric biopsies are phenotypically different from patients with gastric mucosal abnormalities, defined as > 10 eosinophils per high-power field on gastric biopsies.

- **Patients and methods**: Medical records of all patients with EE-A and a random group of patients with EE-N, diagnosed over an 8-year period, were reviewed. A subgroup analysis of patients treated with swallowed fluticasone and who underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy within 6 months of starting therapy was also performed.

- **Results**: During the study period, 41 patients had EE-A. When compared to 50 randomly selected patients with EE-N, no clinical differences were noted, including sex, age, presenting symptoms, esophageal histology, and atopy history. Eleven (27%) of the 41 EE-A patients and 14 (28%) of the 50 EE-N patients were treated with swallowed fluticasone, showing a similar response among the groups. The mean esophageal eosinophils per high-power field among the EE-A group decreased from 47 to 8, compared to a decrease from 46 to 7 among the EE-N group treated with fluticasone therapy (P = 0.91). In 9 (82%) of the 11 patients with EE-A treated with fluticasone, there was either resolution (7 out of 9) or significant improvement (2 out of the remaining patients).
