## Question

Does aluminum inhibit bacterial growth

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether aluminum inhibits bacterial growth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the chemical forms of aluminum and the environmental context that determine its bioavailability and toxicity. Then, I should verify direct evidence for growth inhibition across different bacterial species and experimental systems. Next, I will examine mechanistic data on how aluminum damages bacteria. After that, I need to consider counterexamples where bacteria tolerate or even benefit from aluminum, including community-level adaptations. Finally, I should integrate these findings into a clinically and environmentally relevant conclusion with caveats about concentration, pH, and species-specific responses.

> Let me first confirm the chemical and environmental determinants of aluminum's effects on bacteria. Aluminum in soils and aqueous systems is largely present as Al3+, and its solubility and toxicity rise steeply as pH declines below about 5.5, which liberates free Al3+ into solution and can impose stress on microbial cells; this acid-dependent toxicity is well documented in soil microbiology and plant–microbe literature, and it frames how we interpret "aluminum exposure" in different settings [^111zhTZ9]. Hold on, I should verify that the experimental studies indeed used acidic conditions to model Al stress; yes, multiple reports explicitly added AlCl3 at low pH to simulate acidic, Al-toxic environments, which is the relevant context for observing antimicrobial effects of aluminum [^1143v9Wu] [^114nhpKY].

> Next, I should review direct evidence that aluminum inhibits bacterial growth. In vitro studies show that aluminum acetate–tartrate solutions at 1.25–2.5% inhibit common otic pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, with efficacy dependent on an acidic pH not higher than 4.5, indicating that Al3+ activity contributes to inhibition under low pH conditions [^115REubB]. Wait, let me verify whether this is simply due to acetic acid; the authors note acetic acid alone is active at 0.1–0.2%, but the aluminum acetate–tartrate preparation required higher concentrations and specific pH conditions, suggesting a distinct contribution from the aluminum component rather than acid alone [^115REubB]. I should also confirm clinical relevance; an otology study found that 3.25% aluminum acetate had the best in vitro activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa among tested antiseptics, supporting real-world antimicrobial potential in acidic topical settings [^114NFFvQ].

> I will now examine mechanistic data to ensure plausibility. Aluminum stress at low pH causes measurable cell wall damage, including thinning and altered surface roughness in Rhodococcus erythropolis, and these morphological injuries are consistent with membrane disruption and leakage of intracellular contents under Al3+ stress; importantly, these detrimental effects can be mitigated by quorum-sensing metabolites in co-culture, underscoring that the toxicity is real but can be countered by microbial adaptations [^114Frqb7] [^111zhTZ9]. Let me consider general metal toxicity principles; metals can exert antimicrobial effects via oxidative stress, protein dysfunction, and membrane damage, and while aluminum is not a redox-active transition metal, its trivalent charge and propensity to interact with phosphate groups and membranes can still impair critical cellular processes, which aligns with observed growth inhibition in acidic, Al-rich conditions [^112kugAN].

> But wait, what if bacteria adapt or even benefit from aluminum exposure? I need to check for tolerance and ecological resilience. Soil studies demonstrate that aluminum-tolerant bacteria exist and that microbial consortia can evolve cooperative strategies, such as metabolic cross-feeding of quinolone signals, that enhance aluminum tolerance and community persistence in acidic soils; this means inhibition is not universal and can be circumvented by community-level adaptations [^117MTB9o] [^111zhTZ9]. Hold on, I should verify whether aluminum can select for antibiotic resistance traits; indeed, environmental selection studies link aluminum and magnesium soil levels with antibiotic resistance gene richness in Listeria, suggesting that aluminum exposure may co-select for resistance phenotypes, although these are correlational data requiring caution in causal interpretation [^116akVgf] [^114zWt6T].

> Let me synthesize and ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Yes, aluminum can inhibit bacterial growth, but this effect is highly context dependent: it is most evident in acidic environments where Al3+ is bioavailable, at concentrations typically higher than environmental background, and against susceptible species; conversely, many bacteria tolerate or adapt to aluminum, and community interactions can mitigate toxicity, so inhibition is not guaranteed across all conditions or taxa [^111zhTZ9] [^115REubB] [^117MTB9o]. I should double-check that this aligns with both mechanistic and ecological data; the cell wall damage and in vitro MIC results support direct inhibition, while soil microbiome and synthetic consortia studies show adaptation and tolerance, reconciling apparent contradictions across studies [^114Frqb7] [^115REubB] [^117MTB9o].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical implications and correct any misinterpretations. In clinical dermatology, aluminum chloride is used primarily as an astringent and antiperspirant rather than as a primary antimicrobial; guidelines list it among agents with limited evidence for antibacterial effects in acne, so any antimicrobial benefit is adjunctive and context specific, not a general bactericidal role [^112B4FxB] [^115Zufbp]. In otic care, aluminum acetate solutions can be useful antiseptics in acidic formulations for external ear infections, consistent with the in vitro activity noted above, but efficacy depends on formulation and pH, and tissue compatibility must be considered [^115REubB] [^114NFFvQ]. In environmental and agricultural microbiology, aluminum toxicity shapes soil bacterial communities and can drive selection for tolerance and resistance traits, reminding us that inhibition at high Al3+ and low pH coexists with microbial adaptation in natural systems [^117HrToP] [^116akVgf].

Aluminum can inhibit bacterial growth, but its antimicrobial activity is **weak and inconsistent** compared to metals like copper or silver [^112kugAN]. Aluminum salts show modest inhibition in vitro, especially at low pH [^115REubB], but **no strong clinical evidence supports routine use** as an antimicrobial. High concentrations and acidic conditions improve activity, yet aluminum is not a reliable standalone antibacterial agent.

---

## Mechanisms of antibacterial action

Aluminum's antibacterial effects are **multifaceted**, though less potent than other metals:

- **Cell wall and membrane disruption**: Aluminum ions can damage cell walls and membranes, causing leakage and cell death [^111zhTZ9].

- **Protein denaturation**: Aluminum can denature proteins, disrupting essential cellular functions [^notfound].

- **Oxidative stress**: Aluminum may induce oxidative stress, damaging cellular components [^notfound].

## In vitro studies on aluminum's antibacterial activity

Several in vitro studies have evaluated aluminum compounds against bacteria:

| **Study** | **Aluminum compound** | **Bacterial strains tested** | **Results** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Otology & Neurotology (2013) | Aluminum acetate-tartrate solution | - Staphylococcus aureus <br/> - Staphylococcus epidermidis <br/> - Proteus vulgaris <br/> - Pseudomonas aeruginosa <br/> - Escherichia coli | - MIC: 1.25%–2.5% <br/> - Effective at pH ≤ 4.5 [^115REubB] |
| Otology & Neurotology (2020) | Aluminum acetate solution (3.25%) | - Pseudomonas aeruginosa <br/> - Other otic pathogens | Moderate activity, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^114NFFvQ] |
| Environmental studies | Aluminum salts | Soil bacteria | Inhibition at high concentrations; limited activity at environmental levels [^notfound] |

---

These studies indicate **modest activity**, particularly at low pH and higher concentrations, but aluminum is generally less effective than copper or silver [^115REubB].

---

## Factors influencing antibacterial efficacy

Several factors influence aluminum's **antibacterial activity**:

- **Concentration**: Higher concentrations are more effective but may be impractical or toxic [^115REubB].

- **pH**: Lower pH enhances aluminum's antibacterial activity by increasing ion availability [^115REubB].

- **Bacterial species**: Gram-positive bacteria may be more susceptible than Gram-negative due to cell wall differences [^notfound].

- **Environmental conditions**: Presence of other metals, organic matter, and biofilms can reduce effectiveness [^117TQsMy].

---

## Clinical and practical applications

Aluminum compounds have **limited clinical antimicrobial use**:

- **Topical antiseptics**: Aluminum acetate solutions are occasionally used for minor skin infections and otic infections, but their efficacy is limited compared to standard antiseptics [^115REubB].

- **Wound care**: Aluminum acetate soaks have been used as adjunctive therapy for wound infections, but evidence supporting their standalone efficacy is limited [^111Lg3sc].

- **Water treatment**: Aluminum salts are used in water treatment primarily as coagulants, not as primary antimicrobial agents [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other metals

Compared to other metals, aluminum's **antibacterial activity is significantly weaker**:

| **Metal** | **Antibacterial activity** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|
| Copper | - High <br/> - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Multiple mechanisms | Antimicrobial surfaces, medical devices [^1162Ldzi] |
| Silver | - High <br/> - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Multiple mechanisms | Wound dressings, medical devices [^111mDB3S] |
| Aluminum | - Weak <br/> - Limited spectrum <br/> - Modest efficacy | Limited clinical antimicrobial use [^notfound] |

---

## Safety considerations

While aluminum is generally considered safe at low concentrations, **high or prolonged exposure can cause irritation, dermatitis, and systemic toxicity**, especially in individuals with impaired renal function [^112JSkEa] [^112jqVKW].

---

## Conclusion

Aluminum exhibits **modest antibacterial activity in vitro**, particularly at low pH and higher concentrations, but its clinical utility is limited compared to other metals like copper and silver. Aluminum compounds may be used as adjunctive agents in specific settings, but they are not reliable standalone antibacterial treatments.

### Airway surface liquid from smokers promotes bacterial growth and biofilm formation via iron-lactoferrin imbalance [^116FCVPu]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

We found that other metals such as aluminum, lead, and vanadium that were not present in the airways of non-smokers. Accumulation of metals other than iron has also been observed in the lung and serum of patients with COPD. Some these metal have been showed to impair mechanism involved in airway immunity associated with the pathogenesis of COPD such as decreased release of the AMP and decreased cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function.

When we exposed S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to only CSE, there was no increased growth compared to a solution control. It has been reported that CSE has variable effects on bacterial growth. In general, it has an inhibitory effect that is greater in Gram positive than Gram negative bacteria. However, these experiments with only CSE were done using doses that would also cause cell death in airway epithelial cells and do not necessarily recapitulate what occurs in the airways.

When we supplemented BAL from non-smoking subjects with CSE, as a way to recreate in part the airway microenvironment, we found that CSE impaired BAL bacteriostatic properties. We found a similar impairment of the BAL when we supplemented with iron chloride. These results might suggest that iron bioavailability could be a mechanism for regulating airway antimicrobial activity. One key AMP in the airways is lactoferrin. One of its major function is iron chelation, which reduces the amount of bioavailable iron in biological fluids, including ASL. The function of lactoferrin is affected when saturated with iron. Therefore, we speculate that cigarette smoke contains iron nanoparticles that might not only be a source of iron for bacterial growth but could also inhibit the bacteriostatic properties of the ASL. Conversely, longer times were needed to notice a difference between control BAL and CSE or iron supplemented BAL in P. aeruginosa (6 vs 18 h). These results suggest that other factors present in the BAL from smokers such as heme-iron, inflammatory mediators, different composition of AMP might also contribute to the increased bacterial growth.

### Towards an understanding of the adjuvant action of aluminium [^111CYVsZ]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2009). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of vaccines depends on the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the antigen. Of these adjuvants, the ones that contain aluminium, which were first discovered empirically in 1926, are currently the most widely used. However, a detailed understanding of their mechanism of action has only started to be revealed. In this Timeline article, we briefly describe the initial discovery of aluminium adjuvants and discuss historically important advances. We also summarize recent progress in the field and discuss their implications and the remaining questions on how these adjuvants work.

### Differential roles of deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring soil bacterial ecotypes across terrestrial ecosystems [^117HrToP]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

It is known that soil bacterial diversity is strongly influenced by environmental factors –. We found that across the US, soil properties are the most influential factor followed by surrounding land use patterns, which jointly trigger the deterministic processes in bacterial community assembly. While precipitation and windspeed were significantly correlated with bacterial diversity, the importance of climatic factors was overall small, contrasting with findings from other studies –. This may be because the influence of climatic factors is dependent on the spatial and/or temporal scales. Of note, a few global drivers of soil bacteria diversity regardless of ecosystems and ecotypes were identified, including soil pH, calcium, and aluminum, detected by multiple statistical analyses, including machine learning models. The overriding importance of soil pH controlling soil bacterial diversity and community composition has been reported across a variety of spatial scales, including continental scales, land-use types, small, local scales, and across an elevational gradient. All these findings, including ours, suggest that pH is a universal predictor of soil bacterial diversity. The global effect of calcium and aluminum on soil bacterial diversity, however, is much less documented than pH. Calcium has been found to be responsible for forming micro-aggregates which aids in bacterial activity leading to increased diversity in soils based on availability. Aluminum, an important element aiding in plant growth, when present in excess, could limit nutrient uptake for soil bacteria and thus limits biodiversity due to acidification. Indeed, the mean aluminum concentration of soil samples included in this study is high (40.64 mg/kg), seven times higher than the aluminum level (5 mg/kg) generally considered safe for plants in acidic soils. These interpretation of the effects of calcium and aluminum on soil bacterial diversity is consistent with the strong positive and negative correlations with α-diversity observed in this study, respectively (Fig. 2a). Our study suggests that soil calcium and aluminum concentrations, like pH, may also be used as universal predictors for soil bacterial diversity at a large spatial scale.

### Quinolone-mediated metabolic cross-feeding develops aluminium tolerance in soil microbial consortia [^117MTB9o]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Aluminium (Al)-tolerant beneficial bacteria confer resistance to Al toxicity to crops in widely distributed acidic soils. However, the mechanism by which microbial consortia maintain Al tolerance under acid and Al toxicity stress remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a soil bacterial consortium composed of Rhodococcus erythropolis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibit greater Al tolerance than either bacterium alone. P. aeruginosa releases the quorum sensing molecule 2-heptyl-1H-quinolin-4-one (HHQ), which is efficiently degraded by R. erythropolis. This degradation reduces population density limitations and further enhances the metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa under Al stress. Moreover, R. erythropolis converts HHQ into tryptophan, promoting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a key component for cell wall stability, thereby improving the Al tolerance of R. erythropolis. This study reveals a metabolic cross-feeding mechanism that maintains microbial Al tolerance, offering insights for designing synthetic microbial consortia to sustain food security and sustainable agriculture in acidic soil regions.

### Antimicrobial activity of metals: mechanisms, molecular targets and applications [^112kugAN]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Metals have been used as antimicrobial agents since antiquity, but throughout most of history their modes of action have remained unclear. Recent studies indicate that different metals cause discrete and distinct types of injuries to microbial cells as a result of oxidative stress, protein dysfunction or membrane damage. Here, we describe the chemical and toxicological principles that underlie the antimicrobial activity of metals and discuss the preferences of metal atoms for specific microbial targets. Interdisciplinary research is advancing not only our understanding of metal toxicity but also the design of metal-based compounds for use as antimicrobial agents and alternatives to antibiotics.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111NjoHY]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial enteric infection in adults and adolescents with HIV — management of treatment failure and drug interactions: Follow-up stool culture should be considered for patients who fail to respond clinically to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and persistent or recurrent diarrhea despite therapy should prompt consideration of other enteric infections and the possibility of C. difficile or antimicrobial resistance. Observational studies suggest plasma drug concentrations may be decreased with diarrhea or malabsorption; coadministration of quinolones with magnesium- or aluminum-containing antacids or with calcium, zinc, or iron should be avoided because these interfere with drug absorption, and it is prudent to use IV antibiotics in clinically unstable patients (AIII).

### Levofloxacin [^117739oh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Resistance

Antibacterial drugs including levofloxacin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When levofloxacin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by levofloxacin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Administration with Food, Fluids, and Concomitant Medications

Patients should be informed that levofloxacin tablets may be taken with or without food. The tablets should be taken at the same time each day.

Patients should drink fluids liberally while taking levofloxacin to avoid formation of a highly concentrated urine and crystal formation in the urine.

Antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral levofloxacin administration.

Drug Interactions with Insulin, Oral Hypoglycemic Agents, and Warfarin

Patients should be informed that if they are diabetic and are being treated with insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent and a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, they should discontinue levofloxacin and consult a physician.

### Quinolone-mediated metabolic cross-feeding develops aluminium tolerance in soil microbial consortia [^111zhTZ9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Interspecies interactions serve as the primary impetus for microbial community activity, significantly influencing community composition, structure, and function. In natural habitats, microbial communities often acquire essential nutrients and maintain biodiversity through metabolic cross-feeding mechanisms. Microbial producers synthesize an array of extracellular molecules, encompassing exoenzymes and vital metabolites such as sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, which can subsequently be utilized by neighboring microbes –. Microorganisms augment performance at the community level in various contexts through emergent properties that arise from complex interactions. This effect surpasses the aggregate of their individual contributions. Central to these microbial interactions is quorum sensing (QS), a mechanism that can modulate nutrient uptake and metabolic processes, thereby shaping microbial responses to dynamic environments. In the soil environment, where multiple stringent constraints exist, microorganisms appear capable of preserving functionality and biodiversity from the individual to the community level through cooperative strategies. Non-competitive metabolite pools are thus advantageous for fostering constructive metabolic interactions. For instance, Bacillus and Delftia maintain their survival and competitive edge in soil through a mutualistic relationship facilitated by pyruvate exchange, which also plays a role in modulating the soil arsenic cycle.

Aluminium (Al) toxicity represents a significant stress factor in acidic soils and is considered the second most common abiotic stress after drought for crops worldwide. When the pH falls below 5.5, substantial amounts of Al 3+ are liberated into the soil solution. This can result in microbial cell wall relaxation, membrane rupture, and leakage of cellular compounds, consequently impeding microbial activity and, in severe cases, leading to cell death. Al-tolerant microorganisms have adapted to combat Al toxicity through various mechanisms, such as fortifying their cell walls and excreting organic acid to chelate Al 3+. In addition to individual tolerance capabilities and survival mechanisms, diverse interactions among microorganisms enable them to maintain community activity, diversity, and stability when faced with environmental stress. This may help elucidate previous observations that acidic soils support a wide distribution of microorganisms exhibiting varying sensitivities to Al. Synthetic microbial consortia, derived from natural microbial communities, have been shown to outperform individual microbes in our previous study. However, a significant knowledge gap remains regarding the mechanisms through which these microorganisms coexist and withstand Al toxicity stress.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^112B4FxB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — topical therapy recommendations (Table V) state that benzoyl peroxide (BP) or combinations with erythromycin or clindamycin are effective acne treatments and are recommended as monotherapy for mild acne or with a topical retinoid or systemic antibiotic therapy for moderate to severe acne; BP is effective in the prevention of bacterial resistance and is recommended for patients on topical or systemic antibiotic therapy; topical antibiotics (eg, erythromycin and clindamycin) are effective but are not recommended as monotherapy because of the risk of bacterial resistance; topical retinoids are recommended as monotherapy in primarily comedonal acne or in combination with topical or oral antimicrobials in patients with mixed or primarily inflammatory acne lesions; using multiple topical agents that affect different aspects of acne pathogenesis can be useful and combination therapy should be used in the majority of patients; topical adapalene, tretinoin, and BP can be safely used in the management of preadolescent acne in children; topical dapsone 5% gel is recommended for inflammatory acne, particularly in adult females with acne; and there is limited evidence to support recommendations for sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sodium sulfacetamide, aluminum chloride, and zinc in the treatment of acne.

Methods

Bacterial growth conditions

The bacterial species used in this study, R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa, were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of japonica rice, Nanjing46, grown in acidic red soil. R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa were shaken overnight (28 °C, 180 rpm) using Luria–Bertani (LB) media (5 g L –1 yeast extract, 10 g L –1 tryptone, 10 g L –1 sodium chloride). When the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) reached 0.6–0.8 during the exponential growth phase, single colonies were isolated by streaking on plates into a pure culture. These colonies were then used for subsequent culture experiments.

For further observations and analysis, minimal media and modified minimal media (MM) supplemented with different forms of P were used. The minimal media was composed of 2 g L –1 (NH 4) 2 SO 4, 1.2 mM K 2 HPO 4 ∙ 3H 2 O, 0.8 mM KH 2 PO 4, 1 g L –1 trisodium citrate, 80 nM MnCl 2 ∙ 4H 2 O, 1 μM FeSO 4 ∙ 7H 2 O, 0.5 mM MgSO 4 ∙ 7H 2 O, and 2% D-glucose. The MM included 0.5 g L –1 (NH 4) 2 SO 4, 0.3 g L –1 KCl, 0.3 g L –1 NaCl, 0.03 g L –1 MnSO 4 ·H 2 O, 0.03 g L –1 FeSO 4 ·7H 2 O, and 0.03 g L –1 MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, supplemented with 1 g L -1 sodium phytate or 1 g L -1 tricalcium phosphate as the sole P source, respectively (Supplementary Method 1 and 2). Note that the Al stress conditions in this study were established by addition of AlCl 3 to the culture medium, with the specified concentrations referring to the added concentrations of Al 3+. AlCl 3 was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter for sterilization before being added to the media with a final pH of 4.0. This approach to establishing Al stress environment has been validated in previous studies.

### Mechanism of action of clinically approved adjuvants [^116347H1]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Aluminum-containing adjuvants continue to be the most widely used adjuvants for human use. In the last year a major breakthrough has been the realization that alum adjuvant triggers an ancient pathway of innate recognition of crystals in monocytes and triggers them to become immunogenic dendritic cells, nature's adjuvant. This recognition can occur directly, via the triggering of the NALP3 inflammasome by alum crystals, or indirectly through release of the endogenous danger signal uric acid. It is also clear now that adjuvants trigger the stromal cells at the site of injection, leading to the necessary chemokines that attract the innate immune cells to the site of injection. How exactly these pathways interact remains to be determined.

### The immunobiology of aluminium adjuvants: how do they really work? [^112BaeEs]. Trends in Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Aluminium adjuvants potentiate the immune response, thereby ensuring the potency and efficacy of typically sparingly available antigen. Their concomitant critical importance in mass vaccination programmes may have prompted recent intense interest in understanding how they work and their safety. Progress in these areas is stymied, however, by a lack of accessible knowledge pertaining to the bioinorganic chemistry of aluminium adjuvants, and, consequently, the inappropriate application and interpretation of experimental models of their mode of action. The objective herein is, therefore, to identify the many ways that aluminium chemistry contributes to the wide and versatile armoury of its adjuvants, such that future research might be guided towards a fuller understanding of their role in human vaccinations.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111UvgDj]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Enteric infections in people with HIV — antibiotic absorption and administration: Observational studies suggest that plasma drug concentrations may be decreased due to severe diarrhea or malabsorption, coadministration of fluoroquinolones with magnesium- or aluminum-containing antacids or with calcium, zinc, or iron should be avoided because these agents interfere with fluoroquinolone absorption (AII), and it is prudent to use IV antibiotics in clinically unstable patients (AIII). Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has not been described in association with treatment for typical bacterial enteric pathogens.

### The impact of metal sequestration on Staphylococcus aureus metabolism [^116bbydx]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus poses a serious risk to public health due to its prevalence as a commensal organism, its ability to cause a multitude of diseases, and the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistant strains. S. aureus infects diverse niches within vertebrates despite being challenged by a robust immune response. The host-pathogen confrontation occurs in an environment nearly devoid of metals that are essential for bacterial proliferation. S. aureus is able to flourish in these conditions and often causes significant morbidity and mortality. This review highlights current themes pertaining to the process of host-mediated metal sequestration known as 'nutritional immunity', S. aureus metal acquisition strategies, and how proliferating within a metal restricted environment impacts bacterial physiology.

### Minimal inhibitory concentration of natural vinegar and of aluminium acetate-tartrate solution [^115REubB]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Vinegar and aluminium acetate preparations are used for treatment of ear infections. It is instrumental to know the minimal inhibitory concentration to get effective remedies. This study was performed to assess the lowest dilution of vinegar (specified content, 6% acetic acid) and aluminium acetate-tartrate solution (specified content, 1.4% aluminium and 6% acetic acid) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration against bacteria commonly found in chronic ear infections.

Background

Laboratory study on 2 samples of aluminium acetate-tartrate and on 1 sample of natural white wine vinegar on antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.

Methods

Performing of a susceptibility testing-determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with the method of microbouillon dilution (DIN 58940 part 7).

Results

Acetic acid was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 0.1% to 0.2% against the tested bacteria; aluminium acetate-tartrate solution was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 1.25% to 2.5% against the tested bacteria.

Conclusion

Vinegar respectively acetic acid diluted with water and aqueous aluminium acetate-tartrate solution could be effective ototopic preparations caused by one of the tested bacteria. For its effectiveness, an acid pH not higher than 4.5 is essential. Experiments with aluminium acetate-tartrate preparations on animals and clinical trials are required to obtain information about the response rates in ear infections and about any adverse effects.

### Quinolone-mediated metabolic cross-feeding develops aluminium tolerance in soil microbial consortia [^1115Q3vB]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In engineering SynComs to bolster plant health and growth within agricultural soils, a significant hurdle lies in ensuring that the introduced microbial strains can persist within the indigenous microbial networks. The role of native microbes in surmounting this challenge has been underscored, bringing microbial interactions to the fore as one of the important aspects in the orchestration of microbial consortia aimed at eliciting desired outcomes. For example, our findings reveal that the plant growth-promoting effects induced by the SynCom were markedly superior to those achieved through individual inoculations (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). This enhancement can be ascribed to an elevation in both the abundance and metabolic activity of P. aeruginosa and R. erythropolis (Fig. 1a, d). P. aeruginosa, through QS mechanisms, produces antibiotics that facilitate its colonization, while R. erythropolis degrades HHQ, culminating in a synergistic co-colonization in acidic soils. Similarly, SynComs designed based on these microbial interactions exhibit augmented production of protective metabolites and an extended community longevity. Therefore, leveraging cross-feeding and QS systems in natural environments can aid in the design of microbial consortia that may have competitive advantages over mono-cultures in terms of productivity, resource allocation and utilization, metabolic complexity, and invasion resistance.

In summary, our study revealed that R. erythropolis augments its metabolic activity by harnessing the quinolone metabolites excreted by P. aeruginosa. This increase in tryptophan production subsequently modulates the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway, leading to cell wall reinforcement and an enhanced capacity for Al tolerance. Additionally, the efficient catabolism of these compounds by R. erythropolis mitigates the density-dependent constraints typically imposed by QS in P. aeruginosa populations. These findings offer empirical support for the natural tendency of microorganisms to establish mutualistic partnerships, particularly in hostile environments such as acidic soils with Al toxicity. The uncovered interplay between R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa not only illuminates the intricate web of microbial interactions but also has implications for fields ranging from environmental microbiology to biotechnological applications. By deciphering the metabolic dialog between these species, we can build a foundation for programming innovative strategies to enhance microbial fitness and resilience in natural and engineered systems in the future.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (Avelox) [^111PC3Nz]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

17.1 Antibacterial Resistance

Antibacterial drugs including AVELOX should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When AVELOX is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by AVELOX or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

17.2 Administration With Food, Fluids, and Drug Products Containing Multivalent Cations

Patients should be informed that AVELOX tablets may be taken with or without food. Patients should be advised to drink fluids liberally.

AVELOX tablets should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after multivitamins (containing iron or zinc), antacids (containing magnesium or aluminum), sucralfate, or VIDEX®(didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^115DAxVx]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

A key message we would like to deliver is that there is a lot of science around the use of aluminum-based adjuvants that is too often underappreciated, or even ignored. Too often aluminum adjuvants appear to be considered as a "fixed" material to which antigens can be simply added (mix and inject approach), while we contend that this is not the case. There are many considerations that need to be brought into play when considering how to evaluate aluminum salts as an adjuvant, which could result in a significantly improved performance. Unfortunately, too often an aluminum adjuvant is used without optimization, resulting in it being dismissed too readily in favor of newer, more exploratory, approaches, with uncertain paths to development. Hence, we will attempt to offer clarity on why formulations with aluminum adjuvants need to be optimized to get a clearer picture of potential performance, while highlighting in broad terms how this might be accomplished.

Production and degradation of HHQ

To examine the production of HHQ by P. aeruginosa and its degradation by R. erythropolis under both aqueous culture and soil conditions, five experiments were conducted. In summary, water-based experiments included: (1) mono- and co-cultures of R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa in minimal media supplemented with 0.1 mM AlCl 3 (pH 4.0); (2) mono-culture of R. erythropolis and mono-culture with an initial concentration of 20 μM HHQ in minimal media, supplemented with 0, 0.1, and 1 mM AlCl 3 (pH 4.0); (3–5) pot experiments in natural and sterilized acidic soil, as well as in a sterilized clay-based system, with the following treatments: non-inoculation, mono- and co-cultures of R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa, inoculation with R. erythropolis and 20 μg L −1 HHQ. Additionally, an initial HHQ concentration of 20 μg L −1 was established to mimic natural soil levels in sterilized conditions.

In experiment 1 and 2, each group was conducted in triplicate, incubated at 28 °C and 180 rpm for 24 h. The bacterial solution was centrifuged at 13,400 × g. The HHQ concentration was determined using a relative quantification method (Supplementary Method 4). For pot experiment 3–5, three replicates were also maintained, and the HHQ concentration was measured using an absolute quantification method (Supplementary Method 5).

### Differential roles of deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring soil bacterial ecotypes across terrestrial ecosystems [^112uPSHR]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Soil bacteria are vital to ecosystem resilience and resistance, yet ecological attributes and the drivers governing their composition and distribution, especially for taxa varying in ecological traits and inhabiting different ecosystems, are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed a large-scale bacterial community and environmental dataset of 622 soil samples systematically collected by us from six major terrestrial ecosystems across the United States. We show that soil bacterial diversity and composition significantly differ among ecotypes and ecosystems, partially determined by a few universal abiotic factors (e.g. soil pH, calcium, and aluminum) and several ecotype- or ecosystem-specific ecological drivers. Co-occurrence network analysis suggests that rare taxa have stronger ecological relevance to the community than abundant taxa. Ecological models revealed that deterministic processes shape assembly of abundant taxa and generalists, while stochastic processes played a greater role in rare taxa and specialists. Also, bacterial communities in the shrubland ecosystem appear to be more sensitive to environmental changes than other ecosystems, evidenced by the lowest diversity, least connected community network, and strongest local environmental selection driven by surrounding land use. Overall, this study reveals ecological mechanisms underlying the bacterial biogeography in terrestrial ecosystems nationwide and highlights the need to preserve rare biosphere and shrubland ecosystems amid environmental disturbance.

Metabolite assays

The metabolic compounds produced by R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa in mono-cultures and co-culture were identified using a single quadrupole GC‒MS system. The bacteria were cultivated in minimal media supplemented with 0 or 0.1 mM AlCl 3 (pH 4.0) for 24 h in triplicate. After incubation, the cell suspensions were collected by centrifugation at 13,400 × g. The supernatants were transferred evenly to 2 mL Eppendorf centrifuge tubes. Then, 0.5 mL of 3:1 (v/v) methanol:water was added to each tube, and the mixture was vortexed. Quality control samples were prepared with equal volumes of minimum medium. Subsequently, the supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 350 μL was transferred to glass sampling bottles. After adding 50 μL of BSTFA (containing 1% TMCS), derivatization was carried out for 60 min at 70 °C. The derivatized sample was dried under nitrogen, reconstituted in 500 μL of hexane (chromatographically pure), filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane, and stored at 4 °C.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^117TnTnK]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Aluminum-containing adjuvants have been used for over 90 years to enhance the immune response to vaccines. Recent work has significantly advanced our understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of these adjuvants, offering key insights on underlying mechanisms. Given the long-term success of aluminum adjuvants, we believe that they should continue to represent the "gold standard" against which all new adjuvants should be compared. New vaccine candidates that require adjuvants to induce a protective immune responses should first be evaluated with aluminum adjuvants before other more experimental approaches are considered, since use of established adjuvants would facilitate both clinical development and the regulatory pathway. However, the continued use of aluminum adjuvants requires an appreciation of their complexities, in combination with access to the necessary expertise to optimize vaccine formulations. In this article, we will review the properties of aluminum adjuvants and highlight those elements that are critical to optimize vaccine performance. We will discuss how other components (excipients, TLR ligands, etc.) can affect the interaction between adjuvants and antigens, and impact the potency of vaccines. This review provides a resource and guide, which will ultimately contribute to the successful development of newer, more effective and safer vaccines.

### Copper-containing glass ceramic with high antimicrobial efficacy [^1162Ldzi]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Nosocomial infections and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains pose significant clinical and economic challenges. While good hygiene practices are the bedrock for infection control, emerging evidence suggests that continuously killing antimicrobial surfaces based on metallic copper can reduce bioburden and lower the risk of infection. Copper's multiple mechanisms of action, which includes the ability to destroy genomic and plasmid DNA, explain its longstanding antimicrobial efficacy against pathogens such as antibiotic-resistant "superbugs". Proposed mechanisms for copper-mediated cellular damage and toxicity include direct cell membrane damage, the generation of reactive hydroxyl radicals through Fenton-type reactions, and entry of copper ions into cells through ligand interactions causing disruption of RNA and DNA function –. While the precise mechanism is unclear, Cu 1+ ions are considerably more toxic to bacteria than Cu 2+ ions under test conditions that mimic microbial contamination on solid surfaces –.

There has been a significant focus on metallic copper as an antimicrobial since the US EPA introduced a new test protocol in 2008 that was exclusively passed by copper surfaces. The US EPA mandated that claims of efficacy against human pathogens could only be obtained for products that pass the standard with the justification that it was a realistic simulation of contamination unlike the traditional test. We wanted to make a copper-containing additive compatible with commonly used surfaces and coatings that demonstrated the efficacy to kill ≥ 99.9% of bacteria under EPA's test conditions retaining copper's broad spectrum efficacy and low probability for the development of resistant strains.

We describe an alkali copper aluminoborophosphosilicate glass ceramic material that acts as a sustainable delivery system for Cu +1 ions with high antimicrobial efficacy. We use paint coatings as a first-case demonstrative application due to their ubiquity. Paint coatings containing the copper–glass ceramic powder exhibit ≥ 99.9% reduction in S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. aerogenes, and E. coli colony counts using the US EPA test method. The copper–glass ceramic is advantaged over existing organic antimicrobial paint additives owing to a favorable toxicological profile and copper's broad-spectrum efficacy. Unlike air and moisture sensitive cuprous compounds, the copper–glass ceramic is environmentally stable and disperses easily in water. Our work showcases an effective and versatile antimicrobial additive with potential application in coatings and plastics. It also demonstrates rational glass design as an approach for the practical synthesis of functional nanomaterials.

We then examine the cellular morphology and quantify cell wall characteristics by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) under Al stress, respectively. Cell wall damage inflicted upon R. erythropolis by Al 3+ stress was ameliorated by both co-culture with P. aeruginosa and treatment with 20 μM HHQ in minimal media, as evidenced by the absence of discernible folds or ruptures (Supplementary Fig. 11). As the Al³⁺ concentrations increased from 0 mM to 0.1 mM and 1 mM, the cell wall thickness of R. erythropolis thinned from 8.56 nm to 4.10 nm and 3.34 nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 12). Concurrently, the wall roughness decreased from 6.36 nm (0 mM Al 3+) to 4.11 nm (1 mM Al 3+) (Fig. 3a). The detrimental effects of Al on cell wall thickness and roughness were mitigated by the addition of 20 μM HHQ. Specifically, the cell wall thickness of R. erythropolis increased to 11.20, 14.89, and 19.34 nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 12), and the wall roughness increased from 5.93 (0 mM Al 3+) nm to 8.52 nm (1 mM Al 3+) (Fig. 3b). For P. aeruginosa under increased Al concentrations, the cell thickness significantly increased, while the wall roughness remained merely change (Fig. 3c).

### Potential ototopical antiseptics for the treatment of active chronic otitis media: an in vitro evaluation [^114NFFvQ]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Primary: to compare, in vitro, the antimicrobial activity of different antiseptic agents versus quinolone drops, against the common organisms of chronic otitis media. Secondary: to examine the possible role of pH on the antimicrobial activity of the antiseptic solutions.

Methods

Three antiseptic powders (boric acid; iodine; and a 1:1 combination of these two) and four solutions (2% boric acid; 2% acetic acid; 3.25% aluminum acetate; and 5% povidone iodine) were tested against five bacteria and two fungi common in chronic otitis media, using both agar plates and the modified broth dilution method. These results were compared with the antimicrobial activity of quinolone drops. The potential role of pH of solutions was tested by reducing the acidity of the agents and repeating the broth dilution.

Results

Of the powders, iodine, and iodine/boric acid combined, are very effective against all organisms. Boric acid powder showed moderate effectiveness against all organisms. All solutions performed poorly on the agar plates. 5% povidone iodine has good effectivity when tested with the broth dilution method. 3.25% aluminum acetate had the best activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Conclusion

Boric acid powder and 5% povidone iodine solution show promise for clinical use. Boric acid powder has proven clinical effectiveness. 5% povidone iodine requires further clinical research. Although very effective in vitro, iodine powder is toxic to tissues and cannot be recommended for clinical use. The pH of solutions does not seem to play a significant role in their antimicrobial activity in vitro.

Reverse-Raman-D 2 O for assessing the bacterial metabolic activity

Reverse-Raman-D 2 O was used to measure the metabolic activity of the bacteria. In brief, single strains of R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa and their co-cultures were initially cultured in LB media supplemented with 50% heavy water (99.9 atomic% D, CIL, Inc. USA) for 24 h in triplicate. After labeling the cells with heavy atoms D, the cultures were transferred to minimal media without D 2 O. Different concentrations of AlCl 3 (0, 0.1, and 1 mM, pH 4.0) were added under sterile conditions. The cultures were then incubated at 28 °C and 180 rpm for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,600 × g, 10 min) at room temperature, washed twice with ultrapure water, and resuspended in deionized water to disperse cell clusters.

For Raman measurement, 2 μL of cell suspension was loaded on Al foil and air-dried. Raman spectra were acquired using a LabRAM HR Evolution microscope (HORIBA Scientific, France) with a 532 nm Nd:YAG laser (laser Quantum), a 100× objective lens (Olympus, NA = 0.9), and a spectral range of 400–3200 cm −1. A total of 30 individual bacteria were randomly selected from each treatment for Raman measurement. Baseline correction, normalization, and subsequent Fourier transformation were consistently performed on all measurements using LabSpec6 software (Horiba Jobin-Yvon). The C–D ratio was calculated to assess D assimilation, using the integral intensity of the C–H peak (2800–3100 cm −1) and C–D peak (2040–2300 cm −1), with lower C–D ratio indicating higher metabolic activity under Al stress. In co-culture, the resonance Raman peak of cytochrome C (heme group, 749.95 cm −1) was selected as the basis for distinguishing between P. aeruginosa and R. erythropolis.

### Modality of bacterial growth presents unique targets: how do we treat biofilm-mediated infections? [^115s38JJ]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

It is well accepted that bacterial pathogens growing in a biofilm are recalcitrant to the action of most antibiotics and are resistant to the innate immune system. New treatment modalities are greatly warranted to effectively eradicate these infections. However, bacteria growing in a biofilm are metabolically unique in comparison to the bacteria growing in a planktonic state. Unfortunately, most antibiotics have been developed to inhibit the growth of bacteria in a planktonic mode of growth. This review focuses on the metabolism and physiology of biofilm growth with special emphasis on staphylococci. Future treatment options should include targeting unique metabolic niches found within bacterial biofilms in addition to the enzymes or compounds that inhibit biofilm accumulation molecules and/or interact with quorum sensing and intercellular bacterial communication.

### Metalloregulation of Gram-positive pathogen physiology [^114z4F6p]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Owing to the unique redox potential of transition metals, many of these elements serve important roles as cofactors in numerous enzymes. However, the reactive nature of metal becomes an intracellular threat when these ions are present in excess. Therefore, all organisms require mechanisms for sensing small fluctuations in metal levels to maintain a controlled balance of uptake, efflux, and sequestration. The ability to sense metal ion concentration is especially important for the survival of pathogenic bacteria because host organisms can both restrict access to essential metals from invading pathogens and utilize the innate toxicity of certain metals for bacterial killing. Host-induced metal ion fluctuations must be rapidly sensed by pathogenic bacteria so that they can activate metal transport systems, alter their physiology to accommodate differences in metal concentrations, and regulate the expression of virulence factors.

### A protein-free vaccine stimulates innate immunity and protects against nosocomial pathogens [^11634mBs]. Science Translational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditional vaccines are difficult to deploy against the diverse antimicrobial-resistant, nosocomial pathogens that cause health care-associated infections. We developed a protein-free vaccine composed of aluminum hydroxide, monophosphoryl lipid A, and fungal mannan that improved survival and reduced bacterial burden of mice with invasive blood or lung infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-expressing Escherichia coli, and carbapenem-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The vaccine also conferred protection against the fungi Rhizopus delemar and Candida albicans. Efficacy was apparent by 24 hours and lasted for up to 28 days after a single vaccine dose, with a second dose restoring efficacy. The vaccine acted through stimulation of the innate, rather than the adaptive, immune system, as demonstrated by efficacy in the absence of lymphocytes that were abrogated by macrophage depletion. A role for macrophages was further supported by the finding that vaccination induced macrophage epigenetic alterations that modulated phagocytosis and the inflammatory response to infection. Together, these data show that this protein-free vaccine is a promising strategy to prevent deadly antimicrobial-resistant health care-associated infections.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^114f2dpd]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vaccination is one of the major contributors to the global control of infectious diseases in the human population. It has been estimated that vaccination has prevented more than 100 million cases of infectious diseases in people since the 1920s in the United States alone. In recent years, advances in biotechnology, molecular biology, and immunology have led to an increasingly rapid identification of new vaccine antigens and the generation of more effective and safer vaccines. Since most highly purified recombinant antigens are poorly immunogenic, adjuvants are often required to increase the level and duration of protection induced by vaccines. The immune enhancement effect of precipitation of diphtheria toxoid with insoluble aluminum salts was first reported by Glenny et al. in 1926. Since that time, aluminum-containing adjuvants have been incorporated into billions of doses of vaccines and administered annually to millions of people. This success can be attributed to the fact that aluminum adjuvants are effective with many of the various vaccine antigens in currently licensed vaccines; have an excellent safety profile; are associated with minimal reactogenicity; and are inexpensive. Moreover, they have a practical advantage by offering the possibility of creating single liquid vials or prefilled syringe formats, which are generally preferred in the market place.

### Evidence of horizontal gene transfer and environmental selection impacting antibiotic resistance evolution in soil-dwelling Listeria [^116akVgf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Understanding the associations between environmental factors and ARGs is crucial for unraveling the dynamics and evolution of antibiotic resistance under environmental disturbance. In this study, multiple layers of analysis from different perspectives all suggest that environmental selection, likely triggered by soil properties and surrounding land use, plays a role in the evolution of ARGs in Listeria. Soil properties (e.g. pH and nutrients) have been widely reported to influence ARGs in soils –. In this study, aluminum and magnesium were found to be the most influential soil properties for ARG richness in Listeria, supported by both correlation and machine learning-based analyses. A previous study suggests that nanoalumina can enhance the uptake of ARGs by facilitating the transfer of plasmid-mediated ARGs. Additionally, the persistence of aluminum in soils may exert prolonged selective pressure on bacteria to maintain ARGs through co-selection mechanisms. These mechanisms can all lead to a positive correlation between ARG richness and aluminum observed in Listeria in this study. In contrast, the correlation between magnesium and ARG richness in Listeria was negative. This may be due to the competitive dynamics in magnesium-limited environments, where fungal-bacterial competition for magnesium can increase the fitness and survival of bacteria possessing ARGs, as these genes provide a competitive advantage under stress conditions. Furthermore, magnesium-modified biochar has been found to reduce the spread and abundance of ARGs by influencing the bacterial community structure and inhibiting HGT. Given the complexity of natural environments and the observed associations are correlational not causal, further experimental investigations are needed to better understand the influence of soil properties on ARG richness.

### Reviewing the complexities of bacterial biocide susceptibility and in vitro biocide adaptation methodologies [^114t9cKg]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the medical importance of antibiotics, it is understandable that AMR research is primarily focused on antibiotic phenotypes and mechanisms, as they are clinically relevant for optimal treatment outcomes. However, biocides are an important and vital tool in agricultural safety and clinical disinfection regimes, as successful antibiotic treatments are highly dependent upon biocide antiseptic and disinfectant practices and efficacy. In contrast to antibiotics, biocides are often overlooked in AMR considerations until they fail. A growing number of studies show that bacterial biocide exposures and bacterial resistance to low and sub-lethal biocide concentrations can impact antibiotic resistance phenotypes – as well as heavy metal resistance. Therefore, as part of an AMR One Health Approach, which recognizes that human antimicrobial usage extends far beyond the clinical setting to agricultural, industrial, environmental, and even household contamination, it is imperative to better understand how biocide resistance, tolerance, and susceptibility emerges in clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and how they intersect with cross-resistance phenotypes for antibiotics and other inhibitory compounds.

### Protection and consolidation of stone heritage by self-inoculation with indigenous carbonatogenic bacterial communities [^116kd8sx]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We carefully selected the treatment areas such that they all have the same stone type, the same exposure, the same level of degradation, and suffer from the same damage mechanism (salt weathering). All these prerequisites were fulfilled by the three selected calcarenite stone blocks. Indeed, our analyses corroborated that all three blocks had the same composition, porosity, drilling resistance and weight loss following the peeling tape tests (within error). They also have comparable salt composition and content, and microbiota (Results section).

Previously studied bacterial conservation bio-treatments

Two stone blocks showing similar extensive deterioration were subjected to well-established bacterial bio-consolidation treatments, using: (1) a 48 h-old M. xanthus culture as inoculant; or (2) a sterile M-3P nutritive solution (1% Bacto Casitone, 1% Ca(CH 3 COO) 2.4H 2 O, 0.2% K 2 CO 3.1/2 H 2 O in a 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8)without the addition of any microorganism. Controls consisted of areas of the weathered stone blocks left untreated.

In the M. xanthus treatment, the stone was treated on the first day with the culture of M. xanthus and then for the remaining 5 days of treatment, only the sterile M-3P nutritive solution was applied. In the sterile M-3P treatment, only the nutritive solution was applied to the stone during the 6 days of the treatment. In both cases, the solution was sprayed onto the stone twice each day to avoid desiccation of the stone. To maintain the stone adequately damp and protected from the direct effect of sunlight, the treated areas were covered with an aluminum/plastic foil (not in direct contact with the stone surface) during the treatment and up to 3 days after treatment completion until the solutions evaporated completely. The treatment application is described in further detail in Jroundi et al.

### Crucial role for the nalp3 inflammasome in the immunostimulatory properties of aluminium adjuvants [^114Wrht2]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Aluminium adjuvants, typically referred to as 'alum', are the most commonly used adjuvants in human and animal vaccines worldwide, yet the mechanism underlying the stimulation of the immune system by alum remains unknown. Toll-like receptors are critical in sensing infections and are therefore common targets of various adjuvants used in immunological studies. Although alum is known to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that alum does not require intact Toll-like receptor signalling to activate the immune system. Here we show that aluminium adjuvants activate an intracellular innate immune response system called the Nalp3 (also known as cryopyrin, CIAS1 or NLRP3) inflammasome. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and interleukin-18 by macrophages in response to alum in vitro required intact inflammasome signalling. Furthermore, in vivo, mice deficient in Nalp3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) or caspase-1 failed to mount a significant antibody response to an antigen administered with aluminium adjuvants, whereas the response to complete Freund's adjuvant remained intact. We identify the Nalp3 inflammasome as a crucial element in the adjuvant effect of aluminium adjuvants; in addition, we show that the innate inflammasome pathway can direct a humoral adaptive immune response. This is likely to affect how we design effective, but safe, adjuvants in the future.

Resistance studies

For single step resistance, the mutation prevention concentration (MPC) assay was preformed based on a modified method. In brief, S. aureus Newman at 10 10 CFU was plated onto BHI agar plate containing ampicillin and Ag + /AgNP with various concentrations. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, the resistant mutant colonies were counted, and the relative mutation frequency was calculated as the proportion of resistant colonies per inoculum. For plates with observable colonies (> 4), the colonies were re-cultured for MIC measurement. The MIC values higher than the original value was determined as higher-level resistant mutant colony. The concentrations that inhibited the growth of mutant colonies was defined as MPC. The multiple prevention index (MPI) was obtained via the equation of MPI = MPC/MIC.

For resistance development by sequential passaging, the assay was performed with modification from the previous method. Generally, S. aureus Newman cells at exponential phase were diluted to ~10 7 CFU/mL in BHI broth. The diluted cell suspension was added to 96-well plate supplemented with drugs at escalating concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h prior testing the growth. For further passaging, cultures from the second highest concentrations allowing bacterial growth were performed 1:1000 dilution into fresh medium supplemented with the same concentrations of drugs. For ampicillin, 1-fold of MIC was set as 4 μg/mL. For the combination of ampicillin and Ag +, 1-fold MIC was set as 0.25 μg/mL ampicillin + 8 μg/mL Ag +. This in vitro passage was repeated for 16 times. The MIC was determined by broth microdilution every two passages. Experiments were performed with biological replicates.

Statistical analysis

Three biological replicates and two technique replicates were performed for all experiments without specified. All comparisons between two groups were performed on two-tailed t -test. Results are presented as mean ± SEM. Identification results of Ag + -binding proteins are included in the Supplementary information.

### Immunotherapy targeting adenosine synthase A decreases severity of Staphylococcus aureus infection in mouse model [^116pMPas]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Staphylococcusaureus is a severe pathogen found in the community and in hospitals. Most notably, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is resistant to almost all antibiotics, which is a growing public health concern. The emergence of drug-resistant strains has prompted the search for alternative treatments such as immunotherapeutic approaches. Previous research showed that S. aureus exploit the immunomodulatory attributes of adenosine to escape host immunity. In this study, we investigated adenosine synthase A (AdsA), an S. aureus cell wall-anchored enzyme as possible targets for immunotherapy. Mice vaccinated with aluminum hydroxide-formulated recombinant AdsA (rAdsA) induced high-titer anti-AdsA antibodies, thereby providing consistent protection in 3 mouse infection models when challenged with 2 S. aureus strains. The importance of anti-AdsA antibody in protection was demonstrated by passive transfer experiments. Moreover, AdsA-specific antisera promote killing S. aureus by immune cells. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the AdsA is a promising target for vaccines and therapeutics development to alleviate severe S. aureus diseases.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^11565LHv]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Future directions of aluminum adjuvants

Besides active investigation of aluminum-based combination adjuvants and mechanisms of action, several research groups have reported attempts to develop well-defined aluminum nanoparticle adjuvants, with reduced particle size compared to the available commercial products. – If such efforts are successful, aluminum nanoparticles with tunable particle size and even particle shape could potentially offer approaches to optimize biological activity (e.g. lymph node trafficking) and manufacturing/stability aspects (e.g. ability for terminal sterile filtration), beyond what is achievable with the traditional aluminum salts. Nevertheless, in most cases the novel adjuvant nanoparticles are not benchmarked to commercial aluminum salts, making it difficult to evaluate benefit and supporting our motivation in writing this review. Other interesting developments which could facilitate delivery of aluminum salt vaccines to resource poor areas include lyophilized thermostable formulations and excipient approaches that enable stability to freezing temperature excursions. Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for the development of new and improved characterization tools, to attain a better understanding of the binding, release, and stability of aluminum-adsorbed antigens.

### Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization [^112rtPHU]. Nature Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Inhalation of silica crystals causes inflammation in the alveolar space. Prolonged exposure to silica can lead to the development of silicosis, an irreversible, fibrotic pulmonary disease. The mechanisms by which silica and other crystals activate immune cells are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that silica and aluminum salt crystals activated inflammasomes formed by the cytoplasmic receptor NALP3. NALP3 activation required phagocytosis of crystals, and this uptake subsequently led to lysosomal damage and rupture. 'Sterile' lysosomal damage (without crystals) also induced NALP3 activation, and inhibition of either phagosomal acidification or cathepsin B activity impaired NALP3 activation. Our results indicate that the NALP3 inflammasome senses lysosomal damage as an endogenous 'danger' signal.

### Mohs surgical postoperative wound infection caused by rare enterobacteriaceae [^111Lg3sc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Fourteen days postsurgery, on February 24, 2023, the patient returned for suture removal. Examination revealed a dry, well-approximated wound with no erythema or drainage. However, 3 days later, on February 27, 2023, she reported abnormal wound healing. Physical examination revealed a superficial wound with mild erythema, granulation tissue, fibrinous slough, and an overlying crust. A scant amount of odorless, clear transudate was present, which was cultured, yielding heavy growth of Raoultella planticola (Fig 2) (Table I).

Bacterial culture and sensitivities

Antibiotic susceptibility testing identified multiple effective treatments. The patient was prescribed oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg twice daily), topical gentamicin ointment (0.1% twice daily), along with aluminum acetate solution (Domeboro) daily soaks. By her follow-up on March 27, 2023, the oral antibiotic course was completed, but the wound displayed persistent granulation tissue and transudate. Wound debridement was performed, and daily cadexomer iodine gel (Iodosorb) application was initiated. The patient returned on April 03, 2023 with concerns of nonhealing wound, and a repeat culture identified only Proteus mirabilis sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate. A new course of amoxicillin-clavulanate (500/125 mg twice daily for 10 days), aluminum acetate solution soaks, and daily Iodosorb gel application were prescribed. On April 24, 2023, 10 weeks after the initial Mohs procedure, the wound was fully healed with no signs of infection (Fig 3).

### Protective anti-Helicobacter immunity is induced with aluminum hydroxide or complete freund's adjuvant by systemic immunization [^112cX813]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To determine whether systemic immunization against Helicobacter pylori could be achieved with an adjuvant approved for human use, the efficacy of vaccination with Helicobacter antigen in combination with aluminum hydroxide (AlOH) was evaluated in a murine model of Helicobacter infection. Immunization with antigen and AlOH induced interleukin-5-secreting, antigen-specific T cells, and immunization with antigen and complete Freund's adjuvant induced interferon-gamma-secreting, antigen-specific T cells, as determined by ELISPOT assay. Both immune responses conferred protection after challenge with either H. pylori or H. felis, as confirmed by the complete absence of any bacteria, as assessed by both histology and culture of gastric biopsy samples. Protection was antibody independent, as demonstrated with antibody-deficient muMT mice (immunoglobulin-gene knockout mice), and CD4(+) spleen T cells from immunized mice were sufficient to transfer protective immunity to otherwise immunodeficient rag1(-/-) recipients. These results suggest an alternative and potentially more expeditious strategy for development of a human-use H. pylori vaccine.

### The promise of copper ionophores as antimicrobials [^116eNDLM]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic-resistant microbe-mediated deaths are a major worldwide health issue. Unfortunately, due to microbial adaptation to develop resistance, some antibiotics are nullified early in their usage, and worse, resistance is detected before they can even be prescribed. Copper's toxicity since antiquity against microbes at the host-pathogen interface offers a fascinating weapon to fight antimicrobial resistance. Here, we briefly review why copper is so effective, how drugs that work with copper are effective antimicrobials, and how compounds such as these could reinvigorate investment in antimicrobial development.

### Predicting drug inactivation by changes in bacterial growth dynamics [^115B6S2z]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic drugs target key cellular processes to arrest bacterial growth and, in some cases, kill the cells. Surveys of drug toxicity in different bacterial species have established that numerous non-antibiotic drugs, medications not administered to treat infectious diseases, can inhibit bacterial growth –. At subinhibitory drug concentrations, bacterial growth inhibition is incomplete, and compounds can influence different aspects of cell morphology and population growth dynamics. Such influences can be quantified by imaging single cells with a microscope, and by monitoring changes in optical density in batch cultures growing in liquid media. Interestingly, while changes in cellular morphology have been consistently associated with the mechanism of action underlying drug toxicity, far less is known about the factors that determine how growth phenotypes of bacterial cultures are reshaped by different drugs. Resolving what can be learned about bacteria–drug interactions from bulk-culture phenotypes is valuable, given the ubiquity and high throughput of standard microplate-reader assays.

### Predicting drug inactivation by changes in bacterial growth dynamics [^116vjvVT]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Studying how antibacterials operate at subinhibitory concentrations reveals how they impede normal growth. While previous works demonstrated drugs can impact multiple aspects of growth, such as prolonging the doubling time or reducing the maximal bacterial load, a systematic understanding of this phenomenon is lacking. It remains unknown if common principles dictate how drugs interfere with growth. We monitored growth curves across thirty-eight drugs, spanning multiple mechanisms of action in Escherichia coli to deconvolve their impact on the lag, growth rate, and carrying capacity and developed a mathematical framework to quantitatively compare their effects. We discovered that drugs induced considerably different inhibition phenotypes, which were independent from the drug's target. Functional assays of drug inactivation revealed that drug inactivation is a key shared factor underlying a lag-associated phenotype. Our work reveals that likely drug inactivation can be directly inferred from growth dynamics which is instrumental for rapidly identifying drug-inactivating bacteria.

### Cerium nitrate stiffensSkin models and reducesPathogenicity and penetration through skin models [^111mDB3S]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

CeN has broad spectrum antibacterial activity. Burkes and McCleskey performed a systematic investigation of the bacteriostatic properties of salts of cerium, lanthanum, and thallium against a panel of 39 bacterial species across 16 genera, including gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative P. aeruginosa. Using radial streak inoculations (eight cultures to each plate) on petri plates of solidified agar containing the specified amount of the salts and basal media, they found that CeN was an effective bacteriostatic agent against the whole spectrum of bacteria. Pseudomonas species were the most susceptible genera, with inhibition of growth at concentrations 0.1–0.4 mM of CeN followed by Escherichia and Salmonella species at 0.5 mM. However, almost twice that concentration is effective on S. aureus.

Marone et al evaluated the antimicrobial activity of SSD, alone and in combination with CeN, gentamicin, and amikacin against 130 clinical isolates, including multidrug resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The results showed that the combination of SSD and CeN was as effective as SSD alone.

In these early studies CeN has demonstrated broad but greater antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria at concentrations of 10–40 mM, which led to the use of CeN combined with SSD to complement SSD's gram-positive antimicrobial activity. However, subsequent testing of the complementarity of these agents in vitro produced conflicting results, possibly due to cerium precipitating as cerium phosphate or cerium binding to proteins, as well as SSD having poor solubility giving erroneous results in agar disc diffusion tests or broth assays. Nonetheless, topical application of CeN-SSD on patient's burns has been associated with decreased bacterial contamination and P. aeruginosa infection.

Alongside CeN's inherent antimicrobial activity, in treating human burn wounds CeN in CeN-SSD produces an eschar that adheres well for longer periods to the underlying tissue and may resist bacterial colonization and invasion. Thus, CeN's effects both on the eschar and bacteria may mitigate bacterial colonization and infection of burn wounds. However, little experimental evidence for these mechanisms is available. In this study, we independently treated P. aeruginosa and tissue models (three-dimensional [3D]-collagen matrix and ex-vivo –burned porcine skin).

### Aluminum effects in infants and children [^112JSkEa]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aluminum has no known biological function; however, it is a contaminant present in most foods and medications. Aluminum is excreted by the renal system, and patients with renal diseases should avoid aluminum-containing medications. Studies demonstrating long-term toxicity from the aluminum content in parenteral nutrition components led the US Food and Drug Administration to implement rules for these solutions. Large-volume ingredients were required to reduce the aluminum concentration, and small-volume components were required to be labeled with the aluminum concentration. Despite these rules, the total aluminum concentration from some components continues to be above the recommended final concentration. The concerns about toxicity from the aluminum present in infant formulas and antiperspirants have not been substantiated but require more research. Aluminum is one of the most effective adjuvants used in vaccines, and a large number of studies have documented minimal adverse effects from this use. Long-term, high-concentration exposure to aluminum has been linked in meta-analyses with the development of Alzheimer disease.

### Quinolone-mediated metabolic cross-feeding develops aluminium tolerance in soil microbial consortia [^115GWSpp]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Experimental site description and field experiments

The field experiment was established at the Yingtan National Agricultural Ecosystem Observation and Research Station in Jiangxi Province (28°12′N, 116°55′E), China. The experimental area has a typical subtropical climate with an average annual precipitation of 1881.8 mm and an average annual temperature of 18.4 °C. The field soil used in the experiment was Quaternary red clay with a soil content of 36%, which is strongly weathered and has high Al and iron oxide contents. It is classified as a typical Plinthosol by the US soil classification system, and its relevant physical and chemical properties are shown in Supplementary Data 2. In accordance with local traditional farming methods, the experimental field was managed using a single rice crop system per year, employing furrow irrigation and consistent weed management throughout the growing season.

Rice seeds from japonica Nanjing 46 were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 s and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite three times for 15 min and germinated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar media for 15 days (25 °C). Rice plants in similar growth stages were subsequently transplanted into field plots, with 40 plants per plot. The size of each plot was 1.5 m × 6.0 m, with furrows serving as boundaries. The field experiment included four treatments: non-inoculation (CK), mono-inoculation with R. erythropolis (Rh), mono-inoculation with P. aeruginosa (Ps), and inoculation with co-cultured R. erythropolis and P. aeruginosa (RP), with each treatment having one plot (Supplementary Fig. 1). During the heading and maturity stages of rice, photos were taken using a digital camera (RICH GRIII, R02010, Vietnam), and the leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD-502-plus, Konica Minolta, Japan) and rice plant height were measured. A total of 40 rice plants were harvested at 110 days after transplanting. Shoot biomass and panicle weight per plant were measured.

### Structural characterization of a protein adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in vaccine formulation [^114M4EAR]. NPJ Vaccines (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vaccination is one of the major contributors to the control of infections in human population globally. Insoluble aluminum salts have been used to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens against bacterial and viral infections since 1926, when Glenny et al. reported their use to improve the response of diphteria toxoid. Recently other adjuvants based on oil-in-water emulsions (i.e. MF59, AS03) and liposomes have been used for licensed vaccines and other candidates at different stages of research and development. However, the aluminum salts are the most commonly used adjuvants for commercial vaccines and, also due to their long-term success, they still remain the "gold standard" against a new adjuvant.

For licensed vaccines, aluminum(III) hydroxide (AlumOH) and aluminum(III) phosphate (AlumP) are the most commonly used adjuvants. AlumOH is a chemically crystalline aluminum(III) oxyhydroxide (AlOOH), prepared by exposing soluble aluminum(III) salts (generally Al(H 2 O) 6 Cl 3 or AlK(SO 4) 2) to alkaline conditions to obtain a suspension which is finally dehydrated under hydrothermal conditions. AlumP is a noncrystalline compound generated by incorporation of phosphate which interferes with the crystallization process. AlumP can be prepared by mixing the aluminum salt Al(H 2 O) 6 Cl 3 or AlK(SO 4) 2 with a basic solution of trisodium phosphate, or directly mixing aluminum salt with phosphate solution, followed by precipitation with sodium hydroxide. The substitution of hydroxyl groups of AlumOH with phosphate groups results in the formation of aluminum hydroxyphosphate, Al(OH) x (PO 4) y, a nonstoichiometric compound in which the ratio of hydroxyls to phosphate depends on the precipitation conditions.

### Transition metal homoeostasis is key to metabolism and drug tolerance of… [^115ok3zU]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on the REMA results, six ion-antibiotic combinations that showed significant differences in MIC compared with untreated cultures were selected for a kinetic time-killing study: Ni 2+ with clarithromycin (CLR), amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LVF), as well as Co 2+ with clarithromycin and amikacin (Fig. 5b). The kinetic experiments were carried out to further understand the effect of transition metal treatments on the drug tolerance profile of M. abscessus.

When treated with CLR at 1 × MIC 50 concentration, the bacterial population was relatively stable over time, with a three-fold increase in CFU at the end of the assay (Fig. 5b). When CLR was supplemented with Ni 2+, the bacterial population steadily decreased over time and the CFU of this culture was reduced by 3 log 10 units in comparison to the CLR-only cultures after 7 days (p = 0.0001). This demonstrated a stronger bactericidal effect of the Ni 2+ -CLR combination compared with the CLR-only group. The opposite was observed for the combination of Ni 2+ with AMK. When used alone, AMK maintained stable bacterial CFU during the first 72 hours and its effect stopped afterwards, leading to a bacterial growth of about 2 log 10 units at t = 168 h. The combined treatment with Ni 2+ and AMK yielded a growth curve that was initially intermediate between those of the Ni 2+ - and AMK-only groups, with the combined treatment showing bacterial CFU that were more than 2 log 10 higher compared to the AMK-only group (p = 0.0001 at t = 72 h and p = 0.0044 at t = 168 h). At the end of the assay, the CFU for the combined treatment group was similar to that of the Ni 2+ -only group. The killing kinetics revealed somewhat similar trends for CIP and LVF. In particular, Ni 2+ supplementation resulted in significantly higher bacterial growth after 72 hours of incubation than observed for the antibiotic-only groups (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0073 for Ni 2+ + CIP and Ni 2+ + LVF groups, respectively). After 168 h, however, only the Ni 2+ + LVF group still had more bacterial growth than the antibiotic-only treatment.

Enrichment process

Transfer cultures were established in 160-mL glass serum bottles containing 100 mL of anoxic, completely synthetic, defined basal salt medium prepared with modifications. The mineral medium consisted of (g L −1): NaCl (1.0); MgCl 2
- 6H 2 O (0.5); KH 2 PO 4 (7.0); NH 4 Cl (0.3); KCl (0.3); CaCl 2
- 2H 2 O (0.015);-cysteine (0.031) or dithiothreitol (0.15). The medium also contained 1 mL of a trace element solution, 1 mL Se/Wo solution, and 0.25 mL resazurin solution (0.1% w/w). The trace element solution contained (mg L −1): FeCl 2
- 4H 2 O (1,500); CoCl 2
- 6H 2 O (190); MnCl 2
- 4H 2 O (100); ZnCl 2 (70); H 3 BO 3 (6); Na 2 MoO 4
- 2H 2 O (36); CuCl 2

- 5H 2 O (6); NaWO 4
- 2H 2 O (8), and NaOH (500). The serum bottles with N 2 headspace were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ, USA) held in place with aluminum crimp caps. Following autoclaving, the measured medium pH ranged between 4.27 to 4.35. All subsequent amendments to the cultivation vessels used sterile plastic syringes and needles to augment the medium with aqueous, filter-sterilized (0.2 µm polyethersulfone membrane filters, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) stock solutions and undiluted gases. Ten mL of N 2 O gas (416 µmol, 4.16 mM nominal; 99.5%) was added 24 hours prior to inoculation. The bottles were inoculated (1%, v/v) from an El Verde microcosm (established in 160 mL glass serum bottles containing 100 mL of basal salt medium and ∼2 g [wet weight] of soil) showing N 2 O reduction activity. The microcosm was manually shaken before 1 mL aliquots were transferred with a 3-mL plastic syringe and a 2-gauge needle. Initial attempts to obtain solid-free enrichment cultures with 5 mM lactate as carbon source and electron donor showed no N 2 O reduction activity. The following substrates were subsequently tested in the transfer cultures: 5 mM propionate, 20 mM pyruvate, 20 mM pyruvate plus 10 mL (416 µmol, 4.16 mM nominal) hydrogen (H 2), 1 mM formate plus 1 mM acetate and 5 mL (208 µmol, 2.08 mM nominal) CO 2, and 0.1 or 10 g L −1 yeast extract. Subsequent transfers (3%, v/v) used medium supplemented with 0.5 or 2.5 mM pyruvate and 10 mL H 2, and occurred when the initial dose of 10 mL N 2 O had been consumed. All culture vessels were incubated in upright position at 30 °C in the dark without agitation.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^111oAeFL]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

We are proposing two key practical considerations for adjuvant research and development. One, that aluminum adjuvants continue to be a necessary benchmark in all studies, and two, that they need to be used appropriately, with some formulation optimization, to enable it to be a legitimate comparison. Our expectation is that the potency of aluminum adjuvants will continue to be exceeded by alternative approaches in preclinical and clinical studies, but there needs to be a vaccine-specific evaluation of how much enhancement is enough, in addition to how much reactogenicity is acceptable. In many programs, the development timelines, the manufacturing and component sourcing challenges, the accumulated data necessary on new approaches, and the regulatory challenges involved, will all be considerably reduced if an aluminum-based adjuvant is selected for product development. Particularly if it can be determined that an aluminum adjuvant can provide enough to accomplish what is needed. This will be particularly true as new generation antigens are developed, with key structural elements to render them inherently more potent as immunogens. Moreover, enthusiastic scientists promoting more novel approaches should not lose sight of the inherent value in using the preferred presentation modes for vaccine products in the market place, single vial liquids or prefilled syringes, which can be readily accomplished with traditional aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines.

### Multimetal resistance and tolerance in microbial biofilms [^117TQsMy]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2007). Medium credibility.

Geochemical cycling and industrial pollution have made toxic metal ions a pervasive environmental pressure throughout the world. Biofilm formation is a strategy that microorganisms might use to survive a toxic flux in these inorganic compounds. Evidence in the literature suggests that biofilm populations are protected from toxic metals by the combined action of chemical, physical and physiological phenomena that are, in some instances, linked to phenotypic variation among the constituent biofilm cells. Here, we propose a multifactorial model by which biofilm populations can withstand metal toxicity by a process of cellular diversification.

### Aluminum toxicity in neonatal parenteral nutrition: what can we do? [^116SzD4V]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Aluminum toxicity has been described in patients of all ages who are receiving a variety of therapies, including dialysis, phosphate-binding medications, and parenteral nutrition (PN). Neonates are at an increased risk of aluminum toxicity because of anatomic, physiologic, and nutrition-related factors not present in other populations. In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration recommended restricting daily aluminum administration to 5 μg/kg/day and now requires that additives used to compound PN have the maximum aluminum content at expiration listed on the product label. Although the pharmacist can work to decrease aluminum toxicity in this population, it remains difficult to reach this threshold.

### Lanthanum carbonate [^116mKs6t]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Drugs Binding to Antacids

There is a potential for lanthanum carbonate to interact with compounds which bind to cationic antacids (i.e., aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium-based); therefore, do not administer such compounds within 2 hours of dosing with lanthanum carbonate. Examples of relevant classes of compounds where antacids have been demonstrated to reduce bioavailability include antibiotics (such as quinolones, ampicillin, and tetracyclines), thyroid hormones, ACE inhibitors, statin lipid regulators, and anti-malarials.

7.2 Quinolone Antibiotics

Co-administration of lanthanum carbonate with quinolone antibiotics may reduce the extent of their absorption. The bioavailability of oral ciprofloxacin was decreased by approximately 50% when taken with lanthanum carbonate in a single-dose study in healthy volunteers.

Administer oral quinolone antibiotics at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after lanthanum carbonate. When oral quinolones are given for short courses, consider eliminating the doses of lanthanum carbonate that would normally be scheduled near the time of quinolone intake to improve quinolone absorption [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Levothyroxine

The bioavailability of levothyroxine was decreased by approximately 40% when taken together with lanthanum carbonate. Administer thyroid hormone replacement therapy at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after dosing with lanthanum carbonate and monitor thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.4 Use with Other Oral Medications

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between lanthanum carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of concomitant medications that have a narrow therapeutic range.

### Myeloid-related protein-8 / 14 facilitates bacterial growth during pneumococcal pneumonia [^114JkdHX]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most commonly identified pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8/14 is a major component of neutrophils that is released upon infection or injury. MRP8/14 is essential for protective immunity during infection by a variety of micro-organisms through its capacity to chelate manganese and zinc. Here, we aimed to determine the role of MRP8/14 in pneumococcal pneumonia.

Methods

MRP8/14 was determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum of CAP patients, in lung tissue of patients who had succumbed to pneumococcal pneumonia, and in BALF of healthy subjects challenged with lipoteichoic acid (a component of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall) via the airways. Pneumonia was induced in MRP14 deficient and normal wildtype mice. The effect of MRP8/14 on S. pneumoniae growth was studied in vitro.

Results

CAP patients displayed high MRP8/14 levels in BALF, lung tissue and serum. Healthy subjects challenged with lipoteichoic acid demonstrated elevated MRP8/14 in BALF. Likewise, mice with pneumococcal pneumonia had high MRP8/14 levels in lungs and the circulation. MRP14 deficiency, however, was associated with reduced bacterial growth and lethality, in the absence of notable effects on the inflammatory response. High zinc levels strongly inhibited growth of S. pneumoniae in vitro, which was partially reversed by MRP8/14.

Conclusions

In sharp contrast to its previously reported host-protective role in several infections, the present results reveal that in a model of CAP, MRP8/14 is misused by S. pneumoniae, facilitating bacterial growth by attenuating zinc toxicity toward the pathogen.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^114EP7F3]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

During the early stages of the development of a potential new vaccine, the need for adjuvants should be critically assessed. If it is concluded that an adjuvant is required to obtain a protective immune response, then the vaccine antigens should be evaluated in combination with aluminum adjuvants, before more potent adjuvants are assessed. If the widely available aluminum adjuvants are deemed sufficient, then there is no need to evaluate more potent adjuvants, although clinical trials may be necessary to determine this more accurately. Moreover, the evaluation of aluminum adjuvants requires a serious effort to develop a "stage appropriate", stable and effective vaccine formulation. The creation of appropriate formulations with aluminum adjuvants requires detailed knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of the vaccine antigen(s), the interaction of antigens with the adjuvant, and knowledge of the effect of excipients such as salts, buffers, and tonicity modifiers (Fig. 1). Lack of attention to these features will likely result in an inadequate formulation and a suboptimal immune response to the vaccine. In addition, the aluminum-adjuvanted comparator, once established, should be carried forward in subsequent studies, so that the enhanced performance of the new adjuvant can be benchmarked consistently across a number of studies with diverse readouts. This will allow a clear definition of how and where the new adjuvant offers improvements over the more established approach, which can be used to support the clinical development plans.

Fig. 1
Formulation of an effective vaccine with aluminum adjuvants requires knowledge of the chemical and physical properties of the adjuvant and rigorous characterization of the antigen and antigen−adjuvant formulation. Excipients can affect the antigen−adjuvant interactions

In spite of the widespread and longstanding use of aluminum adjuvants, a more thorough understanding of their physical chemistry, and the necessary formulation steps to allow their optimal use has only begun to emerge more recently. Here, we review current knowledge and provide practical insights into the formulation of vaccines with aluminum adjuvants, we highlight recently developed techniques to assess the integrity and stability of adsorbed antigens, and identify gaps in our knowledge that currently limit the rational design of aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines. However, rather than a comprehensive review of how to create optimal vaccine candidates using aluminum adjuvants, we intend this review as an overview, although we will highlight where to go to find the necessary information to take the next steps, some of which has been reviewed previously. –

### Evidence of horizontal gene transfer and environmental selection impacting antibiotic resistance evolution in soil-dwelling Listeria [^114zWt6T]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Soil is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and understanding how corresponding environmental changes influence their emergence, evolution, and spread is crucial. The soil-dwelling bacterial genus Listeria, including L. monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, serves as a key model for establishing this understanding. Here, we characterize ARGs in 594 genomes representing 19 Listeria species that we previously isolated from soils in natural environments across the United States. Among the five putatively functional ARGs identified, lin, which confers resistance to lincomycin, is the most prevalent, followed by mprF, sul, fosX, and norB. ARGs are predominantly found in Listeria sensu stricto species, with those more closely related to L. monocytogenes tending to harbor more ARGs. Notably, phylogenetic and recombination analyses provide evidence of recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in all five ARGs within and/or across species, likely mediated by transformation rather than conjugation and transduction. In addition, the richness and genetic divergence of ARGs are associated with environmental conditions, particularly soil properties (e.g., aluminum and magnesium) and surrounding land use patterns (e.g., forest coverage). Collectively, our data suggest that recent HGT and environmental selection play a vital role in the acquisition and diversification of bacterial ARGs in natural environments.

### Optimizing the utilization of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines: you might just get what you want [^114yP13g]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

Mechanism of action of aluminum adjuvants

Although aluminum adjuvants have been used for over 70 years in human vaccines, the mechanism by which they enhance the immune response remains not fully understood. This probably reflects the fact that several mechanisms are operating simultaneously, rather than a lack of awareness of an individual mechanism. Studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms by which aluminum adjuvants enhance the immune response have recently been reviewed in detail. Here, we will provide a brief interpretive summary with updates from recent studies. A satisfactory explanation of the mechanisms that underlie the immune-enhancing effect of aluminum adjuvants should take into account that adsorption of antigen, although not always, usually enhances the immune response. Adsorption is probably important for three reasons: (1) it makes soluble antigens particulate, which enhances uptake through phagocytosis by dendritic cells;, (2) it targets antigen to antigen-presenting cells, while enhancing antigen-presentation, as indicated by increased expression of MHC II-peptide complexes and increased activation of CD4 T cells; – and (3) it retains antigen at the injection site, allowing time for recruitment of antigen-presenting cells through the release of cytokines and the induction of a local inflammatory reaction. – It has been suggested that a short-term depot is not necessary for the effect of aluminum adjuvants. This was based on the intradermal injection of protein adsorbed to aluminum adjuvant in the ear of mice (the ear of mice does not have muscle or subcutaneous tissue) followed by surgical resection of the ear at different time points. Removal of the ear as early as 2 h after injection had no effect on the immune response. However, although the study was a sincere attempt to examine the need for a depot effect, the authors could not exclude the possibility that tissue damage from the resection of the ear resulted in sufficient inflammatory signals to enhance the immune response. An early study showed that removal of the injection site after subcutaneous injection of an aluminum-adjuvanted vaccine within 4 days after injection interfered with the immune response. Thus, it seems likely that a short-term depot is generally needed for the immunostimulatory effect of aluminum adjuvants.

### Recent advances in the development of metal complexes as antibacterial agents with metal-specific modes of action [^112skuXX]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The mounting burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most concerning threats to public health worldwide. With low economic incentives and a dwindling supply of new drugs in clinical pipelines, more innovative approaches to novel drug design and development are desperately required. Metal-based compounds are rapidly emerging as an alternative to organic drugs, as they have the ability to kill pathogens via metal-specific modes of action. We herein review recent advances in metal-based antibacterial agents, including metal complexes, metal ions and catalytic metallodrugs. The review concludes with a perspective on the rational design of metal-based antibiotics, and how we can exploit their unique properties to tackle AMR.

### DNA released from dying host cells mediates aluminum adjuvant activity [^1169Yk5o]. Nature Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Aluminum-based adjuvants (aluminum salts or alum) are widely used in human vaccination, although their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Here we report that, in mice, alum causes cell death and the subsequent release of host cell DNA, which acts as a potent endogenous immunostimulatory signal mediating alum adjuvant activity. Furthermore, we propose that host DNA signaling differentially regulates IgE and IgG1 production after alum-adjuvanted immunization. We suggest that, on the one hand, host DNA induces primary B cell responses, including IgG1 production, through interferon response factor 3 (Irf3)-independent mechanisms. On the other hand, we suggest that host DNA also stimulates 'canonical' T helper type 2 (T(H)2) responses, associated with IgE isotype switching and peripheral effector responses, through Irf3-dependent mechanisms. The finding that host DNA released from dying cells acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern that mediates alum adjuvant activity may increase our understanding of the mechanisms of action of current vaccines and help in the design of new adjuvants.

### In vitro models, in vivo models, and pharmacokinetics: what can we learn from in vitro models? [^111R8CMM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

In vitro pharmacokinetic models of infection can make an important contribution to the study of the pharmacodynamic properties of an antibacterial agent. In conjunction with animal and human pharmacodynamic evaluations, they provide data to allow for the optimization of drug dosing regimens. In vitro models can be used simply to describe the effect of a drug on a bacterial population as well as to provide data for more-analytical studies, including hypothesis testing. Analytical study designs provide information on the pharmacodynamic parameter best related to the chosen outcome, as well as its magnitude. Factors such as the characteristics of the model (method of drug removal, inoculum density, and growth phase), doses simulated, species and susceptibility range of bacteria, and methods and analytical tools used to measure antibacterial effect will have an effect on the conclusions drawn. In vitro models have an important future role in ensuring antibiotic efficacy and in reducing the risks of resistance.

Receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS)

Two groups of proteins have been specifically implicated in detecting and responding to microbial molecules. These are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). Evidence has accumulated over the years that these respond to specific molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (TLR4), CpG DNA (TLR9), bacterial lipoprotein (TLR2/1 and 2/6) and flagellin (TLR5), diaminopimelate/DAP peptidoglycan (NOD1), muramyl peptides (NOD2), flagellin (NLRC4), and bacterial/viral RNA/DNA (NLRP3) (reviewed in). Many of these ligands have been shown to have adjuvant activity in that they broadly stimulate immune responses, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF) and antimicrobial peptides (reviewed in). Interestingly, there is emerging evidence that NLRP3, a potential alternative target for muramyl peptides (main text) may be a target for the adjuvant action of aluminum salts. However, Nlrp3 knockout mice were reported to respond normally to alum and the role of NLRP3 in the adjuvant activity of alum remains uncertain. Despite the focus on TLRs and NLRs, these are not the only receptors for PAMPS, exemplified by YB-1 that is targeted by muramyl dipeptides.

Wilderness blister prevention and treatment — an aluminum-based antiperspirant (20% aluminum chloride hexahydrate) applied to the soles for at least 3 consecutive days reduced blisters by 27% vs placebo in a double-blind trial, and little evidence exists to support the use of tissue adhesives for blister treatment. Little evidence exists to support a preventive role for moleskin, duoderm, adhesive tape, emollients, tincture of benzoin, or foot powders. Blister prevention is facilitated by the use of proper footwear and promoting a dry environment for the foot, including the use of a wicking sock system (Recommendation grade: 1C). Small blisters (< 5 mm in diameter) and hot spots should be protected with pressure relief, such as a donut-shaped pad (eg, moleskin), or covered with hydrogel or hydrocolloidal dressings (Recommendation grade: 1C). Blisters larger than 5 mm in diameter should be drained, but not unroofed, then covered with a hydrocolloid or hydrogel patch or equivalent (petrolatum or antibacterial ointment covered with gauze or moleskin) (Recommendation grade: 1C).

### Multi-target mode of action of silver against Staphylococcus aureus endows it with capability to combat antibiotic resistance [^114iyoJr]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Combination assay

The MICs of each drug alone or in combination were determined by a typical broth microdilution method in accordance with CLSI standards. In brief, S. aureus was cultured in BHI broth at 37 °C and 200 rpm for overnight. The bacterial density was adjusted to 1 × 10 6 CFU/mL and further confirmed by counting CFU on agar plates. Tested antibiotics (ampicillin, kanamycin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin) or Ag + /AgNP or their combinations were added into 96-well plates with 2-fold serial dilution of the drugs, followed by addition of prepared bacterial inocula and incubation at 37 °C for overnight. Growth control wells containing the medium were included in each plate. The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of the drug that could inhibit the growth of S. aureus by measuring the OD 600 via plate reader.

The FICI was calculated with the following equation: FICI = FIC A + FIC B = C A /MIC A + C B /MIC B, in which MIC A and MIC B are the individual MIC values of drug A or B, and C A and C B are the concentrations of drug A and B at the effective combinations. The FICI values were interpreted as follows: FICI ≤ 0.5, synergy; 0.5 < FICI < 1, partial synergy; 1 < FICI < 2, additive; 2 < FICI < 4, indifferent; FICI > 4, antagonism. All tests were performed in three biological replicates.

Time–kill kinetics assay

The time–kill kinetics assays were preformed based on a standard method. S. aureus cells were cultured aerobically in BHI medium at 37 °C and 200 rpm for overnight, and then diluted 100 times in fresh medium and cultured for another 2–3 h until they reach a log phase. The bacteria density was then adjusted to ~ 2 × 10 7 CFU/mL and followed by treatment of ampicillin (2 µg/mL), Ag + (8 µg/mL) or combined therapy. S. aureus cells without treatment were used as control. 0.1 mL aliquots of bacterial cultures were transferred for counting bacterial viability by agar plating at different time intervals. The results from three independent experiments were averaged and plotted as log 10 CFU/mL versus time (h).

### Predicting drug inactivation by changes in bacterial growth dynamics [^116D73Wv]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Here, we aimed to systematically study how population growth dynamics are shaped by a broad panel of drugs in a single, well-characterized model system. We monitored the growth curves of E. coli exposed to twenty-one antibiotics and seventeen non-antibiotic drugs, that span diverse mechanisms, across a range of concentrations. Using the modified Gompertz equation, we quantitatively characterized changes in key growth parameters across drugs and concentrations and developed a mathematical framework to infer drug-induced growth phenotypes at comparable toxicity levels. A comparison of phenotypes revealed that drugs elicit considerably different inhibition phenotypes, such as how they influence the growth rate, and that even drugs targeting the same cellular process can produce distinct effects on growth dynamics. By testing the impact of different antibiotic resistance cassettes on growth curves, we identified enzymatic inactivation as a key factor that can influence growth inhibition phenotypes. Follow up experiments, using a functional assay for detecting drug inactivation, revealed that drug inactivation is a key factor underlying variation in inhibition phenotypes observed across the drug panel. Taken together, our results suggest that drug inactivation, rather than the drug's cellular target, is a major causal factor influencing growth inhibition phenotypes.

### A component of innate immunity prevents bacterial biofilm development [^112RZJHQ]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Antimicrobial factors form one arm of the innate immune system, which protects mucosal surfaces from bacterial infection. These factors can rapidly kill bacteria deposited on mucosal surfaces and prevent acute invasive infections. In many chronic infections, however, bacteria live in biofilms, which are distinct, matrix-encased communities specialized for surface persistence. The transition from a free-living, independent existence to a biofilm lifestyle can be devastating, because biofilms notoriously resist killing by host defence mechanisms and antibiotics. We hypothesized that the innate immune system possesses specific activity to protect against biofilm infections. Here we show that lactoferrin, a ubiquitous and abundant constituent of human external secretions, blocks biofilm development by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This occurs at lactoferrin concentrations below those that kill or prevent growth. By chelating iron, lactoferrin stimulates twitching, a specialized form of surface motility, causing the bacteria to wander across the surface instead of forming cell clusters and biofilms. These findings reveal a specific anti-biofilm defence mechanism acting at a critical juncture in biofilm development, the time bacteria stop roaming as individuals and aggregate into durable communities.

### Doxycycline (doxycycline monohydrate) [^116x1qGN]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions:

Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.

Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.

Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.

Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.

The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.

Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:

False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:

Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with related antibacterials, oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibacterials (tetracycline, oxytetracycline). Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg/kg/day had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats. Effect on male fertility has not been studied.

### Does implant coating with antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro? [^1145CidA]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Concerning the antibacterial activity, a lower MIC for the antibiotic-loaded hydrogel compared to each substance tested alone (gentamicin, vancomycin, or NAC) was observed. However, this phenomenon has only been tested on a limited number of microorganisms and at a single antibacterial concentration. As previously published observations are lacking, further studies are needed to confirm these data and to evaluate its clinical relevance. Moreover, the possible mechanism underlying this finding, which may theoretically include increased cell permeability or longer stability and action of the drug delivered, has not been determined.

Hydrogel loaded with gentamicin, vancomycin, or NAC exhibited synergistic antibiofilm activity when compared with the activity of each agent alone against S aureus and S epidermidis. This finding is rather unique, since, although antifouling ability of hyaluronic acid has been previously reported, a possible synergistic effect of a hydrogel carrier and an antibacterial substance with regard to biofilm formation has not been described. Once again, the mechanisms underlying this finding have not been investigated and may be due to chemical and physical reasons. For example, in the case of NAC, the hydrogel may prevent oxidation, maintaining its antibiofilm activity for longer periods of time. However, we showed a synergistic antibiofilm effect of the hydrogel only in vitro, on a limited number of microorganisms and compounds, and at only one concentration. Further studies are needed to confirm these data and to evaluate their clinical relevance.

The authors conclude that the persistence of aluminum hydroxide at the site of intramuscular injection is a novel finding which has an exact significance that remains to be established fully. It seems mandatory to evaluate possible long-term adverse effects induced by this compound, because this issue has not been addressed (in the past, aluminum hydroxide was believed to be cleared quickly from the body). If safety concerns about the long-term effects of aluminum hydroxide are confirmed, novel and alternative vaccine adjuvants to rescue vaccine-based strategies should be proposed to ensure the enormous benefit for public health that these vaccines provide worldwide.

### The RAE1-STOP1-GL2-RHD6 module regulates the ALMT1-dependent aluminum resistance in arabidopsis [^112E8vYz]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Aluminum (Al) toxicity is one of the major constraints for crop production in acid soils, Al-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1)-dependent malate exudation from roots is essential for Al resistance in Arabidopsis, in which the C2H2-type transcription factor SENSITIVE TO PROTONRHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1) play a critical role. In this study, we reveal that the RAE1-GL2-STOP1-RHD6 protein module regulated the ALMT1-mediated Al resistance. GL2, STOP1 and RHD6 directly target the promoter of ALMT1 to suppress or activate its transcriptional expression, respectively, and mutually influence their action on the promoter of ALMT1 by forming a protein complex. STOP1 mediates the expression of RHD6 and RHD6-regulated root growth inhibition, while GL2 and STOP1 suppress each other's expression at the transcriptional and translational level and regulate Al-inhibited root growth. F-box protein RAE1 degrades RHD6 via the 26S proteasome, leading to suppressed activity of the ALMT1 promoter. RHD6 inhibits the transcriptional expression of RAE1 by directly targeting its promoter. Unlike RHD6, RAE1 promotes the GL2 expression at the protein level and GL2 activates the expression of RAE1 at the transcriptional level by directly targeting its promoter. The study provides insights into the transcriptional regulation of ALMT1, revealing its significance in Al resistance and highlighting the crucial role of the STOP1-associated regulatory networks.

### Antipathogenic properties and applications of low-dimensional materials [^115LkSYP]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Design parameters for LD-based next-generation antimicrobials

Recent advancements in LDMs have highlighted their potential as antimicrobial treatments. These highly antimicrobial materials can reduce the number of microbial cells by over 80% within a few hours. Such materials include: (1) 0Dand 1Dcarbon, (2) 0Dand 2Dg-C3N4, (3) 0D CdTe, (4) 1D metal oxides, (5) 2D GO, (6) 2D BP, and (7) 2D MXene, which have all exhibited high antimicrobial ability. Most of these materials employ a combination of mechanisms that are influenced by their chemical composition and morphology. There are many factors to consider when selecting LDMs for a specific antimicrobial treatment or scenario. For instance, is the desired application biological or abiotic in nature? What is the delivery method of the required treatment (injectable, solution, surface, physical, etc)? Does the treatment need to last for a prolonged period, or does it degrade rapidly in response to treatment? Is there a single target pathogen or more-general antimicrobial activity required? Is a chemical approach or physical methodology better for the scenario in question?

To assist with answering these questions, the following section has been designed to give an overview of the currently available antimicrobial LDMs and provide insight into the future directions of research in this area. Notably, the selection of LDMs is not trivial and is dependent on the system, application and specific microbes involved. Furthermore, the application must be adequately tailored to either prevention or treatment. Table 2 summarises the currently measured antimicrobial efficacy, the respective cytotoxicity, relative commercial costs, chemical stability, and the current status of the LDMs previously described for medical, industrial, and scientific-based antimicrobial-based exploitation.

Herein, we identify Ag + -proteome in S. aureus and delineate the dynamic bactericidal mode of action of antibacterial Ag + against S. aureus at the molecular level. We show that silver exerts bactericidal activity through targeting multiple biological pathways via functional disruption of key proteins. Such a shotgun mode of action of Ag + endues the sustainable antimicrobial effect of silver. Importantly, we have shown that silver could be further exploited to enhance the efficacy of conventional antibiotics as well as to resensitize MRSA to antibiotics.

### An interbacterial toxin inhibits target cell growth by synthesizing (p) ppApp [^115PW7Fj]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to inhibit the growth of competitors 1. One such mechanism involves type VI secretion systems, which bacteria can use to inject antibacterial toxins directly into neighbouring cells. Many of these toxins target the integrity of the cell envelope, but the full range of growth inhibitory mechanisms remains unknown 2. Here we identify a type VI secretion effector, Tas1, in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The crystal structure of Tas1 shows that it is similar to enzymes that synthesize (p)ppGpp, a broadly conserved signalling molecule in bacteria that modulates cell growth rate, particularly in response to nutritional stress 3. However, Tas1 does not synthesize (p)ppGpp; instead, it pyrophosphorylates adenosine nucleotides to produce (p)ppApp at rates of nearly 180,000 molecules per minute. Consequently, the delivery of Tas1 into competitor cells drives rapid accumulation of (p)ppApp, depletion of ATP, and widespread dysregulation of essential metabolic pathways, thereby resulting in target cell death. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism for interbacterial antagonism and demonstrate a physiological role for the metabolite (p)ppApp in bacteria.

Determination of kinetic parameters

The affinities of the enrichment culture for NO 3 −, NO 2 −, NO and N 2 O were determined using batch incubations. For each starting concentration of every substrate, duplicate batch incubations were started with 8–20 mL of biomass collected from the bioreactor. Serum vials of 20ml, 40ml or 60 mL were closed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium caps and flushed with Ar/CO 2 (95:5) to remove air. The biomass was not washed to avoid loss of activity, and was added into the vials either undiluted or after dilution with filter-sterilized spent mineral medium. Inoculated vials were again flushed with Ar/CO 2 (95:5) and an overpressure of 200 mbar was established. The pH was adjusted to ~7.3 with anoxic 1 M NaHCO 3. Formate was added in excess as the electron donor for the reduction reactions. NO 2 − and NO 3 − were added to the incubations from anoxic stocks to reach the desired starting concentration (0.5 μM, 1 μM, 3 μM, 5 μM, 7 μM, 10 μM, 15 μM, 25 μM, 35 μM, 45 μM or 60 μM). NO and N 2 O were injected into the headspace from 10% NO (v/v, in He) and 100% N 2 O (N50; Air Liquide) to achieve the desired dissolved concentrations (0.1 μM, 0.2 μM, 0.3 μM, 0.4 μM, 0.6 μM, 0.85 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM, 4 μM, 6.5 μM, 8 μM, 15 μM, 30 μM or 60 μM). After NO and N 2 O additions, vials were incubated for 5–10 min to reach gas equilibration before the first sampling. All vials were incubated at 20 ± 2 °C on a shaker plate at 200–250 rpm. Substrate consumption was monitored by periodically sampling either 0.7 mL of the liquid (for NO 2 − and NO 3 − assays) or 0.1–0.25 mL of the headspace gas (for NO and N 2 O assays) during a maximum incubation time of 2 h or until the substrate could no longer be detected. Samples were withdrawn from the vials after careful flushing of needles and syringes with Ar/CO 2 to avoid oxygen contamination. The extracted volume was always replaced with the equivalent volume of Ar/CO 2 (95:5). The liquid samples collected at each time point during the NO 3 − and NO 2 − assays were immediately filtered through 0.22 µm filters and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Headspace gas samples were directly injected into the NO x analyser or the µECD gas chromatograph to measure NO or N 2 O concentrations, respectively. After each incubation was finished, samples for protein quantification were collected and stored at −20 °C. The total gas pressure in each vial, pH, and temperature were monitored and recorded to ensure reproducible conditions for all assays and to be used on the calculation of NO and N 2 O solubilities.

### Aluminum posttranscriptional regulation of parathyroid hormone synthesis: a role for the calcium-sensing receptor [^1167zK45]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium regulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression by a posttranscriptional mechanism, as well as parathyroid gland growth through the activation of the calcium-sensing receptor. Aluminum decreases both parathyroid cell proliferation and PTH levels by an unknown mechanism.

Methods

To investigate the possible role of calcium-sensing receptor in the aluminum-induced PTH inhibition we used human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells transiently transfected with the human calcium-sensing receptor. We used a parathyroid gland tissue culture model to investigate whether the effect of aluminum in PTH mRNA was a transcriptional mechanism and also its possible role in calcium-sensing receptor expression.

Results

We found that Al activated the calcium-sensing receptor with higher efficiency than calcium, its biologic ligand. Aluminum inhibited PTH gene expression by a posttranscriptional mechanism, but only when low calcium is present in the medium. Finally, we found that aluminum is also able to decrease calcium-sensing receptor mRNA levels by a posttranscriptional mechanism; however, no effect was observed on calcium-sensing receptor protein.

Conclusion

These findings indicate that aluminum impairs parathyroid function through a calcium-like mechanism due to the lack of specificity of the calcium-sensing receptor. Additionally, aluminum decreases parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor mRNA levels, and the regulatory mechanism was posttranscriptional. These findings demonstrate for the first time a regulatory effect in the calcium-sensing receptor by one of its ligands.

### Aluminum | ToxFAQs ™ | ATSDR… [^112jqVKW]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2015). Low credibility.

Aluminum compounds have many different uses, for example, as alums in water-treatment and alumina in abrasives and furnace linings. They are also found in consumer products such as antacids, astringents, buffered aspirin, food additives, cosmetics, and antiperspirants. Only very small amounts of aluminum that you may inhale, ingest, or have skin contact with will enter the bloodstream. Some people with kidney disease store a lot of aluminum in their bodies and sometimes develop bone or brain diseases which may be caused by the excess aluminum. Some studies show that people exposed to high levels of aluminum may develop Alzheimer's disease, but other studies have not found this to be true. We do not know for certain whether aluminum causes Alzheimer's disease. The Department of Health and Human Services and the EPA have not evaluated the carcinogenic potential of aluminum in humans. Aluminum has not been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Children with kidney problems who were given aluminum in their medical treatments developed bone diseases. It does not appear that children are more sensitive to aluminum than adults. We do not know if aluminum will cause birth defects in people. Birth defects have not been seen in animals. Aluminum in large amounts has been shown to be harmful to unborn and developing animals because it can cause delays in skeletal and neurological development. Aluminum is found in breast milk, but only a small amount of this aluminum will enter the infant's body through breastfeeding. The EPA has recommended a Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level of 0. 05–0. 2 milligrams per liter for aluminum in drinking water. The SMCL is not based on levels that will affect humans or animals. It is based on taste, smell, or color.

The Occupational Health and Safety Administration has limited workers' exposure to aluminum in dusts to 15 milligrams per cubic meter and 5 mg/m3 of air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The Food and Drug Administration has determined that aluminum used as food additives and medicinals such as antacids are generally safe. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.

We do not know for certain that aluminum causes Alzheimer's disease. to higher levels of aluminum than a person who generally consumes unprocessed foods and uses pots made of other materials.

However, aluminum levels found in processed foods and foods cooked in aluminum pots are generally considered to be safe. Consumer products Limiting your intake of large quantities of aluminum-containing antacids and buffered aspirin and using these. medications only as directed is the best way to limit exposure to aluminum from these sources. As a precaution, such products should have child-proof caps or should be kept out of reach of children so that children will not accidentally ingest them. Detecting exposure All people have small amounts of aluminum in their bodies. It can be measured in the blood, bones, feces, or urine. Recommendations and regulations are also updated periodically as more information becomes available. For the most current information, check with the federal agency or organization that provides it. Some regulations and recommendations for aluminum include the following: Drinking water The EPA has recommended a Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level of 0. 05–0.

2 mg/L for aluminum in drinking water. The SMCL is not based on levels that will affect humans or animals. It is based on taste, smell, or color. Consumer products The FDA has determined that aluminum used as food additives and medicinals such as antacids are generally safe. FDA set a limit for bottled water of 0. 2 mg/L. Workplace air OSHA set a legal limit of 15 mg/m3 and 5.

### OLIGODYNAMIC ACTION OF METALLIC ELEMENTS AND OF METAL ALLOYS ON CERTAIN BACTERIA AND VIRUSES: I. in vitro observations… [^116g2y6y]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

THE OLIGODYNAMIC action of metals and metal compounds was noted in 1893 by von Naegeli who pointed out that "definite metals and metal compounds confer in minute quanity of water solutions the ability to change and finally kill cells in a characteristic way. " Many metallic elements have been observed to inhibit the growth of bacteria and to inactivate enzymes. Practical application of such activity of metals has been made in the purification of water and in the preservation of tomato juice, of cider, and of hides. Metallic lead, cadmium, and mercury have been noted to exert an oligodynamic action at varying distances from micro-organisms, apparently the result of solution of small amounts of individual ions in the medium. Minute amounts of certain metals have been found to stimulate the growth of tumors in rabbits. Although the virus of poliomyelitis and that of influenza have been shown to be inactivated.

in vitro by salts of heavy metals, studies with viruses similar to those made on the oligodynamic action of metallic elements on bacteria are not available. Furthermore several metals are now obtainable which were not included in earlier studies. The purpose of this report is to present the results of investigations of the possible oligodynamic action of metallic elements and metal alloys on various species of bacteria and fungi, and on the viruses of poliomyelitis and on influenza A by. in vitro methods. Table I depicts the periodic arrangement of the elements and a list of the metals employed. Materials and Methods Metallic elements and alloys: The metallic elements were obtained in so far as possible as pure substances, but manufacturers' analyses were accepted and no attempts were made to ascertain if there might be traces of impurities present.

The manufacturers' analyses of the composition of some of the metal alloys are listed in Table II with amounts of each ingredient stated on a percentage basis. Comments.
