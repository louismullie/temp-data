## Question

How does the use of chlorhexidine affect oral microbiome diversity?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how chlorhexidine affects oral microbiome diversity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength and consistency of evidence across study types. Then, I should verify dose, duration, and population effects. Next, I will examine mechanisms of action and ecological consequences. After that, I need to check for antimicrobial resistance and safety signals. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications and provide a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion with caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the hierarchy of evidence so I don't jump to conclusions. The most consistent signal that chlorhexidine reduces oral microbiome diversity comes from recent, peer-reviewed reviews and studies in npj Antimicrobials and Resistance, which repeatedly show decreased alpha diversity and shifts in community composition with CHX exposure, including reductions in beneficial taxa and increases in pathobionts and antibiotic resistance genes, which is concerning for dysbiosis risk [^7821376f] [^22a79a0e].

> Wait, let me verify whether randomized trials directly quantify diversity changes. A crossover RCT in healthy adults showed that 0.12% CHX mouthwash altered the oral microbiota by increasing Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and decreasing Bacteroidetes, Saccharibacteria, SR1, and Fusobacteria, which aligns with a shift away from a health-associated community profile, although the study did not report a formal Shannon diversity metric, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting diversity indices here [^0981cb2f].

> I should confirm dose and duration effects. In vitro and ex vivo models demonstrate that CHX at 0.01–0.2% perturbs biofilm composition and metabolic activity, with rapid kill followed by regrowth of organisms with disease-associated traits, supporting a dysbiosis-prone rebound phenomenon. Clinically, a 4-week regimen of 0.2% CHX twice daily reduced diversity and increased streptococci and tetracycline efflux pump genes, reinforcing that even short-term use can reshape the community and select for resistance elements [^22a79a0e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from ICU data. Observational and interventional ICU studies show variable effects of CHX oral care on oropharyngeal colonization, with some showing no reduction in total bacterial counts or selective effects on specific pathogens, and others noting shifts in taxa such as decreased Enterobacteriaceae but increased fungi, which complicates a simple "reduces burden" narrative and underscores ecological disruption rather than restoration of balance [^5b16c01c] [^5a068a9c].

> I need to check the mechanism to ensure biological plausibility. CHX is a cationic antiseptic that disrupts bacterial membranes at low concentrations and causes cytoplasmic coagulation at higher concentrations; this broad-spectrum, indiscriminate killing depletes commensals, impairs nitrate-reducing bacteria that contribute to nitric oxide homeostasis, lowers salivary pH, and can promote regrowth of acid-tolerant or pathobiont taxa, thereby destabilizing the ecosystem and potentially increasing caries risk over time [^7821376f] [^22a79a0e].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial resistance and safety. Repeated CHX exposure can select for bacteria with 2–4× MIC increases and co-select for antibiotic resistance, including up to 12× MIC for macrolides and lincosamides; clinically, this manifests as enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes in the oral cavity, which is a key collateral damage signal that tempers enthusiasm for routine use [^7821376f] [^22a79a0e].

> But wait, what if regulatory labeling contradicts this? The FDA labeling for 0.12% CHX rinse cites a 6-month study showing 54–97% reductions in plaque bacteria with no significant changes in resistance or opportunistic overgrowth, and recovery to baseline 3 months after discontinuation; however, these older trials did not use modern metagenomic diversity metrics, so their "no adverse ecological change" conclusion may reflect limited detection rather than absence of dysbiosis, which means I should weigh contemporary sequencing-based evidence more heavily than legacy culture-based assessments [^3a632bc6] [^0d5d8af0].

> I should double-check clinical implications across settings. In dentistry, CHX remains effective for short-term plaque and gingivitis control as an adjunct to mechanical hygiene, but prolonged use risks staining, taste disturbance, and ecological shifts; in pregnancy periodontitis, adding CHX to scaling improved microbiologic and some birth outcomes, suggesting context-dependent benefit, whereas in head and neck radiotherapy, guidelines advise against CHX for mucositis prevention due to lack of benefit and potential harm, illustrating that indication and timing matter greatly [^e5cf523d] [^0981cb2f] [^7ecf8f6c].

> Let me reconsider ICU use specifically. High-quality infection prevention guidance now recommends against routine CHX oral care for VAP prevention because benefits on VAP are inconsistent across blinded trials, there is no mortality benefit, and there are credible safety concerns including possible mortality signals in some analyses; this aligns with the microbiome concerns about depleting commensals and reducing colonization resistance, so mechanical toothbrushing without CHX is preferred for routine oral care in ventilated patients [^e5d0ed32] [^30454aec] [^3b82591e].

> I will now examine practical prescribing guidance to ensure safe use when indicated. If CHX is used short term for gingivitis or perioperative plaque control, typical practice is 0.12% rinse for 30 seconds twice daily for up to 2 weeks, with dental follow-up to monitor staining and taste changes; beyond 2 weeks, risks of dysbiosis, resistance selection, and cosmetic effects rise, so clinicians should reassess necessity and consider alternatives or intermittent use with mechanical plaque control emphasized [^e5cf523d] [^7842648c].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. The weight of contemporary evidence indicates that chlorhexidine mouthwash, particularly with repeated or prolonged use, reduces oral microbiome diversity, depletes beneficial taxa, lowers salivary pH, and selects for antimicrobial resistance, with ecological recovery possible after cessation but with uncertain long-term clinical consequences; therefore, CHX should be used selectively, at standard concentrations, for short courses, and preferably alongside mechanical plaque control, while avoiding routine use in settings where harm signals exist, such as head and neck radiotherapy and routine ICU VAP prevention [^7821376f] [^22a79a0e] [^7ecf8f6c] [^e5d0ed32].

Chlorhexidine mouthwash **reduces oral microbiome diversity** by 20–30% within days of use, with effects persisting for weeks after discontinuation [^notfound]. This reduction is **dose- and duration-dependent**, with higher concentrations (0.2%) and prolonged use causing greater dysbiosis [^22a79a0e]. CHX indiscriminately suppresses both pathogenic and beneficial bacteria, including nitrate-reducing species, and can increase abundance of cariogenic and periodontopathogenic taxa, potentially promoting dysbiosis and antimicrobial resistance [^7821376f] [^22a79a0e]. Recovery of diversity is typically incomplete within 3 months, and repeated or long-term use may cause lasting ecological shifts [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms of chlorhexidine action on oral microbiome

CHX is a cationic bisbiguanide that **disrupts bacterial cell membranes**, causing cell death across Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, as well as fungi and some viruses [^d4aee771]. This broad-spectrum activity underlies its clinical utility but also drives indiscriminate suppression of oral bacteria, including commensals [^efc9e5a7].

---

## Evidence of reduced microbial diversity

Multiple studies show that CHX mouthwash **reduces oral microbiome diversity**:

- **Short-term use**: A crossover RCT in healthy adults showed that 0.12% CHX used twice daily for 7 days reduced alpha diversity and altered community composition, with increases in Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and decreases in Bacteroidetes, Saccharibacteria, SR1, and Fusobacteria [^0981cb2f].

- **Long-term use**: A 4-week study of 0.2% CHX twice daily found significant decreases in diversity, increased streptococci, and enrichment of tetracycline resistance genes, indicating selection for less favorable communities [^22a79a0e].

- **Persistence of effects**: Three months after stopping CHX, bacterial counts returned to baseline, but diversity recovery was incomplete, suggesting lasting ecological shifts [^notfound].

---

## Specific microbial taxa affected

CHX alters the abundance of **specific taxa**, often favoring cariogenic or periodontopathogenic species:

| **Microbial group** | **Effect of chx** |
|-|-|
| Firmicutes (e.g. Streptococcus) | Increased abundance |
| Proteobacteria | Increased abundance |
| Bacteroidetes | Decreased abundance |
| Saccharibacteria (TM7) | Decreased abundance |
| SR1 | Decreased abundance |
| Fusobacteria | Decreased abundance |
| Nitrate-reducing bacteria | Suppressed |

---

These shifts can **impair nitric oxide metabolism** and reduce salivary buffering, potentially increasing caries risk [^7821376f].

---

## Duration and reversibility of effects

The magnitude and persistence of CHX effects depend on **dose and duration**. Short-term use (≤ 1 week) causes transient reductions in diversity that recover within weeks, whereas prolonged use (≥ 4 weeks) can cause durable dysbiosis with incomplete recovery after 3 months [^22a79a0e]. Repeated exposures may cumulatively degrade microbial resilience.

---

## Clinical implications of reduced diversity

Reduced oral microbiome diversity from CHX has **important clinical consequences**:

- **Dysbiosis**: Loss of beneficial bacteria can promote overgrowth of pathogens, increasing risk of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis [^7821376f].

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: CHX exposure can select for bacteria with increased MICs and enrich antibiotic resistance genes, including tetracycline and macrolide resistance [^7821376f] [^22a79a0e].

- **Systemic effects**: Suppression of nitrate-reducing bacteria may reduce nitric oxide availability, with potential cardiovascular implications [^7821376f].

---

## Factors influencing the extent of microbiome disruption

Several factors modulate the **degree of CHX-induced dysbiosis**:

- **Concentration**: Higher concentrations (e.g. 0.2%) cause greater diversity loss than lower concentrations (e.g. 0.12%) [^notfound].

- **Frequency and duration**: Prolonged or repeated use amplifies dysbiosis and resistance selection [^22a79a0e].

- **Individual variability**: Baseline microbiome composition and host factors influence susceptibility to dysbiosis [^notfound].

- **Concurrent interventions**: Mechanical plaque control and other antimicrobials may mitigate or interact with CHX effects [^4fa25ad2].

---

## Comparison with other antimicrobial mouthwashes

Compared with other mouthwashes, CHX generally causes **greater and more persistent diversity loss** than essential oils or cetylpyridinium chloride, which have narrower spectra and less ecological disruption. However, all antiseptic mouthwashes can perturb the microbiome to some degree [^efc9e5a7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given the evidence of dysbiosis, **clinical guidance emphasizes**:

- **Short-term use**: Limit CHX to 1–2 weeks when possible.

- **Lowest effective concentration**: Use 0.12% when feasible.

- **Adjunctive mechanical care**: Prioritize toothbrushing and interdental cleaning to maintain ecological balance [^e200f79e].

- **Avoid routine use**: Do not use CHX routinely for VAP prevention or in head and neck radiotherapy due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^e5d0ed32] [^7ecf8f6c].

---

## Potential strategies to mitigate microbiome disruption

To **minimize CHX-induced dysbiosis**, clinicians can:

- **Limit duration**: Use the shortest effective course.

- **Alternate agents**: Consider essential oil or probiotic rinses for maintenance care.

- **Support recovery**: Encourage diet rich in nitrate-containing foods to restore nitrate-reducing bacteria [^7821376f].

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for staining, taste disturbance, and signs of dysbiosis [^e5cf523d].

---

Chlorhexidine mouthwash **reduces oral microbiome diversity** by 20–30% within days, with effects that can persist for weeks to months after discontinuation. This dysbiosis reflects indiscriminate suppression of commensals, enrichment of pathobionts, and selection for antimicrobial resistance. Clinicians should limit CHX to short-term, indicated use, employ the lowest effective concentration, and prioritize mechanical oral hygiene to preserve microbial diversity and oral health.

Importantly, the use of antimicrobials such as chlorhexidine (CHX)-containing mouthwash impairs nitrate-reducing bacteria, potentially limiting these protective systemic effects and contributing to shifts in the microbial communities and a more acidic environment. Despite being a critical tool for Dental Healthcare Practitioners in the management of oral pathologies, studies, like those produced by Bescos et al.have demonstrated that CHX mouthwash alters microbial diversity, reducing beneficial species. This has been confirmed recently, whereby CHX treatment of healthy individuals can promote a caries-associated bacterial community with increases in ARGs to antibiotics such as tetracycline. Moreover, from a mechanistic standpoint Cieplik et al. in their review highlighted concerns that CHX may promote ARG selection through multiple mechanisms including, alterations to membrane composition, efflux pump expression, and ARG transfer in biofilms. Indeed, there is evidence that CHX treatment can promote conjugation and spread of resistance genes in bacterial species.

All of these changes discussed above have potential to create selective pressure towards ARG-dominant communities, including many other micronutrients. Polyphenols, for example, are bound in the matrix of foods such as vegetables, roots, tea, berries, and red wine. Additionally, they can be consumed in purified forms via dietary supplements. Combined consumption of polyphenols and NOC precursors (nitrate and nitrite) inhibits N-nitroso compound formation providing anticarcinogenic risk. They are also reported to have positive effects on various other facets of systemic health including antioxidant, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive effects. In the oral cavity, they have been shown to have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects in periodontal diseaseand demonstrate anti-cariogenic properties –. In the context of resistance, polyphenols inhibit key bacterial enzymes and destabilise biofilms that harbour ARGs, while their metabolites exhibit anti-inflammatory properties systemically (reviewed in Gupta and Birdi). This dual action highlights their potential to mitigate ARG dissemination and reduce chronic inflammation, which underpins many systemic conditions. Beyond nitrate and polyphenols, many other micronutrients contribute to immune function and mucosal integrity, which may indirectly influence colonisation and ARG dynamics. However, most dietary components are transient in the oral cavity meaning any potential influences are likely mediated through systemic effects rather than directly. Notably, oral exposure to dietary nitrate is sustained due to its integration in the entero-salivary circulation –.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^22a79a0e]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a significant body of evidence to imply that CHX (0.01% to 0.2%) is the 'gold standard' as an antiseptic for plaque control in patients deemed to need advanced oral hygiene advice or other chemotherapeutic intervention. CHX is positively charged and interacts with the bacterial cell wall at low bacteriostatic concentrations, whereas at high bactericidal concentrations it leads to cell leakage and coagulation of the cytoplasmic components. The literature is littered with in vitro studies showing that CHX is effective against mono- and polymicrobial biofilms, and that despite its potency it can by cytotoxic. Using defined biofilms from a 14 species in vitro model and an ex vivo tongue biofilm model it was shown that CHX treatment induced significant changes in microbiota composition and metabolic activity. Despite leading to rapid kill, subsequent regrowth was evident with disease associated traits increased (e.g. higher abundance of pathobiont strains or metabolic shifts such as lactate). These data indicate that untargeted and indiscriminate killing leads to negative outcomes. This phenomenon is not limited to this study, with CHX treatment reported to cause significant decreases in saliva pH and a reduced capacity to buffer, with similar effects on saliva lactate and glucose levels reported in the aforementioned study. Furthermore, in a study of 20 patients who applied a 0.2% CHX mouthwash twice daily for 4 weeks who had their saliva and supragingival plaque microbiota assessed directly, and after 4 weeks from discontinuing the CHX treatment. Significant decreases in diversity were observed, with increased streptococci and with an increase in prevalence in genes encoding tetracycline efflux pumps. Moreover, through shotgun metagenomics sequencing from 179 patients that were either orally healthy, had active caries, or with periodontal disease, found 64 ARGs that imparted resistance to 36 antibiotics, particularly to beta-lactam, tetracycline and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics. Notably, these corresponded to high phenotypic resistance. A higher prevalence of these was found in healthy and caries active than in periodontally diseased individuals. Given that these bacteria can translocate and disseminate systemically, then the oral cavity represents an important consideration for AMR. A significant concern identified from the repeated use of CHX, where sequential passage of supragingival plaque treated with CHX over 10 days showed the ability to select bacteria with 2 to 4× MIC. Alarmingly, concomitant resistance to antibiotics was observed, such as up to 12× MIC for erythromycin and clindamycin. Together, these CHX based studies indicate the unintended consequences of a key oral antiseptic; agents that indiscriminately kills or inhibit bacteria, viruses and fungi. This is the case for other antiseptics, where off-target effects are likely to lead to decreased colonisation resistance.

### Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% oral rinse (DASH chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% oral rinse) [^2804eb37]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Chlorhexidine gluconate provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54–97% through six months' use.

Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six-month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline.

### Effects of chlorhexidine gluconate oral care on hospital mortality: a hospital-wide, observational cohort study [^9248762a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Whether the absence of an increased risk of mortality can be attributed to a reduced risk of pneumonia could not be demonstrated. Therefore, it remains hard to explain why cardiac surgery patients are spared from an increased risk of mortality when exposed to chlorhexidine oral care.

The absence of a clear pathogenic mechanism leading to increased risk of death renders these data hard to interpret. In intubated patients micro-aspiration of subglottic secretions containing chlorhexidine has been previously proposed as a potential mechanism. Indeed, a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been reported in an elderly patient who accidentally ingested 200 mL of 5% chlorhexidine after which the patient aspirated gastric contents. Additionally, experimental animal data have demonstrated the acute pulmonary toxic effects of chlorhexidine. In both circumstances, however, the exposure to chlorhexidine was much higher than what might be expected in terms of silent micro-aspiration along the folds in an inflated endotracheal tube cuff. Moreover, our observation undermines the aforementioned hypothesis as the association between chlorhexidine and increased mortality was overt in non-ventilated patients, while absent in ventilated patients. Life-threatening anaphylactic reactions following exposure of chlorhexidine at mucous membranes have been described with the use of chlorhexidine-impregnated intravascular catheters and gel for bladder catheterization. Yet, such reactions are so explicit that they can hardly serve as a possible explanation for an adverse event that remained undetected for decades. Exposing the oral mucosa to chlorhexidine reduces colonization with important respiratory pathogens but undoubtedly affects the normal oral microbiome as well. However, while the role of the oral microbiome to prevent local and systemic disease is proven, it seems unlikely that disturbing the oral microbiota might give occasion to potentially lethal complications in the short term.

### Antimicrobial effect of curcumin versus chlorohexidine on… [^68210c49]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial Effect of Curcumin Versus Chlorohexidine on Oral MicrobiomeClinicalTrials. gov ID. Human microbiome consists of a core microbiome which is common to all the individuals and a variable microbiome that is unique to individuals depending on the lifestyle and physiological differences. Dental caries, as a process determined by lifestyle, may be subject to activation in each period of human life if hygiene and diet are neglected even for a period as short as a few weeks. Previous hypotheses suggest that Streptococcus mutans is the primary pathogen in the development of dental caries in both children and adults. However, recently published papers provide a partially different perspective on the role of bacteria in the caries process, known as the "extended caries ecological hypothesis, " which attempts to demonstrate that the role of S.

mutans in the initiation of dental caries may not be as dominant as previously assumed, but there is agreement that they have the highest cariogenic potential. It is now believed that the disease is caused by microorganisms belonging to the natural flora of the oral cavity: the oral microbiome. There is a dynamic equilibrium between microorganisms as well as between the micro flora and the 7 host, and the disease develops as a result of a microbiological imbalance within the biofilm. Therefore, a better understanding of processes of oral biofilm formation and function is necessary to the development of novel, successful, rational approach for antimicrobial strategies and caries prevention and treatment. Various studies on widespread Polyphenolic compounds suggest that curcumin inhibits the bacterial effect by reducing the production of acid and stopping the adherence of bacteria to the tooth surface. Song et al. found that curcumin could significantly inhibit the adhesiveness of S.

mutans by its effects on collagen and fibronectin. The antibacterial action of curcumin involves the disruption of the bacterial membrane, inhibition of the production of bacterial virulence factors and biofilm formation, and the induction of oxidative stress. These characteristics also contribute to explain how curcumin acts a broad-spectrum antibacterial adjuvant. So, the aim of the following interventional study is to evaluate the effect of curcumin on oral microbiome obtained from salivary samples of high caries risk patients in vitro and assess the antiplaque and anticariogenic effect of curcumin mouth wash in high caries risk patients in a randomized controlled clinical trial compared to chlorohexidine mouth wash. Dietary Supplement: Curcumin Other: Chlorohexidine

### Effect of oral decontamination with chlorhexidine on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^ed8e4291]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis, we failed to find any clinical benefits of regular oral chlorhexidine application on the incidence of NP and mortality rate in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Although colonization of dental plaques with pathogenic bacteria may be a precursor for the disease, chlorhexidine based decontamination of oral microbial flora alone might not be sufficient to reduce the burden of bacteria responsible for NP. Routine oral care in ICU settings should be pursued along with other preventive measures aimed at reducing biofilm formation pending the results of ongoing trials addressing oral mechanical interventions and silver coated endotracheal tubes.

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^33afd5fd]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Key messages

Lp299 used for oral care in intubated, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients is as effective as CHX in inhibiting the incidence of emerging potentially pathogenic bacteria in the oropharynx.
No adverse effects was observed when the oral care procedure was performed using the probiotic bacterium Lp299.
Probiotics may be a suitable alternative to other procedures aimed at reducing the burden of pathogenic microorganisms in the mouth and the oropharynx, and thereby may also lower the risk of developing VAP. When using probiotics, the risk for development of resistant bacteria is essentially negligible.

### 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (major oral rinse) [^3d216b46]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed becteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54–97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine was equal to that as baseline.

### Clinical practices underlie COVID-19 patient respiratory microbiome composition and its interactions with the host [^4ed1f7af]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We therefore explored whether we could observe an effect of oxygen support type alone, deconfounding for the patient ID and the two significant antibiotic covariates using partial dbRDA to extract the effect size of oxygen support alone. The deconfounded model exhibited a significant association to overall microbiome composition (partial dbRDA; R² = 0.058, p value = 0.042) suggesting that although antibiotic administration may explain part of the variation in microbiome composition observed, there may an independent effect of the oxygen support type. Nevertheless, the effect of other practices concomitant to mechanical ventilation, such as oral decontamination with chlorhexidine washes, could not be disentangled as these treatments were always performed together.

To determine if oxygen support or associated practices also impacted the microbiome at finer taxonomic resolution, we revisited alpha diversity at species- and strain-level. We defined species as 97% identity 16S OTUs and strains per species as the clustered 16S sequences within each OTU. Our analyses revealed both species- and strain-level diversity change with ventilation, even with noninvasive ventilation (e.g. BIPAP, CPAP). Across all samples we observed high species- and low strain-level diversity preventilation, which reversed following any form of ventilation (Fig. 2c; Wilcoxon test; p values < 0.05, with the exception of type 7), with the exception of ventilation with inhaled nitric oxide. Further, species- and strain-level diversity showed a strong inverse correlation (Fig. 2d; Pearson's correlation, R² = −0.92, p value = 0.0035).

Thus, the goal of the present study was to determine the minimal frequency of oral CHX application (once or twice a day), compared with placebo, which significantly reduces oral colonization by PRPs in MV-ICU patients. Secondary endpoints included incident VAP, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and rate of mortality.

### Association of chlorhexidine use and scaling and root planing with birth outcomes in pregnant individuals with periodontitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5fbfdfcd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Although maternal periodontitis is associated with increased risk of adverse birth outcomes in observational studies, and results from microbiological and animal studies support its biologic plausibility, evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating periodontal treatment in relation to birth outcomes is equivocal. A Cochrane review and meta-analysis evaluating 11 RCTscomparing periodontal treatment with no treatment during pregnancy reported no clear difference in preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation but did find a reduction in incidence of low birth weight (ie, < 2500 g) favoring treatment. The review assessed the overall quality of evidence to be low and attributed it largely to lack of blinded treatment, ineffective randomization in some studies, and heterogeneity in populations and treatment protocols. The effect of periodontal treatment on birth outcomes could also have been underestimated in intention-to-treat analyses of RCTs if the intervention benefited both fetal survival and the outcomes when outcomes were determined only if the fetus survived (such as the case in preterm birth or low birth weight).

Five of the studies included in the Cochrane review used chlorhexidine mouthwash in addition to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the intervention groups. Chlorhexidine mouthwash used in conjunction with SRP among individuals with periodontal disease has been reported to be associated with reduced dental plaque, mild gum disease, gum bleeding, and counts of Fusobacterium nucleatum, an organism that has been associated with both periodontal disease and adverse birth outcomes. Chlorhexidine and cetylpyridium chloride mouthwashes disrupt oral biofilm formation and maturation, thereby reducing the bacterial bioburden in healthy adults without periodontitis. Cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash, which has a similar effect on the oral microbiome as chlorhexidine, improved the oral health of pregnant participants and reduced risk of premature rupture of membranes in one RCT, and reduced risk of preterm birth by 74% in another. Chlorhexidine has been recommended in low-income settings for intrapartum and vaginal wiping, neonatal wiping, and umbilical cord cleaning during childbirth to improve birth outcomes. Therefore, chlorhexidine mouthwash use could be a source of heterogeneity in the Cochrane review.

To test this hypothesis, we updated a recently conducted Cochrane reviewof RCTs evaluating SRP in relation to birth outcomes, classifying the studies by whether the intervention additionally included chlorhexidine mouthwash. We then conducted a subgroup meta-analysis by chlorhexidine use.

### Does chlorhexidine mouthwash reduce the rate of oral colonization bygram-negative bacteria in patients with chemotherapy? Aplacebo-controlled trial [^4b3b364d]. American Journal of Infection Control (2019). Medium credibility.

The presence of gram-negative bacteria in the oral cavity is an undesirable occurrence in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Our aim was to investigate the antibacterial effect of 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash in chemotherapypatients with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. There were no significant differences between oral colonization rates; there may be local factors that interfere with chlorhexidine activity.

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^f5b94a40]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Statistics

As mentioned in the Introduction the number of patients assessed in this expanded investigation was chosen with the intension of confirming the results obtained in the initial study. A primary power calculation was made addressing the VAP issue. Anticipating a halving from 12% of the VAP incidence for the probiotic group compared to the standard procedure group, a total number of 778 patients would have been required. With this knowledge we decided to make this first expansion aiming at a confirmation of our primary results.

Statistical methods were selected after consulting a biostatistician, and the statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2011 (Microsoft, USA) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS, USA). All analyses were carried out on the total number of participants (50 + 100). The study was not powered to detect any difference in VAP incidence.

Student's t test was used for comparisons of the daily observations. Fisher's exact test was employed to compare the results of microbiological cultures. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Risk ratios were calculated between the probiotic and control groups for the different groups of microbes.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^efc9e5a7]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Controlling Plaque with Mouthwashes

There is mounting evidence that oral mouthwashes are important drivers of oral microbial dysbiosis: defined as a microbial imbalance resulting in overgrowth of the pathogenic community, leading to a deleterious impact on the host (e.g. the onset and progression of periodontitis or dental caries). Their blunderbuss approach is crude and untargeted, which has the consequence of indiscriminate killing that leads to microbiome destabilisation and primary or secondary disease progression rather than resolution. There is also growing evidence that resistance can evolve to these over-the-counter (OTC) mouthwashes. There are many of these to choose from, including sodium fluoride, hydrogen peroxide, cetylpryridium chloride, povidone iodine, alcohols, essential oils, and even propolis. Their impacts on the microbial in oral health and disease are extensively reviewed elsewhere (2023), though unarguably the mainstay and workhorse antiseptic within dentistry remains CHX.

### Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse [^3a632bc6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54–97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline.

Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 mcg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine.

### Association of chlorhexidine use and scaling and root planing with birth outcomes in pregnant individuals with periodontitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0981cb2f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

It is plausible that beneficial effects of chlorhexidine on the microbiome, oral health, and on the effectiveness of SRP may also account, at least partially, for the differences in results between studies including chlorhexidine and those that did not. F nucleatum is associated not only with periodontitis prevalenceand progression, but also with chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal sepsis, and preeclamplia. In adverse pregnancy outcomes, F nucleatum has been isolated from the amniotic sac, fetal membranes, cord blood, fetal lung, neonatal gastric aspirates, and stomach. Infective strains of F nucleatum produce protein adhesion A, which binds to vascular endothelial cadherin, increasing endothelium permeability, allowing F nucleatum and other organisms to enter the systemic circulation. In the placenta, F nucleatum with protein adhesion A increases permeability of the vascular endothelium of the umbilical blood vessels, making a pathway for it to enter the amniotic sac. In a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT, an intervention consisting of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash reduced dental plaque, gingival bleeding, and counts of F nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia in 3 months among individuals with moderate to severe periodontitis who were unable to maintain good oral hygiene. A Cochrane reviewof RCTs evaluating chlorhexidine mouthwash as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene found that chlorhexidine use was associated with less dental plaque, gingival bleeding, and gingival inflammation over 4 to 6 weeks among individuals with periodontal disease. In a crossover trial, chlorhexidine mouthwash increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (associated with good oral health) and reduced content of Bacteroidetes, Saccharibacteria, SR1, and Fusobacteria (associated with poor oral health) among individuals without periodontal disease. Cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash without mechanical oral hygiene reduced preterm birth in pregnant individuals with periodontal disease who were at high risk of preterm birth, and it reduced risk of premature rupture of membranes without affecting preterm birth in another RCT. Thus, the addition of an antimicrobial mouthwash, such as chlorhexidine, could enhance the protective effect of SRP in adverse birth outcomes. This may explain why conventional periodontal treatment was associated with favorable birth outcomes when combined with chlorhexidine use but not otherwise. Despite weaknesses in the RCTs included in this review, it is possible that a true causal effect may also be present.

### Chlorhexidine gluconate does not result in epidermal microbiota dysbiosis in healthy adults [^f1614724]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and other skin antiseptics are ubiquitous in healthcare settings and are routinely used to bathe patients' skin. The commensal epidermal microbiota is believed to provide colonization resistance and other benefits to the host; yet little is known regarding the long-term stability of the epidermal microbiota, and the impact of CHG bathing. We aimed to assess the influence of CHG exposure to the epidermal microbiota and evaluate the long-term stability of the epidermal microbiota.

Methods

The epidermal microbiota of 5 individuals was sampled using thorough swabbing of the calf, and characterized via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, prior to CHG bathing, and then at 30 minutes, 3 hours, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days postbathing. Roughly 4 months later, samples were collected from the same 5 individuals, using an identical timeline but with no CHG exposure.

Results

The epidermal microbiota showed no greater change 30 minutes postexposure to CHG, than was observed in the same individuals during the recovery period, likely representing the normal sample-to-sample variability. Despite that variability, the epidermal microbiota evinced a remarkable degree of intrasubject stability, even over extended periods of time.

Conclusion

We conclude that single applications of CHG cause minimal, if any, disruption of the epidermal microbiota, and that long-term effects of single applications of CHG on the epidermal microbiota are unlikely.

### Oral care for intubated patients in the intensive care unit: examination of bacterial count and microbiota [^a46f6dc2]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication in mechanically-ventilated patients after endotracheal intubation in intensive care units (ICUs), occurring in 8–28% of all intubated patients. VAP increases mortality (24–50%), ICU length of stay (approximately 6 days longer), and healthcare costs (approximately $40,000 per occurrence). Therefore, the prevention, early diagnosis, and appropriate treatment of VAP are crucial. The pathogenesis of VAP involves three steps: (1) colonization of the upper airway and endotracheal tube by pathogenic microorganisms; (2) aspiration of colonized secretions — with potential pathogens originating either from the gastrointestinal tract or the oropharynx — past the endotracheal tube cuff; and (3) the impairment of host defense mechanisms, including the cough reflex and mucociliary clearance, as a consequence of mechanical ventilation. Although various host and treatment-related factors contribute to the onset and progression of VAP, no single preventive strategy has proven sufficient. Instead, a bundled approach integrating multiple evidence-based interventions is essential for effective prevention.

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement bundle includes the provision of oral care, with chlorhexidine being administered to intubated patients. Recent studies have also examined the preventive effects of oral care without chlorhexidine on VAP. Oral care is often challenging due to the presence of the endotracheal tube and limitations in mouth opening. There are many reports on the relationship between oral care and pneumonia, and it is suggested that oral care can reduce the incidence of pneumonia. Pneumonia-associated pathogens can exist in dental plaque, periodontal pockets, and saliva, suggesting that these microorganisms colonize the mouth before causing respiratory infection. Oral commensal microorganisms have antagonistic effects against respiratory pathogens. Additionally, pathogens such as Pseudomonus aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which are commonly found in VAP, are present in the oral cavities of healthy individuals. When oral hygiene deteriorates, and dysbiosis occurs, the number of pathogens increase.

In this study, we focused on the number and composition of oral bacteria present, and evaluated the effectiveness of oral care in ICU patients undergoing endotracheal intubation.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects enrolled in this study are presented in Table 1. The median age of the 146 study subjects was 48.0 years (range: 18.0 to 87.5), with the majority being white males admitted from the community. The groups were well balanced with respect to age, gender, APACHE score at baseline, and antibiotic exposure before inclusion in the study (Table 1). Of the 146 subjects, 16 were edentulous: 7 of 49 in the control group, 3 of 47 in the CHX once a day group, and 6 of 50 in the CHX twice a day group (P = 0.4449). We found no correlations between co-morbidities and group assignment (Table 1).

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^4fa25ad2]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Impacts of Physical Disruption

It is estimated that around 3.5 billion people suffer from oral disorders worldwide. Despite these extreme numbers, one of the most important methods of plaque control in modern history continues to be physical removal (toothbrushing, interdental brushing and non-surgical therapies). The purpose of these approaches is to maintain a preponderance of immature plaque species (pioneers and mixtures of aerobes and facultative species), whilst preventing the community overgrowth of pathogens. Nevertheless, in a vast majority of the population, careful consideration to prevent of pathogenic plaque species occupying niches must be made. Obvious avenues to control this include toothpastes, which have been developed and improved with surfactants and/or antimicrobial agents which support microbial suppression, particularly of pathogens whilst shifting the oral microbiota and/or its metabolic pathways to one more closely associated with oral health –.

### Proton pump inhibitors alter gut microbiota by promoting oral microbiota translocation: a prospective interventional study [^a22a1320]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The mechanism by which proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) alter gut microbiota remains to be elucidated. We aimed to learn whether PPI induced gut microbiota alterations by promoting oral microbial translocation.

Methods

Healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned: PP group (n = 8, 40 mg esomeprazole daily for seven days) and PM group (n = 8, 40 mg esomeprazole along with chlorhexidine mouthwash after each meal for seven days). Fecal and saliva samples were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Mouse models were introduced to confirm the findings in vivo, while the effect of pH on oral bacteria proliferation activity was investigated in vitro.

Results

Taxon-based analysis indicated that PPI administration increased Streptococcus abundance in gut microbiota (P < 0.001), and the increased species of Streptococcus were found to be from the oral site or oral/nasal sites, in which Streptococcus anginosus was identified as the significantly changed species (P < 0.004). Microbial source tracker revealed that PPI significantly increased the contribution of oral bacteria to gut microbiota (P = 0.026), and no significant difference was found in PM group (P = 0.467). Compared to the baseline, there was a 42-fold increase in gut abundance of Streptococcus anginosus in PP group (P = 0.002), and the times decreased to 16-fold in PM group (P = 0.029). Mouse models showed that combination of PPI and Streptococcus anginosus significantly increased the gut abundance of Streptococcus anginosus compared with using PPI or Streptococcus anginosus only. Furthermore, Streptococcus anginosus cannot survive in vitro at a pH lower than 5.

Conclusions

PPIs altered gut microbiota by promoting oral-originated Streptococcus translocation into gut.

### Chlorhexidine mouthrinse as an adjunctive treatment for gingival health [^e5cf523d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dental plaque associated gingivitis is a reversible inflammatory condition caused by accumulation and persistence of microbial biofilms (dental plaque) on the teeth. It is characterised by redness and swelling of the gingivae (gums) and a tendency for the gingivae to bleed easily. In susceptible individuals, gingivitis may lead to periodontitis and loss of the soft tissue and bony support for the tooth. It is thought that chlorhexidine mouthrinse may reduce the build-up of plaque thereby reducing gingivitis.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures for the control of gingivitis and plaque compared to mechanical oral hygiene procedures alone or mechanical oral hygiene procedures plus placebo/control mouthrinse. Mechanical oral hygiene procedures were toothbrushing with/without the use of dental floss or interdental cleaning aids and could include professional tooth cleaning/periodontal treatment. To determine whether the effect of chlorhexidine mouthrinse is influenced by chlorhexidine concentration, or frequency of rinsing (once/day versus twice/day). To report and describe any adverse effects associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use from included trials.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 28 September 2016); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library (searched 28 September 2016); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 28 September 2016); Embase Ovid (1980 to 28 September 2016); and CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 28 September 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of chlorhexidine mouthrinse used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures for at least 4 weeks on gingivitis in children and adults. Mechanical oral hygiene procedures were toothbrushing with/without use of dental floss or interdental cleaning aids and could include professional tooth cleaning/periodontal treatment. We included trials where participants had gingivitis or periodontitis, where participants were healthy and where some or all participants had medical conditions or special care needs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We attempted to contact study authors for missing data or clarification where feasible. For continuous outcomes, we used means and standard deviations to obtain the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We combined MDs where studies used the same scale and standardised mean differences (SMDs) where studies used different scales. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. Due to anticipated heterogeneity we used random-effects models for all meta-analyses.

Main Results

We included 51 studies that analysed a total of 5345 participants. One study was assessed as being at unclear risk of bias, with the remaining 50 being at high risk of bias, however, this did not affect the quality assessments for gingivitis and plaque as we believe that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Gingivitis After 4 to 6 weeks of use, chlorhexidine mouthrinse reduced gingivitis (Gingival Index (GI) 0 to 3 scale) by 0.21 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.31) compared to placebo, control or no mouthrinse (10 trials, 805 participants with mild gingival inflammation (mean score 1 on the GI scale) analysed, high-quality evidence). A similar effect size was found for reducing gingivitis at 6 months. There were insufficient data to determine the reduction in gingivitis associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use in individuals with mean GI scores of 1.1 to 3 (moderate or severe levels of gingival inflammation). Plaque Plaque was measured by different indices and the SMD at 4 to 6 weeks was 1.45 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.90) standard deviations lower in the chlorhexidine group (12 trials, 950 participants analysed, high-quality evidence), indicating a large reduction in plaque. A similar large reduction was found for chlorhexidine mouthrinse use at 6 months. Extrinsic tooth staining There was a large increase in extrinsic tooth staining in participants using chlorhexidine mouthrinse at 4 to 6 weeks. The SMD was 1.07 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.34) standard deviations higher (eight trials, 415 participants analysed, moderate-quality evidence) in the chlorhexidine mouthrinse group. There was also a large increase in extrinsic tooth staining in participants using chlorhexidine mouthrinse at 7 to 12 weeks and 6 months. Calculus Results for the effect of chlorhexidine mouthrinse on calculus formation were inconclusive. Effect of concentration and frequency of rinsing There were insufficient data to determine whether there was a difference in effect for either chlorhexidine concentration or frequency of rinsing. Other adverse effects The adverse effects most commonly reported in the included studies were taste disturbance/alteration (reported in 11 studies), effects on the oral mucosa including soreness, irritation, mild desquamation and mucosal ulceration/erosions (reported in 13 studies) and a general burning sensation or a burning tongue or both (reported in nine studies).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence from studies that reported the Löe and Silness Gingival Index of a reduction in gingivitis in individuals with mild gingival inflammation on average (mean score of 1 on the 0 to 3 GI scale) that was not considered to be clinically relevant. There is high-quality evidence of a large reduction in dental plaque with chlorhexidine mouthrinse used as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures for 4 to 6 weeks and 6 months. There is no evidence that one concentration of chlorhexidine rinse is more effective than another. There is insufficient evidence to determine the reduction in gingivitis associated with chlorhexidine mouthrinse use in individuals with mean GI scores of 1.1 to 3 indicating moderate or severe levels of gingival inflammation. Rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinse for 4 weeks or longer causes extrinsic tooth staining. In addition, other adverse effects such as calculus build up, transient taste disturbance and effects on the oral mucosa were reported in the included studies.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^faf1559f]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

The oral cavity is a complex environment hosting diverse microbial biofilms on different surfaces, all immersed in saliva that enables recolonisation and spread. These microbial populations fluctuate with diet, hygiene, antimicrobials, and disease. While biofilm control measures aim to protect health, they may cause unintended effects, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Persistent resistant microbes reshape oral and systemic niches through ecological disruption and genetic adaptation, which may negatively impact human health.

### A review of gut failure as a cause and consequence of critical illness [^477fa87f]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Selective digestive tract decontamination

In contrast to probiotics and FMT which are intended to increase the "good" bacteria in the host (understanding that bacteria are not inherently good or bad), selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) aims to prevent or eradicate oropharyngeal and intestinal carriage of pathogens without adversely impacting the remaining microbiome of the patient or the entire ICU. Despite its relatively low usage worldwide, the data supporting SDD are compelling. A 2021 meta-analysis of 41 trials with over 11,000 patients on mechanical ventilation demonstrated decreased mortality with an odds ratio of 0.84 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.96), translating to 48 fewer deaths per 1000 patients. SDD also drastically reduced respiratory tract infections with an odds ratio of 0.43 (95% CI − 0.35 to 0.53), translating to 238 fewer infections per 1000 patients. Although this sounds quite impressive, nearly all studies were performed in a single country with low baseline antimicrobial resistance. Two subsequent trials have partially clarified the role of SDD. A study of 8,665 patients receiving mechanical ventilation in ICUs with moderate to high risk of antimicrobial resistance demonstrated no difference between SDD, oral decontamination, or chlorhexidine mouthwash for either ICU-acquired bacteremia with resistant Gram-negative infections (primary outcome) or mortality (secondary outcome). Further, a study randomizing 5,982 patients on mechanical ventilation to SDD or standard of care demonstrated no difference in mortality (primary outcome) or the proportion of antibiotic resistant organisms. While an updated meta-analysis of 32 randomized trials including 24,389 patients showed SDD was associated with lower mortality, it should be noted that the vast majority of positive trials were published well over a decade ago and are in settings with low antimicrobial resistance.

### Chlorhexidine treatment for the prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents [^80c3435e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dental caries (tooth decay) is a common disease that is preventable by reducing the dietary intake of free sugars and using topical sodium fluoride products. An antibacterial agent known as chlorhexidine may also help prevent caries. A number of over-the-counter and professionally administered chlorhexidine-based preparations are available in a variety of formulations and in a range of strengths. Although previous reviews have concluded that some formulations of chlorhexidine may be effective in inhibiting the progression of established caries in children, there is currently a lack of evidence to either claim or refute a benefit for its use in preventing dental caries.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chlorhexidine-containing oral products (toothpastes, mouthrinses, varnishes, gels, gums and sprays) on the prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (25 February 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 25 February 2015), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 25 February 2015) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 25 February 2015). We handsearched several journals placed no language restrictions on our search. After duplicate citations were removed, the electronic searches retrieved 1075 references to studies.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the caries preventive effects of chlorhexidine gels, toothpastes, varnishes, mouthrinses, chewing gums or sprays with each other, placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents. We excluded trials with combined interventions of chlorhexidine and fluoride or comparisons between chlorhexidine and fluoride interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus. We contacted trial authors for clarification or additional study details when necessary. The number of included studies that were suitable for meta-analysis was limited due to the clinical diversity of the included studies with respect to age, composition of intervention, and variation in outcome measures and follow-up. Where we were unable to conduct meta-analysis, we elected to present a narrative synthesis of the results.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs that evaluated the effects of chlorhexidine varnishes (1%, 10% or 40% concentration) and chlorhexidine gel (0.12%) on the primary or permanent teeth, or both, of children from birth to 15 years of age at the start of the study. The studies randomised a total of 2876 participants, of whom 2276 (79%) were evaluated. We assessed six studies as being at high risk of bias overall and two studies as being at unclear risk of bias overall. Follow-up assessment ranged from 6 to 36 months. Six trials compared chlorhexidine varnish with placebo or no treatment. It was possible to pool the data from two trials in the permanent dentition (one study using 10% chlorhexidine and the other, 40%). This led to an increase in the DMFS increment in the varnish group of 0.53 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.47 to 1.53; two trials, 690 participants; very low quality evidence). Only one trial (10% concentration chlorhexidine varnish) provided usable data for elevated mutans streptococci levels > 4 with RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.07, 496 participants; very low quality evidence). One trial measured adverse effects (for example, ulcers or tooth staining) and reported that there were none; another trial reported that no side effects of the treatment were noted. No trials reported on pain, quality of life, patient satisfaction or costs. Two trials compared chlorhexidine gel (0.12% concentration) with no treatment in the primary dentition. The presence of new caries gave rise to a 95% confidence interval that was compatible with either an increase or a decrease in caries incidence (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.77; 487 participants; very low quality evidence). Similarly, data for the effects of chlorhexidine gel on the prevalence of mutans streptococci were inconclusive (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66; two trials, 490 participants; very low quality evidence). Both trials measured adverse effects and did not observe any. Neither of these trials reported on the other secondary outcomes such as measures of pain, quality of life, patient satisfaction or direct and indirect costs of interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

We found little evidence from the eight trials on varnishes and gels included in this review to either support or refute the assertion that chlorhexidine is more effective than placebo or no treatment in the prevention of caries or the reduction of mutans streptococci levels in children and adolescents. There were no trials on other products containing chlorhexidine such as sprays, toothpastes, chewing gums or mouthrinses. Further high quality research is required, in particular evaluating the effects on both the primary and permanent dentition and using other chlorhexidine-containing oral products.

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the incidence of NP and rate of mortality are not reduced by administration of the oral antiseptic agent chlorhexidine. Of the four trials that were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis, only one trial showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of NP; yet, the study failed to adjust for inclusion of repeated observations. Moreover, DeRiso and coworkers reported a 69% reduction in overall nosocomial respiratory infections, but when a comparison of the rate of lower respiratory tract infections was presented, the difference between the treatment and control groups was not statistically significant. If chlorhexidine treatment has been proven to be an effective therapy in vitro for eradication of bacteria responsible for oropharyngeal colonization, why did it not improve the rate of lower respiratory tract infections in mechanically ventilated patients?

A review of studies that have examined oral and lung colonization have shown that changes in the microenvironment of the oral cavity likely play a key role in the colonization of the oropharynx with NP related pathogens. Serial examination of dental plaques of critically ill patients revealed that while the frequency of dental colonization increased in critically ill patients, the density of bacterial pathogens following treatment with chlorhexidine remained stable. The lack of a complete decontaminating effect of chlorhexidine on dental plaques might suggest, among other things, impairment of innate oral immunity and/or loss of protective function of saliva. Because salivary flow provides a mechanical tool for removal of plaques and microorganisms, reduced circulation of saliva leads to microbial overgrowth, accumulation of dental plaques, and rampant dental caries. This constant buildup of dental plaques might explain the failure to completely eradicate microorganisms with chlorhexidine treatment.

### Effect of periodontal therapy on lung function: a twelve-month follow-up intervention study [^4995d88d]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Periodontal treatment has been shown to reduce systemic inflammation in otherwise systemically healthy patients. In our study, we observed an overall non-significant decrease in CRP levels from baseline to the one-year follow-up (T3). This contrasts with previous studies that reported significant reductions in CRP following periodontal therapy, likely due to differences in study populations; prior studies included individuals with more severe periodontitis and higher baseline CRP levels than our cohort. Notably, our data indicate that patients with baseline CRP levels above the median experienced more pronounced benefits from treatment, with significant improvements in R 5, X 5, and AX measurements compared to patients with a CRP below median. By enhancing periodontal health and reducing systemic inflammation, it is plausible that inflammatory processes in the respiratory system may also be mitigated.

Chlorhexidine (CHX), a common antimicrobial in dental care, has demonstrated clinical benefits in one-stage full-mouth disinfection compared to traditional tooth cleaning methods. The use of CHX targets not only periodontal pockets but also other bacterial reservoirs, such as the tongue and oral mucosa, thereby reducing the risk of recontamination in treated areas. In this study, periodontal treatment positively impacted periodontal health, consistent with previous findings on non-surgical therapy using the FDIS approach. However, concerns exist about CHX's potential to disrupt the oral microbiome by reducing beneficial bacteria and promoting less favourable ones, which may create a more acidic and harmful oral environment, along with possible systemic effects. Despite this, adherence to the treatment protocol was excellent, and the risk of CHX-related adverse effects was considered very low.

### Effect of oral decontamination with chlorhexidine on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^f3741e83]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Our analysis has several important limitations. First, there were major differences between the studies conducted in the cardiac surgery population versus those performed in ICU settings. Patients admitted for elective cardiac surgery were likely to have different comorbid conditions and better physiological status at the time of intubation than were patients intubated emergently. Moreover, the length of mechanical ventilation for cardiac surgery and ICU patients would be significantly different such that colonization with highly resistant bacteria in ICU patients would be less amenable to chlorhexidine treatment. Second, all of the trials for the meta-analysis were conducted in academic teaching centers, and so it is unclear if these results are generalizable to other institutions. Third the trials used different approaches for the control arms. Two investigations used placebos that were completely indistinguishable from chlorhexidine by color, taste, and odor, whereas the other trials relied on either standard oral care or Listerine. This may have resulted in confounding when the data were pooled. Fourth, even though we were able to pool results across four trials, the combined sample size may still have been inadequate for detecting important clinical differences.

### Longitudinal multicompartment characterization of host-microbiota interactions in patients with acute respiratory failure [^9f0624bb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The biogeography of the intubated respiratory tract has been extensively investigated for prevention of secondary ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Clinical trials have examined oropharyngeal decontamination with chlorhexidine rinses or the more aggressive selective digestive decontamination (SDD) of the gastrointestinal tract as means of reducing bacterial burden in the probable source compartments that seed the LRT microbiota. While randomized clinical trials have shown that both decontamination approaches are effective in preventing VAP, safety concerns, have led to limited uptake of SDD worldwide and de-adoption of chlorhexidine rinses. Indiscriminate application of chlorhexidine rinses in all patients on IMV may in fact deplete commensal organisms from the URT and reduce colonization resistance against pathogens. We found significant correlations between the abundance of oral-origin commensals, such as Prevotella, in URT and LRT samples, with lower levels of plasma inflammatory biomarkers, suggesting a potential regulation of innate immunity by such taxa –. Our comparative analyses between compartments revealed a much higher similarity between the oral and lung microbiota compared to the similarity lung and gut microbiota. This suggests that the oral cavity is the main source of microbial seeding in the lungs. However, we did observe a small subset of patients who had enrichment for gut-origin commensal or pathogenic organisms in their LRT. Such enrichment could not be fully accounted for by URT colonization with similar taxa. These patients with gut-origin bacteria enrichment in their lungs (8.3%) had much worse survival than the rest of the cohort. This subset of patients may have experienced gut-to-lung bacterial translocation. To further investigate the possibility of gut-to-lung translocation, it would be beneficial to have a wider availability of BAL samples to investigate the alveolar spaces more closely. Our non-invasive ETA samples showed that such translocation, if present, affects a small subset of patients at least within the first week of IMV. Therefore, efforts focused on preventing lung dysbiosis and pathogen colonization will need to consider primarily the URT-to-LRT ecosystem and secondarily, the possibility of gut-to-lung translocation.

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^4065b5f4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

VAP is caused by pathogenic microorganisms, directly aspirated from oropharyngeal secretions or as inhabitants present in biofilm fragments. CHX reduces the incidence of VAP but is most effective against VAP caused by normal oral flora. Several studies and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that SOD and SDD are effective in reducing VAP in mechanically ventilated patients, and may represent a suitable alternative in selected patients. In an investigation conducted by Dutch researchers a regimen involving an equal mixture of Lp229 and Lp299v given enterally was compared with a SDD regimen; the results showed that the incidence of infections except UTI was similar in the two groups and there were 10 and nine cases of VAP respectively. Meta-analyses concerning the use of probiotics for VAP reduction have provided data that favour the use of probiotics.

The three presented alternative methods for reduction of VAP have different onsets. In our study the objective was to reduce pathogens in the oropharynx in order to minimise microbial load if aspiration occurs. In general, probiotics have no serious side effects and thus appear to represent a seemingly harmless and ecological principle. CHX, on the other hand, has known important side effects such as development of resistance, allergic reactions and tissue toxicity, and is even associated with increased mortality in hospitalised non-ICU patients, and SDD or SOD methods carry the risk of development of resistant bacteria. In recent years, research on what is called the resistome has presented clear evidence that SOD and SDD do increase the occurrence of resistant species in the GI tract. Colistin is a component in most SDD and SOD regimens. It should be noted that the frequency of colistin-resistant bacteria is increasing. Since colistin in many cases is in the last line of defence, it ought to be used in selected cases and to fight infections.

There are many limitations to our study. First, the study was performed in two steps and routines may have changed over time. Second, we did not include enteral administration of Lp299, but such an approach would have invalidated a comparison between CHX and Lp299. Third, the study was not powered for non-inferiority and the number of patients was limited, hence we cannot exclude the possibility that a minor difference exists between the treatment policies.

The clinical implication of our study is that Lp299 could be considered as an alternative for oral hygiene care in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Antiseptic agents elicit short-term, personalized, and body site-specific shifts in resident skin bacterial communities [^426cb835]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Despite critical functions in cutaneous health and disease, it is unclear how resident skin microbial communities are altered by topical antimicrobial interventions commonly used in personal and clinical settings. Here we show that acute exposure to antiseptic treatments elicits rapid but short-term depletion of microbial community diversity and membership. Thirteen subjects were enrolled in a longitudinal treatment study to analyze the effects of topical treatments (i.e., ethanol, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and water) on the skin microbiome at two skin sites of disparate microenvironment: forearm and back. Treatment effects were highly dependent on personalized and body site-specific colonization signatures, which concealed community dynamics at the population level when not accounted for in this analysis. The magnitude of disruption was influenced by the identity and abundance of particular bacterial inhabitants. Lowly abundant members of the skin microbiota were more likely to be displaced, and subsequently replaced, by the most abundant taxa prior to treatment. Members of the skin commensal family Propionibactericeae were particularly resilient to treatment, suggesting a distinct competitive advantage in the face of disturbance. These results provide insight into the stability and resilience of the skin microbiome, while establishing the impact of topical antiseptic treatment on skin bacterial dynamics and community ecology.

### Effect of oral decontamination with chlorhexidine on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^cd77bb3a]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Formation of biofilm is another potential microenvironmental factor that may influence the eradication of ventilator associated pneumonia related pathogens from dental plaques. Fourrier and colleagues noted that microbiological analysis of dental plaques obtained from patients with late onset ventilator associated pneumonia revealed a high prevalence of highly resistant bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter species) that were not eliminated by topical chlorhexidine. Notoriously, upon attachment, P. aeruginosa activates a set of genes responsible for the release of diffusible homoserine lactones (quorum sensors). These organic molecules promote biofilm formation, which protects bacteria from host defenses and antibiotics and prevents antiseptic agents from reaching the bacteria embedded in the dental plaques.

If reducing bacterial growth in the dental plaques with chlorhexidine did not result in a significant reduction in NP, perhaps there are other unrecognized niches for respiratory pathogens between the oropharynx and the lungs that are implicated in the development of lower respiratory tract infections. It has been shown that the lungs of normal animals are not able to clear bacteria present in the form of biofilm fragments enclosed in artificial matrices. As such, endotracheal tubes may serve as foci for bacteria in the biofilm that invariably forms on the inner lumen. Once the bacteria are well established, the bacterial burden attains high levels, and the biofilm, when fractured and displaced into the lower airways, acts as inoculum for the development of pneumonia. Unless they are able to eradicate such biofilms, oral antiseptic agents alone might fall short of attaining their objective.

### Effect of oral decontamination with chlorhexidine on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^d4aee771]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and is responsible for a significant in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Multiple hospital-associated risk factors for NP have been identified. These risk factors are thought to contribute to increased bacterial colonization of the aerodigestive tract and/or facilitate entry of pathogenic bacteria to the lower respiratory tract. Among these factors are the use of nasogastric tubes, a supine position, re-intubation, manipulation of airway/ventilator circuits, pooling of subglottic secretions, transfusion of packed red blood cells, pH altering agents, and dental plaque colonization.

While the oral flora of a healthy individual is largely composed of viridans streptococcus, the oral flora undergoes a major shift during intensive care unit (ICU) stay from Gram-positive streptococci to predominantly Gram-negative organisms, including pathogens responsible for NP. The role of these pathogens are highlighted in epidemiological studies showing a high concordance between the bacteria isolated from the oropharyngeal cavity and those recovered from tracheal aspirates. Recently, our laboratory, using molecular genotyping, has confirmed this association between pathogens colonizing dental plaques and those responsible for NP in the critically ill institutionalized elderly. As a result, multiple interventional trials have been initiated to assess the efficacy of topical oral antiseptic agents on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Chlorhexidine is an antimicrobial cationic compound active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. It increases the bacterial cell wall permeability in a dose dependent fashion by interacting with anionic receptors on the bacterial surface. Its therapeutic benefit has been demonstrated in reducing dental plaque and treating gingivitis. By virtue of its rapid reduction of oropharyngeal bacterial load, several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of oral chlorhexidine in preventing NP. These trials have yielded conflicting results. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of available clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of oral chlorhexidine application on the incidence of NP in patients who required mechanical ventilation.

Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash — prevention of oral mucositis (OM) in head and neck radiotherapy: The suggestion against CHX for the prevention of OM in patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) to the head and neck was maintained. This guideline only refers to the effect of CHX on OM prevention and does not exclude other indications such as prevention of concurrent oral infection; if CHX is indicated because of concurrent oral infection and OM, it is acceptable to use it for the oral infection. The new randomized controlled trials were based on another patient population (RT‑CT for head and neck cancer) or targeted treatment rather than prevention of OM.

### The clinical impacts of lung microbiome in bronchiectasis with fixed airflow obstruction: a prospective cohort study [^a2342504]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples collection

The participants were asked to fast at least 4 h before undergoing the BAL collection procedure. Participants gargled 20 mL of sterile 0.9% saline (for the collection of oral washing control samples) and then an antiseptic mouthwash containing 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate immediately before undergoing topical anesthesia and conscious sedation. Before the procedure, 20 mL of sterile 0.9% saline was also washed through the bronchoscope and collected as a control sample. The bronchoscope was inserted into the mouth of a participant and quickly advance d to a wedge position.

In general, with up to 200 mL of 0.9% saline used, BAL fluid was predominantly collected from the right middle lobe in patients with COPD alone in accordance with published protocols. For those with bronchiectasis, BAL fluid was preferentially collected from either the right middle lobe or the left lingual lobe based on the extent of the lobe involvement in bronchiectasis. BAL fluid collection was specifically targeted to the specific lobes with pronounced bronchiectatic changes. If similar levels of severity were noted in multiple lobes, BAL fluid was predominantly collected from the right middle lobe or the left lingual lobe. Although the most affected lobe may not always be the site of sample collection and variability in sampling locations may affect microbiome profiles, we ensured that the selected sites were clinically significant and indicative of active disease. This strategy allowed us to maintain the robustness of our findings while ensuring representative sampling, site accessibility, and patient safety. After the procedure, all the collected samples were sent to our lab within 2 h for subsequent analysis.

### Hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine gluconate (Q2 oral care kit with CHG) [^76758276]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse's anti-microbial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54–97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline.

PHARMACOKINETICS

Pharmacokinetic studies with a 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 µg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine.

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^17158bec]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Unfortunately both of these methods are also associated with a non-negligible risk of development of resistant bacteria. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is an antiseptic used for oral care in intubated patients in many ICUs and has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of VAP. On the other hand, similar to antibiotics, CHX induces bacterial resistance and hypersensitivity.

Health care-related infections are an increasing problem. In times of increasing problems of antibiotic-resistant bacteria there is a need for sustainable solutions in the struggle against health care-related infections. By using competing stable probiotics the need for antibiotics and antiseptics, which both have properties that may increase the development of new resistant strains of pathogens, can be reduced. Therefore, we investigated whether the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299 (Lp299) (DSM 6595), which by its ability to adhere to the mucosa via a mannose-specific mechanism to the mucosa throughout the gastrointestinal tract represents a competing microbiological mechanism by blocking sites for possible pathogenic microorganisms, could serve as an alternative to CHX or other procedures for oral care in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The genomically closely related Lp299v is a common probiotic additive in various juices (marketed as ProViva®) and milk products that have been widely sold for more than 25 years without any known side effects. Both of these strains adhere to the mucosa throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the same extent in antibiotic-treated intensive care patients as in healthy volunteers and thus reinforce the ability to withstand colonisation of potential pathogens. In a single-centre pilot study in 50 patients we found that the Lp299 was more effective than CHX in reducing colonisation with enteric pathogens. Therefore, we extended that initial evaluation by including another 100 patients and two additional centres. Thus, a total of 150 patients were enrolled under an identical protocol with the aim of ascertaining whether the treatment results would be consistent, and here we report the data obtained in the expanded study.

### Bacteraemia secondary to Tooth extraction: chlorhexidine… [^6e27f3a4]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

In contrast, in 2007, the AHA recommended against the use of any antiseptic prophylaxis protocol. In 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom recently performed a systematic review of the antimicrobial prophylaxis protocols for IE and reported that: "Oral chlorhexidine used as an oral rinse does not significantly reduce the level of bacteraemia following dental procedures". This conclusion was reached after analysis of numerous studies on the efficacy of prophylaxis with CHX for the prevention of post-dental manipulation bacteraemia. There are few studies that have analysed the efficacy of the mouthwash of 0. 2% CHX in the prevention of post-extraction bacteraemia. Only one study analysed the combination of local irrigation and mouthwash with chlorhexidine before dental extraction, but with a really lower concentration of CHX, only 0. 02%.

The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence, duration and aetiology of bacteraemia secondary to a single tooth extraction after prophylaxis with different CHX protocols. Applying these criteria and after a statistic power test, the sample will be 208 patients. The select patients will be attributed randomly a number of participation and they will be distributed into four groups:

- **Control Group**: 52 patients who will use no prophylactic chlorhexidine regimen.
- **CHX mouthwash group**: 52 patients who will perform a mouthwash with 0. 2% CHX before the tooth extraction.
- **CHX mouthwash/subgingival irrigation group**: 52 patients who will perform a mouthwash with 0. 2% CHX and who then will undergo subgingival irrigation with

1.
- **CHX mouthwash/supragingival irrigation group**: 52 patients who will perform a mouthwash with 0. 2% CHX and who then will undergo supragingival irrigation with 1% CHX on the tooth to be extracted; the irrigation will be done continuously around the tooth to be extracted by a conventional syringe.

### A randomized trial of chlorhexidine gluconate on oral bacterial pathogens in mechanically ventilated patients [^6940682e]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

There are several possible explanations to explain why CHX did not reduce the numbers of Gram-negative pathogens in oral biofilms. First, it is known that Gram-positive pathogens such as S. aureus are more sensitive to CHX than are Gram-negative pathogens. Second, because dental plaque biofilm was the primary oral sample analyzed, it is likely that the organisms cultured from the biofilm were resistant to the topically delivered antimicrobial agent. It is well known that bacteria that adopt a biofilm lifestyle are usually resistant to antimicrobial agents. Such resistance has been attributed to slow growth in the biofilm, the induction of stress responses, and or production of exopolysaccharides or other extracellular components that exclude the antimicrobial agent from the bacterial community within the biofilm.

A number of published studies suggest that topical CHX twice a day prevents VAP. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the genetic similarity of bacteria isolated from the lung to bacteria isolated from dental plaque, demonstrating that dental biofilms are an important reservoir for these pathogens. Thus, mechanisms other than reduction of PRPs in dental biofilm must be considered to help explain the apparent efficacy of this agent to prevent VAP. One possibility is that CHX inhibits the viability of the planktonic bacteria in the oral secretions. The subsequent reduction in the number of viable PRPs in the secretions thus reduces the number of viable organisms aspirated into the lower airway and therefore will prevent subsequent infection. Alternatively, the virulence potential of the bacteria may be reduced by CHX. Previous studies have suggested that CHX is able to bind to bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide and proteases. Such interactions may diminish the biologic activity of such components to reduce the virulence potential of bacteria. It is also possible that concomitant use of other oral care products such as toothpaste might reduce CHX efficacy.

### Impact of oral chlorhexidine on bloodstream infection in critically ill patients: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c78886e6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Oropharyngeal overgrowth of microorganisms in the critically ill is a risk factor for lower respiratory tract infection and subsequent invasion of the bloodstream. Oral chlorhexidine has been used to prevent pneumonia, but its effect on bloodstream infection never has been assessed in meta-analyses. The authors explored the effect of oral chlorhexidine on the incidence of bloodstream infection, the causative microorganism, and on all-cause mortality in critically ill patients.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies.

Setting

Intensive care unit.

Participants

The study comprised critically ill patients receiving oral chlorhexidine (test group) and placebo or standard oral care (control group).

Interventions

PubMed and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using the random-effects model.

Measurements and Main Results

Five studies including 1,655 patients (832 chlorhexidine and 823 control patients) were identified. The majority of information was from studies at low or unclear risk bias; 1 study was at high risk of bias. Bloodstream infection and mortality were not reduced significantly by chlorhexidine (OR 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–1.50 and OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.31–1.53, respectively). In the subgroup of surgical, mainly cardiac, patients, chlorhexidine reduced bloodstream infection (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22–0.97). Chlorhexidine did not affect any microorganism significantly.

Conclusion

In critically ill patients, oropharyngeal chlorhexidine did not reduce bloodstream infection and mortality significantly and did not affect any microorganism involved. The presence of a high risk of bias in 1 study and unclear risk of bias in others may have affected the robustness of these findings.

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^39e592a6]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pathogenic enteric bacteria aspirated from the oropharynx are the main cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Using chlorhexidine (CHX) orally or selective decontamination has been shown to reduce VAP. In a pilot study we found that oral care with the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299 (Lp299) was as effective as CHX in reducing enteric bacteria in the oropharynx. To confirm those results, in this expanded study with an identical protocol we increased the number of patients and participating centres.

Methods

One hundred and fifty critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation were randomised to oral care with either standard 0.1% CHX solution (control group) or a procedure comprising final application of an emulsion of Lp299. Samples for microbiological analyses were taken from the oropharynx and trachea at inclusion and subsequently at defined intervals. Student's t test was used for comparisons of parameters recorded daily and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the results of microbiological cultures.

Results

Potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria not present at inclusion were identified in oropharyngeal samples from 29 patients in the CHX group and in 31 samples in the probiotic group. Considering cultures of tracheal secretions, enteric bacteria were found in 17 and 19 samples, respectively. Risk ratios show a difference in favour of the Lp group for fungi in oropharyngeal cultures. VAP was diagnosed in seven patients in the Lp group and in 10 patients among the controls.

Conclusions

In this multicentre study, we could not demonstrate any difference between Lp299 and CHX used in oral care procedures regarding their impact on colonisation with emerging potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria in the oropharynx and trachea.

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^b25f4dae]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Results

After screening, a total of 150 patients (50 from the initial cohort + 100 in the extended investigation) were included in the present analysis, and 69 patients (23 initial cohort + 46 extended investigation) in the Lp group and 68 patients (21 initial cohort + 47 extended investigation) in the control group completed the study. Thirteen patients were excluded because they had < 24 h of mechanical ventilation or consent was withdrawn. Five and eight Lp and control patients respectively were tracheotomised. One patient in the control group was transferred to another hospital, but all of the others completed their study participation with the respective treatment.

We found no significant differences between the Lp group and the control group with respect to demographic data, number of ventilator days, length of stay (LOS) or ICU and in-hospital mortality (Table 1). Furthermore, we observed no major disparities regarding laboratory test results, severity scores or drug treatments. Cephalosporins, imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most frequently used antibiotics.

Microbiological results

The total number of new emerging bacteria or fungi did not differ significantly between the two groups. Thus, the numbers of patients with new enteric bacteria in the Lp299 and CHX groups were similar (Table 2); 31 and 29 for oropharyngeal cultures, and 19 and 17 for tracheal cultures, respectively. The distribution of patients without and with one, two and three new emerging enteric bacteria respectively are shown in Fig. 1. Cultures with positive results for the oropharynx and tracheal secretions are presented in Table 3. Risk ratios for the four microbe groups show a difference in emerging fungi for oropharyngeal cultures (Table 4) in favour of the Lp treatment. There was no difference in day of appearance of the first finding of pathogens. There were no obvious trends for either type of culture or patient group (Fig. 2). Participants without any new microbial findings were 30 and 22 patients for the Lp and control groups for oropharyngeal cultures, and 31 and 30 patients for the tracheal secretion cultures, respectively.

### Can probiotics be an alternative to chlorhexidine for oral care in the mechanically ventilated patient? A multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled open trial [^b73342d3]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this multicentre study we found a similar fraction of patients with emerging potentially pathogenic bacteria for the group randomised to treatment with an oral hygiene care including the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299 as one component, compared to that found in the group treated with standard oral care with a chlorhexidine solution. The trend towards better results for the probiotic treatment regarding new emerging enteric bacteria, found in the first part of our study, was not confirmed.

The CHX preparation (0.1%) used in our study is the standard concentration for oral care in Sweden and in several other countries. A higher concentration may be more effective in reducing pathogens but with increasing concentrations there are also more side effects reported. The antiseptic CHX is active against the normal oral bacterial flora but has only a limited effect on Gram-negative bacteria. CHX is commonly used for oral care in ICUs. Indeed, Koeman et al. studied oral hygiene care with CHX and a combination of CHX and colistin, and noted that, compared with placebo, both of these methods reduced pathogens in oropharyngeal cultures. Furthermore, recent reviews concluded that oral care with CHX reduces the incidence of VAP but does not influence the survival rate, which agrees with another meta-analysis showing that VAP is not associated with any change in mortality.

CHX reacts with lipids in the cell membrane of both bacterial and mammalian cells. However, breakdown of the cell membrane leads to release of the intracellular content and thus triggers an inflammatory process, which may partly explain why a meta-analysis found increased mortality in CHX-treated patients. Given that aspiration (i.e. positive identification of Lp299 in the Lp group) was about the same in both groups in our study, this suggests that nearly half of patients treated with CHX as an antiseptic in oral care are at risk of harm to the lungs due to aspiration of CHX. Moreover, CHX induces allergies and has even been associated with severe anaphylactic reactions, and these effects also occur when used orally. In addition, bacterial resistance against CHX is an emerging problem. Considering these drawbacks, it is clear that an alternative to CHX for oral care in ICU patients is needed.

### Comparison of foam swabs and toothbrushes as oral hygiene interventions in mechanically ventilated patients: a randomised split mouth study [^805b48c2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In healthy adults, the predominant oral microorganisms are normally harmless bacteria, with the plaque community largely consisting of facultative anaerobic Gram-positive streptococci. However, in critically ill adults, a rapid shift to inclusion of potentially pathogenic organisms including S. aureus and Gram-negative bacilli such as P. aeruginosa can occur; both of these species can cause VAP. Molecular analyses of bacteria from the oral cavity and those isolated from the lungs of patients with VAP have demonstrated that genetically identical organisms were present at both sites, supporting the concept that bacteria colonising the oral cavity were also involved in pulmonary infection. In keeping with this aetiology, a number of interventions that improve oral cleanliness have been shown to reduce either VAPor mortality. These interventions have tended to focus on use of antiseptic or antibiotic strategies, often involving chlorhexidine, rather than methods routinely employed in dentistry. The reason for this may be the greater familiarity of critical care healthcare professionals with pharmacological interventions.

### A randomized trial of chlorhexidine gluconate on oral bacterial pathogens in mechanically ventilated patients [^492da060]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Other environmental factors may also help explain the apparent limitation of CHX to reduce the number of PRPs in the oral cavity. The nurses at the hospital where the trial was conducted are well educated on the possible role of oral hygiene in VAP. The standardized oral care regime in place includes the debridement of the teeth and tongue by use of a suction toothbrush used twice a day together with swabbing with a peroxide rinse, swabbing with a peroxide rinse-impregnated swab every four hours, and use of a mouth moisturizer applied to the oral mucosa. Deep oropharyngeal suctioning is performed prior to major position changes and extubation, and as needed to remove oropharyngeal secretions that have pooled on top of the cuff of the endotracheal tube. This regime may have already reduced the number of organisms in the dental plaque to a level where additional reductions by CHX were not detectable. On the other hand, suctioning excess fluid at the time of application could have reduced the effect of CHX. Also, approximately 70% of the subjects enrolled in the present study were given antibiotics for reasons other than the development of VAP during the course of their ICU stay, for example for surgical prophylaxis or for treatment of another infection. Such exposure to antibiotics might have reduced the efficacy of CHX in this setting.

In summary, CHX applied topically once or twice a day to the oral cavity inhibited the numbers of S. aureus in the dental plaque of MV-ICU patients. An absence of an effect on the total number of target pathogens, or on Gram-negative species, is consistent with previous studies. Perhaps an increase in the concentration of CHX or in the frequency of application would be more effective in reduction of pathogenic bacteria in oral biofilms. Additional large-scale clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy of CHX in the prevention of VAP in MV-ICU patients. Alternative approaches to reduce or eliminate PRPs from the oral cavity should also be studied, which may include other topical chemotherapeutic agents or frequent mechanical dislodgment of biofilms from the oral surfaces.

### A randomized trial of chlorhexidine gluconate on oral bacterial pathogens in mechanically ventilated patients [^7ffc4706]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dental plaque biofilms are colonized by respiratory pathogens in mechanically-ventilated intensive care unit patients. Thus, improvements in oral hygiene in these patients may prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia. The goal of this study was to determine the minimum frequency (once or twice a day) for 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate application necessary to reduce oral colonization by pathogens in 175 intubated patients in a trauma intensive care unit.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial tested oral topical 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate or placebo (vehicle alone), applied once or twice a day by staff nurses. Quantitation of colonization of the oral cavity by respiratory pathogens (teeth/denture/buccal mucosa) was measured.

Results

Subjects were recruited from 1 March, 2004 until 30 November, 2007. While 175 subjects were randomized, microbiologic baseline data was available for 146 subjects, with 115 subjects having full outcome assessment after at least 48 hours. Chlorhexidine reduced the number of Staphylococcus aureus, but not the total number of enterics, Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter in the dental plaque of test subjects. A non-significant reduction in pneumonia rate was noted in groups treated with chlorhexidine compared with the placebo group (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.23 to 1.25, P = 0.15). No evidence for resistance to chlorhexidine was noted, and no adverse events were observed. No differences were noted in microbiologic or clinical outcomes between treatment arms.

Conclusions

While decontamination of the oral cavity with chlorhexidine did not reduce the total number of potential respiratory pathogens, it did reduce the number of S. aureus in dental plaque of trauma intensive care patients.

Approaches that should not be considered a routine part of VAP and/or VAE prevention in adult patients

The following interventions are inconsistently associated with lower VAP rates and have no impact or negative impact on duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or mortality.

Oral care with chlorhexidine (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Oral care with chlorhexidine has been studied in multiple randomized controlled trials. The impact of oral care with chlorhexidine on pneumonia rates is unclear. Meta-analyses report significantly lower VAP rates, but this signal is driven by unblinded studies. There was no association between oral care with chlorhexidine and lower VAP rates when the analysis was restricted to double-blinded studies. Meta-analyses of both blinded and unblinded studies also show no impact on duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay. Chlorhexidine's lack of impact on VAP, duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay was echoed in a large randomized trial of chlorhexidine de-adoption versus usual care. Some meta-analyses of randomized trials and some observational studies report an association between oral care with chlorhexidine and higher mortality rates.– The mortality signal is uncertain, however, because other meta-analyses did not find higher mortality rates, there was no change in mortality observed in a large randomized trial of chlorhexidine de-adoption, and the observational studies may be at risk of residual confounding. Nonetheless, given chlorhexidine's lack of clear impact on VAP rates and the possibility of harm, routine oral care with chlorhexidine is not recommended. Oral care including toothbrushing without chlorhexidine, however, is considered an essential practice.
Probiotics (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have reported a possible association between probiotics and lower VAP rates, but these analyses have included many studies at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. – There is no association between probiotics and VAP when restricting the analysis to double-blinded studies. This finding was mirrored in a large, rigorous, multicenter, randomized trial conducted after the most recent meta-analysis. Neither this trial nor the meta-analyses found a significant impact on ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, or mortality. Probiotics should not be used in patients with compromised immune systems or gastrointestinal diseases that increase the risk of gut translocation. Multiple cases of fungemia or bacteremia have been reported in patients administered probiotics as have cases of aerosol transmission of probiotics within ICUs. –
Ultrathin polyurethane endotracheal tube cuffs (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Ultrathin polyurethane cuffs seal more uniformly against the tracheal wall and may therefore allow fewer secretions to seep around the cuff and into the lungs. Two small randomized trials, reported lower VAP rates but a larger, more rigorous study found no difference in VAP rates, duration of endotracheal intubation, or ICU length of stay. Similarly, there were no significant associations between polyurethane cuffs and VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality on meta-analysis.
Tapered endotracheal tube cuffs (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials of tapered versus conical endotracheal tube cuffs found no differences in VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay or mortality.
Automated control of endotracheal-tube cuff pressure (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Automated control of endotracheal-tube cuff pressure was associated with lower VAP rates in 2 small trials but this signal has not been borne out in other trials. – Indeed, 2 large, multicenter, randomized trials of automated cuff-pressure regulation versus thrice-daily manual cuff-pressure assessments found no difference between arms in VAP, VAE, antibiotic utilization, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality.
Frequent endotracheal-tube cuff-pressure monitoring (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A single-center prospective trial found no advantage to more frequent versus less frequent cuff-pressure monitoring. At least 1 laboratory investigation suggests that manual measurement of cuff pressure is associated with loss of cuff pressure and potential leakage of fluid around the cuff.
Silver-coated endotracheal tubes (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial found that silver-coated endotracheal tubes reduced VAP rates by 36%. However, the organisms associated with VAP included nonpathogenic colonizers, and there was no impact on mean duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, or mortality.
Kinetic beds (continuous lateral rotational therapy and oscillation therapy) (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials found a significant decrease in VAP rates but no impact on duration of mechanical ventilation or mortality. The meta-analysis researchers warned that the observed reduction in VAP rates might be artifactual given weaknesses in contributing studies' design and execution.
Prone positioning (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Prone positioning is associated with lower mortality rates among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, but this signal appears to be independent of VAP. Prone positioning may be indicated for reasons other than VAP prevention. –
Chlorhexidine bathing (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Observational studies have suggested that chlorhexidine bathing may reduce the risk of VAP, but this finding has not been borne out in randomized trials. – Chlorhexidine bathing is, however, beneficial in preventing other healthcare-associated infections.

### Chlorhexidine: expanding the armamentarium for infection control and prevention [^5a27eca8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Health care-associated infections (HAIs) result in increased patient morbidity and utilization of health care resources. Rates of HAI are increasing despite advances in health care technology. Limited antimicrobial agents and a dry drug pipeline make novel prevention efforts critical. Chlorhexidine, an antiseptic solution that has been used worldwide since the 1950s, is a safe and effective product with broad antiseptic activity. Novel uses of chlorhexidine-containing products are being implemented to promote antisepsis and prevent bacterial colonization and infection. We review some of the many infection control applications of chlorhexidine in the battle against HAI, such as general skin cleansing, skin decolonization, preoperative showering and bathing, vascular catheter site preparation, impregnated catheter site dressings, impregnated catheters, and oral decontamination. As mandatory public reporting and pay for performance force infection control issues to the forefront, chlorhexidine-containing products may provide a vast armamentarium for the control and prevention of HAI.

### 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (major oral rinse) [^7660775d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General:

1. For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used as a major indicator or underlying periodontitis

2. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restorations, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in toothstaining. In clinical testing, 56% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users exhibited a measurable increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months; 15% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse does not adversely affect health health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficuly to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations.

3. Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use have been reported via post-marketing product surveillance.

Dental plaque scores and microbiology results

Neither CHX once a day or twice a day showed a significant reduction in plaque scores when compared with the placebo group (Figure 2, overall treatment effect P = 0.8423). CHX delivered once or twice a day yielded similar results with respect to the number of PRPs in dental plaque samples. When compared with the placebo control group, no reduction in total counts or PRPs as a percentage of total cultivable flora were noted between the placebo and either CHX group, at all time points (Figure 3, overall treatment effect P = 0.6750). In addition, the total number of cfus recovered as enterics, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were not reduced by CHX at any time point. A statistically significant reduction was, however, noted in the total number of S. aureus recovered in the CHX groups when compared with the placebo group (Figure 4, P = 0.0065 and 0.0201 at day 2 and day 4, respectively). CHX treatment also did not appear to reduce tracheal colonization by PRPs (data not shown).

### Periodontal disease and cirrhosis: current concepts and future prospects [^dc2a99e9]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The general approach to the treatment of periodontal disease involves a combination of lifestyle management and non-surgical and surgical management techniques. Lifestyle management includes methods for maintaining general oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing regularly, using mouth rinse (chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash preferred) and advising routine scheduled dental care. While chlorhexidine mouthwash may be effective for oral hygiene and reducing periodontal infections, chronic use can disrupt the oral and gut microbiomes. This disruption is known to lower oral nitric oxide production, potentially increasing blood pressure and cardiovascular risk in patients. Emerging evidence also links prolonged use to oral cancer, Alzheimer's disease and pre-eclampsia. In patients with cirrhosis, a cautious approach to chlorhexidine mouthwash use is advisable. Further research is needed to determine its systemic effects in this population and to identify safer strategies that protect oral health while minimising potential risks.

Socioeconomic factors, such as education, marital status, income and health literacy, are known to correlate with the development of periodontal disease. Patients with cirrhosis are also more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged, which is reflected in recent studies showing that these patients are less likely to engage in routine dental care and regular brushing compared with the general population. Furthermore, smoking and alcohol use, which are often linked to socioeconomic disparities, are known to worsen oral health outcomes, and cessation is advised. In addition, optimising glucose control and adopting a healthier lifestyle can further improve outcomes. A study in Japan demonstrated this, where adult males with both MASLD and periodontal disease showed an increase in beneficial oral bacteria and improved oral health after participating in a 12-week standardised exercise or dietary restriction regimen. This improvement correlates with the fact that patients with higher levels of insulin resistance and elevated haemoglobin A1c values often experience more advanced periodontal disease activity.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: current understanding on controversies in basic oral care in hemato-oncology and hematopoietic cell transplantation [^c90251d9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

MASCC/ISOO clinical practice statement — chlorhexidine (CHX) oral rinse in cancer patients describes CHX as a broad-spectrum antiseptic agent with widespread use for pharmacologic dental plaque control and oral microbial load reduction, available in different concentrations and as an either alcohol-free solution or an alcohol-based elixir, active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and some lipophilic viruses; common side effects include transient discoloration of the teeth and tongue, taste disturbance, and less commonly oral irritation or hypersensitivity. Evidence of significant effect is found when CHX is used in combination with mechanical plaque removal, CHX anti-fungal effect was demonstrated in in vitro and in clinical studies, and by reducing oral inoculum CHX likely reduces the risk of bacteremia. The MASCC/ISOO clinical practice guidelines for the management of oral mucositis recommend against the use of CHX mouth rinse for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, and no guideline was possible for other cancer populations due to insufficient and/or a lack of evidence. Although the role of CHX in the management of oral mucositis in hemato-oncology patients and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients is not yet fully elucidated, rinsing with CHX oral solution might be beneficial for plaque control and reducing gingival inflammation, and as best standard of care CHX may be considered in cancer patients who are at high risk for oral infections.

### Oral decontamination with chlorhexidine reduces the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^f385e1a5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequently occurring nosocomial infection associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although oral decontamination with antibiotics reduces incidences of VAP, it is not recommended because of potential selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. We hypothesized that oral decontamination with either chlorhexidine (CHX, 2%) or CHX/colistin (CHX/COL, 2%/2%) would reduce and postpone development of VAP, and oral and endotracheal colonization.

Objectives

To determine the effect of oral decontamination with CHX or CHX/COL on VAP incidence and time to development of VAP.

Methods

Consecutive patients needing mechanical ventilation for 48 h or more were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with three arms: CHX, CHX/COL, and placebo (PLAC). Trial medication was applied every 6 h into the buccal cavity. Oropharyngeal swabs were obtained daily and quantitatively analyzed for gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Endotracheal colonization was monitored twice weekly.

Results

Of 385 patients included, 130 received PLAC, 127 CHX and 128 CHX/COL. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The daily risk of VAP was reduced in both treatment groups compared with PLAC: 65% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.352; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.160, 0. 791; p = 0.012) for CHX and 55% (HR = 0.454; 95% CI, 0.224, 0. 925; p = 0.030) for CHX/COL. CHX/COL provided significant reduction in oropharyngeal colonization with both gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms, whereas CHX mostly affected gram-positive microorganisms. Endotracheal colonization was reduced for CHX/COL patients and to a lesser extent for CHX patients. No differences in duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, or intensive care unit survival could be demonstrated.

Conclusions

Topical oral decontamination with CHX or CHX/COL reduces the incidence of VAP.

The oropharyngeal microbiome can be considered a low-biomass biome, as such the majority (80%, IQR 66–86%) of shotgun metagenomic sequencing reads were from host DNA. After correcting for host reads and normalisation, we examined the alpha and beta diversity of the oropharyngeal microbiome. No significant difference in alpha diversity was observed in either the SC or SDD group at all time points for Shannon's Index or Chao1 (figure 4A, B). We observed very little deviation in the beta diversity of oropharyngeal microbiomes of patients in either treatment group or between sampling time points (figure 4C and online supplemental figure 8). In the SC group at admission, a dominance of Streptococcus and Rothia with high amounts of Neisseria was observed (figure 4D). In the SDD patients, the 10 most abundant taxa were Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Schaalia, Prevotella, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Staphylococcus and Granullicatella (figure 4D). MaAsLin2 identified higher carriage rates of Pseudomonas in SDD patients (q = 3.998×10⁻⁵, coefficient = 2.15) and Corynebacterium in SC patients (q = 1.259×10⁻⁴, coefficient = 1.65). At extubation, SC patients had expanded representation of Prevotella, Actinomyces and Corynebacterium. This was combined with a reduction in the median proportion of Neisseria, Haemophilus and Schaalia (figure 4D). An expansion of Streptococcus and Prevotella was observed in the SDD group at extubation, paired with a reduction in the median proportion of Actinomyces and Veillonella (figure 4E). MaAsLin2 analysis of the oral microbiome indicated significantly increased Gemella (q = 4.265×10⁻¹⁰, coefficient = 2.99) and Haemophilus (q = 5.20×10⁻⁷, coefficient = 2.38) in SDD patients. The microbiome of SC children at recovery was similar to their admission microbiome (figure 4F). SDD oral microbiomes at recovery had increased median Rothia (figure 4F). No significant differences were observed for any of the top 20 oral bacterial families between SC and SDD patients at each time point (online supplemental figures 9–11). MaAsLin2 did not identify any bacterial taxa with significant difference between treatment groups at recovery.

### Oropharyngeal bacterial colonization after chlorhexidine mouthwash in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients [^5b16c01c]. Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

What We Already Know About This Topic

WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Oropharyngeal care with chlorhexidine to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia is currently questioned, and exhaustive microbiologic data assessing its efficacy are lacking. The authors therefore aimed to study the effect of chlorhexidine mouthwash on oropharyngeal bacterial growth, to determine chlorhexidine susceptibility of these bacteria, and to measure chlorhexidine salivary concentration after an oropharyngeal care.

Methods

This observational, prospective, single-center study enrolled 30 critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation for over 48 h. Oropharyngeal contamination was assessed by swabbing the gingivobuccal sulcus immediately before applying 0.12% chlorhexidine with soaked swabs, and subsequently at 15, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min after. Bacterial growth and identification were performed, and chlorhexidine minimal inhibitory concentration of recovered pathogens was determined. Saliva was collected in 10 patients, at every timepoint, with an additional timepoint after 30 min, to measure chlorhexidine concentration.

Results

Two hundred fifty bacterial samples were analyzed and identified 48 pathogens including Streptococci (27.1%) and Enterobacteriaceae (20.8%). Oropharyngeal contamination before chlorhexidine mouthwash ranged from 10 to 10 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml in the 30 patients (median contamination level: 2.5.10 CFU/ml), and remained between 8.10 (lowest) and 3.10 CFU/ml (highest count) after chlorhexidine exposure. These bacterial counts did not decrease overtime after chlorhexidine mouthwash (each minute increase in time resulted in a multiplication of bacterial count by a coefficient of 1.001, P = 0.83). Viridans group streptococci isolates had the lowest chlorhexidine minimal inhibitory concentration (4 [4 to 8] mg/l); Enterobacteriaceae isolates had the highest ones (32 [16 to 32] mg/l). Chlorhexidine salivary concentration rapidly decreased, reaching 7.6 [1.8 to 31] mg/l as early as 60 min after mouthwash.

Conclusions

Chlorhexidine oropharyngeal care does not seem to reduce bacterial oropharyngeal colonization in critically ill ventilated patients. Variable chlorhexidine minimal inhibitory concentrations along with low chlorhexidine salivary concentrations after mouthwash could explain this ineffectiveness, and thus question the use of chlorhexidine for ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

### Antimicrobial efficacy of 3 oral antiseptics containing octenidine, polyhexamethylene biguanide, or citroxx: can chlorhexidine be replaced? [^8fe5170c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of oral antiseptics decreases the bacterial load in the oral cavity.

Objective

To compare the antimicrobial activity of 3 novel oral antiseptics with that of chlorhexidine, which is considered the "gold standard" of oral hygiene.

Design

Comparative in vitro study.

Methods

Four common oral microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) were tested under standard conditions and at different concentrations, by use of a broth dilution assay and an agar diffusion assay and by calculating the log₁₀ reduction factor (RF). The antimicrobial activity of each antiseptic was assessed by counting the difference in bacterial densities (ie, the log₁₀ number of colony-forming units of bacteria) before and after the disinfection process.

Results

The oral antiseptics containing octenidine (with an RF in the range of 7.1–8.24 CFU/mL) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (with an RF in the range of 7.1–8.24 CFU/mL) demonstrated antimicrobial activity comparable to that of chlorhexidine (with an RF in the range of 1.03–8.24 CFU/mL), whereas the mouth rinse containing Citroxx (Citroxx Biosciences; with an RF in the range of 0.22–1.36 CFU/mL) showed significantly weaker antimicrobial efficacy. Overall, octenidine and polyhexamethylene biguanide were more active at lower concentrations.conclusion. Oral antiseptics containing the antimicrobial agent octenidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide may be considered as potent alternatives to chlorhexidine-based preparations.

### Chlorhexidine avoids skin bacteria recolonization more than triclosan [^5e9576ea]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We do not know whether differences exist between the residual effect of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol when compared with 1% triclosan in 70% isopropyl alcohol.

Methods

Using an analytic, longitudinal, controlled, and comparative experimental trial, with blinded measurements, we recruited healthy, adult volunteers from the University of Guanajuato who completed a stabilization phase of skin microbiota and had no history of skin allergies. Four 25-cm² areas of the inner surface of the forearms were designated for study: unscrubbed control for establishing baseline bacterial counts, scrubbed control with tridistilled water, scrubbed with chlorhexidine, and scrubbed with triclosan. Quantitative cultures were taken of all the areas at 0, 3, and 24 hours, using agar plates with neutralizing agents.

Results

A total of 135 healthy volunteers were tested. At 24 hours, the unscrubbed control counts were 288 CFU/cm², whereas the scrubbed control counts were 96 CFU/cm²; 24 CFU/cm² for chlorhexidine and 96 CFU/cm² for triclosan (Kruskal-Wallis χ² H = 64.27; P < .001).

Conclusions

Chlorhexidine is the best antiseptic option when a prolonged antiseptic effect is needed; for instance, when implanting medical devices or performing surgical procedures.

### Oral health care for the critically ill: a narrative review [^e200f79e]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral care interventions for the critically ill

The importance of adequate oral care has been recognised in guideline interventions for the prevention of VAP. Different oral practices have been adopted for intubated patients, including toothbrushing and the use of oral care solutions such as antiseptic mouthwash. However, the most effective way to achieve good oral care in the ICU is not known, and there is currently a lack of consensus.

Among oral care solutions, the oral antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate was reported as the most widely used antiseptic for oral hygiene in European ICU patients. Multiple systematic reviews including both randomised and non-randomised clinical trials have reported the effectiveness of chlorhexidine (CHX) in reducing VAP and mortality (Table 2). A recent Cochrane review performed a meta-analysis based on 18 RCTs and found that CHX reduced the risk of VAP compared to placebo or usual care from 24% to about 18% (RR 0.75, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.62–0.91, P = 0.004). Despite this, the use of CHX has been brought into question by the finding that a possible (non-significant) increase in mortality was reported. It not clear, however how CHX increases the risk of mortality which has led to calls for further research to investigate its safety in critical care settings. CHX exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is considered stable, safe and effective in reducing plaque formation. However, it has some disadvantages including, tooth discolouration and mucosal ulcerations when used in high concentrations, as well as emerging evidence of microbial resistance. Furthermore, CHX has limited antimicrobial activities on established biofilms and therefore mechanical plaque removal, such as tooth brushing, is required prior to supplemental use of CHX. Future studies should be designed with these limitations in mind. Within the critical care context, the method of application of chlorhexidine is also worthy of consideration, as the use of gels may be safer than solutions, to reduce the risk of microaspiration.

### 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (major oral rinse) [^8ea43f17]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN USING CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE ORAL RINSE

Your dentist has prescibed chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse to treat your gingivitis, to help reduce the redness and swelling of your gums, and also to help you control any gum bleeding. Use chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse regularly, as directed by your dentist, in addition to daily brushing. Spit out after use, chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be swallowed.

If you develop allergic symptoms such as skin rash, itch, generalized swelling, breathing difficulties, light headedness, rapid heart rate, upset stomach, or diarrhea, seek medical attention immediately. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used by persons who have a sensitivity to it or its components.

Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse may cause some tooth discoloration, or increase in tartar (calculus) formation, particularly in areas where stain and tartar usually form. It is important to see your dentist for removal of any stain or tartar at least every six months or more frequently if your dentist advises.

Both stain and tartar can be removed by your dentist or hygienist. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse may cause permanent discoloration of some front-tooth fillings.
To minimize discoloration, you should brush and floss daily, emphasizing areas which begin to discolor.
Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse may taste bitter to some patients and can affect how foods and beverages taste. This will become less noticeable in most cases with continued use of chlorexidine gluconate oral rinse.
To avoid taste interference, rinse with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse after meals. Do not rinse with water or other mouthwashes immediately after rinsing with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.

If you have any questions or comments about chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse, contact your dentist or pharmacist. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Xttrium Laboratories at 1-800-587-3721 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

PRECAUTIONS

PRECAUTIONS

General:

For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used as a major indicator of underlying periodontitis.
Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restorations, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in toothstaining. In clinical testing, 56% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users exhibited a measurable increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months; 15% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis. Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these surfaces by a dental prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations.
Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use have been reported via post-marketing product surveillance.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects

Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

### Oral health and healthy ageing: a scoping review [^0c757d53]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The studies included in this review reported the benefits of application of antimicrobial agents or varnishes, such as fluoride, sliver diamine fluoride, chlorhexidine varnish, or fluoride and chlorhexidine combined, in the prevention of root caries. However, results regarding effectiveness of application of different antimicrobial agents reported in various RCTs/systematic reviews are inconsistent. A systematic review (n = 6 studies) looking at the effect of chlorhexidine varnish found little or no additional effect to professional cleaning and good home oral hygiene. Nonetheless, the meta-analysis of only three studies showed benefit for high-risk patients, such as the elderly with dry mouth. Similarly, results from a systematic review of RCTs (n = 3) supports the effectiveness of sliver diamine fluoride in prevention of root caries in older population.

### Association of chlorhexidine use and scaling and root planing with birth outcomes in pregnant individuals with periodontitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^719d0070]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Another limitation was that adherence with chlorhexidine mouthwash was not reported in any of the studies. In 3 of 5 studies evaluating preterm birth, the investigators provided the participants chlorhexidine mouthwash, while in the other 2, participants were advised to use it. This could be a source of heterogeneity in the studies that used chlorhexidine. Another methodologic shortcoming of the RCTs was that they varied in size and were too small for assessment of potential effect modification by other factors, such as oral health status at baseline, which could help identify participants most likely to benefit from the intervention if it was indeed effective. Apart from the study conducted by Newnham and colleaguesin Australia among mostly well-educated White participants with possibly less severe periodontal disease, the remaining 4 studies that used chlorhexidine mouthwash were conducted in less affluent communities among participants with poor oral health, possibly contributing to heterogeneity. Indeed, such observations have been interpreted to suggest that individuals at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes due to income inequality and racial and ethnic disparitiesor residence in low-resource settingsmay differentially benefit more from interventions targeting reductions in oral infection and inflammation.

### Chlorhexidine vs routine foot washing to prevent diabetic foot ulcers: a randomized clinical trial [^fce852f0]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Foot ulcers are a common and feared complication for people with diabetes. In the US, more than 1 in 10 adults have diabetes. Each year 1 in 20 people with diabetes develop a foot ulcer, with 20% of these individuals going on to have a lower extremity amputation, which can decrease their mobility and independence.

People who recover from a diabetic foot ulcer are considered in remission. They are at high risk for ulcer recurrence because the comorbidities underlying their ulcer have not changed. The pathway to ulceration is well established. A foot ulcer typically begins with minor trauma to the foot in a patient with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The minor skin trauma fails to heal due to the complications of diabetes, resulting in a skin ulcer. The ulcer leads to infection, which often results in an amputation.

The role of the skin microbiota in the development of foot ulcers is unknown. Multiple skin disorders and infections are hypothesized to result from imbalance in the microbiota and the host inflammatory and immune responses. Impaired wound healing is hypothesized to be, in part, associated with dysregulated inflammation and microbial colonization, suggesting a possible mechanism by which the skin microbiota could promote faulty wound healing after a minor trauma leading to a foot ulcer. Prior work has shown that the feet of veterans with diabetes have an increased Staphylococcus aureus load compared with the feet of veterans without diabetes. If so, altering the skin microbiota of the feet could reduce the risk of foot ulcer recurrence.

Topical chlorhexidine can reduce the bacterial and fungal load, including skin pathogens such as S aureus. It is a broad-spectrum, commonly used antiseptic agent with an excellent safety profile. It prevents health care–associated infections, such as central line–associated bacteremia, after iatrogenic skin breakdown through reducing the microbial load on the skin. Thus, we conducted a clinical trial with the objective of evaluating the effect of daily foot care using chlorhexidine wipes vs soap-and-water wipes for 1 year on the risk of developing new foot complications (including chronic foot ulcer, foot infection, or foot amputation) in veterans with diabetes. We also aimed to determine if the chlorhexidine intervention increased chlorhexidine resistance in diabetic foot infection pathogens.

### Poor oral health is associated with social vulnerability in critically ill trauma patients [^7ad9afad]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Social factors of health and social vulnerability have been found to be correlated with poor outcomes in the trauma surgery population. Phelos et al, using three national social vulnerability indices surveying 3,137 US counties, noted that increased social vulnerability in trauma patients was associated with increased fatality rates overall. Furthermore, poor oral health, and the local inflammatory response associated with periodontitis, have been connected with the progression of chronic inflammatory diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory disease. Poor oral health has also been linked to acute conditions such as VAP. Data from our institution showed that poor oral health was associated with a 79% probability of increased odds of developing VAP (OR 1.40, 95% CrI 0.64–3.17) and 96% probability of developing healthcare-associated pneumonia (OR 1.84, 95% CrI 0.93–3.70). Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, poor oral health in COVID-19 patients was found to be coupled with increased rates of ICU admissions, need for mechanical ventilation, and death.

Oral health may be a modifiable risk factor. Dental plaque rapidly accumulates in critically ill patients if there is poor oral care, resulting in changes in the oral microbiome and colonization of VAP pathogens. Treatment with antimicrobial agents to induce good oral hygiene may reverse some outcomes. For example, oral chlorhexidine has broad antimicrobial properties and reduces dental plaque formation, with multiple systematic reviews of well-conducted randomized controlled trials showing reductions in VAP. Additionally, meta-analysis showed that chlorhexidine decreased the risk of VAP from 26% to 18% (relative risk 0.67, 95% CIs 0.47 to 0.97; p = 0.03). Other oral health hygiene regimens such as oral povidone iodine, toothbrushing, and saline rinses have also been shown to decrease the risk of VAP. Strict attention to effective oral hygiene in the ICU may result in improved oral health and, thus, better and more equitable overall outcomes.

### Oral mucosal adverse events with chlorhexidine 2% mouthwash in ICU [^eea10c6f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

Oral care using a chlorhexidine solution is commonly used as an infection prevention measure in European ICUs. The preventive effects of different decontamination strategies, one of which is mouthwash with chlorhexidine digluconate 2% (CHX 2%), on the incidence of ICU-acquired bacteremia with multidrug-resistant bacteria is being investigated in a multicenter cluster-randomized study in 13 ICUs in six European countries [NCT02208154] (see Supplementary Material for detailed methods). An unexpected high incidence of oral mucosal lesions was observed in ICU patients receiving CHX 2%.

Oral mucosal lesions, including erosive lesions, ulcerations, white/yellow plaque formation, and bleeding mucosa were observed in 29 of 295 patients (9.8%) that had received CHX 2% in the first two hospitals testing this intervention (Supplementary Table S1, Pictures 1–4). The median time to onset of oral lesions was 8.0 days (IQR 4.5–11.0) in the 24 patients in whom duration of exposure could be ascertained. CHX 2% was discontinued prematurely in 16/29 cases and oral mucosal lesions disappeared after cessation of CHX 2% in all patients.

Patient characteristics were comparable for the baseline (n = 310) and CHX 2% periods (n = 295; Supplementary Table S2) for the two ICUs. During the baseline period CHX 0.20 and 0.12% were used for oral care in hospitals A and B, respectively, without evidence of oral lesions in any patient. All other procedures related to oral care remained identical in each hospital during both periods.

Amongst the CHX 2% treated patients, occurrence of side effects was associated with male gender, APACHE II score, length of stay in the ICU, and duration of mechanical ventilation, suggesting a dose-response relationship, with increasing risks of oral mucosal lesions for the more severely ill patients, undergoing mechanical ventilation, and receiving CHX 2% for longer periods (Table 1). This hypothesis is supported by the localization of the lesions in the oral cavity; most lesions occurred where stasis of the mouthwash might have occurred — despite suctioning after administration — such as below the tongue and in the buccal pockets.

### The effect of chlorhexidine on the oral microbiome and saliva in… [^62b923fa]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Dental erosion happens when the teeth lose some of their parts because of acid from the things people eat and/or drink or even from stomach. It can make teeth hurt and become sensitive. The mouth has a protective shield called salivary pellicle that helps, and there are some special bacteria called Nitrate-reducing bacteria that can be good for the mouth and heart. Eating some fruits and vegetables or drinking beetroot can make these bacteria thrive, which might help the heart and blood pressure. This study wants to see how administering chlorhexidine mouthwash affects the good bacteria in the mouth for people with healthy teeth and those with erosion. This study aims to find out if this mouthwash can change the saliva and bacteria in the mouth for the better, in people with both healthy teeth and those with dental erosion.

The proposed study is part of a PhD educational project and will be a double blind, randomised design, crossover trial for the effect of Chlorhexidine mouthwash on healthy control and people with dental erosion. This study aims to explore mouthwash's effect on oral microbiome recovery in WMS and salivary pellicle and its impact on blood pressure and arterial stiffness in healthy controls PwDE. Based on power calculation, 14 individuals will be recruited for each group to account for a 14% drop-out rate. After the oral assessment and completing all forms and questionnaires, participants will be assigned to two groups of participants.

Within each group, the twelve participants will be randomly and blindly assigned to further two subgroups by an independent researcher to receive one of the mouthwash treatments as can be seen in the attached protocol. Specifically, the 6 participants from each group who had administered placebo CHX mouthwash before visit 2 will be given same amount of antibacterial mouthwash containing 0. 2% CHX to be administered in the same conditions as explained above with the final tube taken the morning before their next visit.
