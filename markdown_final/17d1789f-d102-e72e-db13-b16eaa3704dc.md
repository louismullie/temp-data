## Question

create an emergency intubation checklist for immediate use at the bedside

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an emergency intubation checklist for immediate bedside use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why a checklist is needed. Then, I should verify the evidence base for checklists in emergency intubation. Next, I will define design principles for usability under stress. After that, I will structure the checklist into logical phases with concise, actionable items. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios, implementation tips, and a succinct final version, while double-checking that each element aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. Emergency intubation outside the operating room is high risk, with higher rates of hypoxemia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest than in theater, and the risk is amplified by human factors such as cognitive load, time pressure, and team variability, so a standardized checklist can mitigate preventable errors and improve process reliability [^ef31360c] [^b6c89e48].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base before I overstate benefits. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that checklist use is associated with fewer hypoxic events during intubation, though mortality and first-pass success are not consistently improved, and a multicenter RCT did not show differences in oxygenation or blood pressure with a verbalized checklist, likely due to content and implementation factors rather than the concept itself, so I should be cautious and emphasize process and safety endpoints rather than mortality claims [^f5acb2ca] [^2f0bb53a] [^9d1a776a].

> I need to ensure the design principles fit the emergency environment. The checklist should be short, visually scannable, and organized by phase to support a shared mental model; it should be usable by teams of varying expertise and available in both paper and electronic formats, with explicit role assignment and closed-loop communication prompts, because usability testing and implementation science show these features improve adherence and team performance under stress [^502799e5] [^f8e998b1] [^221f0e45].

> Let me think about the pre-intubation phase. I should confirm patient identification, indication, and airway risk assessment using a validated tool like MACOCHA, then verify hemodynamic stability and preoxygenation strategy, including high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation for hypoxemic patients, and ensure a plan for physiologic optimization and contingency steps if deterioration occurs, since these steps reduce peri-intubation hypoxemia and collapse [^bc4cfbba] [^675213e7] [^ef31360c].

> Hold on, I should verify the equipment and personnel section. The checklist should prompt a standardized equipment setup with video laryngoscope, bougie or stylet, supraglottic airway, and a surgical airway kit, with explicit confirmation of functioning suction, waveform capnography, and ventilator readiness, and it should specify team roles including intubator, airway assistant, medication administrator, and a runner, because equipment omissions and role confusion are common contributors to failure [^449788b0] [^bc4cfbba] [^501ba386].

> Next, I will examine the pharmacology and physiology optimization items. I should confirm induction agent selection tailored to hemodynamics, with ketamine or etomidate as common choices in shock states, and verify paralytic dosing and timing, while also prompting vasopressor preparation and pre-intubation fluids for unstable patients, since cardiovascular collapse during induction is frequent and preventable with forethought [^c4348be9] [^ef31360c] [^196bd544].

> I will now consider the intubation execution phase. The checklist should cue optimal positioning, apneic oxygenation, first-pass optimization with video laryngoscopy and adjuncts, and a declared plan B and C if difficulty arises, with a hard stop after two attempts to reassess oxygenation, ventilation, and strategy, because multiple attempts drive complications and a structured escalation plan mitigates harm [^7c8a5355] [^ef31360c] [^5228bec5].

> But wait, what if the patient is COVID-19 suspected or confirmed. I should add aerosol precautions, minimize room staff, and use airborne PPE with a kit-dump mat and sealed equipment strategy, and I should confirm that the team rehearses these steps in simulation to reduce exposure and delays, as pandemic guidance and implementation reports emphasize these adaptations [^bc4cfbba] [^59f6aa22] [^526d8445].

> Let me reconsider pediatric considerations. I should ensure age-appropriate tube sizes, cuffed tubes in children, and a weight-based medication dosing prompt, and I should align the checklist with pediatric-specific safety bundles and expert consensus items for ED pediatric intubation, because pediatric airway anatomy and medication errors differ and require tailored prompts [^a2c1c772] [^44951876] [^7c8a5355].

> I should double-check the post-intubation phase. The checklist should prompt immediate confirmation with waveform capnography, auscultation, and chest rise, secure the tube at the right depth, initiate lung-protective ventilation, obtain an arterial blood gas within 60 minutes, and debrief the team to capture what went well and what to improve, as these steps reduce unrecognized esophageal intubation, ventilator-induced lung injury, and latent errors [^c499d82c] [^213fc180] [^bc4cfbba].

> Next, I should review implementation tactics to sustain use. Visibility is key, so laminated copies on airway carts, integration into EMR workflows, and training with simulation can improve uptake; leadership endorsement and peer champions address motivational barriers, and periodic audits with feedback close the loop, as quality improvement studies show these strategies increase adherence over time [^95cf257b] [^c46c11c6] [^221f0e45].

> Hold on, I should verify that the final checklist is concise and actionable. A one-page, phase-based layout with checkboxes, bold headers, and no more than 10–12 items per phase balances completeness with usability; pilot testing and iterative refinement based on frontline feedback ensure it remains practical across settings and teams [^502799e5] [^f8e998b1].

> Final emergency intubation checklist (one-page, phase-based):

> Pre-intubation (patient and team):
>
> - Identify patient and confirm indication > - Assess airway risk (MACOCHA or equivalent)
> - Evaluate hemodynamics and shock index > - Preoxygenate (HFNC or NIV if hypoxemic)
> - Assign roles: intubator, assistant, medications, runner > - State plan A, B, C aloud > Preparation (equipment and drugs):
>
> - Video laryngoscope ready with spare blade > - Bougie/stylet and extra tubes (cuffed, sizes)
> - Supraglottic airway and surgical airway kit > - Functioning suction and waveform capnography > - Ventilator set and checked > - Induction agent and paralytic dosed and labeled > - Vasopressor and fluids prepared if unstable > Execution (procedure):
>
> - Position head-elevated/ramped > - Apneic oxygenation during laryngoscopy > - First-pass optimization with VL and adjuncts > - Declare failure after two attempts, escalate > - Confirm tube with capnography, auscultation, chest rise > - Secure tube and document depth > Post-intubation (confirmation and stabilization):
>
> - Initiate lung-protective ventilation > - Obtain ABG within 60 minutes > - Sedation and analgesia titrated > - Debrief team and document plan

### Intubation checklist for COVID-19 patients: a practical tool for bedside practitioners [^59f6aa22]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The high frequency of aerosolizing procedures in the ICU, including endotracheal intubation, places clinical staff at elevated risk of contracting the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19). Use of an intubation checklist can reduce exposure risk and thus acts as a potential safeguard. Specific, step-by-step guidance to perform safe endotracheal intubation in the setting of COVID-19 are limited. This article outlines the development and refinement of a COVID-19 intubation checklist and operational protocol for ICU staff at a single center in the United States.

Methods

A standard pre-intubation checklist was adapted and refined by consensus using a multidisciplinary and iterative process, then distributed to local staff for clinical use. Subsequent mock intubation training sessions were held using the new checklist to ensure proficiency. Planned debriefing sessions helped identify several previously unanticipated issues, allowing for further refinement of the intubation checklist and inclusion of all stakeholders.

Results

A COVID-19 intubation checklist helped optimize safety during a high-risk situation by minimizing aerosolization of secretions, the number of staff required in the room, the time spent in the room, and the frequency of donning/doffing personal protective equipment.

Conclusions

We present a checklist for use during high-risk intubations of COVID-19 patients, which serves as a pragmatic bedside tool for clinicians. The process of checklist development may also serve as a model for facilities preparing their own pandemic protocols.

### Association of checklist use in endotracheal intubation with clinically important outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^33f00604]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a frequently used life-saving procedure. In the US annually, 15 million operating room intubations and 650 000 hospital intubations outside the operating room are performed, including 346 000 emergency department (ED) intubations. Despite its frequency, ETI is a high-risk procedure, with significant rates of respiratory complications, hemodynamic instability, and cardiac arrest. Interventions to improve the safety and success of ETI could thus have a substantial effect on public health. Checklists are a form of cognitive strategy intended to force operators to ensure appropriate preparation before a procedure. Checklists have been associated with improved outcomes in multiple aspects of health care, and have been endorsed as a means to reduce complications during ETI.,

The theoretical benefits of checklist use must be balanced with potential risks. Checklist adoption often faces numerous barriers and may require a substantial investment of time and resources. Checklist fatigue may occur with checklist endorsement for multiple different procedures. Furthermore, checklists are not universally correlated with improved outcomes, and, in some cases, have even been associated with harm. This study evaluated the association between checklist use and clinical outcomes after ETI.

### Increasing use of an endotracheal intubation safety checklist in the emergency department [^1784fc23]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Background

Checklists are tools which list action points in a systematic manner and set order. They ensure all items on the list are accounted for and therefore reduce reliance on individual memory, promote standardisation of best practice and reduce error. Because of this, they have found utility within high-reliability organisations such those in nuclear power, aerospace, engineering, firefighting and, most famously, aviation. In healthcare, the use of checklists to promote safety during high-risk interventions is well established, such as during surgery or central venous catheter insertion. There are often barriers to checklist implementation and use. Many of these are sociological or cultural in origin. For example, there can be a sense that independence and expertise are not being fully used in deferring to the step-by-step tick-box approach a checklist offers, or they can be perceived as simply a tool used to satisfy governance requirements without accounting for the varying complexity of different cases. Also, they can be perceived to further complicate situations that are already complex.

ETI of the critically unwell patient appears an ideal situation for a checklist to be of benefit. Its potential lies in ensuring the correct personnel, drugs, equipment and monitoring are available, and that the patient is physiologically optimised for a successful procedure. Locally, many NHS Trusts within the North West of England promote use of the B@EASE checklist. An alternative intubation checklist available is that produced by the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, based on the National Safety Standards for Invasive Procedures framework, and they encourage NHS organisations to further modify this to suit local requirements. The checklist available for use at our Trust is such a modification. There is also evidence of organisations developing their own checklistor modifying template checklists available from national or international organisations.

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are available looking at ETI in the ED setting in non-trauma patients. One preinterventional/postinterventional study showed that use of a checklist in trauma patients consisting of 'prearrival' and 'preintubation' sections reduced paralysis-to-intubation time and intubation-related complications. Another preinterventional/postinterventional quality improvement study performed in the paediatric population showed that a bundle of interventions in the ED had good uptake and increased intubation first-pass success rate without hypoxia or hypotension. This included use of a checklist, used in 93% of cases, but it is hard to determine the impact of this individual part of the bundle on the reduced complication rates seen.

### Sustained improvement in tracheal intubation safety across a 15-center quality-improvement collaborative: an interventional study from the national emergency airway registry for children investigators [^5c7e115c]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of a tracheal intubation safety bundle on adverse tracheal intubation-associated events across 15 PICUs.

Design

Multicenter time-series study.

Setting

PICUs in the United States.

Patients

All patients received tracheal intubations in ICUs.

Interventions

We implemented a tracheal intubation safety bundle as a quality-improvement intervention that includes: 1) quarterly site benchmark performance report and 2) airway safety checklists (preprocedure risk factor, approach, and role planning, preprocedure bedside "time-out", and immediate postprocedure debriefing). We define each quality-improvement phase as baseline (-24 to -12 mo before checklist implementation), benchmark performance reporting only (-12 to 0 mo before checklist implementation), implementation (checklist implementation start to time achieving > 80% bundle adherence), early bundle adherence (0–12 mo), and sustained (late) bundle adherence (12–24 mo). Bundle adherence was defined a priori as greater than 80% of checklist use for tracheal intubations for 3 consecutive months.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was the adverse tracheal intubation-associated event, and secondary outcomes included severe tracheal intubation-associated events, multiple tracheal intubation attempts, and hypoxemia less than 80%. From January 2013 to December 2015, out of 19 participating PICUs, 15 ICUs (79%) achieved bundle adherence. Among the 15 ICUs, the adverse tracheal intubation-associated event rates were baseline phase: 217/1,241 (17.5%), benchmark reporting only phase: 257/1,750 (14.7%), early 0–12 month complete bundle compliance phase: 247/1,591 (15.5%), and late 12–24 month complete bundle compliance phase: 137/1,002 (13.7%). After adjusting for patient characteristics and clustering by site, the adverse tracheal intubation-associated event rate significantly decreased compared with baseline: benchmark: odds ratio, 0.83 (0.72–0.97; p = 0.016); early bundle: odds ratio, 0.80 (0.63–1.02; p = 0.074); and late bundle odds ratio, 0.63 (0.47–0.83; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Effective implementation of a quality-improvement bundle was associated with a decrease in the adverse tracheal intubation-associated event that was sustained for 24 months.

### Association of checklist use in endotracheal intubation with clinically important outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fa9f3c83]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

Figure 1 outlines the flow of study identification. The initial database search returned 1649 unique citations. After screening of titles and abstracts, 1607 citations were excluded, and 42 articles underwent full-text review, with 11 meeting inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion are listed in Figure 1. We requested clarification about inclusion criteria from the authors of 2 studies. Both studies described the use of an intubating protocol without specifying whether a checklist was used. We were able to confirm that a checklist was used in the study by Corl et al, but we were unable to confirm the use of a checklist for the other study, which was thus excluded.

Figure 1.
Study Identification

Characteristics of Studies and Patients

Across the 11 included studies, there were a total of 3261 ETIs performed in 13 institutions in 6 countries. Table 1 gives the characteristics of the individual studies. Seven studies, were conducted in the ED, 3 studies, in the ICU, and 1 studyin both the operating room and ICU. Only 1 (ICU-based) studywas a randomized clinical trial. Eight studies, used a before-and-after observational design, with 6 studies, being prospective and 2 studies, being retrospective. The remaining 2 studies, were prospective case series. None of the observational studies attempted to correct for baseline differences between groups. Five studies, included significant cointerventions (such as health care professional education, equipment changes, health care professional team modeling, and medication changes) in addition to a checklist. Preintubation checklist details were reported in 8 studies, and were heterogeneous. Most checklists included assessment of preoxygenation and medication, but other checklist components were inconsistent (eTable in the Supplement).

### Increasing use of an endotracheal intubation safety checklist in the emergency department [^95cf257b]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a high-risk procedure often performed in the emergency department (ED) in critically unwell patients. The fourth National Audit Project by The Royal College of Anaesthetists found the risk of adverse events is much higher when performing the intervention in this setting compared with a theatre suite, and therefore use of a safety checklist is recommended. This quality improvement project was set in a large teaching hospital in the North West of the UK, where anaesthesia and intensive care clinicians are responsible for performing this procedure. A retrospective baseline audit indicated checklist use was 16.7% of applicable cases. The project aim was to increase the incidence of checklist use in the ED to 90% within a 6-month period. The model for improvement was used as a methodological approach to the problem along with other quality improvement tools, including a driver diagram to generate change ideas. The interventions were targeted at three broad areas: awareness of the checklist and expectation of use, building a favourable view of the benefits of the checklist and increasing the likelihood it would be remembered to use the checklist in the correct moment. After implementation checklist use increased to 84%. In addition, run chart analysis indicated a pattern of nonrandom variation in the form of a shift. This coincided with the period shortly after the beginning of the interventions. The changes were viewed favourably by junior and senior anaesthetists, as well as operating department practitioners and ED staff. Limitations of the project were that some suitable cases were likely missed due to the method of capture and lack of anonymous qualitative feedback on the changes made. Overall, however, it was shown the combination of low-cost interventions made was effective in increasing checklist use when performing emergency ETI in the ED.

### BET 2: should real resuscitationists use airway checklists? [^7b9fd0a0]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether the use of preprocedural checklists prior to intubation of critically ill patients outside a theatre environment can reduce the incidence of adverse events. Four directly relevant papers were found using the reported search strategy and presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. It is concluded that preprocedural checklists may reduce adverse events in these patients, but that the evidence level is low and further matched cohort studies are needed to prove effectiveness.

### Increasing use of an endotracheal intubation safety checklist in the emergency department [^166ec71f]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

A similar non-theatre environment where ETI takes place is the ICU. Despite the presumed advantages, evidence looking at the benefits of a pre-ETI checklist in the ICU is mixed. A reduction in incidence of severe hypoxaemia and cardiovascular collapse has been demonstrated. In contrast a multicentre RCT showed no difference in lowest oxygen saturations, systolic lowest blood pressure, procedure duration or number of life-threatening complications.

Overall, it is assumed there is potential for benefit in using a pre-ETI checklist in the ED and this is recognised by the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA). Therefore, use of a checklist is both a recommendation from the fourth National Audit Projectand a required standard for Anaesthesia Clinical Services Accreditation (ACSA).

### Prioritising intubator safety in a pandemic: the details matter [^526d8445]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Our ED-intensive care unit has instituted a new protocol meant to maximise the safety of physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists involved with endotracheal intubation of patients known or suspected of being infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2. The level of detail involved with this checklist is a deviation from standard intubation practices and is likely unfamiliar to most emergency physicians. However, the two-person system used in our department removes the cognitive burden such complexity would otherwise demand and minimises the number of participants that would typically be exposed during endotracheal intubation. We share this checklist to demonstrate to other departments how adopting international airway guidelines to a specific institution can be achieved in order to promote healthcare worker safety.

### Development of a paediatric airway management checklist for the emergency department: a modified Delphi approach [^a2c1c772]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Airway management checklists have improved paediatric patient safety in some clinical settings, but consensus on the appropriate components to include on a checklist for paediatric tracheal intubation in the ED is lacking.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 14 experts in airway management within and outside of paediatric emergency medicine participated in a modified Delphi approach to develop consensus on the appropriate components for a paediatric airway management checklist for the ED. Panel members reviewed, modified and added to the components from the National Emergency Airway Registry for Children airway safety checklist for paediatric intensive care units using a 9-point appropriateness scale. Components with a median score of 7.0–9.0 and a 25th percentile score ≥ 7.0 achieved consensus for inclusion. A priori, the modified Delphi method was limited to a maximum of two rounds for consensus on essential components and one additional round for checklist creation.

Results

All experts participated in both rounds. Consensus was achieved on 22 components. Twelve were original candidate items and 10 were newly suggested or modified items. Consensus components included the following categories: patient assessment and plan (5 items), patient preparation (5 items), pharmacy (2 items), equipment (7 items) and personnel (3 items). The components were formatted into a 17-item clinically usable checklist.

Conclusions

Using the modified Delphi method, consensus was established among airway management experts around essential components for an airway management checklist intended for paediatric tracheal intubation in the ED.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: intubation of the critically ill child presenting to the emergency department [^44951876]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Intubation of critically ill children presenting to the emergency department is a high-risk procedure. Our article aims to offer a step-by-step guide as to how to plan and execute a rapid, successful intubation in a way that minimises risk of adverse events and patient harm. We address considerations such as the need for adequate resuscitation before intubation and selection of equipment and personnel. We also discuss drug choice for induction and peri-intubation instability, difficult airway considerations as well as postintubation care. Focus is also given on the value of preintubation checklists, both in terms of equipment selection and in the context of staff role designation and intubation plan clarity. Finally, in cases of failed intubation, we recommend the application of the Vortex approach, highlighting, thus, the importance of avoiding task fixation and maintaining our focus on what matters most: adequate oxygenation.

Quality Appraisals

Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using 2 different quality assessment tools. Randomized clinical trials were assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. In brief, each study was assigned a high, low, or unclear risk of bias in each of 7 domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and caregivers, blinding of outcome assessors, attrition bias, incomplete outcome bias, and other bias. Observational studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. This scale assigns up to 4 points for low risk of bias in the domain of selection of patients and comparators, 2 possible points for comparability, and 3 possible points for low risk of bias in determination of exposure. Studies are thus awarded between 0 and 9 points, with higher scores indicating lower risk of bias. Each study underwent quality assessment by 2 of us (S.L.P. B.R.H.) independently, with disagreements resolved through discussion.

Data Extraction

Two of us (J.S.T. A.W.B.) independently extracted data from each study. Data abstracted included year of publication, country, clinical setting, study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, components of used checklists, number of patients, comparator interventions, and primary outcomes. For each study, the number of patients with and without each of our predefined outcomes was calculated for patients for whom a checklist was used and for the control group. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. In cases of missing data or need for clarification, we contacted corresponding authors of the original studies.

### Increasing use of an endotracheal intubation safety checklist in the emergency department [^c46c11c6]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

ETI in a non-theatre setting such as ED should involve the use of a checklist to minimise the likelihood of adverse events. Our project has shown that as well as changes made to the availability and visibility of the checklists, interventions seeking to positively influence psychological factors involved in deciding to use a checklist can lead to an increase in use. The target of 90% use was set as it was recognised a small number of cases may be so extremely emergent that there would be no opportunity to pause for a checklist run-through, although it could be argued the structured approach a checklist brings is of greater importance in such cases. Although overall 90% was not reached, our data suggest improvement still occurred. It appears use of the checklist has been initially sustained for 3 months beyond the end of the last intervention, and it is likely this was because the interventions sought to engage permanent members of staff, in particular, anaesthetic and ICU consultants, and ODPs. It is yet to be seen whether this will continue on a longer term. Regular reaudit is planned, although this is likely to be at a lower frequency than performed in the project so far. A drop in use seen in such a reaudit would act as a trigger for a further period of intensive improvement efforts. Further interventions generated by the driver diagram, not yet implemented, are available to be trialled if use declines.

We believe similar projects could be performed in other organisations at little cost. Changes to checklist availability and visibility would be relatively easy to make, but determining precisely what is best would depend on the layout of individual EDs and resuscitation bays. Attempting to foster positive attitudes towards a checklist is likely to be more challenging. Our experience in this project suggests it is possible by engaging respected senior colleagues to publicly promote the intervention and to build positive cultural momentum. This is congruent with other evidence that checklist implementation often fails without strong leadership championing it. Ultimately, such work would need to be tailored to local circumstances and would unlikely be a direct replica of our project.

Project driver diagram. ED, emergency department; ICU, intensive care unit; ODP, operating department practitioner.

There were two points in the project where our opinion of the causes of the problem were shared with others, to see if they agreed or not. The first was on presenting the problem to the hospital's anaesthetics and intensive care department, and the second was on presenting to the ED resuscitation group. On both occasions, we found the discussions aligned well with what we had already determined around the three key areas which constituted the primary drivers, and we decided not to further alter our approach.

The interventions made were

Increasing awareness of the problem and conveying expectation of checklist use among anaesthetics and ICU medical staff.
Improving visibility and availability of checklists in ED by rationalising those available to the Trust's own checklist, changing where they were kept as well as considering reminder triggers.
Empowering ODPs and anaesthetic/ICU trainee doctors to use the checklist and to advocate its use to senior staff

### Tracheal intubation in the critically ill. where we came from and where we should Go [^ef31360c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Tracheal intubation is commonly performed in critically ill patients. Unfortunately, this procedure also carries a high risk of complications; half of critically ill patients with difficult airways experience life-threatening complications. The high complication rates stem from difficulty with laryngoscopy and tube placement, consequences of physiologic derangement, and human factors, including failure to recognize and reluctance to manage the failed airway. The last 10 years have seen a rapid expansion in devices available that help overcome anatomic difficulties with laryngoscopy and provide rescue oxygenation in the setting of failed attempts. Recent research in critically ill patients has highlighted other important considerations for critically ill patients and evaluated interventions to reduce the risks with repeated attempts, desaturation, and cardiovascular collapse during emergency airway management. There are three actions that should be implemented to reduce the risk of danger: 1) preintubation assessment for potential difficulty (e.g. MACOCHA score); 2) preparation and optimization of the patient and team for difficulty-including using a checklist, acquiring necessary equipment, maximizing preoxygenation, and hemodynamic optimization; and 3) recognition and management of failure to restore oxygenation and reduce the risk of cardiopulmonary arrest. This review describes the history of emergency airway management and explores the challenges with modern emergency airway management in critically ill patients. We offer clinically relevant recommendations on the basis of current evidence, guidelines, and expert opinion.

### Non-invasive airway management of comatose poisoned… [^bdd4bdae]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive Airway Management of Comatose Poisoned Emergency Patients ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview A decreased level of consciousness is a common reason for presentation to the emergency department and is often the result of intoxication admission). However, whether this risk of aspiration pneumonia may be decreased by early intubation is unknown, and no difference in the risk of AP was reported between patients that were intubated early and patients who were not. Although it is well established that in trauma patients, a GCS ≤ 8 mandates airway management by endotracheal intubation, it remains unknown whether this strategy should be applied to other etiologies of coma, in particular for acute poisoned patients. Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation allow to prevent aspiration pneumonia, to optimize oxygenation and gas exchange.

Acute poisoning is a common reason for presentation to the ED or MICU intervention admission). These patients are often intubated, when their GCS is below 8, in order to protect their airways. However there is currently no clear demonstration of its efficacy in this specific target population, while it is known that intubation is associated with morbidity and mortality. Intubated patients need subsequent intensive care unit admission and invasive monitoring, and this can be associated with increased risk of pulmonary complications, length of hospital-stay, nosocomial infections and cost. In a context of expenditures control in health care, appropriate intensive care resource utilization is an important issue.

When considering the increasing demand for intensive care among emergency patients, the importance of health care resource allocation and expenditure control, and the possible absence benefit of intubation and intensive care, an endotracheal airway management of poisoned coma patients might be detrimental.
- Age ≥ 18 years
- Clinical suspicion of acute poisoning
- Decreased level of consciousness with a GCS ≤ 8 assessed by an emergency physician either in the ED or in the out of hospital field with the mobile intensive care unit.
- Written informed consent signed by the patient / the trustworthy person / family member / close relative or inclusion in case of emergency.

### Increasing use of an endotracheal intubation safety checklist in the emergency department [^b6c89e48]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Problem

Critically ill patients in the emergency department (ED) often require endotracheal intubation (ETI) via rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia (RSI). This is a high-risk intervention with potential adverse consequences, including inability to oxygenate and subsequent hypoxic organ injury, aspiration of stomach contents, cardiovascular collapse, cardiac arrest and death. The risk of such sequelae is 30 times greater performing the procedure in ED than in the operating theatre. Contributing factors include not identifying potential difficulty prior to the procedure, not assembling the correct equipment, failure to determine backup plans in case of failure and intubation by personnel without sufficient experience. It has been suggested that the use of an intubation checklist would be beneficial to provide a structured approach to the procedure and to allow cognitive offload in potentially high-stress circumstances.

This project was undertaken at a teaching hospital in the North West of England providing acute secondary care to a population of approximately 530 000 people, with many living in some of the most socially deprived areas in the country. There are approximately 700 inpatient beds, of which 54 are paediatrics and 24 are adult critical care. Emergency ETI is often undertaken in the critically unwell patient within the eight-bay resuscitation area of the ED. This is nearly always performed by a doctor from the anaesthetics or intensive care unit (ICU) teams, assisted by an operating department practitioner (ODP). Although use of an intubation checklist in this setting is recommended by the Royal College of Anaesthetistsand is trust policy, it was suspected by the authors that the checklist available was not being widely used.

The aim of this project was for a preintubation safety checklist to be used in 90% of intubation attempts made in the ED by 31 October 2019, which was 6 months from completion of the initial retrospective audit. The model for improvement was determined to be the most appropriate methodological approach.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^462c2e5d]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

Consider endotracheal intubation (ETI) — indications and first-pass optimization are specified as follows: When less-invasive methods (two-person BVM, SGA placement) are ineffective or inappropriate, and if the patient's clinical course is expected to decline and require protection, intubation may be indicated. Preoxygenation and resuscitation prior to intubation are critical to patient safety. Because multiple ETI attempts contribute to complications and poor patient outcomes, consider the following to increase first pass success: use of a checklist, optimal patient positioning, video laryngoscopy, bougie (if standard geometry laryngoscope), and using the most experienced EMS clinician.

### Randomized trial of sedative choice for intubation (RSI) [^c4348be9]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Among critically ill adults, life-threatening complications during tracheal intubation and initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation remain common. One in five patients experiences hypotension and one-in-forty experiences cardiac arrest during the two-minute tracheal intubation procedure. Adherence to recommended best-practices for tracheal intubation are insufficient to prevent 20–40% of critically ill adults from experiencing cardiovascular collapse during tracheal intubation. Rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation, the most common method of intubation for critically ill patients, is the nearly simultaneous administration of a sedative medication and neuromuscular blocking medication. The ideal sedative agent for rapid sequence intubation would rapidly provide a deep state of unconsciousness and analgesia without causing hemodynamic side effects.

No available agent meets all of these criteria. The administration of any of the available sedative agents at a dose large enough to rapidly induce unconsciousness contributes to cardiovascular collapse through vasodilation, decreased cardiac filling pressures from sedation-induced venodilation, and decreased endogenous catecholamines. While all sedatives commonly used during emergency tracheal intubation of critically ill patients have been associated with unsatisfactory hypotension), ketamine and etomidate are the medications used most commonly in clinical practice due to their rapid onset and favorable hemodynamic profiles relative to the other available sedatives. Etomidate is an imidazole derivative that acts at gamma-aminobutyric acid "A" receptors. Etomidate has been approved by the FDA with an indication for "induction of general anesthesia.

" In a recent review of more than 19, 000 intubations by a large, multicenter emergency medicine registry, etomidate was the most commonly used sedative during emergency tracheal intubation. Because cardiovascular collapse is common during tracheal intubation of critically ill adults sedatives are a driver of cardiovascular collapse, use of ketamine or etomidate varies between centers, specialties, and operators, and prior data suggests the potential for ketamine to significantly decrease mortality for patients without trauma, a large, multicenter trial is needed to determine the effects of ketamine and etomidate on mortality in non-traumatic critical illness.

### Increasing use of an endotracheal intubation safety checklist in the emergency department [^268b161f]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

After November 2019, we intended for periodic reaudit to see if sustained use of the checklist had continued beyond what we considered the end of the implementation, for example, at 3 or 6 monthly intervals. At the time of writing, this has not yet been performed. Therefore, our ability to comment on the longer-term sustainability of our interventions is limited.

Information to help assess the impact of any of the individual interventions was limited. For example, in the first PDSA cycle to promote awareness of the checklist requirement, there was no formal prior assessment of existing awareness, or of knowledge areas around checklist use, before the intervention began. Retention of knowledge was also not assessed as the project progressed. This meant quantitative analysis, for example, of a before-and-after nature, of the educational interventions was not performed.

Similarly, the process changes made in the second cycle could have been monitored via a process measure in a longitudinal manner, such as the percentage of cases where the resuscitation trolley had been correctly stocked with checklists or the percentage of cases where a laminated checklist was available. The ability to capture these data was limited by the large number of potential individual staff members performing ETI and the low likelihood most of them would remember to check these during an emergent scenario. These data would have been useful in establishing the impact of those interventions, and if repeated, we would seek to design a way to also monitor this.

A formal investigation of reasons for the initial low incidence of checklist use was not undertaken either. After the driver diagram was created to break down the problem into what we believed to be the major problem areas, discussions were had with the anaesthetics department during the first PDSA cycle and the ED resuscitation group at the start of the second PDSA cycle, as described earlier. Discussions with these two groups served as a check that our initial assumptions around the causes of the problems were correct, but we recognise this is inferior to more formal approaches such as anonymous questionnaires or quantifying contributing factors to the problem via Pareto analysis. This is another area we would explore further if we were to repeat the project.

### A multicenter randomized trial of a checklist for endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults [^041365b7]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The study Check-UP Checklist was published by David R Janz and colleagues in 2018 in the journal Chest. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness and Endotracheal intubation. In the Check-UP Checklist study, the trial question was: what is the role of a verbal performance of a written preprocedural checklist in critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation? In the Check-UP Checklist study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Check-UP Checklist study, the population was: 262 patients (97 female, 165 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing endotracheal intubation. The key exclusion criteria were awake intubation planned; urgent requirement of intubation; treating clinicians felt a requirement of a specific pre-intubation checklist or patient positioning. In the Check-UP Checklist study, the interventions were: n = 130 checklist (a written, verbally performed, pre-intubation checklist) n = 132 usual care (no pre-intubation checklist). In the Check-UP Checklist study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in lowest SaO2 (92% vs. 93%; ARD -1, 95% CI -3.03 to 1.03). In the Check-UP Checklist study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in lowest SBP (112 mmHg vs. 108 mmHg; AD 4 mmHg, 95% CI -10.86 to 18.86) No significant difference in procedure duration (120 seconds vs. 118 seconds; AD 2 seconds, 95% CI -3.55 to 7.55) Borderline significant increase in the number of laryngoscopy attempts (1 attempt vs. 1 attempt;). In the Check-UP Checklist study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in severe life-threatening procedural complications, hospital death, aspiration, and airway trauma. In the Check-UP Checklist study, the conclusion was: in critically ill adult patients undergoing endotracheal intubation, checklist was not superior to usual care with respect to lowest SaO2.

Strategy

In the first PDSA cycle, the aim was to increase awareness of the expectation that a checklist should be used and of the existing problem that currently its use was rare. It was hypothesised this was the first barrier to checklist use that needed to be overcome to allow subsequent PDSA cycles a better chance of success. This was done via presentation at the anaesthetic and ICU department audit meeting, attended by 20 consultants, 5 staff grade doctors and 4 trainees. The evidence behind checklist use, their benefits and the importance of complying with guidance from RCoA (within the context of the fourth National Audit Project and ACSA) were discussed. The disappointing results of the initial audit of this project were also shared. After the presentation, the discussion was unanimously in favour of checklist use. Other feedback received indicated that many present at the meeting were unaware of the existence of a checklist and of the expectations around its use. It was also agreed that checklist use is a mandatory requirement. Following the meeting, an email was sent to the entire department to reinforce themes covered in the discussion, reaching 48 consultants, 11 staff grade doctors, 29 trainees and clinical fellows, and 1 critical care practitioner.

The problem was presented in a similar manner to a meeting of the ED resuscitation group. The second PDSA cycle was developed in this meeting, and subsequently by meeting with key ED staff. The aim was to improve accessibility and visibility of a physical checklist in resuscitation bays to act as a reminder in the correct moment to use it. This was believed to be important as even though the first PDSA cycle may have led to increased awareness of the checklist, it could be forgotten about in busy high-acuity situations. There were a mix of Trust and B@EASE checklists available, and these were rationalised to the former. A laminated checklist was attached to the outside of the resuscitation trolleys, which would always be available to be used verbally. In addition, paper checklists were stocked in the airway drawer of the trolley on top of airway equipment. Therefore, they would always be encountered before ETI. The checklist would be added to the equipment list used to restock the trolley to ensure they were always available. Feedback from ED staff was positive as it was believed the changes were quick and simple to undertake while bringing a large potential benefit.

### Association of checklist use in endotracheal intubation with clinically important outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f5acb2ca]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Endotracheal intubation of critically ill patients is a high-risk procedure. Checklists have been advocated to improve outcomes.

Objective

To assess whether the available evidence supports an association of use of airway checklists with improved clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation.

Data Sources

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed (OVID), Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and SCOPUS were searched without limitations using the Medical Subject Heading terms and keywords airway; management; airway management; intubation, intratracheal; checklist; and quality improvement to identify studies published between January 1, 1960, and June 1, 2019. A supplementary search of the gray literature was performed, including conference abstracts and clinical trial registries.

Study Selection

Full-text reviews were performed to determine final eligibility for inclusion. Included studies were randomized clinical trials or observational human studies that compared checklist use with any comparator for endotracheal intubation and assessed 1 of the predefined outcomes.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction and quality assessment were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized clinical trials. Study results were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. Reporting of this study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included first-pass success and known complications of endotracheal intubation, including esophageal intubation, hypoxia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.

Results

The search identified 1649 unique citations of which 11 (3261 patients) met the inclusion criteria. One randomized clinical trial and 3 observational studies had a low risk of bias. Checklist use was not associated with decreased mortality (5 studies [2095 patients]; relative risk, 0.97; 95% CI,0.80–1.18; I2 = 0%). Checklist use was associated with a decrease in hypoxic events (8 studies [3010 patients]; relative risk, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.95; I2 = 33%) but no other secondary outcomes. Studies with a low risk of bias did not demonstrate decreased hypoxia associated with checklist use.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that use of airway checklists is not associated with improved clinical outcomes during and after endotracheal intubation, which may affect practitioners' decision to use checklists in this setting.

### Managing the physiologically difficult airway in critically ill adults [^dedf6cd5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

What About Intubation Adjuncts and Checklists?

Despite the growing popularity of video laryngoscopy, direct laryngoscopy remains commonplace worldwide, accounting for 81.5% of intubations included in INTUBE. There also remains international variation in the routine use of endotracheal tube stylets due to their associated risks, which, while uncommon, are potentially severe. The recent STYLETO trial reported a first pass success rate of 78.2% in patients intubated with direct laryngoscopy and a stylet and 71.5% in those intubated without a stylet. Among the 999 included patients, in the stylet group there were two laryngeal injuries, one mediastinal injury, and two esophageal injures, while in the control group there were two laryngeal injuries and one tracheal injury. For clinicians accustomed to using a stylet, the results of the BOUGIE follow-up trial suggest that a tracheal tube introducer (i.e. bougie) may not offer an advantage under usual conditions.

Checklists and other similar cognitive aids have been found to increase adherence to complex multistep processes in stressful clinical contexts. ICU intubation checklists that incorporate physiological optimization have been shown to improve outcomes in small studies. Janz et al. conducted the only randomized trial of an intubation checklist and demonstrated no differences in lowest oxygen saturation or blood pressure during intubation; however, that checklist did not include preparatory steps relevant to physiologic optimization. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of 11 studies, including 3261 patients, found no association between airway checklists and improved clinical outcomes. Although these findings are somewhat discouraging, given the seemingly ever-growing complexity of critical illness and the serious risks posed to patients by airway management in the ICU, further development and assessment of checklists incorporating preparation for physiological difficulties is an important avenue of investigation.

Design

The core project team consisted of the two authors who were members of medical staff; a CT1 anaesthetics trainee and the RCoA airway lead. The ED resuscitation group was consulted on the problem and their views were sought. This group included medical and nursing staff of various grades involved in improvement of care in the resuscitation area of the ED. As the project continued, further input was sought from an emergency medicine consultant and the lead ED nurse for resuscitation. Patients and other members of the public were not consulted in the design or conduct of this service improvement project as the difference in patient experience between using a checklist or not while in a critically unwell state was estimated to be negligible.

A driver diagram was developed to help determine suitable interventions, and this was structured around three primary drivers (figure 1). These were broad areas considered barriers to use of a checklist. The three areas were first, a lack of awareness that a checklist exists and the expectation by the organisation that it must be used; second, a lack of intrinsic motivation to use a checklist, including not believing a checklist is useful or of benefit; third, not remembering to use the checklist while involved in an appropriate case. Secondary drivers were determined as contributing factors to the primary drivers, and interventions addressing these were developed. It was believed multiple interventions would be required, ultimately addressing secondary drivers linked to all three primary drivers. Of all possible interventions considered, those implemented were the ones estimated to be most effective without being too difficult to undertake. They were trialled using the plan–do–study–act (PDSA) framework.

### Advancing emergency airway management by reducing intubation time at a high-volume academic emergency department [^8676d5e6]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Lessons learnt

Engaging with the frontline team, creating a rapport and training them through knowledge and skills can significantly impact acute care delivery. Healthcare workers in high volume centres are often overburdened and feel that major changes are required to improve the working conditions and healthcare delivery. However, through this project we demonstrated that simple things like pasting a drug checklist on the drug tray, on-site awareness sessions made a difference in intubation time that was sustainable.

Use of simulation-based training helped enhance both technical and non-technical skills (communication skills, team work, situational awareness) and improved preparedness for high stressful situations while working in the ED.

Considering inputs from the frontline staff who are involved in direct patient care is very important when considering change ideas. Celebrating small achievements to motivate the team members can go a long way in the success of the project.

### 40th international symposium on intensive care&emergency medicine 2021 [^17779bb9]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Anaesthetics, Guy´s & St Thomas´ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; 2 Critical Care Unit, Guy´s & St Thomas´ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK

Critical Care 2021, 25 (Suppl 1): P146

Introduction: Tracheal intubation in critical care is well recognized as a high-risk procedure, meticulous preparation and effective team working are determinants of good outcome. Checklists aid structured preparation and execution of procedures. We aimed to adapt our unit intubation checklist [1] for use on mobile devices to ensure a consistent safety standard for intubations both on the unit and elsewhere in the hospital.

Methods: The unit intubation checklist covers different aspects of pre-procedure preparation, each aspect was assigned one page. Using Affinity Publisher (Serif Europe Ltd. West Bridgford, UK), the different components of each aspect were laid out and supplemented by pictograms, arrows and formatting to aid visual reception. Interactive elements were then added using Adobe Acrobat X Pro (Adobe Inc. San Jose, California, US). We sought feedback from multiple clinicians at different training levels and improved the checklist iteratively in response to their input.

Results: The resulting PDF document contains eight pages in a 16:9 format suitable for most modern smartphones (Fig. 1). Viewing is intended in the Acrobat app (Adobe Inc. San Jose, California, US), with one-page display and sideways swiping allowing a view of each page in its entirety and quick progress through the checklist. Each page uses a characteristic background color, with large page numbers in the upper right corner. Seven of the pages contain interactive elements - checkboxes to aid completion of all checklist steps and radio buttons on the airway assessment page to aid identification of high-risk features, and a link to the published guideline on the title page.

Conclusions: This interactive mobile checklist has been described as useful and easily adopted in clinical practice from initial feedback. After rolling out this checklist broadly, the impact on checklist uptake and rate of clinical incidents will be the subject of subsequent work.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^7c8a5355]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

Endotracheal intubation (ETI) procedural optimization — use of a checklist and protocolized interventions to optimize the patient physically and physiologically have been shown to improve success rates of ETI and decrease peri-intubation complications, and preparation should also include a promptly available plan for alternate airway placement if ETI is unsuccessful. Adjuncts and techniques include that a bougie may be a helpful adjunct to successful ETI placement, placement in ear-to-sternal notch positioning can improve glottic visualization, and video laryngoscopy may enhance intubation success rates; endotracheal tube sizes (cuffed tubes preferred in pediatrics).

Lessons and limitations

This project sought to increase the incidence of safety checklist use before undertaking the potentially high-risk intervention of ETI in the critically unwell. The problem was believed to be one more related to behavioural and decision-making factors than to ineffective steps in a process. Although both areas were addressed in the interventions, a greater focus was on the former through addressing awareness of the checklist, motivation to use it and remembering to use it in the correct moment. We believe this was important to the success of the project and may have been a key reason for the degree of improvement the data suggest occurred, which we had not anticipated. One additional strength of the project was that these interventions required no additional funds, apart from those needed for printing and lamination of additional checklists.

Of the interventions, the most interesting was the presentation at the department audit meeting. Senior colleagues spoke in favour of checklist use both in terms of patient safety and in adhering to required standards, likely creating a degree of social pressure among other colleagues present to use the checklist in future cases. This learning informed the later cycle aimed at ODPs and junior medical staff, but if repeating the project, we would consider how to leverage social influence further to increase use.

This project had a number of limitations. Only cases coded correctly by ED clinicians were included, meaning it was likely a number of applicable cases were not captured. We do not know how many such cases were missed. Further, the coding system changed in April 2019, and this was likely the reason no cases were captured in May. We believe the impact this change of system would have had on the results is likely limited, but we were unable to determine the magnitude of any influence. This did constitute a change in the way episodes of interest were identified and is therefore a significant limitation of the project. More reliable and consistent systems of capturing applicable cases would have been desirable, and if this project were repeated, this is something we would look to establish. Nevertheless, the sample obtained was believed to be sufficiently representative to indicate improvement or not through run chart analysis.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^c499d82c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Orotracheal/endotracheal intubation (ETI) preparation and peri-intubation care include that checklist use and protocolized interventions to optimize the patient physically and physiologically have been shown to both improve success rates of orotracheal intubation and decrease peri-intubation complications, with preparation including a promptly available plan for alternative airway placement if ETI unsuccessful. In addition to preoxygenation, apneic oxygenation (high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula) may prolong the period before hypoxia during an intubation attempt; positive pressure ventilation after intubation can decrease preload and subsequently lead to hypotension, so significant attention should be paid to adequate preoxygenation to avoid peri-intubation hypoxia and hypoxic cardiac arrest. Routine use of cricoid pressure is not recommended in pediatric or adult intubation, prompt suctioning of soiled airways before intubation attempt may improve first pass success and limit morbidity and mortality, and confirm successful placement with waveform capnography; less optimal methods of confirmation include bilateral chest rise and bilateral breath sounds.

### Peri-intubation adverse events and clinical outcomes in emergency department patients: the BARCO study [^196bd544]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent consensus guidelines from an international Delphi study highlight structured strategies for managing the physiologically difficult airway, emphasizing pre-intubation assessment, hemodynamic stabilization, optimized pre-oxygenation, and careful induction agent selection to minimize peri-intubation adverse events. We identified several key risk factors for MAEs during intubation, consistent with previous research. De Jong et al. highlighted hypotension, hypoxemia, lack of pre-oxygenation, obesity, and age over 75 years as critical risk factors for cardiac arrest. In our cohort, markers of illness severity, including shock index, the number of organ dysfunctions, and vasopressor use, were strongly associated with MAEs. Therefore, targeted efforts to identify and stabilize patients presenting with shock or respiratory failure before intubation are essential. Early optimization of hemodynamic status and oxygenation may reduce the risk of peri-intubation adverse events. Two ongoing international trials, the FLUVA (NCT05318066) and PREVENTION (NCT05014581) trials, are evaluating if pre-emptive vasopressor use can reduce cardiovascular collapse during intubation in critically ill adults and may help clarify the role of hemodynamic optimization in this context. Furthermore, capnography use was limited in our cohort (25%), similar to INTUBE study 4, and likely reflects restricted access to waveform capnography in many resource-limited settings. In contrast, use of a pre-intubation checklist was associated with a lower risk of MAEs (aOR, 0.75), supporting its value as a simple, high-impact intervention to improve the safety of emergency airway management.

### Increasing use of an endotracheal intubation safety checklist in the emergency department [^d57431f9]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Measurement

An initial retrospective audit was undertaken to assess incidence of checklist use. All patient records with an ED episode between September 2018 and April 2019 coded with 'RSI/intubation' or 'general anaesthesia' were reviewed. Coding was undertaken by the ED clinician assessing the patient. The proportion of patients where a preintubation checklist was used was determined by either the presence of a completed checklist or, if this was not present, other documentation stating a checklist was used. It was decided to include the latter as it is assumed the majority of benefit a checklist brings to patient safety is in its real-time use rather than simply acting as a method of documentation. Patients were excluded if only a supraglottic airway device was used; they arrived to the ED already intubated or they were intubated during a cardiac arrest.

In this initial audit, 71 patients were identified. In 10 cases, the relevant episode could not be found within the case notes and these patients were excluded. A further 19 cases met the exclusion criteria stated previously. Of the remaining 42 cases analysed, 3 had a completed checklist with a further 4 having documentation stating a checklist was used without one being present in the notes. Therefore, the total incidence of checklist use was 16.7%.

During the project, patient records were reviewed in the same manner at 3 monthly intervals for the preceding 3-month period. As many patients remained on ICU for prolonged periods, this allowed time for patient episodes to be filed in case notes before review. These audits were approved by our organisation's audit department. The ED episode coding system changed in April 2019, but equivalent coding items were identified and used to identify cases throughout the remainder of the project. Data were displayed in a run chart and analysed by looking for patterns of non-random variation.

### Prehospital emergency anaesthesia: an updated survey of UK practice with emphasis on the role of standardisation and checklists [^2505edf7]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prehospital emergency anaesthesia (PHEA or 'prehospital rapid sequence intubation') is a high-risk procedure. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklists within healthcare systems have been demonstrated to reduce human error and improve patient safety. We aimed to describe the current practice of PHEA in the UK, determine the use of checklists for PHEA and describe the content, format and layout of any such checklists currently used in the UK.

Method

A survey of UK prehospital teams was conducted to establish the incidence and conduct of PHEA practice. Results were grouped into systems delivering a high volume of PHEA per year (> 50 PHEAs) and low volume (≤ 50 PHEAs per annum). Standard and 'crash' (immediate) induction checklists were reviewed for length, content and layout.

Results

59 UK physician-led prehospital services were identified of which 43 (74%) participated. Thirty services (70%) provide PHEA and perform approximately 1629 PHEAs annually. Ten 'high volume' services deliver 84% of PHEAs per year with PHEA being performed on a median of 11% of active missions. The most common indication for PHEA was trauma. 25 of the 30 services (83%) used a PHEA checklist prior to induction of anaesthesia and 24 (80%) had an SOP for the procedure. 19 (76%) of the 'standard' checklists and 5 (50%) of the 'crash' induction checklists used were analysed. On average, standard checklists contained 169 (range: 52–286) words and 41 (range: 28–70) individual checks. The style and language complexity varied significantly between different checklists.

Conclusion

PHEA is now performed commonly in the UK. The use of checklists for PHEA is relatively common among prehospital systems delivering this intervention. Care must be taken to limit checklist length and to use simple, unambiguous language in order to maximise the safety of this high-risk intervention.

### Intubation checklist in the intensive care unit (CHECC) [^5f65b6fe]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Preprocedural checklists have been used and implemented in various aspects and settings of health care. Among others, implementing a surgical checklist resulted in lower morbidity and mortality and in the ICU, using a checklist in conjunction with the placement of a central venous line significantly reduced central line-associated bloodstream infections. A study on implementing a preprocedural intubation checklist on trauma patients in the emergency department showed a reduction in intubation-related complications such as oxygen desaturation, hypotension. Checklists are a cognitive aid and practical tool to help planning and optimising a procedure systematically and set order. They promote standardisation and reduce reliance on individual memory, which can be compromised by stress and fatigue. This is used in aviation, product management and different healthcare areas.

It usually contains a list of required items or suggestions and serves as a reminder how to optimise the patient, preferably with a contingency plan. Hence, in theory, this makes endotracheal intubation an ideal procedure for applying the checklist in critical ill patients in the ICU. Therefore, we aim to investigate whether implementing a preprocedural intubation checklist in the ICU reduces in intubation-related complications in critically ill adults. Objectives and purpose This study aims to explore whether the introduction of a preprocedural checklist for intubation in the intensive care unit is associated with a lower incidence of intubation-related complications. The researchers hypothesise that the introduction and utilisation of a checklist will contribute to a safer and more structured working climate, leading to an optimised surrounding environment and enhanced physiology of the patient.

Description of project This observational retrospective study will be conducted in the ICU, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna. The aim is to study whether introducing and implementing a pre-intubation checklist are associated with a lower incidence of intubation-related adverse events. Adult ICU patients requiring intubation for any indication will be included, with inclusion and exclusion criteria as described above. Clinical relevance Endotracheal intubation entails a significant risk of life-threatening complications in the intensive care setting. Therefore, optimising this procedure is of utmost importance. We aim to study whether the introducing and implementing a structured checklist for intubation will increase the safety of this standard yet perilous procedure. This could reduce the incidence of severe intubation-related complications and greatly benefit ICU patients. Other: Checklist

### Difficult Airway Society guidelines for awake tracheal intubation (ATI) in adults [^66abc208]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Checklists

In the peri‐operative setting the use of cognitive aids, such as checklists, improves inter‐professional communication, teamwork and patient outcomes 88, 89, 90, 91. In anaesthetic practice, cognitive aids enhance performance in simulated emergency scenarios 92, 93, and their use been recommended in elective airway management 1. Given the potential benefits, we recommend a cognitive aid such as a checklist before and during performance of ATI (Grade D; Supporting Information, Appendix S2). The key components of ATI are sedation, topicalisation, oxygenation and performance (sTOP; Fig. 2). The 's' is in lower case to emphasise the optional nature of sedation.

### Tracheal intubation in critically ill patients: a comprehensive systematic review of randomized trials [^675213e7]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The only RCT comparing a pre-intubation checklist to no checklist did not find any positive effect: these results are in contrast with the above mentioned before-after study, and in line with another observational study. A different choice of items could at least in part explain the difference: the positive results were obtained in a center with extensive experience in intubation specifically in critically ill patients, while the checklist of the RCT derived from the opinions of experts in airway management and from guideline-recommended steps for intubation, not focused on critically ill patients. The present systematic review could contribute to identify the most relevant items to be included in future checklists.

Pre-oxygenation of patients to be intubated has a strong rationale, extending the duration of safe apnea during laryngoscopy before the patient reaches critical levels of hypoxemia. Apneic oxygenation can be complementary to pre-oxygenation techniques. Pre-oxygenation before intubation of critically ill patients and, above all, of hypoxemic patients, is crucial. However, the techniques commonly applied in the operating room (spontaneous breathing of high concentration of oxygen applied by face mask for some minutes, followed by manual ventilation by a bag-valve mask) might be not effective or feasible in the deranged physiology of ICU and ED patients. Our findings suggest that HFNC might improve pre-oxygenation; on the other hand, apneic oxygenation with HFNC seems ineffective. These findings are in line with a recent meta-analysis also including a non-randomized trial: apneic oxygenation with HFNC reduced severe desaturation in elective intubation in the operating room (OR), but not in ICU patients with respiratory failure. On the contrary, NIV applied for 3 minutes before laryngoscopy resulted in a better safety profile reducing the incidence of severe desaturation episodes, without NIV-related complications: NIV may be regarded as a useful approach to pre-oxygenation in critically ill patients, above all in hypoxemic patients, even if it was evaluated only in a single, small study.

### Five-year audit of adherence to an anaesthesia pre-induction checklist [^2572fe14]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Known barriers to checklist compliance are personal (negative) attitude towards safety procedures and an overconfidence bias that is the overestimation of one's own abilities and skills, leading to not complying with safety checks. Some argued that patients might be unsettled witnessing safety discussions about potential failure during anaesthesia. However, actual data from checklists' use in the induction room have shown that such safety checks are highly appreciated by patients.

This audit has some limitations. First, the analysis did not include anaesthesia procedures in paediatrics, under sedation or regional anaesthesia. If the checklist has not been completed, it may add additional stressors in such an emergency. This needs reconsideration because every procedure can unexpectedly and urgently change into the need for general anaesthesia with airway management. Second, the retrospective study design might have led to missing data due to poor data entry (e.g. patients whose tracheas were already intubated or who had a tracheostomy in‐situ), which might underestimate the overall compliance. Finally, we could not find any effect of the use of the checklist on patient outcomes.

In summary, we implemented an anaesthesia pre‐induction checklist locally designed to improve patient safety during anaesthesia. The checklist focused on correctly preparing the equipment required, communicating the roles and distribution of tasks clarifying the anaesthesia and backup plans. Adherence of use increased from 48% to 67% over 5 years. We identified reduced adherence in non‐operating theatres, immediate urgent procedures, some anaesthesia teams for different surgical specialities and during the night. Pre‐induction checklists should be used as part of a broader organisational patient safety concept, potentially contributing to reduced anaesthesia‐related crises and less fatal patient outcomes.

### Impact of checklists on peri-intubation care in ED trauma patients [^9d43e36b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Checklists have successfully been used in intensive care units (ICUs) to improve metrics of critical care. Proper peri-intubation care including use of appropriate induction agents and postintubation sedation is crucial when performing endotracheal intubation (ETI) on critically ill patients, especially in the emergency department (ED). We sought to evaluate the impact of checklists on peri-intubation care in ED trauma patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all trauma patients intubated in the ED of an urban, level 1 academic center from November 2010 to October 2012. As part of a quality improvement project, a peri-intubation checklist was instituted on November 1, 2011 to guide peri-intubation care. Using a predesign and postdesign, we compared peri-intubation parameters using parametric and nonparametric statistics when appropriate to evaluate the impact of a checklist on peri-intubation care. We also evaluated outcome measures including mortality and lengths of stay.

Results

During the 2-year study period, 187 trauma patients underwent ETI in the ED, 90 prechecklist and 97 postchecklist. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) use was greater with the checklist than without (90.7% vs 75.6%, P = 0.005). No difference was found between the number of ETI attempts per patient, hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation), postintubation anxiolysis, median number of ventilator days, length of ED stay, length of ICU stay, or mortality.

Conclusion

Peri-intubation checklists result in higher rates of RSI in ED trauma patients but do not alter other measured metrics of peri-intubation care.

### Association of checklist use in endotracheal intubation with clinically important outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2f0bb53a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Among secondary outcomes, checklist use was not associated with a statistically significant difference in the rate of most adverse events, including esophageal intubation (4 studies, [1701 patients]; RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.30–1.41; I² = 58.9%), hypotension (7 studies, [2821 patients]; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.38–1.24; I² = 48.3%), or peri-intubation cardiac arrest (5 studies, [2563 patients]; RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.31–1.36; I² = 0%). However, checklist use was associated with a decrease in hypoxic events (8 studies, [3010 patients]; RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.95; I² = 33%). This association was more pronounced in studies, with cutoffs for hypoxia of 90% to 93% (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Checklist use was also not associated with increased first-pass intubation success (9 studies, [2563 patients]; RR, 1.05 with checklist; 95% CI, 0.96–1.14; I² = 73%) (Figure 2). Time to successful intubation results were not pooled because definitions differed among the studies. Smith et alreported decreased time from paralysis to intubation associated with checklist use (82 vs 94 seconds, P = 0.02). Janz et alreported no difference in time from induction to intubation (120 seconds with checklist and 118 seconds without). Lastly, Hatch et alreported an increase in time from decision to intubate to successful intubation associated with checklist use (33 vs 27 minutes, P = 0.01). Hospital length of stay was only reported in 1 studyand was not different between groups (11 days for checklist group and 12 days for control group, P = 0.55).

### A multicenter randomized trial of a checklist for endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults [^9d1a776a]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoxemia and hypotension are common complications during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults. Verbal performance of a written, preintubation checklist may prevent these complications. We compared a written, verbally performed, preintubation checklist with usual care regarding lowest arterial oxygen saturation or lowest systolic BP experienced by critically ill adults undergoing endotracheal intubation.

Methods

A multicenter trial in which 262 adults undergoing endotracheal intubation were randomized to a written, verbally performed, preintubation checklist (checklist) or no preintubation checklist (usual care). The coprimary outcomes were lowest arterial oxygen saturation and lowest systolic BP between the time of procedural medication administration and 2 min after endotracheal intubation.

Results

The median lowest arterial oxygen saturation was 92% (interquartile range [IQR], 79–98) in the checklist group vs 93% (IQR, 84–100) with usual care (P = 0.34). The median lowest systolic BP was 112 mm Hg (IQR, 94–133) in the checklist group vs 108 mm Hg (IQR, 90–132) in the usual care group (P = 0.61). There was no difference between the checklist and usual care in procedure duration (120 vs 118 s; P = 0.49), number of laryngoscopy attempts (one vs one attempt; P = 0.42), or severe life-threatening procedural complications (40.8% vs 32.6%; P = 0.20).

Conclusions

The verbal performance of a written, preprocedure checklist does not increase the lowest arterial oxygen saturation or lowest systolic BP during endotracheal intubation of critically ill adults compared with usual care.

### A preprocedural checklist improves the safety of emergency department intubation of trauma patients [^abef610d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Endotracheal intubation of trauma patients is a vital and high-risk procedure in the emergency department (ED). The hypothesis was that implementation of a standardized, preprocedural checklist would improve the safety of this procedure.

Methods

A preprocedural intubation checklist was developed and then implemented in a prospective pre-/postinterventional study in an academic trauma center ED. The proportions of trauma patients older than 16 years who experienced intubation-related complications during the 6 months before checklist implementation and 6 months after implementation were compared. Intubation-related complications included oxygen desaturation, emesis, esophageal intubation, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Additional outcomes included time from paralysis to intubation and adherence to safety process measures.

Results

During the study, 141 trauma patients were intubated, including 76 in the prechecklist period and 65 in the postchecklist period. A lower proportion of patients experienced intubation-related complications in the postchecklist period (1.5%) than the prechecklist period (9.2%), representing a 7.7% (95% confidence interval = 0.5% to 14.8%) absolute risk reduction. Paralysis-to-intubation time was also lower in the postchecklist period (median = 82 seconds, interquartile range [IQR] = 68 to 101 seconds) compared to the prechecklist period (median = 94 seconds, IQR = 78 to 115 seconds; p = 0.02). Adherence to safety process measures also improved, with all safety measures performed in 69.2% in the postchecklist period compared to 17.1% before the checklist (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Implementation of a preintubation checklist for ED intubation of trauma patients was associated with a reduction in intubation-related complications, decreased paralysis-to-intubation time, and improved adherence to recognized safety measures.

### Implementation of NAP4 emergency airway management recommendations in a quaternary-level pediatric hospital [^d777e82e]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Emergency airway management, particularly outside of the operating room, is associated with a high incidence of life-threatening adverse events. Based on the recommendations of the 4th National Audit Project, we aimed to develop hospital-wide systems changes to improve the safety of emergency airway management. We describe a framework for governance in the form of a hospital airway special interest group. We describe the development and implementation of the following systems changes: 1. A local intubation algorithm modified from the Difficult Airway Society's plan A-B-C-D approach, including clear pathways for airway escalation, and emphasizing the concepts of resuscitation prior to intubation, planning for failure, and avoidance of fixation error. 2. Simplified and standardized airway equipment located in identical airway carts in all critical care areas. 3. A preintubation checklist and equipment template to standardize preparation for airway management. 4. Availability of continuous waveform endtidal capnography in all critical care areas for confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement. 5. Multidisciplinary team training to address the technical and nontechnical aspects of nonoperating room intubation. In addition, we describe methodology for ongoing monitoring of performance through a quality assurance framework. In conclusion, changes in the process of emergency airway management at a hospital level are feasible through collaboration. Their impact on patient-based outcomes requires further study.

### Improving the safety of remote site emergency airway management [^e15f7ee8]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We would therefore fully support the opinions of others prior to embarking on any other clinical improvement project to ensure that the best work is produced.

This project unfortunately did have some limitations. Firstly, this project was limited to a single centre implementation. This means that despite its general applicability to other centres, the model used in this project may need adapting dependent upon the resources available in different centres. Potential examples may include in larger hospitals having more that one ICU or in smaller centres, with limited staff availability, it may not be possible to have immediately available skilled staff to help the anaesthetist with remote site airway management.

The numbers involved in the assessment of trainee confidence in this study are small and therefore to increase validity, this should ideally be repeated at a Deanery level. However, despite the small numbers, we do feel that the sample does represent the majority of most junior trainees when faced with such situations.

A potential problem that may arise with the introduction of this package is the encouragement of more senior staff in using the RSI checklist. We did not have this problem in our cohort of senior anaesthetists; however, it could be envisaged that senior staff may feel less inclined to use such a checklist due to their wealth of experience and skill. Unfortunately, complications and problems do happen to clinicians regardless of seniority, and it should be stressed that this package is an aid to simply enhance patient safety by ensuring any potential difficulties and / or complications are planned for as best as possible prior to commencing what is deemed a high-risk procedure.

There is always inherent difficulty when quantifying the difficulties with remote site airway management, particularly if difficulties occur but no harm comes to the patient as a result. However, the introduction of our airway package will allow for assessment of the use of the checklist and also whether essential help and equipment are present during such situations, and early reports are suggesting that it is already helping to promote good team working, identification of team roles and in promoting an environment where potential difficulties are actively planned for and avoided.

### Consensus guidelines for managing the airway in patients with COVID-19: guidelines from the Difficult Airway Society, the association of anaesthetists the intensive care society, the faculty of intensive care medicine and the royal college of anaesthetists [^bc4cfbba]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Fundamentals of airway management for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19

Airway management for patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID‐19 follows similar principles in both emergency and non‐emergency settings (Fig. 1).

Prepare. a Institutional preparation (equipment for routine management and for managing difficulty; adequate numbers of appropriately trained staff; availability of tracheal intubation checklists; PPE etc.) should be in place well before airway management occurs. If this does not already exist, it is strongly recommended it is put in place urgently. Resources from this guideline may form part of that preparation. b Team and individual preparation require knowledge of the institutional preparation, the skills required, how to use PPE correctly and assessment of the patient's airway to predict difficulty and prepare the airway strategy (Fig. 3). It is accepted that MACOCHA (Malampatti, obstructive sleep apnoea, c‐spine movement, mouth opening, coma, hypoxaemia, non‐anaesthetist intubator 25) is not widely used but it is validated and recommended. Figure 3 MACOCHA score and prediction of difficult intubation. Adapted from 23.
Create a COVID‐19 tracheal intubation trolley or pack. Critically ill patients may need to be intubated in a location other than ICU. On ICU, tracheal intubation will likely take place in single rooms. Prepare a tracheal intubation trolley or pack that can be taken to the patient and decontaminated after use. The Supporting Information (Appendix S1) in the online supplementary material illustrates and provides some guidance on its contents.
Have a strategy. The airway strategy (the primary plan and the rescue plans, and when they are transitioned to) should be in place and the airway team briefed before any part of airway management takes place.
Involve the smallest number of staff necessary. This is not an argument for solo operators but staff who have no direct role in the airway procedure should not unnecessarily be in the room where airway management is taking pace. Three individuals are likely required: an intubator; an assistant; and a third person to give drugs and watch monitors. A runner should be watching from outside and be able to summon help rapidly if needed (Fig. 4). Figure 4 Personnel plan for tracheal intubation of a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. Adapted from 20.
Wear appropriate, checked PPE (see above). Even in an emergency and including cardiac arrest, PPE should be in worn and checked before all airway management and staff should not expose themselves to risk in any circumstance.
Avoid aerosol‐generating procedures wherever possible. If a suitable alternative is available, use it. If aerosol generation takes place, the room is considered contaminated, airborne precaution PPE should be used and the room should be deep cleaned after 20 min 24.
Focus on promptness and reliability. The aim is to achieve airway management successfully at the first attempt. Do not rush but make each attempt the best it can be. Multiple attempts are likely to increase risk to multiple staff and to patients.
Use techniques that are known to work reliably across a range of patients, including when difficulty is encountered. The actual technique may differ according to local practices and equipment. Where training and availability is in place this is likely to include: a Use of a kit dump mat (Fig. 5); Figure 5 Exemplar of kit dump mat. The emergency front‐of‐neck airway kit may be excluded from the airway kit dump due to the risk of contamination and could be placed outside of the room with immediate access if required. b Videolaryngoscopy for tracheal intubation; c A 2‐person 2‐handed mask ventilation with a VE‐grip (Fig. 6); Figure 6 (a). Two‐handed two‐person bag‐mask technique with the VE hand position; the second person squeezes the bag. (b). The C hand position, which should be avoided. Reproduced with permission of Dr A. Matioc. d A second‐generation supraglottic airway device (SGA) for airway rescue (e.g. i‐gel, Ambu Aura Gain, LMA ProSeal, LMA Protector)
The most appropriate airway manager should manage the airway. See above.
Do not use techniques you have not used before or are not trained in. Again, for the reasons stated above, this is not a time to test new techniques.
Ensure all necessary airway kit is present in the room before tracheal intubation takes place. This includes the airway trolley and a cognitive aid consistent with the rescue strategy. a Monitoring including working continuous waveform capnography b Working suction c Ventilator set up d Working, checked intravenous (i.v.) access
Use a tracheal intubation checklist (Fig. 7 and also see Supporting Information, Appendix S2). This is designed to aid preparedness and should be checked before entering the patient's room as part of preparation. Figure 7 Emergency tracheal intubation checklist in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. Adapted from 20 with permission.
Use a cognitive aid if difficulty arises (Fig. 8). Airway difficulty leads to cognitive overload and failure to perform optimally. A cognitive aid will help focus the team and enhance transitioning through the algorithm. Two algorithms are provided: that derived from the Difficult Airway Society (DAS) 2018 guidelines for tracheal intubation of the critically ill 20 has intentionally been reduced in scope and choices removed to accommodate the current setting and encourage reliable and prompt decision‐making and actions.

(b) Cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate. Adapted from 20 with permission. (c) Vortex approach cognitive aid. From 27 with permission.
Use clear language and closed loop communication. It may be hard to communicate when wearing PPE and staff may be working outside normal areas of practice. Give simple instructions. Speak clearly and loudly, without shouting. When receiving instructions repeat what you have understood to the person speaking. If team members do not know each other well, a sticker with the individual's name can be placed on the top of the visor to aid communication with other staff.

### The use of checklists in the intensive care unit: a scoping review [^92cebb68]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Guidelines

Ten guidelines were identified in the search. Three guidelines commented solely on delirium screening checklists, namely the ICDSC. Another two guidelines commented on the ICDSC along with procedural checklists, which included intubation as one of those procedures. Two guidelines provided recommendations for central line insertion checklists for the prevention of CLABSIs. Three guidelines provided guidance on intubation checklists, two of which were related to COVID-19 emergency intubation. No guidelines on rounding checklists or transfer/handover checklists were identified.

All five guidelines that mentioned delirium screening checklists recommended regular delirium screening using either the ICDSC or another common delirium screening tool, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). In addition to recommending the use of the ICDSC, two of the guidelines required a checklist to be used for all invasive or high-risk procedures (including intubation).

Two guidelines recommended the implementation of any form of a central line insertion checklist in the ICU. Both provided an example of a central line insertion checklist from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.

All three intubation checklist guidelines recommended the use of an intubation checklist. One provided an intubation checklist that was developed by its authors. Two guidelines provided their recommendations in the context of COVID-19, each presenting a COVID-19 emergency intubation checklist.

The 8-item ICDSC which was supported by the five guidelines has been repeatedly validated before and after the guidelines were published. All airway management checklist studies that provided information on the contents of their checklist on intubation were conducted before the earliest intubation checklist guidelines (since 2012). Accordingly, none of the intubation checklists published by the guidelines have had another study validate their efficacy.

### Measuring evidence-based clinical guideline compliance in the paediatric intensive care unit [^e7371ce0]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

We did not observe a change in compliance with an external evaluator (figure 1A). Although our data were collected prospectively, we did not share results with the clinical staff in real time. Specifically, if a guideline was poorly adhered to, it was not known until after the event, and direct prompting was not given. In fact, research staff had limited direct interaction with the bedside team during compliance data collection. Interestingly, there are studies showing increased compliance not with an evaluator, but with knowledge of peer practices and peer-to-peer comparison. Intradepartment comparison may be a more potent motivator. An interventional trial would provide valuable information on whether changes in these factors were correlated to a change in compliance.

Data collected here on patient outcomes supported existing literature that guideline adherence and standardised checklists can improve patient outcomes. For example, data collected on intubation showed a low adverse event rate when compliance scores were high. This is consistent with previous research on emergency intubation showing that a preprocedural checklist improves outcomes. Specifically, in one study, first pass success in neonatal and paediatric patients was shown to improve by to 20% with preprocedural checklist compliance and simulation. In this frame, it is possible our comparatively low complications may be associated with high preprocedural checklist compliance. Data collected on patient outcomes also can help with local practice and quality improvement. With our descriptive comparison to patient outcomes, we identified areas for local improvement to benefit patients; for example, we identified bronchiolitis remains inappropriately treated, indicating a potential area for targeted evaluation and education initiatives to change local practice with potential patient benefit.

### Interdisciplinary development of an adult intubation procedural checklist [^a2fdfce4]. Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

There are multiple procedural skills common to all residency programs. This study had two main objectives: (1) Use an interdisciplinary team to develop a procedural competency checklist for adult endotracheal intubation that could be shared across specialty programs and levels of training and (2) Evaluate the validity and reliability of the checklist.

Methods

Clinical faculty from the institutional residency programs for family medicine, emergency medicine, obstetrics, and the simulation laboratory developed the initial checklist. Face validity and content validity of the checklist was established using literature review, expert opinion, and Lawshe's Content Validity Ratio. A training DVD was produced to standardize teaching and evaluation use of the checklist. Four teams of two physician raters representing a mix of specialty (family medicine, emergency medicine, obstetrics) and skill levels (clinical faculty and residents) were used to test inter-rater reliability of the checklist.

Results

A convenience sample of 35 residents from family medicine, emergency medicine, and obstetrics participated. Bland and Altman's method for measuring differences between raters was used to test inter-rater reliability. No differences were found between raters based on specialty area or level of training.

Conclusions

Procedural skills common to multiple specialty residency programs can be taught and evaluated across residency programs when a standardized training program and checklist is used. Resources could be maximized by offering training and evaluation sessions across resident specialty programs that are cooperatively staffed by evaluators of different levels of training and specialty backgrounds.

### Critical airway skills and procedures [^ebc3fc16]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Airway management is a critical procedure and essential skill necessary for all physicians working in the emergency department. Optimal resuscitative treatment of medical and trauma patients often revolves around timely and effective airway interventions that can be challenging in the acute setting, especially in critical patients. Time-honored airway techniques and procedures combined with recent advances in rapid sequence intubation, video laryngoscopy, and further advanced airway techniques now offer emergency clinicians a wide range of exciting new options for improving this crucial component of acute care and management.

### Western Trauma Association critical decisions in trauma: airway management in adult trauma patients [^501ba386]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Emergency department adult airway management

Once the adult trauma patient arrives in the emergency department, the environment and options for airway management change significantly. In the emergency department, you have a variety of personnel more experienced in advanced airway management (emergency medicine, respiratory therapy, anesthesia, trauma surgery), a more controlled situation, better lighting, more medication options, and a vast array of equipment including airway adjuncts. However, the guiding principles of airway management remain the same: open airway, oxygenation, and ventilation.

Prior to intubation

The trauma team should make significant preparations prior to patient arrival and planned intubation. Personnel should be gathered prior to patient arrival and for patients with high likelihood for requiring advanced airway management (eg, low GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale)), the entire trauma team should be activated. Every trauma airway should be managed under the premise that there will be a difficult airway, as there is typically not time to complete an evaluation of predictors of difficult laryngoscopy. All advanced airway equipment should be easily accessible and checked for functionality, including laryngoscopes (direct and video), a variety of endotracheal tubes, airway adjuncts (stylets, NPA, and OPAs), rescue airways, and equipment for a surgical airway. Medications needed for rapid sequence intubation should be drawn up and readily available. This preprocedure preparation is an ideal situation for an intubation checklist, or preintubation time out, as these steps have been shown to decrease intubation-related complications and improve adherence to recognized safety measures.

Once the decision has been made to intubate the adult trauma patient, basic airway maneuvers should be used during the time leading up to intubation. Ideally, the patient should have supplemental oxygen applied and preoxygenated for several minutes prior to intubation. Preoxygenation will prolong safe apnea time and prolong apnea time without desaturation. If the patient is spontaneously breathing only supplemental oxygen is needed, but if patient is not breathing spontaneously the patient should receive assisted BVM ventilation with jaw thrust, NPA, OPA as needed. Passive oxygenation should continue through the entire intubation process until the definitive airway is secured.

### Care of the intubated emergency department patient [^f0f08347]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians perform tracheal intubation and initiate mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients on a daily basis. With the current national challenges of intensive care unit bed availability, intubated patients now often remain in the emergency department (ED) for exceedingly long periods of time. As a result, care of the intubated patient falls to the emergency physician (EP). Given the potential for significant morbidity and mortality, it is crucial for the EP to possess the most current, up-to-date information pertaining to the care of intubated patients.

Discussion

This article discusses critical aspects in the ED management of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. Specifically, emphasis is placed on providing adequate sedation and analgesia, limiting the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, correctly setting and adjusting the mechanical ventilator, utilizing appropriate monitoring modalities, and providing key supportive measures. Despite these measures, inevitably, some patients deteriorate while receiving mechanical ventilation. The article concludes with a discussion outlining a step-wise approach to evaluating the intubated patient who develops respiratory distress or circulatory compromise. With this information, the EP can more effectively care for ventilated patients while minimizing morbidity, and ultimately, improving outcome.

Conclusion

Essential components of the care of intubated ED patients includes administering adequate sedative and analgesic medications, using lung-protective ventilator settings with attention to minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury, elevating the head of the bed in the absence of contraindications, early placement of an orogastric tube, and providing prophylaxis for stress-related mucosal injury and deep venous thrombosis when indicated.

### Improving the safety of remote site emergency airway management [^95bdadd5]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Human factors (or non-technical skills) are therefore of great importance in remote site emergency airway management and are defined as 'cognitive and social skills that reduce human error, improve human performance and enhance safety'. Non-technical skills have been a recent area of study in both anaesthesia and intensive care medicine, and of particular importance is the non-technical skill of situational awareness. That is, an ability to maintain an overall awareness of the environment and anticipate potential problems, acting to prevent them from occurring. Numerous studies have revealed that a loss of situational awareness is often a key deficiency in many critical incidents leading to harm.

A key recommendation from NAP4 was that an intubation checklist is used alongside capnography in all remote site emergency airway management situations involving critically ill patients, as they have been shown to significantly reduce complication rates. Checklists are not a new concept and have been successfully used by the aviation industry for a long time. They are also widely used in the pre-hospital and military environments to improve patient safety in high-risk situations. The aim of using a checklist in clinical practice is to ensure that patient, equipment, and team-related factors are all addressed prior to the procedure and that the principles of crew resource management are used to improve the situational awareness of the team as a whole. The Resuscitation Council UK have recently published a minimum equipment and drug list in an attempt to standardise drug and equipment availability for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This list includes advanced airway equipment (including capnography) alongside core resuscitation drugs that when present will improve both safety and care delivery to patients. In addition, studies have demonstrated that intubation checklists and care bundles when used in critical care improve patient safety, reduce mortality, reduce complication rates, and have no effect on the time to induction, irrespective of anaesthetist grade therefore further supporting the NAP4 recommendations.

In the UK, training in intensive care medicine is changing, and doctors from differing backgrounds, who may have less advanced airway experience compared to their predecessors, may staff ICUs. This therefore means that remote site emergency airway management is of paramount importance in the maintenance of patient safety and steps need to be established to minimise the potential for patient harm occurring as a result of incidents relating to emergency airway management.

### A quality improvement initiative to increase the safety of pediatric emergency airway management [^6a2d6ca3]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency airway management is commonly associated with life-threatening hypoxia and hypotension which may be preventable.

Aims

The aim of this quality improvement study was to reduce the frequency of intubation-related hypoxia and hypotension.

Methods

This prospective quality improvement study was conducted over 4 years in the Emergency Department of The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. A preintervention cohort highlighted safety gaps and was used to design study interventions, including an emergency airway algorithm, standardized airway equipment, a preintubation checklist and equipment template, endtidal carbon dioxide monitoring, postintubation team debriefing, and multidisciplinary team training. Following implementation, a postintervention cohort was used to monitor the impact of study interventions on clinical process and patient outcome. Process measures were as follows: use of a preintubation checklist, verbalization of an airway plan, adequate resuscitation prior to intubation, induction agent dose titration, use of apneic oxygenation, and use of endtidal carbon dioxide to confirm endotracheal tube position. The primary outcome measure was first pass success rate without hypoxia or hypotension. Potential harms from study interventions were monitored.

Results

Forty-six intubations were included over one calendar year in the postintervention cohort (compared to 71 in the preintervention cohort). Overall clinical uptake of the 6 processes measures was 85%. First pass success rate without hypoxia or hypotension was 78% in the postintervention cohort compared with 49% in the preintervention cohort (absolute risk reduction: 29.0%; 95% confidence interval 12.3%-45.6%, number needed to treat: 3.5). No significant harms from study interventions were identified.

Conclusion

Quality improvement initiatives targeting emergency airway management may be successfully implemented in the emergency department and are associated with a reduction in adverse intubation-related events.

### Obstetric anaesthetists' association and Difficult Airway Society guidelines for the management of difficult and failed tracheal intubation in obstetrics [^8bac8449]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

These guidelines cover the essential elements and steps for safe management of obstetric general anaesthesia, with the intention of minimising the incidence of failed tracheal intubation while ensuring optimal management should it occur. The algorithms use simple flow pathways with minimal decision points. Algorithm 1 incorporates items to check during the preparation, planning and delivering of anaesthesia, to supplement the World Health Organization checklists. Table 1 allows a more structured evaluation of the multiple pre- and post-induction factors salient to the decision whether to wake or proceed after failed intubation (Algorithm 2) or a front-of-neck procedure (Algorithm 3); the examples in the rows are illustrative and will assume different importance both for individual practice as well as unit-based approaches, and therefore an individual case might be managed differently by different anaesthetists. Besides a clinical tool, the table can act as a focus for case-based teaching. Table 2 formulates detailed management for both awakening and proceeding with surgery after failed intubation, an area that has not been described in detail previously. We hope that the publication of national guidelines will improve consistency of clinical practice, reduce adverse events and provide a structure for teaching and training in failed tracheal intubation in obstetrics.

### We asked the experts: the WHO surgical safety checklist and the COVID-19 pandemic: recommendations for content and implementation adaptations [^181e4096]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 57 individuals invited to participate, 18 panelists completed round three. The final panel included eight surgeons, five anesthesiologists, three perioperative nurses, and two human factors engineers from eight countries across five continents. Twelve panelists (67%) were from high-income countries and ten (56%) were female.

Twenty-nine suggestions emerged in the first round (19 content items and 10 implementation items). Twelve items reached consensus for inclusion in round two and an additional four were included after round three (Table 1). Three items reached consensus for exclusion.

Table 1
Consensus recommendations for SSC content modification and implementation

Content adaptations

Round one recommendations concerning COVID-19 screening and personal protective equipment (PPE) were nearly universal. Other recommendations centered around OR process modifications to minimize the risk of staff exposure.

In round two, three recommendations related to infectious risk assessment achieved consensus for inclusion: review of the patient's COVID-19 screening or risk, intubation plan, and aerosolization risks. A recommendation to review equipment availability to limit ingress and egress from the OR also reached consensus for inclusion, while a suggestion to review COVID-19 screening of OR team members was rejected.

Four additional recommendations were included after the third round: ensuring the OR team has proper PPE, confirming postoperative bed availability, discussing proper handling of laboratory and pathological specimens, and signing out prior to extubation. Two recommendations reached consensus for exclusion (restriction of OR team to essential staff and use of trocar sealers). Eight recommendations did not achieve consensus. Free text responses indicated that these recommendations were not universally feasible and were covered by other safety instruments, or should be addressed before the patient enters the OR.

Implementation adaptations

Eight implementation recommendations achieved consensus for inclusion in the second round. These recommendations were focused on the need for rapid implementation, periodic review, and consideration for de-implementation of a pandemic-oriented SSC. Recommendations related to local ownership and leadership support for the adapted checklist were also included, as it was the need for additional training during implementation. Two items reached consensus for exclusion and two did not achieve consensus (specific recommendations for introducing and de-implementing changes and use of electronic displays). These were felt to be potentially useful but not universally necessary or feasible. A recommendation for a separate supplementary COVID-19 checklist which achieved consensus in round two was removed after further discussion with the panelists.

### Using a post-intubation checklist and time out to expedite mechanical ventilation monitoring: observational study of a quality improvement intervention [^213fc180]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed mechanical ventilation monitoring may impede recognition of life-threatening acidemia. Coordination of multidisciplinary processes can be improved by using a checklist and time-out procedure. The study objective was to evaluate process-related outcomes after implementation of a post-intubation checklist and time out.

Methods

An observational study of a 24-bed medical ICU in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was conducted from January to December 2011. A random sample of mechanically ventilated adults was selected from the pre-intervention (n = 80) and post-intervention (n = 144) periods. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with an arterial blood gas (ABG) result within 60 min of mechanical ventilation initiation. Secondary outcomes included rates of respiratory acidosis, moderate-severe acidemia (pH < 7.25), checklist initiation, and project sustainability. Chi-square analysis was used to evaluate differences in outcomes between time periods.

Results

After the intervention, the proportion of subjects with an ABG result within 60 min increased (56% vs 37%, P = 0.01), and time to ABG result improved (58 min vs 79 min, P = 0.004). Adjusting for illness severity, the proportion with an ABG result within 60 min remained significantly higher in the post-intervention period (odds ratio 2.42, 95% CI 1.25–4.68, P = 0.009). Checklist adherence was higher with ICU intubations than for intubations performed outside the ICU (71% vs 27% checklist initiation rate, P < .001). Transfer from referring institutions (23% checklist initiation rate, P = 0.006) negatively impacted checklist use. Implementation challenges included frequent stakeholder turnover, undefined process ownership, and lack of real-time performance feedback.

Conclusions

A post-intubation checklist and time out improved the timeliness of mechanical ventilation monitoring through more rapid assessment of arterial blood gases. Implementing this peri-intubation procedure may reduce the risks associated with transitioning to full mechanical ventilatory support. Optimal implementation necessitates strategies to surmount organizational and behavioral barriers to change.

### Five-year audit of adherence to an anaesthesia pre-induction checklist [^ae8aa4aa]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This 5‐year audit presents the adherence to a pre‐induction checklist for 95,946 anaesthesia procedures with airway management, with overall completion in almost 60% of all procedures. We showed a 4.5% increase in the annual adherence rate. Factors influencing adherence included the type of anaesthesia, variability between anaesthesia teams for different surgical specialities and urgent and daytime procedures. The checklist was used more frequently in the operating theatre, for non‐emergency procedures and during daytime working hours.

Adherence to the surgical WHO checklist improves patient outcomes. The benefit of a pre‐induction checklist has been described as reducing severe life‐threatening events in the intensive care setting. Pre‐hospital data have also demonstrated fewer intubation attempts and higher first‐pass intubation success using a pre‐induction checklist, which then led to their widespread use. For anaesthesia, several studies have reported on pre‐induction checklists, although the evidence for improved patient outcomes is not clear. In a 2020 review, the use of checklists during tracheal intubation was shown to reduce hypoxic events, although this did not impact patient mortality. Such variable results can be explained by the heterogeneity of endpoints – such as the first‐attempt success rate – which will depend more on the clinician's skill than on the use of a checklist. In addition, there is a paucity of studies that have reported on long‐term adherence to pre‐induction checklists. Such quality audits provide data towards a culture of further improvements to patient safety.

### Challenges and advances in intubation: airway evaluation and controversies with intubation [^e4cb210a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Management of the airway is the first priority in any patient. Dealing with a difficult airway can be a challenge, whether or not it involves facemask ventilation, an intermediate airway device, laryngoscopy and intubation, or a surgical airway. Various scales predict which patient is likely to have a difficult airway. The goal of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is to eliminate or mitigate untoward reflex responses to intubation. Although controversy has arisen regarding the various steps in RSI, it remains an essential component of emergency medicine practice.

### Difficult Airway Society 2015 guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults [^b45e6a06]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Postoperative care and follow-up

Difficulties with airway management and the implications for postoperative care should be discussed at the end of the procedure during the sign-out section of the WHO checklist. In addition to a verbal handover, an airway management plan should be documented in the medical record. Many airway guidelines and airway interest groups(including the DAS Extubation and Obstetric Guidelines) recommend that patients should be followed up by the anaesthetist in order to document and communicate difficulties with the airway. There is a close relationship between difficult intubation and airway trauma; patient follow-up allows complications to be recognized and treated. Any instrumentation of the airway can cause trauma or have adverse effects; this has been reported with videolaryngoscopes, second-generation supraglottic devices, and fibre-optic intubation. The American Society of Anesthesiologists closed claims analysis suggests that it is the pharynx and the oesophagous that are damaged most commonly during difficult intubation. Pharyngeal and oesophageal injury are difficult to diagnose, with pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or surgical emphysema present in only 50% of patients. Mediastinitis after airway perforation has a high mortality, and patients should be observed carefully for the triad of pain (severe sore throat, deep cervical pain, chest pain, dysphagia, painful swallowing), fever, and crepitus. They should be warned to seek medical attention should delayed symptoms of airway trauma develop.

Despite these recommendations, communication is often inadequate. – The DAS Difficult Airway Alert Form is a standard template with prompts for documentation and communication. The desire to provide detailed clinical information must be balanced against the need for effective communication. At present, there is no UK-wide difficult airway database, although national systems such as Medic Alert have been advocatedand can be accessed for patients with 'Intubation Difficulties'.

Coding is the most effective method of communicating important information to general practitioners; the code for 'difficult tracheal intubation' is Read Code SP2y3and should be included on discharge summaries. Read Codes in the UK will be replaced by the international SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms) by 2020.

Every failed intubation, emergency front-of-neck access, and airway-related unplanned admission should be reviewed by departmental airway leads and should be discussed at morbidity and mortality meetings.

### Advancing emergency airway management by reducing intubation time at a high-volume academic emergency department [^b17967eb]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Strategies

After several discussions with the team members, we came up with change ideas based on the process mapping and fish bone analysis. PDSA cycles were used to test the change ideas.

PDSA 1: training of frontline residents and nursing officers (class room training)

In the first change idea junior residents and nursing officers of one shift underwent a simulation-based teaching on RSI in the seminar room of the ED. The emergency medicine senior resident and faculty from college of nursing conducted the training session. The frontline team was sensitised about the importance of reducing oxygen desaturation time. Their skills in laryngoscopy and intubation were improved by practising on a manikin under direct supervision of the senior resident and faculty. Each resident was given individual feedback. Through a simulated session, the nursing officers were taught how to facilitate the airway management ensuring all drugs and equipment are ready and functional. Data were collected over 4 weeks and analysed.

PDSA 2: sensitisation of critical care area residents and nursing officers (on-site training)

In order to ensure practice change, short (lasting 10–15 min) on-site training and awareness sessions were organised by senior residents and nursing officers' mentor for on duty residents and nursing officers working in critical care areas of the department. About 10–12 healthcare workers were part of each on-site training. Steps of intubation, logistical issues, drug and equipment checklist were discussed and local issues were resolved. Three such sessions were organised to cover different shift teams. We ensured that data were collected only after the on-site training of healthcare workers.

PDSA 3: streamlining processes by introducing airway drug checklist and ensuring availability of difficult airway equipment

Inputs from the nursing officers were taken during the on-site training and accordingly an RSI drug checklist and bougie was introduced in the resuscitation trolley. The RSI drug checklist contained the doses of frequently used drugs during intubation. The drug list was pasted on the lid of the drug tray ensuring easy check by the nursing team. This prevented medication dosing error and delay between the administration of induction and paralytic agent. Bougie or ET airway introducer useful in the management of difficult airway was not a part of the resuscitation trolley routinely. Making bougie a compulsory part of resuscitation trolley made sure intubation was quicker even in cases of difficult airway.

### The use of checklists in the intensive care unit: a scoping review [^ab8718f4]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

When checklists adherence was low, it was usually due to clinicians' choice not to use the checklist. Clinicians may feel a checklist is not useful, either to a specific patient or in general. Other explanations for low adherence include a short duration of adherence measurement, patients being discharged before checklist use, a lack of training or performance feedback being adopted, or a lack of "checklist champions". Failure to achieve uptake by clinicians is a multifactorial problem, but one which may be further contributed to by the major intensive care societies. Many checklists identified in our scoping review of the published literature were not endorsed by multiple societies. We identified 12 checklists endorsed by the major societies, with limited published literature on either their development, implementation, or efficacy. Three of these were central line insertion checklists, two rounding checklists and seven others focused on unique tasks such as nasogastric tube insertion and intubation. This degree of variation in checklists endorsement by major intensive care societies creates confusion amongst clinicians. COVID-19 demonstrated that universal endorsement of airway management checklists and guidelines by professional societies and specialist colleges led to widespread adoption by practitioners. There is a strong argument that the universal adoption of the best checklist by these societies would significantly improve their use within the clinical environment.

### Using lean tools to improve the efficiency of awake fibreoptic intubation setup [^c07fca3d]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Setup accuracy was documented at the conclusion of each simulation using checklists consisting of predetermined items deemed essential for an awake fibreoptic intubation. This checklist was created by conducting a survey of five attending anaesthesiologists. Seven items were chosen for the accuracy checklists, including three items relevant to both the preintervention and postintervention simulations. There were two items specific to the pre-intervention simulations using the original protocol, and two items specific to the post-intervention simulations using the revised protocol. Statistical comparisons in setup accuracy were limited to the three items present in both the preintervention and postintervention simulation checklists.

Preintervention and postintervention comparisons were made using the chi-square test for proportions and t-test for means. All statistical analyses were performed on STATA V.12.0 (StataCorp). A box plot with medians, IQRs and individual points was created to show the data in comparison to the intervention over time. The timing of simulations was random, reflecting the need for the primary author to conduct simulations during non-clinical time.

### Elective intubation [^712bf64f]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Endotracheal intubation is a commonly performed operating room (OR) procedure that provides safe delivery of anesthetic gases and airway protection during surgery. The most common intubation technique in the perioperative environment is direct laryngoscopy with orotracheal tube insertion. Infrequently, difficulties that require an alternative intubation technique are encountered due to patient anatomy, equipment limitations, or patient pathophysiology. Careful patient evaluation, advanced planning, equipment preparation, system redundancy, use of checklists, familiarity with airway algorithms, and availability of additional help when needed during OR intubations have resulted in exceptional success and safety. Airway difficulties during intubation outside the controlled environment of the OR are more frequent and more serious. Translating the intubation processes practiced in the OR to intubations outside the perioperative setting should improve patient safety. This paper considers each step in the OR intubation process in detail and proposes ways of incorporating perioperative procedures into intubations outside the OR. Management of the physiologic impact of intubation, lack of readily available specialized equipment and experienced help, and planning for transfer of care following intubation are all challenges during these intubations.

### Advancing emergency airway management by reducing intubation time at a high-volume academic emergency department [^15ad67cd]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Background

Airway management is a life-saving procedure in the emergency department (ED). Hypoxia during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Aim

To decrease the median time of intubation (time from administration of paralytic agent to the successful passage of endotracheal tube) by 40% from baseline 300 s in patients undergoing RSI in the ED.

Methods

A multidisciplinary quality improvement team worked to improve the airway management. The bottle necks identified using process mapping and fish bone analysis were lack of formal training of residents and nursing officers, and communication gap between residents and nursing officers. Change ideas focused on training residents in laryngoscopy and intubation and nursing officers in facilitating airway management by preparation of drugs and equipment; on-site awareness of logistical issues to the residents and nursing officers, introducing airway drug checklist and ensuring availability of difficult airway equipment.

Results

After implementation of change ideas there was a significant reduction in intubation time. At the end of first Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle median intubation time was 165 s (IQR 125 s). By the end of last PDSA cycle, median intubation time reduced to 157 s (IQR 66 s). A shift was obtained on the run chart with a new median time of 141.5 s from mid-PDSA 1. The 8-week data after the end of PDSA 3 showed sustainability with median time of 126 s (IQR 42 s).

Conclusion

A well organised team effort, simple change ideas such as structured training of residents and nursing officers, introduction of airway drug checklist and improved communication can decrease the intubation time in a chaotic ED.

### Tracheal intubation in critically ill patients: a comprehensive systematic review of randomized trials [^b4e33910]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Database searches and scanning of references yielded 880 articles. From these we finally identified 22 randomized clinical trials for inclusion in seven areas of interest (Additional file 1: Figure S1): use of a pre-procedure check-list (1 study), pre-oxygenation and apneic oxygenation (6 studies), sedatives (3 studies), neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) (1 study), patient's position (1 study), videolaryngoscopy (9 studies), and post-intubation recruitment maneuver (RM) (1 study).

One multicenter RCT evaluated the efficacy of a verbally performed 10-item pre-intubation checklist compared to no checklist in 262 enrolled critically ill patients: no difference was found in any outcome (lowest peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), lowest systolic blood pressure, number and length of intubation attempts, life-threatening episodes, or in-hospital mortality).

The six RCTs focusing on pre-oxygenation and apneic oxygenation were heterogeneous in treatment and comparator groups. Pre-oxygenation refers to the administration of oxygen before induction (though some oxygen delivery devices used for pre-oxygenation can then be left on after induction or even during laryngoscopy). Apneic oxygenation refers to oxygen applied to a patient who is not spontaneously breathing (i.e. during induction-to-laryngoscopy and laryngoscopy-to-intubation periods). The characteristics and findings of these six RCTs (563 patients overall) are summarized in Table 1. The two studies applying non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for pre-oxygenation compared to standard pre-oxygenation showed positive results In a meta-analysis of the five studies applying high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), stratified for the application as pre-oxygenation tool and/or as apneic oxygenation tool, limited evidence suggests that HFNC is ineffective if used for apneic oxygenation, while it might have some efficacy in improving the levels of lower oxygen saturation, but without improving the incidence of severe desaturation if used for pre-oxygenation (Additional file 1: Figures S2 and S3).

### Revisiting the value of pre-hospital tracheal intubation: an all time systematic literature review extracting the utstein airway core variables [^136343e9]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tracheal intubation (TI) to secure the airway of severely ill or injured patients is a critical intervention regularly conducted by emergency medical service (EMS) providers throughout the world. This activity is based on the assumption that, in keeping with in-hospital practice, a compromised airway should be secured as early as possible to ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation. However, because pre-hospital environmental and infrastructural factors can be challenging, intubation success rates are variable. When TI is performed incorrectly, it can provoke adverse events and may worsen outcome in some patient groups. Even when performed correctly, suboptimal ventilation following TI may increase the risk of fatal outcomes in certain patient subgroups.

The use of pre-hospital TI is widely debated [see Additional data file 1], but the majority of TI-related studies are thought to be of limited value. The core question therefore remains unanswered: does TI in the pre-hospital setting fail or result in adverse events at rates that exceed the benefits of adequately performed TI?

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) and TI are regarded as the standard of care for airway management during in-hospital emergencies. It seems reasonable that this practice should be applied in the pre-hospital phase to prevent delay in good oxygenation and ventilation. However, because of available expertise and pre-hospital external factors, several alternatives to RSI and TI are practised. Environment, equipment, procedures, provider competence, practical skills, and drug protocols vary between emergency rooms and emergency medical service (EMS) systems, among EMS systems, and within EMS systems. These variations have been reported to influence the frequency and quality of TI and, in all likelihood, patient outcome.

However, the heterogeneity of procedures, providers, patients, systems and monitored outcomes makes the published scientific reports difficult to interpret and compare, and inconsistency in the types of data reported exacerbates the problem. To improve reporting, an international expert panel published a consensus-based, Utstein-style template for the uniform reporting of data on pre-hospital advanced airway management. The template defines inclusion criteria along with 28 core variables and 19 optional variables for documenting and reporting data. The 28 core variables are in three groups: "system variables", "patient variables", and "post-intervention variables" (Table 1). In addition, the template recommends that 12 fixed-system variables be reported (Table 2) to accurately describe the particular EMS system from which the data were collected.

### Difficult Airway Society guidelines for awake tracheal intubation (ATI) in adults [^7b89791d]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Awake tracheal intubation has a high success rate and a favourable safety profile but is underused in cases of anticipated difficult airway management. These guidelines are a comprehensive document to support decision making, preparation and practical performance of awake tracheal intubation. We performed a systematic review of the literature seeking all of the available evidence for each element of awake tracheal intubation in order to make recommendations. In the absence of high-quality evidence, expert consensus and a Delphi study were used to formulate recommendations. We highlight key areas of awake tracheal intubation in which specific recommendations were made, which included: indications; procedural setup; checklists; oxygenation; airway topicalisation; sedation; verification of tracheal tube position; complications; management of unsuccessful awake tracheal intubation; post-tracheal intubation management; consent; and training. We recognise that there are a range of techniques and regimens that may be effective and one such example technique is included. Breaking down the key practical elements of awake tracheal intubation into sedation, topicalisation, oxygenation and performance might help practitioners to plan, perform and address complications. These guidelines aim to support clinical practice and help lower the threshold for performing awake tracheal intubation when indicated.

### Tracheal intubation in critically ill patients: a comprehensive systematic review of randomized trials [^19b70d61]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled studies evaluating any drug, technique or device aimed at improving the success rate or safety of tracheal intubation in the critically ill.

Methods

We searched PubMed, BioMed Central, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials and references of retrieved articles. Finally, pertinent reviews were also scanned to detect further studies until May 2017. The following inclusion criteria were considered: tracheal intubation in adult critically ill patients; randomized controlled trial; study performed in Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Department or ordinary ward; and work published in the last 20 years. Exclusion criteria were pre-hospital or operating theatre settings and simulation-based studies. Two investigators selected studies for the final analysis. Extracted data included first author, publication year, characteristics of patients and clinical settings, intervention details, comparators and relevant outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool.

Results

We identified 22 trials on use of a pre-procedure check-list (1 study), pre-oxygenation or apneic oxygenation (6 studies), sedatives (3 studies), neuromuscular blocking agents (1 study), patient positioning (1 study), video laryngoscopy (9 studies), and post-intubation lung recruitment (1 study). Pre-oxygenation with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and/or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) showed a possible beneficial role. Post-intubation recruitment improved oxygenation, while ramped position increased the number of intubation attempts and thiopental had negative hemodynamic effects. No effect was found for use of a checklist, apneic oxygenation (on oxygenation and hemodynamics), videolaryngoscopy (on number and length of intubation attempts), sedatives and neuromuscular blockers (on hemodynamics). Finally, videolaryngoscopy was associated with severe adverse effects in multiple trials.

Conclusions

The limited available evidence supports a beneficial role of pre-oxygenation with NIV and HFNC before intubation of critically ill patients. Recruitment maneuvers may increase post-intubation oxygenation. Ramped position increased the number of intubation attempts; thiopental had negative hemodynamic effects and videolaryngoscopy might favor adverse events.

### Advancing emergency airway management by reducing intubation time at a high-volume academic emergency department [^bd8d507d]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Results

After the implementation of change ideas, there was a significant reduction in the time to intubation (table 2). At the end of the first PDSA, the median time of intubation in 14 patients reduced from baseline 300 s to 165 s (IQR 125 s). The reduction in time difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.293). Though the median time to intubation (165 s) reduced by more than 40% after the first PDSA, the IQR was widely distributed (125 s). So, we continued trying new change ideas to improve the system. We planned to have an on-site training session with the frontline staff which was done as PDSA 2. During the training, we got feedback about simple process gaps. Accordingly, we decided to try PDSA 3 where we introduced airway drug checklist and difficult airway equipment in the resuscitation trolley. The PDSA 3 was implemented the next day after the on-site training, as per the feedback received. So, we analysed PDSA 2 and PDSA 3 together. The median time of intubation further reduced to 157 s (IQR 66 s, p = 0.075) after PDSA 3 over the next 4 weeks. We could achieve 47.6% reduction from 300 s at the end of the third PDSA. A shift was identified at the end of first PDSA and the new median calculated was 141.5 s. The run chart is depicted in figure 2.

Figure 2
Run chart depicting the time of placement of endotracheal (ET) tube after the administration of the paralytic agent. Each data point on X-axis represents the date on which rapid sequence intubation (RSI) was performed. Each data point on the Y-axis represents the time required for successful placement of ET tube into the trachea after the administration of paralytic agent. The baseline median intubation time was 300 s (red line) and the new median was 141.5 s (pink line).

Results of various phases of the study

We collected data for 8 weeks after the PDSA 3 to look for sustainability. The median time of intubation was 126 s (IQR 42 s). The intubation time in the postintervention phase was significantly lower compared with the baseline intubation time (p value 0.003). Monthly short on-site sessions of residents and nursing staff on faster intubation were continued. The training became a part of the induction programme conducted for the newly joined residents and refresher courses in the routine academics.

### Improving the safety of remote site emergency airway management [^b345d8ee]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Strategy

The RSI checklists were printed, laminated, and placed in key locations throughout the hospital. They were placed on the walls in both adult and paediatric resuscitation areas in poster format. In A4 size, they were attached to adult and paediatric resuscitation bay airway trolleys, the difficult intubation trolleys in A&E, ICU and main theatre, and to the new advanced airway equipment bag.

The drugs and advanced airway equipment bags were placed in the ICU pharmacy (drugs bags in fridge), with posters advertising their location. Following discussion at the ICU senior sisters meeting, it was agreed that upon request by the on-call anaesthetist, an appropriately trained ICU nurse would attend emergency situations with the RSI checklist, advanced airway equipment and drugs bags.

The departmental guidelines were updated to include a section providing information about the RSI checklist, drugs bag, advanced airway equipment bag, and availability of assistance. The 1st on-call anaesthetist's roles and responsibilities were also updated to include checking of the drugs and advanced airway equipment bags against their respective inventories at the start of each on-call shift, and replenishing stock if any deficiencies were found and after any clinical use. The use of zip ties on the zips of all bags was also introduced to prevent inadvertent use of the bag contents in non-emergency situations and also to alert users that the bag had been opened and used.

### Five-year audit of adherence to an anaesthesia pre-induction checklist [^024b21ea]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Although patient safety related to airway management has improved substantially over the last few decades, life‐threatening events still occur. Technical skills, clinical expertise and human factors contribute to successful airway management. Checklists aim to improve safety by providing a structured approach to equipment, personnel and decision‐making. This audit investigates adherence to our institution's airway checklist from 1 June 2016 to 31 May 2021. Inclusion criteria were procedures requiring airway management and we excluded all procedures performed solely under regional anaesthesia, sedation without airway management or paediatric and cardiovascular surgery. The primary outcome was the proportion of wholly performed pre‐induction checklists. Secondary outcomes were the pattern of adherence over the 5 years well as details of airway management, including: airway management difficulties; time and location of induction; anaesthesia teams in operating theatres (including teams for different surgical specialities); non‐operating theatre and emergency procedures; type of anaesthesia (general or combined); and urgency of the procedure. In total, 95,946 procedures were included. In 57.3%, anaesthesia pre‐induction checklists were completed. Over the 5 years after implementation, adherence improved from 48.3% to 66.7% (p < 0.001). Anticipated and unanticipated airway management difficulties (e.g. facemask ventilation, supraglottic airway device or intubation) defined by the handling anaesthetist were encountered in 4.2% of all procedures. Completion of the checklist differed depending on the time of day (61.3% during the day vs. 35.0% during the night, p < 0.001). Completion also differed depending on location (66.8% in operating theatres vs. 41.0% for non‐operating theatre anaesthesia, p < 0.001) and urgency of procedure (65.4% in non‐emergencies vs. 35.4% in emergencies, p < 0.001). A mixed‐effect model indicated that urgency of procedure is a strong predictor for adherence, with emergency cases having lower adherence (OR 0.58, 95%CI 0.49–0.68, p < 0.001). In conclusion, over 5 years, a significant increase in adherence to an anaesthesia pre‐induction checklist was found, and areas for further improvement (e.g. emergencies, non‐operating room procedures, night‐time procedures) were identified.

Methods

The development of these guidelines followed the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREE) reporting checklist 36. To ensure these guidelines are supported by best evidence, a systematic review adhering to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) recommendations 37 was performed. We sought published data of relevance to ATI, including decision making, technical performance, complications, training and non‐technical aspects. Details of the search, screening and study selection are shown in the supplementary material (Supporting Information, Appendix S1).

Data from included studies were synthesised and consensus from all 10 members of the guideline group was sought to formulate guideline recommendations using a three‐round Delphi method 38, 39. The first round entailed an initially proposed longlist of recommendations, which were each reviewed and rated for content and clarity. The recommendations in which six or more members of the guideline group approved were shortlisted. A second round of rating was then undertaken, in which the highest rated recommendations were selected. Finally, a third round involving recommendation‐ratification in round‐table discussions was undertaken. These recommendations were based on a number of factors, including: volume and consistency of supportive evidence; applicability and generalisability of the evidence to current practice; and clinical and practical implications of recommendations.

### Checklists for tracheal intubation of critically ill adults… [^4fe5d28f]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Checklist use is almost ubiquitous in life, helping us to remember tasks, groceries, and other commonly forgotten items in our daily routine. High-stakes scenarios that involve potential risk, such as piloting an aircraft, include checklists to ensure the consistent performance of agreed-on essential items that are vital for safe operation. Checklists for these items are also performed among multiple people involved in the operation to create an environment of teamwork and communication. Tracheal intubation of critically ill adults is a high-stakes procedure associated with a number of complications, such as cardiovascular collapse1 and hypoxemia2: has a number of preparatory items experts agree should always be performed; and requires a team to safely perform the procedure. 3 This procedural environment has been, therefore, hypothesized to benefit from checklist use.

In this issue, Turner et al4 report a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial on the association of preparatory procedural checklist use before tracheal intubation of critically ill adults with the primary outcome of mortality. Secondary outcomes included first-attempt success, esophageal intubation, hypotension, cardiac arrest, and hypoxic events. Although mortality is often chosen as the primary outcome, it is difficult to understand any biologically plausible mechanism in which a preprocedural checklist to prepare for a 2-minute procedure, on average, 1–3 would have any mechanistic association with mortality. However, the authors also analyzed procedural- and possibly patient-centered outcomes found no consistent association.

In addition, the robustness of the meta-analysis was limited by the predominance of observational studies and the exclusion of a commonly cited observational study5 of an intubation bundle, which was associated with decreased cardiopulmonary collapse but was not applied in the form of a checklist. It is also unknown which items should be included in a preparatory checklist to improve outcomes. The randomized clinical trial of checklist use for tracheal intubation3 was the only study included in the meta-analysis in which checklist items were created using an iterative process of guideline recommendations, expert recommendations, and consideration of the time-sensitive environment of intubating critically ill adults.

In addition, this meta-analysis could not definitively answer the question of whether there is a small association with outcomes such as mortality because the 95% CI for the point estimate of the association of checklist use with mortality included the potential for small reductions or increases in mortality.

### Improving the safety of remote site emergency airway management [^f9597a6a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Design

Following the survey and assessment of resources a number of interventions were made in order to improve the safety of remote site emergency airway management and to increase the confidence of anaesthetic trainees.

Firstly, an RSI checklist (Annex A) was developed for use prior to any RSI in order to ensure adequate communication, team composition, patient / equipment preparation, and planning for the management of anticipated difficulty or complications.

Two pre-existing drug bags were stocked to include all emergency anaesthetic and peri-arrest and cardiac arrest drugs. Appropriately sized syringes, needles, and drug labels were also included in a user-friendly and uniform layout. A photographic inventory with drug list was also attached to each bag to help in re-stocking after each use (Annex B).

An advanced airway bag was developed to include all equipment required for emergency, difficult, and failed intubations. It included the equipment required to perform all stages of the Difficult Airway Society (DAS) failed intubation guidelines. An inventory was also composed and attached to the bag to help in re-stocking after each use (Annex C).

As per NAP4 guidance, capnography is fundamental to aid confirmation and monitoring of endotracheal intubation regardless of the site of intubation, therefore, carbon dioxide detector filters were procured (following discussion with and approval from the Clinical Director) and these formed part of the airway equipment bag.

Each part of the above package was subjected to open consultation from all anaesthetic consultants and trainees, theatre sisters and staff, ICU sisters and staff, outreach team members, A&E consultants, and resuscitation officers. A number of modifications were undertaken from the draft versions based on valid suggestions occurring during the consultation period.

### Clinical guidelines and standardization of practice to improve outcomes: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 792 [^683f31ba]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Protocols and checklists have been shown to reduce patient harm through improved standardization and communication. Implementation of protocols and guidelines often is delayed because of lack of health care provider awareness or difficult clinical algorithms in medical institutions. However, the use of checklists and protocols clearly has been demonstrated to improve outcomes and their use is strongly encouraged. Checklists and protocols should be incorporated into systems as a way to help practitioners provide the best evidence-based care to their patients.

### The use of checklists in the intensive care unit: a scoping review [^a44d2e79]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This scoping review has identified an increasing use of checklists within the ICU. Five checklist categories were most frequently described and utilised during rounding, delirium screening, handover, CLABSI prevention and airway management. Although checklists are being used in ICU globally, 45% of research included in this study was published from the USA. Most checklists identified were physical checklists; however, use of electronic checklists has increased over the past 10 years. The length of most ICU checklists varied between six and 20 items, with checklists identified in guidelines being longer (averaging 41 items). The uptake of recommended checklists has been excellent, with the median adherence rate ranging from 73 to 91%. Significant clinical and process of care outcomes associated with checklist use that we identified were also overwhelmingly positive.

The ICDSC, a delirium screening checklist, was the most ubiquitous individual checklist in the ICU specific literature, as well as the most validated. Other checklist types appear to have vastly more implementation studies than validation data. Checklist development was highly variable. Most checklists were taken from a previous study (41%), although more than half these were delirium screening checklist studies. Following this, iterative development was the most common development process (20%) followed by those modified or adapted from previous institutional checklists before implementation (11%). In one of four checklists identified, the development process was not specified (28%).

Checklists were frequently implemented alongside education, training, or other interventions unique to the checklist studied. A considerable portion of articles failed to provide sufficient detail of their intervention, and as such, we opted not to apply the TIDieR tool to assess the reproducibility of the included papers' interventions. Validation of some of the specific checklists identified is evident by current guidelines which support the use of the ICDSC, central line insertion checklists, procedural checklists, and intubation checklists. Unfortunately, few articles reported post-intervention data used to modify the checklist studied and improve its efficacy.

### 2022 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway [^8d37731d]. Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Unanticipated and emergency difficult airway management — interventions and evidence signals: Airway management of an unanticipated or emergency difficult airway consists of interventions addressing (1) calling for help, (2) optimization of oxygenation, (3) use of a cognitive aid, (4) noninvasive airway management devices, (5) combination techniques, (6) invasive airway management interventions, and (7) ECMO. The literature is insufficient to evaluate patient outcomes associated with the immediate access to airway management support equipment or calling for help, and the literature is also insufficient to evaluate difficult airway patient outcomes associated with the use of a visual aid, cognitive aid, or algorithm for unanticipated or emergency difficult airways. Nonrandomized studies comparing videolaryngoscopes with direct laryngoscopes reported equivocal findings for intubation success with difficult airways in emergency departments (Category B1-E evidence), observational studies indicated successful videolaryngoscope-guided intubation rates after failed intubation ranging from 92 to 100% for unanticipated and emergency difficult airways (Category B4-B evidence), and a retrospective observational study reported a flexible bronchoscopy success rate of 78% for intubation rescue after failed direct laryngoscopy (Category B3-B evidence).

### AAGBI: safer pre-hospital anaesthesia 2017: Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^6b43c1da]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are existing local and national guidelines for pre‐hospital emergency anaesthesia (PHEA) and airway management 2, 4. Since the first version of these UK guidelines was produced 1, significant developments have taken place in UK pre‐hospital care. The number of air ambulances staffed with doctor–paramedic teams in the UK has increased, and with this the frequency of PHEA. Pre‐hospital emergency medicine (PHEM) has been recognised by the General Medical Council as a subspecialty, and pre‐hospital training organisations are required to demonstrate clear evidence of a clinical governance structure.

Although the evidence base for pre‐hospital care and PHEA is still of relatively low quality, much has been published recently. For example, available data on pre‐hospital tracheal intubation failure rates have more than tripled, and have been used as one indicator to confirm the importance of experience and training in successful pre‐hospital anaesthesia 5, 6, 7.

In 2007, the 'Trauma: who cares?' National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) report documented poor pre‐hospital airway management 8. A significant proportion of seriously injured patients were delivered to emergency departments with airway compromise, and this is not unique to the UK 9. More recently, it has been demonstrated that, in a significant number of trauma patients, basic and advanced airway management without PHEA does not reliably correct airway compromise 10.

The majority of severely ill and injured patients have intact airway reflexes, and require drugs to facilitate tracheal intubation. In contrast, tracheal intubation has not been shown to improve outcome in patients with cardiac arrest 11, and drugs are not usually required to facilitate tracheal intubation in this patient group.

Many UK pre‐hospital services have aspired to achieve the key message of the AAGBI 2009 Pre‐hospital anaesthesia guidelines – that, despite variable pre‐hospital conditions, the standard of care delivered should be the same as that for in‐hospital emergency anaesthesia 1. Recent evidence has shown that anaesthesia in the Emergency Department is not without problems 12, and the standardisation of technique, along with safety adjuncts such as pre‐induction checklists are probably essential in both the pre‐hospital and Emergency Department environments.

### Airway management in emergency department thoracotomy: a narrative review [^eb5f3c21]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) is a high-risk, life-saving intervention for patients in traumatic cardiac arrest. A critical component of EDT is airway management, typically performed by emergency physicians, yet formal guidance regarding optimal strategies remains limited. Airway management in this setting is uniquely complex due to concurrent anatomic injury, physiologic instability, and the procedural demands of thoracotomy.

Discussion

Endotracheal intubation (ETI) during EDT presents multiple challenges. Anatomic difficulties may arise from facial or cervical trauma, restricted positioning, and the presence of cervical collars. Cognitive load is heightened by the chaotic, multidisciplinary environment, requiring strategies such as pre-briefing, checklists, and closed-loop communication. To optimize outcomes, the most experienced operator should perform ETI, preferably using video laryngoscopy, which improves visualization and confirmation of tube placement. Adjunctive measures to facilitate procedural success include preparation for airway contamination, selective mainstem intubation to facilitate surgical exposure, and orogastric tube placement to aid intra-thoracic orientation. While supraglottic devices or surgical airways may serve as temporizing options, definitive endotracheal access remains the standard. Ventilation management must be closely coordinated with the thoracotomy team, with adjustments for single-lung ventilation, reduced tidal volumes, and decompression as indicated.

Conclusions

Airway management during EDT requires technical expertise, adaptability, and seamless communication between emergency physicians and surgical teams. Video laryngoscopy, selective ventilation strategies, and early orogastric tube placement can optimize procedural success. Protocolized, team-based approaches are essential to overcoming the unique airway challenges of EDT.

### The use of checklists in the intensive care unit: a scoping review [^ae00c49f]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical checklists remain the most identified medium utilised, with an increasing use of the electronic checklist over the past decade demonstrated by this review. It is suspected that most of the checklist mediums that were not specified were likely physical checklists which would further emphasise the dominance of paper checklists in ICUs. Increasing trends in electronic media is possibly due to advancements capability or increased use of electronic medical records (EMR). As shown in this study, more dynamic checklists which draw on EMR data to allow patient specific modification is possible through the use of electronic media.

To our knowledge, this is the first published scoping review on the use and efficacy of checklists within the ICU but other reviews on related topics have previously been published. We identified one other scoping review on quality improvement tools for the nursing care of long stay patients in the ICU. Ten systematic reviews on specific checklists have been published since 2012. Six of the systematic reviews analysed delirium screening checklists specifically and one was published for each of the other four checklist types we identified. The results of these reviews mostly aligned with the outcomes of our scoping review. The systematic reviews on the ICDSC, a delirium screening checklist, were supportive of its use following the assessment of its validity. One systematic review on bedside ward round checklists found significant improvements in ICU length of stay (ICU LOS) and mechanical ventilation (MV) duration which were also the two most improved clinical outcomes identified by our scoping review. The systematic reviews on handover checklists affirmed the improvements in information transfer and omissions found in our review. One systematic review on CLABSI prevention interventions reported that checklists significantly reduced the risk of CLABSIs. A systematic review on intubation checklists in critically ill patients did not find any significant outcomes in its ICU subgroup (n = 3 studies) while our review identified a few significant positive outcomes from the use of airway management checklists. This scoping review significantly adds to the results from these reviews and also provides context around the development and implementation methods of the checklists, how they are currently used, and the clinical guidelines that recommend their use.

### What families have in the emergency tracheostomy kits: identifying gaps to improve patient safety [^091aaeb7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the contents of parent-created emergency tracheostomy kits and identify deficiencies.

Methods

This was an observational study. Data on emergency tracheostomy kits were abstracted for 30 consecutive children who had a tracheostomy tube in situ during an outpatient clinic visit with the Division of Respiratory Medicine and/or the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children between February 1 and October 30, 2016. A checklist of 12 essential items based on expert consensus was used to evaluate each tracheostomy kit.

Results

Emergency tracheostomy kits from all children were missing at least one item from the 12-item checklist. Nineteen (63%) kits had three or more critical items missing. All kits had the same size tracheotomy tube. Twenty-two (73%) kits did not have a half size smaller tracheostomy tube. Fifteen (50%) were missing a manual resuscitation bag and four (13.3%) were missing a suction machine. Children who had tracheostomy tube in situ for ≥ 4 years were more likely to have ≥ 3 missing items in their kit (43.4%) compared to those who had tracheostomy tube for < 4 years (20%), (χ2 (1) = 9.85, P = 0.0017).

Conclusion

Maintenance of a fully stocked emergency tracheostomy kit can save a child's life. It is incumbent upon healthcare providers to ensure ongoing reassessment of knowledge and skills required to care for a child with a tracheostomy tube and to regularly review the components of a child's emergency tracheostomy kit.

### Use and implementation of standard operating procedures and checklists in prehospital emergency medicine: a literature review [^3e05d16c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This review aimed to analyze published literature to introduce the use and implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklists in prehospital emergency medicine and their impact on guideline adherence and patient outcome.

Methods

An English literature search was carried out using the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Springer, Elsevier, and ProQuest databases. Original articles describing the use and implementation of SOPs or checklists in prehospital emergency medicine were included. Editorials, comments, letters, bulletins, news articles, conference abstracts, and notes were excluded from the analysis. Relevant information was extracted relating to application areas, development of SOPs/checklists, educational preparation and training regarding SOPs/checklists implementation, staff attitudes and the effects of SOPs/checklists use on guideline adherence and patient outcomes.

Results

The literature search found 2187 potentially relevant articles, which were narrowed down following an abstract review and a full text review. A final total of 13 studies were identified that described the use and implementation of SOPs (9 studies) and checklists (4 studies) in different areas of prehospital emergency medicine including prehospital management of patients with acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute coronary syndrome, prehospital airway management, medical documentation, Emergency Medical Services triage, and transportation of patients.

Conclusions

The use and implementation of SOPs and checklists in prehospital emergency medicine have shown some benefits of improving guidelines adherence and patient outcomes in airway management, patient records, identification and triage, and other prehospital interventions. More research in this area is necessary to optimize the future use and implementation of SOPs and checklists to improve emergency personnel performance and patient outcomes.

### Committee opinion no. 680 summary: the use and development of checklists in obstetrics and gynecology [^221f0e45]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Checklist implementation in obstetrics and gynecology emphasizes accessibility, role clarity, and strategies for team adoption. Each checklist should be readily accessible to the team in an emergency situation. Checklists can be turned into posters and mounted on the walls in operating rooms, kept in a binder at the patient's bedside or embedded into electronic health records and used as a forcing function, or made into laminated cards to be hung from equipment carts or into forms to be placed in equipment packages. Key considerations include "Who completes the checklist and signals when it is time to use it?" and whether there is "someone who is designated as a reader who does not have responsibilities other than completing the checklist and maybe monitoring how much time has passed?" All of these issues need to be addressed to ensure successful implementation, and critical to this is strong but flexible leadership that is focused on the goal of improving the quality of care and willing to accept input from frontline users. However, in one study, 97% of practitioners reported that if they were the patient, they would want the team to use a checklist during a critical event (7).

### Radical evolution: the 2015 Difficult Airway Society guidelines for managing unanticipated difficult or failed tracheal intubation [^930e11d6]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

There is little doubt that these guidelines incorporate advances made in airway management since 2004. They will change day-to-day practice of anaesthesia, as outlined above, from pre-operative airway assessment, to integrating the WHO team briefing, to the use and provision of equipment and drugs, and the recording of information on the anaesthesia chart. They will inform the later analysis of any critical airway incidents, especially as documentation and postoperative management are addressed, and they will encourage training in a range of techniques. Taken together, not quite a revolution but certainly a very 'radical evolution'. Assessment of the utility of the new guidelines should consider if they can be used as tools to enhance knowledge and training, or in addition as a prosthesis to bridge the gap between the requirements of and our abilities during emergencies. Formal testing may reveal which aspects of their design, complex as it is, may distract from, rather than enhance, airway management during crises. All guidelines represent a standard of care or a normative approach to a clinical problem. As such, they not only help guide clinicians, but they also provide the broader community with the opportunity to improve standards, to ensure equipment is available, and that training for the skills and processes required are in place to ensure successful adoption.

### Surgical checklists: a systematic review of impacts and implementation [^bdd9aadd]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Harms

Direct harms of surgical checklists have not been reported. In 2011, Sewell et al reported that after WHO implementation, the rate of lower respiratory tract infections actually increased from 2.1% to 2.5%. Whether this increase was caused by the checklist is unclear; however the authors attributed rate reductions to the checklist, so they could also have attributed rate increases to the checklist. Despite the absence of reported direct harms, some checklist users have expressed concern regarding potential harms. For instance, some worry that checklist use decreases OR efficiency or creates unnecessary patient anxiety. In 2011, Kearns et al reported that 3 months after WHO checklist implementation, 30% believed it was an inconvenience in emergency cases; however, this percentage was lower than it had been prior to implementation of the checklist when staff were asked hypothetically whether they believed it would be an inconvenience in emergency cases (53% said it would be). OR efficiency might also be compromised if checklists duplicated already existing safety procedures or if nurses responsible for performing the checklist were unfamiliar with its execution due to high staffing turnover. In one study, staff expressed concerns that prompting patients for their name several times immediately before induction of anaesthesia might create unnecessary anxiety.

### Difficult Airway Society 2015 guidelines for management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults [^5228bec5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

For any plan to work well in an emergency, it must be known to all members of the team and should be rehearsed. For rare events, such as CICO, this rehearsal can be achieved with simulation training, as has recently been included in the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists continuing professional development requirements. This also provides the opportunity to develop non-technical skills, such as leadership, team coordination, communication, and shared understanding of roles, which has been shown to improve performance in intensive care and trauma teams.

Structured communication between anaesthetists and anaesthetic assistants could help prepare for and deal with airway difficulties. Talking before every patient, or at least before every list, about the plan to manage difficulties should they develop is good practice. At a minimum, this involves thinking about the challenges that might be encountered and checking that the appropriate equipment is available.

If airway management does become difficult after induction of anaesthesia, a clear declaration of failure at the end of each plan will facilitate progression through the airway strategy. The use of a structured communication tool, such as PACE (Probe, Alert, Challenge, Emergency), can aid communication of concerns when cognitive overload and hierarchical barriers might otherwise make this difficult.

Our profession must continue to acknowledge and address the impact of environmental, technical, psychological, and physiological factors on our performance. Human factors issues at individual, team, and organizational levels all need to be considered to enable these 2015 guidelines to be as effective as possible.

### Structured performance assessment in three pediatric emergency scenarios: a validation study [^6003e775]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop and validate 3 performance evaluation checklists (PECs) for systematic performance assessment in 3 clinical scenarios: cardiopulmonary arrest, dyspnea with oxygen desaturation after intubation, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Study Design

The 3 PECs were developed using an integrative approach and used to rate 50 training sessions in a simulator environment by different raters. Construct validity was tested by correlating the checklist scores with external constructs (ie, global rating, team experience level, and time to action). Further interrater reliability was tested for all 3 PECs.

Results

The PECs for the desaturation and cardiopulmonary arrest scenarios were valid and reliable, whereas the PEC for RSV had limited validity and reliability.

Conclusion

For 2 pediatric emergencies, the PEC is a valid and reliable tool for systematic performance assessment. The unsatisfactory results for the PEC for RSV may be related to limitations of the simulation setting and require further investigation. Structured assessment of clinical performance can augment feedback on technical performance aspects and is essential for training purposes as well as for research. Only reliable and valid performance measures will allow medical educators to accurately evaluate the behavioral effects of training interventions and further enhance the quality of patient care.

### Reducing the incidence of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation during rapid sequence intubation in a paediatric emergency department [^cd9f8a49]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the standard for definitive airway management in emergency medicine. In a video-based study of RSI in a paediatric emergency department (ED), we reported a high degree of process variation and frequent adverse effects, including oxyhaemoglobin desaturation (SpO2 < 90%). This report describes a multidisciplinary initiative to improve the performance and safety of RSI in a paediatric ED.

Methods

We conducted a local improvement initiative in a high-volume academic paediatric ED. We simultaneously tested: (1) an RSI checklist, (2) a pilot/copilot model for checklist execution, (3) the use of a video laryngoscope and (4) the restriction of laryngoscopy to specific providers. Data were collected primarily by video review during the testing period and the historical period (2009–2010, baseline). We generated statistical process control charts (G-charts) to measure change in the performance of six key processes, attempt failure and the occurrence of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation during RSI. We iteratively revised the four interventions through multiple plan-do-study-act cycles within the Model for Improvement.

Results

There were 75 cases of RSI during the testing period (July 2012-September 2013). Special cause variation occurred on the G-charts for three of six key processes, attempt failure and desaturation, indicating significant improvement. The frequency of desaturation was 50% lower in the testing period than the historical (16% vs 33%). When all six key processes were performed, only 6% of patients experienced desaturation.

Conclusions

Following the simultaneous introduction of four interventions in a paediatric ED, RSI was performed more reliably, successfully and safely.

### The unanticipated difficult intubation in obstetrics [^31bf68d0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

In this focused review, we discuss an algorithm specifically for the unanticipated difficult intubation in obstetrics. This generic algorithm emphasizes a standardized and prespecified sequence of interventions to provide safe, efficient, and effective airway management for the emergency obstetric surgical patient. Individual institutions and anesthesia providers are encouraged to use this framework to select specific pieces of equipment for each step, and to create regular opportunities for all obstetric anesthesia providers to become facile with each airway device and to integrate the algorithm under simulated conditions.

### Society of Interventional Radiology IR pre-procedure patient safety checklist by the safety and health committee [^5399e441]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion — electronic checklists are encouraged because patient-specific information can be loaded before the start of the case, data can be linked and tracked for future reference, and they may help reduce paper checklist errors; checklist items should be individualized to the needs of the institution and should be kept simple (≤ 10 items), and the checklist should be allowed to evolve over time with addition or removal of items as needed.

### Usability testing via simulation: optimizing the NEAR4PEM preintubation checklist with a human factors approach [^f8e998b1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To inform development of a preintubation checklist for pediatric emergency departments via multicenter usability testing of a prototype checklist.

Methods

This was a prospective, mixed methods study across 7 sites in the National Emergency Airway Registry for Pediatric Emergency Medicine (NEAR4PEM) collaborative. Pediatric emergency medicine attending physicians and senior fellows at each site were first oriented to a checklist prototype, including content previously identified using a modified Delphi approach. Each site used the checklist in 2 simulated cases: an "easy airway" and a "difficult airway" scenario. Facilitators recorded verbalization, completion, and timing of checklist items. After each simulation, participants completed an anonymous usability survey. Structured debriefings were used to gather additional feedback on checklist usability. Comments from the surveys and debriefing were qualitatively analyzed using a framework approach. Responses informed human factors-based optimization of the checklist.

Results

Fifty-five pediatric emergency medicine physicians/fellows (4–13 per site) participated. Participants found the prototype checklist to be helpful, easy to use, clear, and of appropriate length. During the simulations, 93% of checklist items were verbalized and more than 80% were completed. Median time to checklist completion was 6.2 minutes (interquartile range, 4.8–7.1) for the first scenario and 4.2 minutes (interquartile range, 2.7–5.8) for the second. Survey and debriefing data identified the following strengths: facilitating a shared mental model, cognitively offloading the team leader, and prompting contingency planning. Suggestions for checklist improvement included clarifying specific items, providing more detailed prompts, and allowing institution-specific customization. Integration of these data with human factors heuristic inspection resulted in a final checklist.

Conclusions

Simulation-based, human factors usability testing of the National Emergency Airway Registry for Pediatric Emergency Medicine Preintubation Checklist allowed optimization prior to clinical implementation. Next steps involve integration into real-world settings utilizing rigorous implementation science strategies, with concurrent evaluation of the impact on patient outcomes and safety.

### Checking all the boxes: a checklist for when and how to use checklists effectively [^502799e5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Checklists are a type of cognitive aid used to guide task performance; they have been adopted as an important safety intervention throughout many high-risk industries. They have become an ubiquitous tool in many medical settings due to being easily accessible and perceived as easy to design and implement. However, there is a lack of understanding for when to use checklists and how to design them, leading to substandard use and suboptimal effectiveness of this intervention in medical settings. The design of a checklist must consider many factors including what types of errors it is intended to address, the experience and technical competencies of the targeted users, and the specific tools or equipment that will be used. Although several taxonomies have been proposed for classifying checklist types, there is, however, little guidance on selecting the most appropriate checklist type, nor how differences in user expertise can influence the design of the checklist. Therefore, we developed an algorithm to provide guidance on checklist use and design. The algorithm, intended to support conception and content/design decisions, was created based on the synthesis of the literature on checklists and our experience developing and observing the use of checklists in clinical environments. We then refined the algorithm iteratively based on subject matter experts' feedback provided at each iteration. The final algorithm included two parts: the first part provided guidance on the system safety issues for which a checklist is best suited, and the second part provided guidance on which type of checklist should be developed with considerations of the end users' expertise.
