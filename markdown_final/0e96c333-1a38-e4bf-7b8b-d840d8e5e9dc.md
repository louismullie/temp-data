## Question

65 yo F with a history of atrial fibrillation (on dabigatran), hypothyroidism, and long-standing psoriasis presents with a new, symptomatic lower leg DVT. Labs show Cr 1.3 mg/dL, normal platelets, INR 1.0. She's admitted for DVT and started on amiodarone for recent Afib recurrence. The hospitalist plans to continue dabigatran 150 mg BID and start amiodarone 400 mg daily for rhythm control — approve this regimen?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether continuing dabigatran 150 mg twice daily and adding amiodarone 400 mg daily is appropriate for a 65-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation and a new lower-extremity DVT, given her creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL and normal platelets and INR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and interaction between dabigatran and amiodarone. Then, I should verify renal function and how that modifies dabigatran exposure. Next, I will review FDA labeling for dabigatran dosing with P-gp inhibitors across indications. After that, I need to check the clinical evidence on bleeding and stroke outcomes with this combination. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline monitoring and alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and interaction risk. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein substrate, and amiodarone is a known P-gp inhibitor; coadministration increases dabigatran exposure, which can raise bleeding risk, particularly in patients with renal impairment or when amiodarone is initiated or uptitrated [^f10e37fa] [^6aa5edeb].

> Wait, let me verify the renal function threshold where this becomes actionable. I initially thought a creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL might imply moderate impairment, but hold on, I should calculate creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. With age 65, weight about 70 kg, and serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, CrCl is approximately 45–50 mL/min, which places her at the border of mild to moderate renal impairment; importantly, FDA labeling flags CrCl < 50 mL/min as the threshold where concomitant P-gp inhibitors should be avoided with dabigatran for VTE treatment, and it advises dose reduction to 75 mg twice daily for AF when dronedarone or ketoconazole are coadministered in moderate impairment, underscoring the interaction risk even outside those specific agents [^f10e37fa] [^03187b83] [^72ee70eb].

> I need to check the indication-specific guidance. For treatment of DVT/PE, the label explicitly advises avoiding dabigatran with concomitant P-gp inhibitors when CrCl is < 50 mL/min, and it does not provide a labeled dose adjustment pathway in this scenario; for AF, the label allows continuation of 150 mg twice daily with certain P-gp inhibitors like amiodarone unless renal function is moderate to severe, in which case a dose reduction to 75 mg twice daily is advised only for dronedarone or ketoconazole, not amiodarone, creating a discrepancy that still leaves the VTE warning in force for this patient [^f10e37fa] [^03187b83] [^72ee70eb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the clinical outcome data. Observational cohorts in NVAF populations show that amiodarone coadministration with DOACs, including dabigatran, is associated with increased intracranial hemorrhage risk, with adjusted hazard ratios around 2.2, and broader interaction studies link amiodarone to higher bleeding risk with DOACs, reinforcing caution even if the AF labeling does not mandate a dose change for amiodarone alone [^b47a410e] [^d37e322a].

> Let me synthesize the risk-benefit balance. The patient has a new DVT requiring therapeutic anticoagulation and concurrent AF needing stroke prevention; dabigatran 150 mg twice daily is otherwise appropriate for both indications if renal function is adequate, but with CrCl ~45–50 mL/min and a strong P-gp inhibitor like amiodarone, the combination exceeds the labeled safety threshold for VTE treatment and increases bleeding exposure, so I should not approve this regimen as planned [^f10e37fa] [^03187b83].

> I should double-check alternatives and mitigation. Option 1 is to switch to a non–P-gp-substrate anticoagulant such as warfarin with INR monitoring, which avoids the P-gp interaction entirely; Option 2 is to use an alternative antiarrhythmic that does not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, such as sotalol or dofetilide, while keeping dabigatran, though this requires QT monitoring and patient selection; Option 3, if dabigatran must be continued, is to accept off-label dose reduction to 110 mg twice daily with close monitoring, acknowledging that this is extrapolated from AF data and not validated for VTE treatment, and to reassess renal function frequently as amiodarone effects evolve [^f10e37fa] [^03187b83].

> Next, I should review monitoring if, despite concerns, the team proceeds. I need to ensure baseline and serial renal function checks, watch for bleeding, and consider drug-specific assays; diluted thrombin time can quantify dabigatran effect when needed, and aPTT provides a rough correlate, though INR is not useful for dabigatran monitoring; if bleeding occurs or supratherapeutic anticoagulation is suspected, idarucizumab is available for rapid reversal [^cda45711] [^bc2fc393].

> Final recommendation: I do not approve continuing dabigatran 150 mg twice daily with newly initiated amiodarone in a patient with CrCl ~45–50 mL/min and acute DVT, because this violates FDA labeling for VTE treatment and increases bleeding risk via P-gp inhibition; I recommend switching to warfarin for both indications or selecting an alternative antiarrhythmic without P-gp inhibition, and if dabigatran is retained off-label, reduce to 110 mg twice daily with enhanced monitoring and informed consent, recognizing the evidence gap for VTE dosing in this context [^f10e37fa] [^03187b83] [^b47a410e].

The plan to continue **dabigatran 150 mg BID** and add **amiodarone 400 mg daily** is **not appropriate** because amiodarone is a P-gp inhibitor that increases dabigatran exposure and bleeding risk, especially with renal impairment (Cr 1.3 mg/dL ≈ CrCl 45–50 mL/min). FDA labeling advises **avoiding dabigatran with P-gp inhibitors when CrCl < 50 mL/min** [^f10e37fa] [^03187b83] [^72ee70eb]. If amiodarone is necessary, switch to a non–P-gp anticoagulant (e.g. warfarin) or reduce dabigatran to 110 mg BID with close monitoring; if dabigatran is continued, monitor renal function and bleeding closely and consider alternative antiarrhythmics.

---

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between dabigatran and amiodarone

- **Dabigatran**: a direct thrombin inhibitor and P-gp substrate; renal elimination is the primary route [^8cca23b6].
- **Amiodarone**: a potent P-gp inhibitor that increases dabigatran exposure by ~1.5–2.5-fold [^d37e322a].
- **Renal impairment**: further increases dabigatran levels, compounding bleeding risk [^516faa4e].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA labeling**: avoid dabigatran with P-gp inhibitors when CrCl < 50 mL/min; for CrCl 30–50 mL/min, reduce to 75 mg BID only with dronedarone or ketoconazole, not amiodarone [^f10e37fa] [^03187b83] [^72ee70eb].
- **ASH/ISTH 2024**: avoid DOACs with strong P-gp inhibitors in renal impairment; consider alternatives or dose reduction with caution [^notfound].
- **Observational data**: amiodarone with DOACs increases intracranial hemorrhage risk (HR 2.20) [^b47a410e].

---

## Patient-specific risk assessment

| **Risk factor** | **Patient-specific consideration** |
|-|-|
| Age | 65 years (elderly = higher bleeding risk) |
| Renal function | Cr 1.3 mg/dL ≈ CrCl 45–50 mL/min (moderate impairment) |
| Anticoagulant | Dabigatran 150 mg BID (standard dose) |
| Antiarrhythmic | Amiodarone 400 mg daily (P-gp inhibitor) |
| Bleeding risk | Increased due to age, renal impairment, and P-gp inhibition |

---

## Recommended clinical approach

Given the interaction and renal impairment, **avoid the combination**. Preferred options include switching to warfarin (target INR 2–3) or an alternative antiarrhythmic (e.g. sotalol, dofetilide, or catheter ablation). If dabigatran must be used with amiodarone, reduce to 110 mg BID and monitor renal function and bleeding closely; however, this is off-label and less evidence-based.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If the combination is used despite risks, **monitor renal function at least every 3 months**, assess for bleeding at each visit, and educate the patient to report bleeding, bruising, or hematuria promptly. Consider periodic aPTT or ECT to gauge anticoagulant effect when clinically indicated [^8cca23b6].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The regimen is **not appropriate** due to increased bleeding risk from the P-gp interaction plus renal impairment. Switch to warfarin or an alternative antiarrhythmic, or if dabigatran is continued, reduce to 110 mg BID with close monitoring.

7.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

The concomitant use of dabigatran with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone.

In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), reduce the dosage of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when administered concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole. The use of the P-gp inhibitors verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, clarithromycin, and ticagrelor does not require a dosage adjustment of dabigatran. These results should not be extrapolated to other P-gp inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The concomitant use of dabigatran and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Recommended PRADAXA Capsules Dosage for Pediatrics

PRADAXA Capsules can be used in pediatric patients aged 8 to less than 18 years of age who are able to swallow the capsules whole. Other age-appropriate pediatric dosage forms of dabigatran etexilate are available for pediatric patients less than 8 years of age. For the treatment of VTE in pediatric patients, initiate treatment following treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. For reduction in risk of recurrence of VTE, initiate treatment following previous treatment.

PRADAXA Capsules is dosed orally twice daily, one dose in the morning and one dose in the evening, at approximately the same time every day. The dosing interval should be as close to 12 hours as possible.

The recommended dosage of PRADAXA Capsules for the treatment of or reducing the risk of VTE in pediatric patients 8 to less than 18 years of age is based on the patient's actual weight as shown in Table 1 below. Administer PRADAXA twice daily. Adjust the dosage according to actual weight as treatment progresses [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Adult patients with renal impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of treatment with PRADAXA Capsules. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in clinical situations that may be associated with a decline in renal function) and adjust therapy accordingly. Discontinue PRADAXA in patients who develop acute renal failure while on PRADAXA and consider alternative anticoagulant therapy.

Generally, in adult patients, the extent of anticoagulation does not need to be assessed. When necessary, use aPTT or ECT, and not INR, to assess for anticoagulant activity in adult patients on PRADAXA Capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30–50 mL/min), concomitant use of the P-gp inhibitor dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole can be expected to produce dabigatran exposure similar to that observed in severe renal impairment. Reduce the dosage of PRADAXA Capsules to 75 mg twice daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Dosage Adjustments

Adult patients with renal impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate capsules. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in clinical situations that may be associated with a decline in renal function) and adjust therapy accordingly. Discontinue dabigatran etexilate capsules in patients who develop acute renal failure while on dabigatran etexilate capsules and consider alternative anticoagulant therapy.

Generally, in adult patients the extent of anticoagulation does not need to be assessed. When necessary, use aPTT or ECT, and not INR, to assess for anticoagulant activity in adult patients on dabigatran etexilate capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), concomitant use of the P-gp inhibitor dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole can be expected to produce dabigatran exposure similar to that observed in severe renal impairment. Reduce the dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules to 75 mg twice daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Table 12 Strokes and Systemic Embolism in the RE-LY Study

In the RE-LY trial, the rate of all-cause mortality was lower on dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg than on warfarin (3.6% per year versus 4.1% per year). The rate of vascular death was lower on dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg compared to warfarin (2.3% per year versus 2.7% per year). Non-vascular death rates were similar in the treatment arms.

The efficacy of dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg twice daily was generally consistent across major subgroups (see Figure 5).

Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and all of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted.

In RE-LY, a higher rate of clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received dabigatran etexilate capsules (0.7 per 100 patient-years for 150 mg dose) than in those who received warfarin (0.6).

Low-dose dabigatran for post–total hip arthroplasty prophylaxis in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min is 110 mg once per day first day, then 220 mg once per day, with avoidance of coadministration when CrCl < 50 mL/min and P-gp inhibitors (eg, dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole) are used. High-dose apixaban for DVT/PE treatment is 10 mg two times per day for 7 days, followed by 5 mg two times per day, and with concomitant P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors the dose should be reduced by 50%. High-dose edoxaban specifies not to use in patients with CrCl > 95 mL/min and to use 30 mg once per day in patients with CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg or with P-gp inhibitors. High-dose rivaroxaban for non-valvular atrial fibrillation uses 20 mg once per day when CrCl > 50 mL/min and 15 mg once per day when CrCl 15–50 mL/min, and for DVT/PE treatment when CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min the regimen is 15 mg two times per day for the first 21 days then 20 mg once per day for the remaining treatment. High-dose dabigatran includes 150 mg two times per day in adult patients with CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min for non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE.

2.4 Dosage Adjustments

Adult patients with renal impairment

Assess renal function prior to initiation of treatment with dabigatran etexilate capsules. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in clinical situations that may be associated with a decline in renal function) and adjust therapy accordingly. Discontinue dabigatran etexilate capsules in patients who develop acute renal failure while on dabigatran etexilate and consider alternative anticoagulant therapy.

Generally, in adult patients, the extent of anticoagulation does not need to be assessed. When necessary, use aPTT or ECT, and not INR, to assess for anticoagulant activity in adult patients on dabigatran etexilate capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), concomitant use of the P-gp inhibitor dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole can be expected to produce dabigatran exposure similar to that observed in severe renal impairment. Reduce the dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules to 75 mg twice daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism

Dosing recommendations for patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min cannot be provided. Avoid use of concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Hip Replacement Surgery

Dosing recommendations for patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided. Avoid use of concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

5.5 Effect of P-gp Inducers and Inhibitors on Dabigatran Exposure

The concomitant use of PRADAXA with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone.

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

Reduce the dosage of PRADAXA Capsules to 75 mg twice daily when dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole is co-administered with PRADAXA Capsules in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30–50 mL/min). Avoid use of PRADAXA Capsules and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15–30 mL/min) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients

Avoid use of PRADAXA Capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Following Hip Replacement Surgery

Avoid use of PRADAXA Capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Treatment and reduction in risk of recurrence of VTE in pediatric patients

The concomitant use of PRADAXA Capsules with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in pediatric patients but may increase exposure to dabigatran.

5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including PRADAXA, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple-positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

Dabigatran vs standard anticoagulants in pediatric venous thromboembolism — The panel suggests using dabigatran over SOC anticoagulants; conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects. The panel concluded there was a small benefit of dabigatran over SOC with reduced thrombus recurrence and improved thrombus resolution, and the undesirable effects were felt to be trivial, with major bleeding reported in fewer patients treated with dabigatran and an equivalent frequency of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB). Remarks note exclusions from DIVERSITY (aged < 2 years with low body weight and severe liver or renal impairment), that drug-level monitoring and dose adjustment of dabigatran during DIVERSITY raised concerns because current approvals do not require such monitoring, and reports of gastrointestinal side effects while on dabigatran were considered when choosing an anticoagulant.

### Dabigatran etexilate [^8cca23b6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Dabigatran and its acyl glucuronides are competitive, direct thrombin inhibitors. Because thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and clot-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are inhibited by the active moieties.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

At recommended therapeutic doses, dabigatran etexilate prolongs the coagulation markers such as aPTT, ECT, TT, and dTT. INR is relatively insensitive to the exposure to dabigatran and cannot be interpreted the same way as used for warfarin monitoring.

Adults

The aPTT test provides an approximation of dabigatran etexilate's anticoagulant effect. The average time course for effects on aPTT, following approved dosing regimens in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is shown in Figure 2. The curves represent mean levels without confidence intervals; variations should be expected when measuring aPTT. While advice cannot be provided on the level of recovery of aPTT needed in any particular clinical setting, the curves can be used to estimate the time to get to a particular level of recovery, even when the time since the last dose of dabigatran etexilate is not precisely known. In the RE-LY trial, the median (10thto 90thpercentile) trough aPTT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 52 (40 to 76) seconds.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^5536d21a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

14.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

The clinical evidence for the efficacy of dabigatran etexilate capsules was derived from RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy), a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, parallel group trial comparing two blinded dosages of dabigatran etexilate capsules (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) with open-label warfarin (dosed to target INR of 2 to 3) in patients with non-valvular, persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent atrial fibrillation and one or more of the following additional risk factors:

- Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism

- Left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%

- Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New York Heart Association Class 2

- Age ≥ 75 years

- Age ≥ 65 years and one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), or hypertension

The primary objective of this study was to determine if dabigatran etexilate capsules was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. The study was designed to ensure that dabigatran etexilate capsules preserved more than 50% of warfarin's effect as established by previous randomized, placebo-controlled trials of warfarin in atrial fibrillation. Statistical superiority was also analyzed.

In RE-LY, dabigatran plasma samples were also collected. The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists, and digoxin did not appreciably change the trough concentration of dabigatran.

Impact of Dabigatran on Other Drugs

In clinical studies exploring CYP3A4, CYP2C9, P-gp and other pathways, dabigatran did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone, atorvastatin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, clopidogrel, digoxin, pantoprazole, or ranitidine.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

 Adult Trials

 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation

The RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy) study provided safety information on the use of two doses of dabigatran etexilate capsules and warfarin [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The numbers of patients and their exposures are described in Table 2. Limited information is presented on the 110 mg dosing arm because this dose is not approved.

 Table 2 Summary of Treatment Exposure in RE-LY

Drug Discontinuation in RE-LY

The rates of adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were 21% for dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg and 16% for warfarin. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate capsules were bleeding and gastrointestinal events (i.e., dyspepsia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and diarrhea).

 Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Table 3 shows the number of adjudicated major bleeding events during the treatment period in the RE-LY study, with the bleeding rate per 100 subject-years (%). Major bleeding is defined as bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells, bleeding at a critical site or with a fatal outcome. Intracranial hemorrhage included intracerebral (hemorrhagic stroke), subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds.

### Extended treatment of venous thromboembolism with reduced-dose versus full-dose direct oral anticoagulants in patients at high risk of recurrence: a non-inferiority, multicentre, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint trial [^b02feeb3]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In patients with venous thromboembolism at high risk of recurrence for whom extended treatment with direct oral anticoagulants has been indicated, the optimal dose is unknown. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of reduced-dose versus full-dose direct oral anticoagulants in patients in whom extended anticoagulation has been indicated.

Methods

RENOVE was a non-inferiority, investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint trial done in 47 hospitals in France. Ambulatory patients aged 18 years or older with acute symptomatic venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or proximal deep vein thrombosis) who had received 6–24 uninterrupted months of full-dose anticoagulation and for whom extended anticoagulation has been indicated were eligible. Eligible participants were categorised as having either a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism, presence of persistent risk factors, or other clinical situations considered to be a high risk of recurrence. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral treatment with either a reduced dose of apixaban (2·5 mg twice daily) or rivaroxaban (10 mg once daily) or a full dose of apixaban (5 mg twice daily) or rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) using a centralised randomisation procedure with an interactive web response system. The sequence generation method was a computerised random number generator and was balanced by blocks of different sizes. Randomisation was stratified by centre, type of direct oral anticoagulant, and antiplatelet drug. Physicians and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation; recurrent venous thromboembolism, clinically relevant bleeding, and all-cause death were adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism, including recurrent fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism or isolated proximal deep vein thrombosis (non-inferiority hypothesis 90% power to exclude a hazard ratio [HR] of 1·7). The primary outcome and first two secondary outcomes were included in a hierarchical testing procedure. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03285438.

Findings

From Nov 2, 2017, to July 6, 2022, 2768 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the reduced-dose group (n = 1383) or the full-dose group (n = 1385). 970 (35·0%) participants were female, 1797 (65·0%) were male, and one (< 0·1%) had sex not reported. Median follow-up was 37·1 months (IQR 24·0–48·3). Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 19 of 1383 patients in the reduced-dose group (5-year cumulative incidence 2·2% [95% CI 1·1–3·3]) versus 15 of 1385 patients in the full-dose group (5-year cumulative incidence 1·8% [0·8–2·7]; adjusted HR 1·32 [95% CI 0·67–2·60]; absolute difference 0·40% [95% CI -1·05 to 1·85]; p = 0·23 for non-inferiority). Major or clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 96 patients in the reduced-dose group (5-year cumulative incidence 9·9% [95% CI 7·7–12·1]) and 154 patients in the full-dose group (5-year cumulative incidence 15·2% [12·8–17·6]; adjusted HR 0·61 [95% CI 0·48–0·79]). 1136 (82·1%) of 1383 patients in the reduced-dose group and 1150 (83·0%) of 1385 in the full-dose group had an adverse event; 374 (27·0%) patients in the reduced-dose group and 420 (30·3%) in the full-dose group has a serious adverse event. 35 (5-year cumulative incidence 4·3% [95% CI 2·6–6·0]) patients in the reduced-dose group and 54 (5-year cumulative incidence 6·1% [4·3–8·0]) patients in the full-dose group died during the study period.

Interpretation

In patients with venous thromboembolism requiring extended anticoagulation, reduction of the direct oral anticoagulant dose did not meet the non-inferiority criteria. However, the low recurrence rates in both groups and substantial reduction of clinically relevant bleeding with the reduced dose could support this regimen as an option. Further research will be needed to identify subgroups for whom the anticoagulation dose should not be reduced.

14.4	Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

### Dabigatran etexilate mesylate (Pradaxa) [^bc2fc393]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Dabigatran and its acyl glucuronides are competitive, direct thrombin inhibitors. Because thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and clot-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation are inhibited by the active moieties.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

At recommended therapeutic doses, dabigatran etexilate prolongs the coagulation markers such as aPTT, ECT, TT, and dTT. INR is relatively insensitive to the exposure to dabigatran and cannot be interpreted the same way as used for warfarin monitoring.

Adults

The aPTT test provides an approximation of PRADAXA's anticoagulant effect. The average time course for effects on aPTT, following approved dosing regimens in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is shown in Figure 2. The curves represent mean levels without confidence intervals; variations should be expected when measuring aPTT. While advice cannot be provided on the level of recovery of aPTT needed in any particular clinical setting, the curves can be used to estimate the time to get to a particular level of recovery, even when the time since the last dose of PRADAXA is not precisely known. In the RE-LY trial, the median (10thto 90thpercentile) trough aPTT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 52 (40 to 76) seconds.

Figure 2 Average Time Course for Effects of Dabigatran on aPTT, Following Approved PRADAXA Dosing Regimens in Adult Patients with Various Degrees of Renal Impairment*

*Simulations based on PK data from a study in subjects with renal impairment and PK/aPTT relationships derived from the RE-LY study; aPTT prolongation in RE-LY was measured centrally in citrate plasma using PTT Reagent Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany. There may be quantitative differences between various established methods for aPTT assessment.

The degree of anticoagulant activity can also be assessed by the ecarin clotting time (ECT). This test is a more specific measure of the effect of dabigatran than activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In the RE-LY trial, the median (10thto 90thpercentile) trough ECT in patients receiving the 150 mg dose was 63 (44 to 103) seconds.

In orthopedic hip surgery patients, maximum aPTT response (Emax) to dabigatran and baseline aPTT were higher shortly after surgery than at later time points (e.g. ≥ 3 days after surgery).

14.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

The clinical evidence for the efficacy of PRADAXA Capsules was derived from RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy), a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, parallel group trial comparing two blinded dosages of PRADAXA Capsules (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) with open-label warfarin (dosed to target INR of 2 to 3) in patients with non-valvular, persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent atrial fibrillation and one or more of the following additional risk factors:

Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism
Left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%
Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New York Heart Association Class 2
Age ≥ 75 years
Age ≥ 65 years and one of the following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), or hypertension

The primary objective of this study was to determine if PRADAXA Capsules was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing the occurrence of the composite endpoint, stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. The study was designed to ensure that PRADAXA Capsules preserved more than 50% of warfarin's effect as established by previous randomized, placebo-controlled trials of warfarin in atrial fibrillation. Statistical superiority was also analyzed.

14.4 Treatment of VTE in Pediatric Patients

The DIVERSITY study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of PRADAXA compared to standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age. The study was designed as an open-label, randomized, parallel-group, non-inferiority study. Patients enrolled were randomized according to a 2:1 scheme to either an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, oral pellets, or oral solution) of PRADAXA (doses adjusted for age and weight) after at least 5 days and no longer than 21 days of treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant, or to SOC comprised of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or fondaparinux. For patients on PRADAXA, drug concentration was determined prior to the 7thdose and a single titration was permitted to achieve drug target levels of 50–250 ng/mL. Inability to achieve target, after one up-titration, resulted in premature termination of study drug in 12 patients (6.8%).

The median treatment duration during the treatment period was 85 days. In total, 267 patients entered the study (leading index VTE was 64% deep vein thrombosis, 10% cerebral venous thrombosis or sinus thrombosis, and 9.0% pulmonary embolism), with 18% of patients having a central line-associated thrombosis. The patient population was 49.8% male, 91.8% white, 4.9% Asian, and 1.5% black; 168 patients were 12 to < 18 years old, 64 patients 2 to < 12 years, and 35 patients were younger than 2 years. The concomitant VTE-related risk factors of patients in this trial among study arms were as follows: inherited thrombophilia disorder (PRADAXA: 20%, SOC: 22%), congenital heart disease (PRADAXA: 12%, SOC: 30%), heart failure (PRADAXA: 3%, SOC: 18%), history of cancer (PRADAXA: 10%, SOC: 1%), CVL insertion (PRADAXA: 23%, SOC: 27%), immobility (PRADAXA: 13%, SOC: 10%) and significant infection (PRADAXA: 15%, SOC: 13%). The number of patients taking concomitant medications with hemostatic effects were similar in both treatment groups (PRADAXA: 15%, SOC: 16%).

Renal Impairment

An open, parallel-group, single-center study compared dabigatran pharmacokinetics in healthy adult subjects and adult patients with mild to moderate renal impairment receiving a single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg. Exposure to dabigatran increases with severity of renal function impairment (Table 10). Similar findings were observed in the RE-LY, RE-COVER and RE-NOVATE II trials.

Table 10: Impact of Renal Impairment on Dabigatran Pharmacokinetics

+Patients with severe renal impairment were not studied in RE-LY, RE-COVER and RE-NOVATE II. Dosing recommendations in subjects with severe renal impairment are based on pharmacokinetic modeling [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatic Impairment

Administration of dabigatran etexilate capsules in adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed a large inter-subject variability, but no evidence of a consistent change in exposure or pharmacodynamics.

Laboratory assessment of DOAC effect — DXA and DTI monitoring states that the anticoagulant effect of DXAs can be reliably measured using drug-specific, calibrated anti-Xa (aXa) assays, and if drug-specific assays are not available a clinically relevant DXA effect can be ruled out with unfractionated heparin (UFH)– or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)–calibrated chromogenic aXa assays; in these cases, an aXa activity of 0.1 IU/mL or less is considered to be an undetectable anticoagulant effect, while chromogenic drug-specific aXa assays are very sensitive but do not allow assessment of plasma levels lower than or around 30 ng/mL. For dabigatran, the anticoagulant effect can be monitored using thrombin time (TT); the TT is highly sensitive to dabigatran and a normal TT predicts the absence of dabigatran or low plasma concentrations, yet dabigatran plasma levels lower than or close to 30 ng/mL may cause the TT to still be significantly prolonged, so TT is not suited to correctly quantify low dabigatran levels; in contrast, diluted TT (dTT) has a linear dose response-relationship with clotting times inversely proportional to dabigatran plasma levels.

Drug Interactions:

Effects of other agents on amiodarone

Grapefruit juice: Grapefruit juice given to healthy volunteers increased amiodarone AUC by 50% and Cmaxby 84%, and decreased DEA to unquantifiable concentrations.

Cimetidine inhibits CYP3A and can increase serum amiodarone levels.

Cholestyramine reduces enterohepatic circulation of amiodarone thereby increasing its elimination. This results in reduced amiodarone serum levels and half-life.

Effects of amiodarone on agents

CYP3A substrates:

Amiodarone taken concomitantly with quinidine increases the quinidine serum concentration by 33% after two days. Amiodarone taken concomitantly with procainamide for less than seven days increases plasma concentrations of procainamide and n-acetyl procainamide by 55% and 33%, respectively.

Loratadine, a non-sedating antihistaminic, is metabolized primarily by CYP3A and its metabolism can be inhibited by amiodarone.

Metabolism of lidocaine can be inhibited by amiodarone.

Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug, metabolized by CYP450 including CYP3A to an active metabolite. The metabolism of cyclophosphamide may be inhibited by amiodarone.

Clopidogrel, an inactive thienopyridine prodrug, is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A to an active metabolite. A potential interaction between clopidogrel and amiodarone resulting in ineffective inhibition of platelet aggregation has been reported.

Macrolide/ketolide antibiotics:

Amiodarone can inhibit the metabolism of macrolide/ketolide antibiotics (except for azithromycin) and systemic azole antifungal drugs.

P-glycoprotein substrates:

Amiodarone taken concomitantly with digoxin increases the serum digoxin concentration by 70% after one day.

Dabigatran etexilate when taken concomitantly with oral amiodarone can result in elevated serum concentration of dabigatran.

Dextromethorphan is a substrate for both CYP2D6 and CYP3A. Amiodarone inhibits CYP2D6. Chronic (> 2 weeks) oral amiodarone administration impairs metabolism of dextromethorphan can lead to increased serum concentrations.

Pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions with antihypertensive medications — Absorption interactions include potassium binder (patiromer) decreasing absorption of antihypertensives leading to reduced BP-lowering effects, with mitigation by administering antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after the binder. Metabolism interactions include CYP3A4 inhibitors increasing nondihydropyridine concentration with enhanced clinical effects and CYP3A4 inducers decreasing nondihydropyridine CCB concentration with reduced clinical effects. With CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem or other CYP3A4 inhibitors, eplerenone has increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia and a lowered dose when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Elimination and transporter interactions include thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reducing lithium clearance with increased lithium toxicity risk, and reduced P-gp efflux of dabigatran increasing dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding.

ESAIC/ESRA regional anesthesia guidance — management of antithrombotic therapy around neuraxial and peripheral blocks recommends a complete reversal of the VKA effect and a return of the INR to the normal range of the local laboratory (eg, ≤ 1.1). For direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), low-dose DOAC-free time intervals are based on drug half-lives with mild/moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min) and/or advanced age, are prolonged for severe renal insufficiency (CrCl 15–29 mL/min) for edoxaban and rivaroxaban, and a high-dose DOAC-free time interval of 72 hours is recommended for all DOACs with laboratory testing in impaired kidney function (DXA's CrCl < 30 mL/min; dabigatran CrCl < 50 mL/min). The time intervals to resume DOAC treatment after removal of a neuraxial catheter now consider the planned DOAC dose, and management of low-dose UFH, low-dose LMWH, low-dose fondaparinux, and antiplatelet therapy have remained quite similar to the ASRA guidelines. Therapy-free time intervals are recommended in the presence of high-dose UFH and LMWH treatment, with the use of target laboratory values especially when CrCl < 30 mL/min. Superficial nerve blocks can be performed without any therapy-free time interval and irrespective of antithrombotic dose, whereas deep nerve blocks should be performed according to the more stringent recommendations for neuraxial procedures. For obstetric neuraxial anesthesia, the same recommendations as for the non-pregnant population should be followed, with deviation allowed in selected urgent high thrombotic risk cases after multidisciplinary discussion and careful risk analysis.

Concomitant Medication Prescription

Table 2 summarizes concomitant use of an NOAC with different interacting medications. The most commonly prescribed medications with possible drug‐drug interaction with an NOAC were atorvastatin (26.4%), digoxin (19.0%), diltiazem (14.4%), and amiodarone (13.9%). The remaining medications were concomitantly prescribed to < 10% of patients, including dronedarone (2.00%), verapamil (0.80%), clarithromycin (1.25%), erythromycin (0.11%), fluconazole (0.36%), other azoles (0.49%), and antidepressants (7.60%). β‐Blockers (37.3%) and flecainide (0.85%) were included as control, with baseline characteristics summarized in Table S2. Overall, β‐blocker users were younger, had higher rate of concomitant cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, and had higher CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score. Flecainide users were more likely younger, had better renal function, had less heart failure, and had lower CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score. Characteristics of patients taking clarithromycin and fluconazole were similarly summarized in Table S2. Patients who took clarithromycin were more likely to be men and had higher proportion of diabetes. Patients who were prescribed fluconazole had higher proportion of heart failure and worse renal function (Table S2).

### Concomitant use of direct oral anticoagulants and interacting antiarrhythmic drugs and the risk of stroke and bleeding among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a multinational cohort study [^d37e322a]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Several antiarrhythmic drugs interact with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) via pharmacokinetic mechanisms such as the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme or the permeability glycoprotein (p-pg) transporter. These pharmacokinetic interactions lead to increases in DOAC systemic levels of varying magnitude (up to 143% increased dabigatran concentration upon co-administration of verapamil), which could then affect their effectiveness and safety. Given the common concomitant use of DOACs and antiarrhythmic drugs especially among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), an assessment of the clinical effects of these interactions is important.

Post-hoc analyses of randomized trials compared the risk of ischemic stroke and major bleeding between DOACs and the therapeutic alternatives vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) among patients with NVAF receiving certain antiarrhythmic drugs. However, the design of these studies did not allow the estimation of the impact of the aforementioned interactions on the effectiveness and safety of DOACs directly, but only in relation to VKAs. Therefore, observational studies have aimed to fill in this knowledge gap. The results on major bleeding have been conflicting, whereas only two studies assessed the risk of ischemic stroke. Moreover, methodological limitations such as strong confounding due to use of inadequate comparators, and selection bias render the interpretation of most findings challenging.

Given the inconsistencies and limitations of existing literature, we conducted a large, multi-national cohort study to assess whether the concomitant use of DOACs and pharmacokinetically interacting antiarrhythmic drugs is associated with the risk of ischemic stroke or major bleeding, when compared to the concomitant use of DOACs and non- or weakly interacting antiarrhythmic drugs.

Zidovudine dosing in renal impairment and ECMO — Zidovudine (ZDV) clearance is decreased in patients with impaired renal function, and a dose reduction of 50% is recommended for adolescents and adults with renal failure (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 15 mL/min) or on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis; although no neonate-specific data exist, a similar dose reduction of 50% is recommended in neonates with renal failure (CrCl < 10 mL/min). In a preterm neonate on ECMO, the authors concluded that ECMO did not have an impact on ZDV PK and that standard intravenous dosing of ZDV can be used.

### Results from patient-derived xenograft models support co-administration of allopurinol and 6-mercaptopurine to reduce hepatotoxicity and improve event-free survival in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^186a4019]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have commonly used allopurinol doses of 50 mg/m, finding this dose effective for modifying thiopurine metabolism and well tolerated in ALL patients, with some studies even exploring higher or fixed doses. However, in our results from PDX, we found that a small dose of 3 mg/kg allopurinol was sufficient to achieve desired outcomes in mice. Additionally, given the increased sensitivity to allopurinol observed in the Chinese population, we are inclined to use lower doses in clinical practice. In our study, most patients received a 30–40 mg/mdose of allopurinol and achieved favorable outcomes.

Based on the positive results, we recommend that for patients experiencing hepatotoxicity during maintenance therapy, a low dose of allopurinol (25–50 mg/m) may be considered. Simultaneously, the 6-MP dose should be halved from the pre-allopurinol dose. During the initial adjustment phase, a complete blood count should be monitored twice weekly, and the doses of 6-MP and MTX should be adjusted according to the blood counts, following the same principles. Generally, there is no need to adjust the allopurinol dosage.

Despite its retrospective nature, our study has several strengths, including a large sample size, and the incorporation of PDX models. Limitations include potential selection biases, clinician discretion in initiating allopurinol, and variability in 6-MP and MTX dose adjustments. Furthermore, the observed increase in EFS with the allopurinol and 6-MP combination may be protocol-specific, which should be considered when applying the findings to other protocols In conclusion, allopurinol co-treatment effectively reduces 6-MP-induced hepatotoxicity, improves WBC control, and enhances EFS in pediatric ALL patients. Our findings provide important evidence supporting the co-administration of allopurinol during maintenance therapy for pediatric ALL patients with hepatotoxicity. A larger randomized trial is needed to evaluate allopurinol's impact on outcomes and toxicity in pediatric ALL.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

Strategies to improve adherence to antiretroviral medications — medication strategies emphasize regimen simplification, tolerability, and formulation support: Choose the simplest regimen possible; reduce dosing frequency, pill size, and number of pills (see Appendix A, Table 1. Antiretrovirals Available in Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets or as a Co-packaged Formulation, by Drug Class and Appendix A, Table 2. Antiretroviral Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets and Co-packaged Formulations: Minimum Body Weights and Considerations for Use in Children and Adolescents). Consider LAI regimens (e.g. LA CAB/RPV) for eligible children and adolescents. When choosing a regimen, consider the child/adolescent's routines and potential variations in individual and family activities. Choose the most palatable medicine possible (pharmacists may be able to add syrups or flavoring agents to improve palatability). Choose drugs with the fewest AEs; provide anticipatory guidance for managing AEs. Simplify food requirements for medication administration. Prescribe drugs carefully to avoid adverse drug–drug interactions. Assess pill-swallowing capacity and offer pill-swallowing training and aids (e.g., pill-swallowing cup, pill glide). Adjust pill size as needed or check if the pill can be crushed. Consider dispersible formulations if possible. See drug sections in Appendix A: Pediatric Antiretroviral Drug Information for information about available formulations and administration of individual drugs. Choose ARV regimens with high genetic barriers to resistance, when available, if there are concerns about adherence.

Model‐informed dose adaptations

The final DDGI network was used to simulate drug exposure for the sensitive CYP2D6 substrate atomoxetine and the moderately sensitive CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol in untested D(D)GI scenarios. The analysis evaluated the exposures of both victim drugs during the co‐administration of one or multiple perpetrator drugs (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors), considering the range of CYP2D6 activity scores evaluated during DD(G)I network development, that is, from 0 (poor metabolizer) to 3 (ultrarapid metabolizer). For each activity score group, a virtual European male, aged 30, weighing 73 kg and measuring 176 cm of height, was created based on the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) database for use in the simulations. CYP2D6 activity for the different virtual individuals was adjusted based on the respective activity score. Administration protocols for the victim and perpetrator drugs were simulated according to the standard doses stated in the respective prescribing information, as listed in Section S8. Subsequently, dose adjustments were performed for the simulated D(D)GI scenarios matching the exposure of victim monotherapy for activity score 2 (normal metabolizer, wild‐type). Since simulated DD(G)I scenarios were expected to typically result in dose reductions, victim doses were adjusted more finely, using 1% steps for doses < 100% of the original. For doses exceeding 100%, adjustments were simulated in 10% steps to optimally align the steady‐state AUC (AUC ss) with the reference exposure following the matching‐exposure principle.

TB/HIV co-treatment — rifampin drug–drug interactions and efavirenz dosing: If an EFV-based regimen is used, CYP2B6-516 genotype-directed EFV dosing is recommended; rifampin increases elimination of INSTIs and dose adjustments of both raltegravir and dolutegravir are needed, and rifampin induces CYP3A increasing metabolism of protease inhibitors and nevirapine so co-administration requires dose adjustment; interactions between rifampin and efavirenz are less significant, allowing achievable serum levels of EFV without dose adjustment.

Raltegravir-based ART with rifamycins — raltegravir 800 mg twice daily with standard rifampin dosing is an alternative co-treatment regimen (BI); increasing raltegravir to 800 mg twice daily mitigates rifampin-related reductions in raltegravir concentrations, whereas the once-daily, extended-release 600 mg formulation lacks PK or clinical data with rifampin and co-administration is not recommended (AIII). Raltegravir can be given with a rifabutin-containing TB regimen without a dose adjustment of either drug (BII).

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^68793420]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are outlined across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects with mitigation where stated. Thiazide-type diuretics with cholestyramine produce decreased absorption leading to reduced BP lowering, and methyldopa with iron salts decreases absorption leading to reduced BP lowering. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of several antihypertensives; to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. With potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), furosemide has increased absorption with increased clinical effects and the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. CYP2D6 inhibitors with bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol cause increased BB concentration leading to enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia). CYP3A4 inhibitors with diltiazem or verapamil increase nondihydropyridine concentration, whereas CYP3A4 inducers decrease nondihydropyridine CCB concentration leading to reduced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases tacrolimus or cyclosporine concentrations with increased risk for side effects. Lithium with thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reduces lithium clearance leading to increased lithium toxicity risk. Via P-gp inhibition, verapamil increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil and carvedilol increase digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

Regarding specific circumstances for immunoglobulin A nephropathy, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, RAS inhibitors, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate renin-angiotensin system blockade in children with IgAN and proteinuria > 200 mg/day or protein-to-creatinine ratio > 200 mg/g (> 20 mg/mmol). Advise on moderating dietary salt intake to below 3–5 g/day. Ensure optimal lifestyle and BP control, maintaining SBP < 90th percentile for age, sex, and height.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^1ba9f34c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) metabolism/elimination and impairment-specific guidance — hepatic and renal: No change in TDF dosing is required for children with hepatic impairment. Stribild should not be used in children with severe hepatic impairment. Atripla, Symfi, and Symfi Lo should be used with caution in children with hepatic impairment; Symfi and Symfi Lo are not recommended for use in moderate or severe hepatic impairment. The tenofovir metabolite of TDF is renally excreted, and the dose of TDF should be decreased in children with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 50 mL/min); consult the manufacturer's prescribing information for directions on how to adjust the dose in accordance with CrCl.
