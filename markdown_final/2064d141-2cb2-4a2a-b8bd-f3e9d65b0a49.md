## Question

What is the recommended dose of lactulose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the recommended dose of lactulose, including how it is dosed across indications and ages, with clear titration targets and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative sources and labeled indications. Then, I should define the standard concentration to convert mL to grams accurately. Next, I will lay out adult dosing for hepatic encephalopathy (acute and maintenance), followed by adult dosing for chronic constipation. After that, I will review pediatric dosing and titration targets. I should then incorporate guideline-based adjustment principles, special populations and drug–drug considerations, and finally validate with trial data before synthesizing the practical dosing recommendations and monitoring plan [^111Z8S7s] [^117KjC1u].

> Let me first confirm the primary sources and indications to avoid any missteps. The FDA prescribing information is the highest authority for dosing details, and lactulose is labeled for portal-systemic encephalopathy (hepatic encephalopathy) and chronic constipation; the dosing is indication-specific and provided in mL with equivalent grams based on a fixed solution concentration, which I need to verify before converting anything further [^111Z8S7s] [^117KjC1u] [^114swavR].

> I will now examine adult dosing for hepatic encephalopathy and make sure I don't jump to conclusions about the acute phase. For overt HE, the label supports an initial rapid laxation approach of 30–45 mL (20–30 g) every hour until catharsis is achieved, then transitioning to maintenance at 30–45 mL three or four times daily, with explicit titration to 2–3 soft stools per day; if aspiration risk is present (impending coma or coma), rectal administration is considered until oral therapy is feasible; I should confirm the titration target alignment with guidelines, which emphasize achieving 2–3 bowel movements per day for secondary prevention [^111Z8S7s] [^111LvfNU].

> Wait, let me verify adult dosing for chronic constipation because it is lower and often misunderstood. The labeled regimen starts at 15–30 mL (10–20 g) once daily, with the option to increase up to 60 mL daily as needed, and the onset may require 24–48 hours; I initially thought twice-daily might be standard, but the label clearly states once daily as the usual start, so I should correct that in my mental model and ensure mL-to-gram conversions are consistent with the standard concentration here [^117KjC1u] [^111LUiX4].

> Next, I should review the standard solution concentration to avoid dosage conversion errors. Both adult HE and constipation sections in the labels consistently equate 15 mL to 10 g of lactulose, establishing a standard of 0.67 g/mL; this consistency lets me interconvert grams and milliliters confidently during titration and documentation [^111Z8S7s] [^117KjC1u].

> Let me consider pediatric dosing and make sure to align with the label titration principle. For infants, the recommended initial daily oral dose is 2.5–10 mL given in divided doses; for older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40–90 mL, again titrated to achieve 2–3 soft stools daily, and if diarrhea occurs, the dose should be reduced promptly; I should also remember the caution for hyponatremia and dehydration in infants receiving lactulose and ensure monitoring plans reflect this risk [^111Z8S7s] [^115Hg2uE].

> Hold on, I should verify and emphasize the titration targets and what we use to guide them. Across indications, the practical target is 2–3 soft stools per day, but I need to be careful not to over-rely solely on frequency; incorporating stool consistency, such as using the Bristol Stool Scale, can refine dosing adjustments, and there is emerging evidence that bowel movement frequency alone may not correlate with cognitive outcomes in cirrhosis, which reminds me to individualize and avoid overly aggressive titration that induces dehydration or electrolyte imbalance [^111LvfNU] [^111XsCUy] [^111DtcWR].

> I need to ensure special populations and precautions are explicitly addressed. Since the solution contains galactose and lactose, caution is needed in diabetes and it is contraindicated in patients requiring a low-galactose diet; hepatic or renal impairment does not require dose adjustment, but diarrhea-induced fluid and electrolyte losses, including hypokalemia and hypernatremia, must be monitored; I should confirm interactions as well, noting that concurrent oral anti-infectives like neomycin and nonabsorbable antacids may blunt acidification and reduce efficacy, so clinical response should be monitored closely when these are coadministered [^115Hg2uE] [^115se3tS] [^113ib81i] [^116QmwGM] [^114DSKEM].

> Next, I should review the evidence base to corroborate dosing ranges and clinical expectations. Randomized data in overt HE commonly used 30–60 mL three times daily and demonstrated higher rates of HE reversal when rifaximin was added to lactulose, supporting guideline-endorsed secondary prophylaxis strategies; acute management data also indicate that PEG can accelerate early clinical improvement versus lactulose at 24 hours, though lactulose remains first-line with rifaximin as adjunct for recurrence prevention, and FDA labeling for rifaximin confirms improved outcomes when combined with lactulose compared with rifaximin alone in preventing breakthrough episodes [^113S3zVL] [^116xuBtE] [^111QdVSH] [^1152huWY] [^111LvfNU] [^116UhTKF].

> Let me synthesize dosing by indication while keeping the titration rules front and center. For overt hepatic encephalopathy, use 30–45 mL every hour initially until laxation, then 30–45 mL three or four times daily, titrating every 1–2 days to achieve 2–3 soft stools daily; for chronic constipation, start at 15–30 mL once daily and increase up to 60 mL daily as needed, recognizing the 24–48 hour onset; use the standard concentration of 10 g per 15 mL for accurate conversions and documentation, and always adjust based on clinical response rather than fixed doses alone [^111Z8S7s] [^117KjC1u] [^111LvfNU].

> I should double-check that safety and tolerability points are actionable. Common effects include gas, cramping, and diarrhea, with excessive dosing risking dehydration, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia; to improve palatability and adherence, mixing the solution with water, milk, or juice is acceptable, and during the initial HE phase, avoid adding other laxatives that could mask whether the lactulose dose is adequate; if diarrhea occurs, reduce the dose promptly and reassess electrlytes and volume status, especially in frail or infant patients [^113ixGC7] [^1165FBr6] [^117KjC1u] [^115Hg2uE].

Lactulose is titrated to achieve 2–3 soft stools per day [^111LvfNU], with **initial dose 10–20 g/day** [^111LUiX4] for constipation and **30–45 mL every 1–2 hours** [^111Z8S7s] for acute hepatic encephalopathy until catharsis, then maintenance 15–30 mL two to three times daily [^1152huWY]. For chronic HE prevention, use **15–30 mL two to three times daily** [^111LvfNU], adjusting to stool output. Pediatric dosing is 2.5–10 mL/day for infants and 40–90 mL/day for older children, divided and titrated to 2–3 soft stools/day [^111Z8S7s]. Monitor for diarrhea [^113ixGC7], electrolyte disturbances, and dehydration; reduce dose if diarrhea occurs [^1165FBr6].

Dosage and administration

- **Oral**: For adults, the usual oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (30 to 45 ml, containing 20 g to 30 g of lactulose) three or four times daily. The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily. Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of lactulose may be used to induce rapid laxation during the initial phase of therapy for portal-systemic encephalopathy. Once the laxative effect is achieved, the dose may be reduced to the recommended daily amount. Improvement in the patient's condition may occur within 24 hours, but it may not begin before 48 hours or even later. Continuous long-term therapy is advised to lessen the severity and prevent recurrence of portal-systemic encephalopathy, using the same recommended daily dose.

- **Pediatric**: There is very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents. Consistent with adult treatment goals, the objective is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily. For infants, the recommended initial daily oral dose is 2.5 to 10 mL in divided doses. For older children and adolescents, the total daily dose is 40 to 90 ml. If the initial dose causes diarrhea, it should be reduced immediately, and if diarrhea persists, lactulose should be discontinued.

- **Rectal**: When an adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal-systemic encephalopathy with the danger of aspiration, or when endoscopic or intubation procedures are necessary, rectal administration considerations apply. The text is truncated here, but it is suggested to follow the specific medical guidelines for such cases.

**Adverse reactions**: Precise frequency data are not available. Lactulose may produce gaseous distention with flatulence or belching and abdominal discomfort such as cramping in about 20% of patients. Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. Nausea and vomiting have been reported.

In addition to these prospective data, several large retrospective studies have assessed the effectiveness of rifaximin combined with lactulose in comparison to lactulose alone. The IMPRESS study was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study of 207 patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE), 84% of whom received concomitant lactulose. The study was designed to assess the effect of rifaximin-α 550 mg on hospital resource use. Outcomes were compared for the 6 months before starting rifaximin ("pre-rifaximin") versus the 6 months following rifaximin initiation ("post-rifaximin"), and for 12 months pre-rifaximin versus 12 months post-rifaximin. Overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) episodes were experienced by 57% of patients in the 12 months pre-rifaximin versus 38% in the 12 months post-rifaximin. The mean number of HE episodes per patient decreased significantly from the 12 months pre-rifaximin to the 12 months post-rifaximin (P = 0.047).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^11158pzf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

A consolidated overview of evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) treatment over the long term is currently lacking. We identified and assessed published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE with lactulose and/or rifaximin.

A literature search was conducted in PubMed (cutoff date 05 March 2018) using the search terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. All articles containing primary clinical data were manually assessed to identify studies in which long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints were reported for lactulose and/or rifaximin.

- **Effectiveness outcomes**: Long-term effectiveness outcomes were reported in eight articles for treatment with lactulose alone and 19 articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose. These studies showed that lactulose is effective for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term. Additionally, the addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization compared with lactulose therapy alone, without compromising tolerability.

- **Safety/tolerability outcomes**: Long-term safety/tolerability outcomes were reported in six articles for treatment with lactulose alone and nine articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose.

Evidence therefore supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term and suggests an additional benefit from adding rifaximin to lactulose.

There are several limitations that should be noted in this study. First, this meta-analysis is limited by the small number and poor quality of included trials. Second, significant heterogeneity still exists in the outcomes of studies, and the source of heterogeneity may include age, gender, culture, and many other corresponding factors. In addition, only the follow-up in the short term was conducted in these included studies. In the future, more prospective studies should be undertaken with the follow-up in the long term.

There are also a number of advantages in the study. A wide range of literature research was carried out, providing updated information about the efficacy of PEG in the treatment of HE. The inclusion or exclusion of studies and the extraction of data were independently conducted with the help of two reviewers, which can be regarded as more accurate. Moreover, potential studies were not excluded because of publication year or status, and the external validity of the results was increased due to the fact that the trials included were conducted in different settings or even several countries. Another advantage is that not only the efficacy and side effects of both treatments were assessed, but also other significant clinical results, such as serum ammonia concentration and hospital stay, were included. In addition, the funnel plot was also included to investigate substantial publication bias, though a rigorous search strategy was used to reduce the introduction of potential publication bias.

HE is considered to be a severe sequela of chronic liver disease.

### Non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and lactulose versus lactitol for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^113AU47Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Non-absorbable disaccharides (lactulose and lactitol) are recommended as first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. The previous (second) version of this review included 10 randomised clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and eight RCTs evaluating lactulose versus lactitol for people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. The review found no evidence to either support or refute the use of the non-absorbable disaccharides and no differences between lactulose versus lactitol.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of i) non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and ii) lactulose versus lactitol in people with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: We carried out electronic searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to 19 October 2015. We also conducted manual searches of meetings and conference proceedings, checked bibliographies, and corresponded with investigators and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs, irrespective of publication status, language, or blinding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors, working independently, retrieved data from published reports and correspondence with investigators. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatic encephalopathy, and serious adverse events. We presented the results of meta-analyses as risk ratios (RR) and mean differences.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^113vJfGq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting, which manifests as a wide spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from subclinical alterations to coma. The primary pathophysiological mechanism underlying HE is thought to involve elevated blood levels of gut-derived neurotoxins — in particular, ammonia — entering the brain due to the inability of the cirrhotic liver to remove them from the blood circulation. HE increases the risk of mortality and is one of the most debilitating complications of liver disease. Overt HE (OHE) occurs in 30–40% of patients with cirrhosis at some time during their clinical course, with minimal HE (MHE) reported to potentially affect 20–80% of patients with cirrhosis.

HE has a substantial economic effect, not only due to the direct costs of its management (particularly HE-related hospitalization) but also to the indirect costs arising from, for example, absence from work and loss of work productivity. HE negatively affects the lives of both patients and caregivers, and the socioeconomic implications of HE over the longer term may be very profound, decreasing work performance, increasing the risk of vehicle accidents, and severely impairing quality of life. Currently available treatment options for HE include nonabsorbable disaccharides (e.g. lactulose), antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin-α 550 mg), and L-ornithine-aspartate (LOLA). Other potential therapies include branched-chain amino acids, probiotics, metabolic ammonia scavengers, and glutaminase inhibitors.

### Bowel movement frequency is not linked with cognitive function in cirrhosis [^111DtcWR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The spectrum of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) ranges from overt HE (OHE) to cognitive impairment (i.e. covert) HE (CHE). The first-line therapy is lactulose, which is titrated to achieve approximately 2–3 soft/loose daily bowel movements (BM). This metric is considered dogma for practitioners despite erratic results, gastrointestinal adverse events, and poor tolerance in Western countries. There are logistic barriers for the widespread uptake of rifaximin, the second-line therapy. Moreover, although BM frequency-directed dose titration of lactulose is the usual practice, its impact on objective cognitive performance is unclear. Our aim is to determine the impact of BM frequency on cognition in patients with or without prior OHE.

### Heretical thoughts into hepatic encephalopathy [^1117tTR9]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical progress in the development of new diagnostic modalities and therapeutic strategies for managing patients with hepatic encephalopathy has lagged behind the vast knowledge generated from basic studies. In this article, we critically assess matters that should be revisited, such as the definition, classification, diagnosis, and grading of hepatic encephalopathy, which are difficult to apply reproducibly using the criteria. Many lines of investigation have confirmed that hepatic encephalopathy is irreversible in many patients and suggest the need for further studies focusing on mechanisms of neuronal injury and death to guide future drug development for these patients. The clinical evidence behind using lactulose for all severities of hepatic encephalopathy, which is currently considered the standard of care, is poor, and placebo-controlled trials for hepatic encephalopathy should be considered ethically sound. This expert opinion identifies challenges in hepatic encephalopathy and highlights areas that require further debate and investigation to help advance the field both scientifically and clinically.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111J8Cru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Most rifaximin studies assessed the additional benefit of rifaximin prophylaxis as an adjunct to lactulose therapy. Compared with placebo+lactulose, NNT values (95% CIs) for rifaximin+lactulose as secondary prophylaxis for OHE recurrence were calculated to be 3.28 (2.27–5.90) and 4.21 (2.93–7.46).

A phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared the effectiveness of rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily versus placebo for the prevention of OHE recurrence over 6 months in 299 patients with cirrhosis who had experienced at least two OHE episodes in the previous 6 months but who were currently in remission. More than 90% of patients in both treatment arms additionally received lactulose therapy. The rate of OHE recurrence was 22.1% with rifaximin versus 45.9% with placebo, reflecting a hazard ratio for the time to a breakthrough OHE episode for rifaximin versus placebo of 0.42 (95% CI: 0.28–0.64; P < 0.001), reflecting a relative risk reduction of 58% with rifaximin versus placebo. The rate of HE-related hospital readmission was 13.6% with rifaximin versus 22.6% with placebo, and the hazard ratio for time to first HE-related hospitalization for rifaximin versus placebo was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29–0.87; P = 0.01), representing a 50% relative reduction in risk.

In a subanalysis of this trial (n = 219), conducted primarily to assess health-related quality of life, the rate of OHE recurrence was 25.7% with rifaximin versus 50.0% with placebo, and HE remission was maintained for 6 months in 74.3% of patients treated with rifaximin.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LmhcR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Quality evaluation**: The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was employed to assess the study quality. Generally, the risk of bias was high for participants who were not blinded due to significant differences in dosage and taste between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lactulose. However, for most other items, the risk was unclear or low. Achieving participant blinding to the trial was challenging. The risk of bias for the included studies is shown in Figure 2.

- **Synthesis of results**: Five studies, involving a total of 288 patients, compared PEG (n = 143) with lactulose (n = 145) in the early 24 hours of treatment. Based on the Mantel-Haenszel fixed mode, the use of PEG increased the HESA score more significantly than lactulose within 24 hours (RR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.26–1.68; P = 0.000; Fig. 3, Supplementary File 2: Fig. S2A, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Neither publication bias (Egger test P = 0.077 > 0.05; Supplementary File 2: Figs. S2B, S2C, Supplemental Digital Content 1) nor significant heterogeneity (χ² = 3.73, P = 0.444, I² = 0.0%; Supplementary File 2: Fig. S2A, Supplemental Digital Content 1) were found in the five studies.

Figure 3 provides a forest plot illustrating the comparison of the clinical efficacy of polyethylene glycol with lactulose, analyzed using fixed-effects. CI indicates confidence interval; RR, relative risk.

### Dispelling myths in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy [^1139Jmbj]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy suggest ammonia reduction as the main focus, based on strategies to reduce ammonia's generation and absorption in the colon by using lactulose and a reduced protein diet.

Two studies provide compelling and provocative data questioning the relevance of these interventions. Bodils Als-Nielsen and colleagues, in a systematic review of randomized trials, found insufficient evidence about whether non-absorbable disaccharides are beneficial. In a small randomized study, Juan Cordoba and colleagues showed that diets with normal protein content can be administered safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis and that protein restriction does not have any beneficial effect during such episodes.

Two approaches to new therapies for hepatic encephalopathy are needed. First, it is important to focus on the interorgan metabolism of ammonia. The small intestine and kidneys might be important producers of ammonia, and muscle is an important organ that can remove ammonia. Novel therapies targeting these organs reduce ammonia. Second, research is needed to explore factors other than ammonia that might be important in hepatic encephalopathy, including the synergistic role of inflammation. The lack of conclusive data about the efficacy of any treatment supports the view that placebo-controlled trials of newer agents are needed and ethical. The emphasis should shift to aggressive management of the precipitating event.

### Management of minimal and overt hepatic encephalopathy with branched-chain amino acids: A review of the evidence [^115FNd9W]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a challenging complication of liver disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation in the management of HE is a debated topic. This narrative review aims to provide an up-to-date review of the topic and includes studies featuring patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. A review of the literature was performed using the online databases MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies between 2002 and December 2022. Keywords included "branched-chain amino acids", "liver cirrhosis", and "hepatic encephalopathy". Studies were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of 1045 citations, 8 studies met the inclusion criteria.

- **Outcomes**: The main outcomes reported for HE were changes in minimal HE (MHE) (n = 4) and/or incidence of overt HE (OHE) (n = 7). Two of the four studies reporting on MHE showed improvement in psychometric testing in the BCAA group, but there was no change in the incidence of OHE in any of the seven papers in the BCAA group.

- **Adverse effects**: There were few adverse effects of BCAA supplementation.

This review found weak evidence for BCAA supplementation for MHE, and no evidence for BCAAs for OHE. However, given the relative paucity and methodological heterogeneity of the research, there is scope for future studies to examine the effects of varying timing, dosage, and frequency of BCAAs on outcomes such as HE. Importantly, research is also needed to examine BCAAs in conjunction with standard therapies for HE such as rifaximin and/or lactulose.

### Xifaxan [^116UhTKF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A total of 222 subjects were randomized to receive either Xifaxan monotherapy (550 mg twice daily) (N = 113) or Xifaxan (550 mg twice daily) + lactulose (self-titrated by the patient to produce 2 to 3 soft stools per day) (N = 109). Sixty-five percent of subjects received lactulose at enrollment. Subjects randomized to Xifaxan monotherapy who received lactulose at enrollment (N = 76) discontinued lactulose on the day of randomization. Subjects had a mean age of 58 years (range, 32–85 years), 74% were below 65 years of age, 63% were male, 91% were White, 6% were Black, 1% were Asian, and 2% were other.

- **Primary endpoint and results**: The primary endpoint was the time to first breakthrough overt HE episode, which was defined as an increase of Conn score to Grade ≥ 2. Breakthrough overt HE episodes occurred in 28 of 113 subjects (25%) in the Xifaxan monotherapy group and in 15 of 109 subjects (14%) in the Xifaxan + lactulose group during the 6-month treatment period; the hazard ratio was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.06 to 3.7). A comparison of Kaplan-Meier estimates of event-free curves showed that Xifaxan monotherapy, compared with the combination of Xifaxan + lactulose, increased the risk of HE breakthrough by 98% during the 6-month treatment period [see Figure 3].

### Branched-chain amino acids for people with hepatic encephalopathy [^115N61xT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction with neurological and psychiatric changes associated with liver insufficiency or portal-systemic shunting. The severity ranges from minor symptoms to coma. A Cochrane systematic review, including 11 randomized clinical trials on branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) versus control interventions, has evaluated if BCAA may benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of BCAA versus any control intervention for people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: We identified trials through manual and electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index (August 2015).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials, irrespective of the bias control, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The authors independently extracted data based on published reports and collected data from the primary investigators. We changed our primary outcomes in this update of the review to include mortality (all cause), hepatic encephalopathy (number of people without improved manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy), and adverse events. The analyses included random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. We performed subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and trial sequential analyses to evaluate sources of heterogeneity, including intervention, participant and trial characteristics, and bias (using The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group methodology).

### Bifidobacterium combined with fructo-oligosaccharide versus lactulose in the treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy [^1169nrbX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome in patients with liver disease. It was suggested that Bifidobacterium combined with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) may decrease blood and brain ammonia levels.

- **Aim**: The study was conducted to compare the efficacy of Bifidobacterium combined with FOS and lactulose in patients with HE.

- **Methods**: One hundred and twenty-five patients (35 with hepatitis B virus infection, 70 with hepatitis C virus infection, and 20 with cryptogenic cirrhosis) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to receive either a 60-day treatment with Bifidobacterium and FOS (group A) or lactulose (group B) in a double-blind manner.

- **Results**: After 30 days, patients treated with Bifidobacterium and FOS showed a significant decrease in the Trail Making Test B (TMT B) (P < 0.005), and a significant increase in the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Block Design Test (both P < 0.001), compared to those treated with lactulose. After 60 days, Bifidobacterium and FOS-treated patients showed a significant decrease in NH4 fasting HE1 (P < 0.001), TMT A (P < 0.05), TMT B (P < 0.001), and a significant increase in both the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Block Design Test (both P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: The treatment with Bifidobacterium combined with FOS is an alternative to lactulose in patients with cirrhosis, given its effectiveness in reducing blood ammonia levels and improving psychometric tests.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^117Ti1Vu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Studies have assessed the effectiveness of different rifaximin treatment regimens when used in addition to lactulose therapy. No significant differences were observed between patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg once daily versus twice daily or between patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily versus rifaximin 400 mg three times daily, although rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily was shown to be more cost-effective than the three times daily regimen.

Direct head-to-head evidence of the long-term effectiveness of rifaximin versus lactulose is scarce. In a single-center, retrospective chart review, 145 patients diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) received at least six months of treatment with lactulose before receiving at least six months of treatment with rifaximin (400 mg, three times daily). Outcomes were compared for the last six months of lactulose treatment versus the first six months of rifaximin treatment. The number of hospitalizations per patient was significantly lower with rifaximin versus lactulose (0.5 vs. 1.6; P < 0.001), as was the number of days of hospitalization per patient (2.5 vs. 7.3; P < 0.001) and the number of weeks of hospitalization per patient (0.4 vs. 1.8; P < 0.001).

Rifaximin was also compared with lactulose in a single-center, prospective study designed to investigate the duration of treatment necessary for patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Patients with cirrhosis and MHE were randomized to receive primary prophylaxis treatment with either rifaximin (400 mg, three times daily) or lactulose for three months and then followed up for a further six months. After nine months, the rate of M…

### Enulose [^115Hg2uE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Since lactulose solution contains galactose (less than 1.6 g/15 mL) and lactose (less than 1.2 g/15 mL), it should be used with caution in diabetics. In the overall management of portal-systemic encephalopathy, it should be recognized that there is serious underlying liver disease with complications such as electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hypokalemia) for which other specific therapy may be required. Infants receiving lactulose may develop hyponatremia and dehydration.

- **Drug interactions**: There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution. Theoretically, the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti-infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents. Thus, the status of the lactulose-treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti-infective therapy. Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose-induced drop in colonic pH. Therefore, a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose. Other laxatives should not be used, especially during the initial phase of therapy for portal-systemic encephalopathy, because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate lactulose dosage has been achieved.

### Bristol stool scale as a determinant of hepatic encephalopathy management in patients with cirrhosis [^111XsCUy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Bowel movement (BM) frequency is used to titrate lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, stool consistency using the Bristol stool scale (BSS, 0–7) is often ignored.

- **Methods**: The study included pre-BSS and post-BSS cohorts. BSS was incorporated into decision-making after training in outpatients with cirrhosis. Two to three BMs per day and BSS scores of 3–4 were considered normal, whereas other scores were considered high or low. Concordance between the metrics was evaluated. Medication changes and 6-month admissions were compared between the post-BSS group and a comparable pre-BSS group. Concordance and regression analyses for all-cause admissions and HE-related admissions were performed. Comparisons were made for HE-related medication stability. An outpatient group seen twice was analyzed for BSS and BMs in a longitudinal analysis.

- **Results**: In the post-BSS cohort, 112 patients were included with only 46% of BSS and BMs concordance and modest BSS/BMs correlation (r = 0.27, P = 0.005). Compared with the pre-BSS cohort (N = 114), there was a lower 6-month total of HE-related hospitalizations for the post-BSS cohort (4% vs 0.36%, P < 0.05). Significant differences in BMs during this time were observed (P = 0.02).

### Predictors of nonresponse to lactulose in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy [^111CGAM9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Lactulose is commonly used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), although not all patients respond to it. This study evaluated predictors of nonresponse to lactulose in patients with cirrhosis and HE.

Consecutive cirrhotic patients with HE were enrolled, with HE diagnosed by West Haven criteria. The treatment involved lactulose and correction of any associated precipitating factors. Nonresponse was defined as the patient remaining in HE after 10 days of treatment or dying while in HE.

Of the 300 patients with cirrhosis and HE, 231 (77%) met the inclusion criteria. The majority (95%) had Grade 2 or 3 HE. Among these, 180 (78%) responded to lactulose, while 51 (22%) did not respond. Within the nonresponders, 34 (15%) died without improvement in HE, and HE did not improve in 17 (7%) patients after 10 days of therapy.

There was a significant difference in baseline parameters between nonresponders and responders. These included baseline age (42.0 ± 11.9 vs. 46.6 ± 12.7 years, P = 0.02), total leukocyte count (median 9300 vs. 7300 cells/mm³, P = 0.001), serum sodium level (129.9 ± 6.2 vs. 133.7 ± 7.1 mmol/L, P = 0.001), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (22.9 ± 3.8 vs. 19.9 ± 4.2, P = 0.001), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (77.9 ± 10.0 vs. 86.3 ± 8.7 mmHg, P = 0.001), serum AST (median 114 vs. 76 IU/L, P = 0.01), serum ALT (median 84 vs. 48.5 IU/L, P = 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [18 (35%) vs. 37 (21%), P = 0.02], and hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC, 17 (33%) vs. 14 (7%), P = 0.001].

### Enulose [^1166Zv8L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma, controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces blood ammonia levels by 25 to 50%. This reduction is generally paralleled by an improvement in patients' mental state and EEG patterns. The clinical response has been observed in about 75% of patients, which is at least as satisfactory as the results from neomycin therapy. An increase in patients' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose therapy. In the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy, lactulose has been given for over 2 years in controlled studies.

### Non-absorbable disaccharides for hepatic encephalopathy: Systematic review of randomised trials [^112cNCZs]. BMJ (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of non-absorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose and lactitol, in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Data sources**: The data were gathered from multiple sources, including the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group controlled trials register, Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase up until March 2003. Additional data were sourced from reference lists of relevant articles, as well as from authors and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Review methods**: This review included randomized trials that compared non-absorbable disaccharides with placebo, no intervention, or antibiotics for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The primary outcome measures focused on were the lack of improvement in hepatic encephalopathy and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 22 trials were included in the review. Non-absorbable disaccharides, when compared with placebo or no intervention, appeared to reduce the risk of no improvement in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (relative risk 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.84, from six trials). However, high-quality trials found no significant effect (0.92, 0.42 to 2.04, in two trials). When considering mortality, there was no significant impact observed (0.41, 0.02 to 8.68, over four trials). Compared with antibiotics, non-absorbable disaccharides were inferior in reducing the risk of no improvement (1.24, 1.02 to 1.50, reported in ten trials) and lowering blood ammonia concentration (weighted mean difference 2.35 micromol/l, 0.06 micromol/l to 13.45 micromol/l, from ten trials). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two (0.90, 0.48 to 1.67, across five trials).

- **Conclusions**: The study found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of non-absorbable disaccharides for treating hepatic encephalopathy. Antibiotics were found to be more effective in some aspects; more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111djYhV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

In the phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Bass et al, rifaximin-α 550 mg (n = 140) was compared to placebo (n = 159) for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence over six months, with concomitant lactulose used in over 90% of both groups. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar between the groups, being 80.0% with rifaximin and 79.9% with placebo.

- **Adverse events**: The most commonly reported AEs (occurring in ≥ 10% of patients in either group) included nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, peripheral edema, ascites, dizziness, and headache, with no significant differences observed between the treatment groups.
- **Serious adverse events and infections**: There were also no significant differences in the incidences of serious AEs and AEs related to infection, such as Clostridium difficile infection.
- **Mortality**: Deaths occurred in 6.4% of rifaximin-treated and 6.9% of placebo-treated patients, respectively.

### Primary versus secondary psychosis in a patient with congenital liver disease [^117M4DXV]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

During the present medical admission, lactulose was increased to 20 mL four times daily, while rifaximin was continued. Paliperidone was restarted by the psychiatry team at 3 mg, and gradually increased to 9 mg daily. The rationale for starting paliperidone over other antipsychotics is that this second-generation antipsychotic, the primary active metabolite of risperidone, is metabolized and excreted solely by the kidney, hence requiring no dosage adjustment for hepatic impairment. Moreover, studies have shown that switching from risperidone to paliperidone yields improvement of liver enzymes during drug-induced hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. However, it is important to mention that long-term treatment with paliperidone, like other second-generation antipsychotic medications, carries the risk of metabolic side effects and subsequent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, now referred to as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, which may adversely affect outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

After 8 days of management on the medical service, his hepatic function improved, and ammonia levels decreased, but psychosis persisted, necessitating transfer to inpatient psychiatry.

While in the psychiatric unit, his psychotic symptoms gradually abated. Despite the notable reduction in psychotic symptoms, some negative symptoms (such as blunted affect and psychomotor slowing) and cognitive impairments (inattention and executive dysfunction) persisted. Due to the patient's extensive history of medication non-adherence, a collaborative decision was reached between the patient and the treatment team.

### Artificial intelligence evaluation of stool quality guides management of hepatic encephalopathy using a smartphone app [^113bAFQy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Lactulose-based treatment for hepatic encephalopathy requires titration based on the number of bowel movements per day, a process that is enhanced by incorporating the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS). The Dieta app evaluates an artificial intelligence (AI)-based BSS (AI-BSS) using stool images. Initially, controls (N = 13) and cirrhosis patients, both on lactulose and not on lactulose (n = 33), were trained on the app. They entered self-reported BSS (self-BSS) alongside AI-BSS data. Lactulose dose adjustments were tracked. A subset of participants (n = 12) was retested with AI communication blocked. Most subjects reported comfort with the app. Correlations between self-BSS/AI-BSS and lactulose dose/AI-BSS improved with app usage. AI-BSS communications improved users' understanding of their own BSS over time. The Dieta app for gauging stool AI characteristics was deemed acceptable and increased insight into the relationship between lactulose dosage and BSS in patients with cirrhosis.

### Probiotics for people with hepatic encephalopathy [^117FeYsx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a disorder of brain function resulting from liver failure, portosystemic shunt, or both. Both clinically overt hepatic encephalopathy and minimal hepatic encephalopathy significantly impair patients' quality of life and daily functioning, representing a significant burden on healthcare resources. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit on the host.

- **Objectives**: To determine the beneficial and harmful effects of probiotics in any dosage, compared with placebo, no intervention, or any other treatment for people with any grade of acute or chronic hepatic encephalopathy. This review did not consider the primary prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, conference proceedings, reference lists of included trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until June 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials comparing probiotics in any dosage with placebo, no intervention, or any other treatment in people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We conducted a random-effects model meta-analysis due to obvious heterogeneity of participants and interventions. We defined a P value of 0.05 or less as significant.

### Randomized controlled trial of polyethylene glycol versus lactulose for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^116VK5Xm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication of cirrhosis and one of the most debilitating manifestations that necessitates hospitalization. Although many treatment modalities are being investigated, none of them are satisfactory, necessitating the exploration of new treatment options.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) versus lactulose in the management of HE.

- **Patients and methods**: This clinical trial included 100 patients with post-hepatitis C cirrhosis who were admitted with HE. Patients were randomized into two equal groups: group I patients received lactulose and group II patients received PEG. The clinico-epidemiological characteristics of patients, Child-Pugh score, and HE scoring algorithm were registered before and 24 hours after administration of the drug. Moreover, any suspected adverse effects were recorded.

- **Results**: All 100 patients received treatment. Three patients died within 24 hours of admission and did not complete the follow-up period; according to the intention-to-treat approach, they were considered as treatment failure. On analysis, 36 out of 50 (72%) patients improved one grade or more in the HE scoring algorithm after 24 hours of lactulose therapy, compared to 47 out of 50 (94%) of those on PEG therapy (P < 0.05). The time needed for resolution of HE and length of hospital stay were significantly lower in the PEG group versus the lactulose group (P < 0.001). Both therapies were tolerated, and no significant adverse events were reported.

- **Conclusion**: Both lactulose and PEG were safe and effective in the treatment of HE. PEG demonstrated significant advantages in terms of efficacy.

### Probiotics for patients with hepatic encephalopathy [^114gTPjQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a disorder of brain function resulting from liver failure and/or portosystemic shunt. Both hepatic encephalopathy (clinically overt) and minimal hepatic encephalopathy (not clinically overt) significantly impair a patient's quality of life and daily functioning and represent a significant burden on healthcare resources. Probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit on the host.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the beneficial and harmful effects of any probiotic in any dosage compared with placebo, no intervention, or any other treatment for patients with any grade of acute or chronic hepatic encephalopathy, as assessed from randomized trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, conference proceedings, reference lists of included trials, and the WHO international clinical trials registry platform until April 2011 to identify new and ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials that compared probiotics in any dosage with placebo, no intervention, or any other treatment in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included trials and extracted data on relevant outcomes, resolving differences by consensus. We conducted random-effects model meta-analysis due to obvious variability among the studies.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116c6fVx]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The results of this study provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of PEG in the treatment of HE, with shorter hospitalization. The early resolution of HE not only contributes to timely and effective intestinal nutrition, which plays an important role in patient recovery, but also enables health care professionals to focus on managing the factors that cause metabolic encephalopathy and identifying other possible causes. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis of hospital stay, and conservative results were obtained using the random effect model. Uncorrected triggers for HE were excluded from all the trials included in the review. Nevertheless, relevant data were not acquired from individual patients to ascertain whether the length of stay varied depending on the grade or etiology of liver disease or other comorbidities in each population. Importantly, these aspects would most likely generate the heterogeneity observed in the studies.

None of the patients included in this study had any serious adverse reactions, which is consistent with a Cochrane systematic review of PEG versus lactulose in the treatment of chronic constipation. No difference in the incidence of adverse events between PEG and lactulose was observed after collecting valid studies. The meta-analysis of adverse events showed no significant heterogeneity in the pooled studies. Adverse reactions mainly include diarrhea, bloating, nausea, etc. More bloating symptoms appeared in the lactulose group, while more diarrhea symptoms appeared in the PEG group.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^113d6v2E]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Evidence supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy. The addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly reduces the risk of OHE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization compared with lactulose therapy alone, with a demonstrably low NNT to achieve these further benefits.

There is also emerging evidence to indicate that a switch to rifaximin monotherapy may be appropriate for those for whom lactulose is ineffective, poorly tolerated, or when adherence to lactulose therapy is problematic, although this requires further research.

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing rifaximin plus lactulose with lactulose alone in treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^113S3zVL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

The study titled "Rifaximin plus lactulose in hepatic encephalopathy" was published by Sharma BC and colleagues in 2013 in the journal Am J Gastroenterol. This study addresses the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, specifically investigating the effect of rifaximin plus lactulose in patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Study design**: The trial was a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: The study included 120 patients, consisting of 31 females and 89 males. Inclusion criteria required patients to have overt hepatic encephalopathy.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Patients were excluded if they had serum creatinine levels greater than 1.5 mg/dL, active alcohol intake within 4 weeks before the current episode, other metabolic encephalopathies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), degenerative CNS disease or major psychiatric illness, or significant comorbidities.
- **Interventions**: Participants were divided as follows: 63 patients received lactulose and rifaximin (lactulose 30–60 mL three times daily plus rifaximin 1,200 mg/day), and 57 patients received lactulose only (lactulose 30–60 mL three times daily plus placebo capsule).
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the complete reversal of hepatic encephalopathy in the rifaximin plus lactulose group compared to the lactulose only group (76% vs. 50.8%; RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.52).
- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a borderline significant decrease in mortality (23.8% vs. 49.1%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0 to 0.96).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^114wr1fx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In a single-center, retrospective chart review of 137 patients who received lactulose for a mean duration of 27 ± 6 months after their first hepatic encephalopathy (HE) event, it was found that 75% of the patients experienced HE recurrence after 9 ± 1 months. The rate of HE-related hospital readmission was 73%, and the mortality rate was 34%. Thirty-nine (28.5%) patients had HE recurrence associated with lactulose nonadherence, mostly resulting from gastrointestinal adverse effects.

Several large single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled studies have assessed the long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness of lactulose therapy, compared with placebo, probiotics, and/or no therapy. Compared with no treatment or placebo, the calculated number needed to treat (NNT) values [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for lactulose as secondary prophylaxis for overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence were 3.28 (2.15–6.90) and 3.68 (2.33–8.75).

Snehavardhan et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 86 children under 18 years with chronic liver disease. The study compared sodium benzoate (SB) (200 mg/kg/day) plus standard treatment (lactulose, rifaximin, and diet) to a placebo plus standard treatment. A total of 88 episodes of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were analyzed, with 44 episodes per group. There was a significant decrease in ammonia levels after treatment compared with baseline (129.8 ± 34.0 vs. 109.0 ± 40.4 µmol/L), although the difference from the placebo group was not significant. There was no significant effect on the resolution of overt HE, duration of hospital stay (11.8 ± 9.5 vs. 10.0 ± 7.6 days in SB vs. standard treatment, respectively; P = 0.315), or survival with native liver. Adverse events were similar between the groups, and SB was well tolerated. However, there was an increase in ascites observed in 15.9% of patients receiving SB, compared with 4.5% in the placebo group, though this difference was not statistically significant.

Sushma et al. reported on a randomized double-blind controlled trial involving 74 adult patients with cirrhosis or surgical portosystemic anastomosis and HE. Patients were randomized to receive either lactulose (n = 36) or SB at 5 g twice daily orally (n = 38). The clinical and demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. There was no significant difference between the groups in ammonia reduction, clinical recovery, time to recovery (11.6 ± 6.4 vs. 12.8 ± 9.1 days in SB vs. lactulose, respectively; P > 0.1), recovery to normal mental status, or adverse events.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111W6ngN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Historically, the NNT measure was designed to quantify treatment benefit directly in terms of the number of patients who would need to be treated before benefit is observed, thereby providing a means of expressing absolute, as opposed to relative, risk in a clinically meaningful way. Although the number of studies eligible for inclusion in the NNT analyses was limited, the results showed that, in terms of long-term secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of OHE recurrence, approximately four patients would need to be treated with lactulose before clinical benefit is observed, compared with no treatment or placebo. This must be considered within the clinical context showing a very high rate of OHE recurrence with no prophylaxis or with poor adherence to lactulose therapy.

Importantly, to show the add-on benefit of rifaximin to lactulose, the NNT is approximately four patients to prevent the recurrence of OHE. The relatively low NNT value for adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy provides further support for the clinical benefit of these treatments for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term.

Only one study compared rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin+lactulose, and NNT analysis showed that approximately seven patients would need to be treated with rifaximin monotherapy before clinical benefit is observed (in comparison with rifaximin+lactulose). However, the results of this single study should be viewed with caution, not only because the 95% CI was very wide but also because the study design was such that patients who received rifaximin monotherapy m…

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BdTy7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, this study shows that PEG is able to improve the clinical efficacy of HE within 24 hours better than lactulose and does not increase side effects. Due to its effectiveness and safety, PEG should be considered as a first-line treatment for patients who are intolerant of lactulose and as second-line therapy for HE patients with lactulose treatment failure.

### Lactulose vs polyethylene glycol 3350 — electrolyte solution for treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy: the HELP randomized clinical trial [^111QdVSH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common cause of hospitalization in patients with cirrhosis. Pharmacologic treatment for acute (overt) HE has remained the same for decades. This study aimed to compare polyethylene glycol 3350-electrolyte solution (PEG) and lactulose treatments in patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital for HE. The hypothesis was that rapid catharsis of the gut using PEG may resolve HE more effectively than lactulose.

The HELP (Hepatic Encephalopathy: Lactulose vs Polyethylene Glycol 3350-Electrolyte Solution) study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in an academic tertiary hospital involving 50 patients with cirrhosis, of the 186 screened, who were admitted for HE. Participants were block randomized to receive treatment with either a 4-L dose of PEG (n = 25) or standard-of-care lactulose (n = 25) during hospitalization.

The primary endpoint was defined as an improvement of 1 or more grades in HE at 24 hours, determined using the hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm (HESA), which ranges from 0 (normal clinical and neuropsychological assessments) to 4 (coma). Secondary outcomes included the time to HE resolution and the overall length of stay.

Results indicated that 25 patients were randomized to each treatment arm. Baseline clinical features at admission were similar among the groups. Thirteen of 25 patients in the standard therapy arm (52%) showed an improvement of 1 or more in the HESA score, meeting the primary outcome measure. In comparison, 21 of 23 evaluated patients receiving PEG (91%) exhibited similar improvement (p < 0.01).

### Generlac [^112c2uKb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy, including the stages of hepatic pre-coma and coma, controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces blood ammonia levels by 25 to 50%. This reduction is generally paralleled by an improvement in the patients' mental state and EEG patterns. The clinical response has been observed in about 75% of patients, which is at least as satisfactory as that resulting from neomycin therapy. An increase in patients' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose solution therapy. In the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy, lactulose solution has been administered for over 2 years in controlled studies.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^115L9Xru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review shows an increasing body of evidence for the use of rifaximin in addition to lactulose, and for lactulose therapy alone, in the long-term management of patients with HE. In line with the guidelines, this evidence supports the use of lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of OHE events over the long term. In addition, one study has showed the effectiveness of lactulose as primary prophylaxis in the prevention of long-term OHE occurrence. Although there is very little direct head-to-head evidence of rifaximin versus lactulose over the long term, there is considerable evidence to support recommendations for the use of rifaximin as an add-on treatment to standard lactulose therapy in the secondary prophylaxis setting.

In terms of effectiveness, several long-term, open-label clinical trials and clinical practice studies have shown that, when added to lactulose therapy, rifaximin significantly reduces the recurrence of OHE events and the rate of HE-related hospitalization, in comparison with lactulose therapy alone. An exception to this was a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, carried out by Ali et al, in which rifaximin was found to be no better than placebo when combined with lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis against OHE recurrence. In discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancy in the findings of this trial, compared with those of the phase III trial by Bass et al, the authors point out that the study populations differed in terms of primary etiology of cirrhosis.

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing rifaximin plus lactulose with lactulose alone in treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^116xuBtE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with poor prognosis in cirrhosis. Drugs used in the treatment of HE are primarily aimed at reducing blood ammonia levels. Rifaximin and lactulose have proven effective in treating HE. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rifaximin plus lactulose versus lactulose alone for the treatment of overt HE.

In this prospective double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 120 patients with overt HE were divided into two groups: group A (lactulose plus rifaximin 1,200 mg/day; n = 63) and group B (lactulose plus placebo; n = 57). The primary endpoint was the complete reversal of HE. Secondary endpoints included mortality and hospital stay duration.

A total of 120 patients (mean age 39.4 ± 9.6 years; male/female ratio 89:31) participated in the study. Thirty-seven patients (30.8%) were classified as Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B, while 83 patients (69.2%) were in class C. The mean CTP score was 9.7 ± 2.8, and the MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score was 24.6 ± 4.2. At admission, 22 patients (18.3%) had grade 2 HE, 40 (33.3%) had grade 3, and 58 (48.3%) had grade 4 HE.

Of the patients treated, 48 (76%) in group A had complete reversal of HE compared to 29 (50.8%) in group B (P < 0.004). There was a significant decrease in mortality with treatment using lactulose plus rifaximin versus lactulose and placebo (23.8% vs. 49.1%, P < 0.05). Sepsis-related deaths were significantly higher in group B compared to group A (7 vs. 17, P = 0.01), whereas no significant differences were observed due to gastrointestinal bleeding (4:4, P = nonsignificant).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^114Y5NkF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In a primary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis but no previous history of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months. Lactulose significantly reduced the rate of OHE occurrence compared to no lactulose (11% vs. 28%; P = 0.02) and reduced the median length of stay for HE-related hospitalization, although not significantly.

In a secondary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64), or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months. The rate of OHE recurrence was 26.5% with lactulose, 34.4% with probiotics, and 56.9% with no therapy (lactulose vs. probiotics, P = not significant; lactulose vs. no therapy, P = 0.001; and probiotics vs. no therapy, P = 0.02). The mortality rate was 19.1%, 17.2%, and 24.6% for the lactulose, probiotics, and no therapy groups, respectively (P = not significant between groups).

In a similar secondary prophylaxis study, patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. Lactulose was significantly superior to placebo in reducing the rate of OHE recurrence (19.6% vs. 46.8%; P = 0.001) but not in reducing the rate of hospitalization for non-HE events or mortality.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^113pHwBu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the similarly designed single-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Ali et al, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was low and similar in patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg (n = 63) or placebo (n = 63) for 6 months, in addition to lactulose therapy. Deaths occurred in 11.1% of patients in both treatment groups.

In the 24-month, open-label maintenance study that followed the trial by Bass and colleagues, a total of 392 patients were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg ('all-rifaximin' group), including 252 patients who received de novo treatment (82 patients who received placebo in the original trial and 170 newly recruited patients; 'new-rifaximin' group). Approximately 90% of the patients in the all-rifaximin group additionally received treatment with lactulose. Safety and tolerability results were compared with those for patients who received rifaximin and placebo in the original phase III trial ('historical-rifaximin' (n = 140) and 'historical-placebo' (n = 159) groups, respectively). The overall rates of AEs per patient-year event (PYE) were lower in the all-rifaximin (0.71) and new-rifaximin (0.69) groups than in the historical-rifaximin (2.24) and historical-placebo (2.76) groups, as were the rates of serious AEs per PYE and discontinuation owing to AEs (rate per PYE). The rate of death per PYE was 0.15 in the all-rifaximin group compared with 0.24 in the historical-placebo group. The rate of C. difficile infection remained stable with long-term rifaximin treatment. When comparing patients who received rifaximin in combination with lactulose (n = 352) with those who received rifaximin alone…

### Branched-chain amino acids for people with hepatic encephalopathy [^112Zm63R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction characterized by neurological and psychiatric changes associated with liver insufficiency or portal-systemic shunting. The severity of this condition ranges from minor symptoms to coma. A Cochrane systematic review, including 11 randomized clinical trials on branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) versus control interventions, has evaluated whether BCAA may benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of BCAA versus any control intervention for people with hepatic encephalopathy.

- **Search methods**: Trials were identified through manual and electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, and LILACS as of May 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials were included irrespective of bias control, language, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were independently extracted from published reports and collected from primary investigators. In this review update, primary outcomes were changed to include mortality (all-cause), hepatic encephalopathy (number of people without improved manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy), and adverse events. Analyses included random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses, with subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and trial sequential analyses performed to evaluate sources of heterogeneity, including intervention and participant characteristics.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: A consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^1144MqUd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Specific therapy for overt HE episodes includes supportive care, treatment of underlying precipitants, and initiation of specific therapy; first-line choices are nonabsorbable disaccharides or short-course antibiotics. All patients recovering from an acute episode of overt HE should also receive secondary prophylaxis to reduce the risk of recurrence; the evidence-based choices include nonabsorbable disaccharides and/or rifaximin. Appropriate therapy can reduce the duration of admission and reduce the risk of subsequent readmission. However, to maximize the benefits from therapy, early diagnosis is essential to allow prompt initiation of recommended treatment.

We recommend that our conclusions and recommendations be considered further by our colleagues in gastroenterology and hepatology and those in other disciplines, and hope that these recommendations assist in the development of regional/national cross-speciality guidelines to improve the identification and triage of patients who may have HE and facilitate appropriate management. We also hope that future guidelines consider the management of patients with HE from initial 'suspicion' of cognitive impairment, which may be by a clinician or healthcare provider not routinely responsible for management of an individual's liver disease.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^114PP9FU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In a similarly designed single-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 126 patients with cirrhosis who were admitted to the hospital with an index OHE event, having experienced at least one other OHE event in the previous 6 months, were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg or placebo for 6 months, in addition to lactulose therapy. In this trial, the rate of HE recurrence was 44.4% with rifaximin versus 36.5% with placebo (P = not significant), and the mortality rate was 11.1% in both treatment groups.

When examining long-term use specifically, patients completing the trial by Bass and colleagues were eligible to enter a phase III, multicenter, open-label maintenance study, in which patients received open-label treatment with rifaximin-α 550 mg for 24 months. In total, 392 patients were treated with rifaximin ('all-rifaximin' group), including 252 patients who received de novo treatment ('new-rifaximin' group). As in the initial trial, approximately 90% of patients were additionally treated with lactulose. The rates of HE-related hospitalization were 0.21 and 0.23 events/person-year of exposure (PYE) for the all-rifaximin and new-rifaximin groups, respectively. In the original trial, the corresponding values were 0.30 events/PYE for rifaximin versus 0.72 events/PYE for placebo (P < 0.0001).

A post-hoc analysis of this study was conducted for 321 patients who had been treated for a mean duration of 1.5 years. Data were compared between patients who had been newly recruited, having not participated in the original trial ('rifaximin-newly recruited' group), with those who received rifaximin.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution versus lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148FdPL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, for the first time, the efficacy of PEG was reviewed compared with lactulose on HESA improvement, adverse effects, hospital stay, and serum ammonia concentration. It was found that PEG was superior to lactulose in the treatment of an acute episode of HE, which could deliver clinical improvement in HESA score and reduce the LOS without increasing the incidence of adverse events. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in serum ammonia levels.

PEG is a nonabsorbable, nondigestible macromolecule that is not metabolized by colonic microflora, and it can be commonly used for colonoscopy preparation, causing osmotic diarrhea through osmotic and volumetric expansion in the colon. Although the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides for HE therapy has not yet been supported or refuted by sufficient evidence, lactulose has always been used for the catharsis of the gut mainly through creating an acidic environment in the gut which helps in the conversion of soluble ammonia (NH₃) to insoluble ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), thereby resulting in decreased systemic absorption from the gut. Compared with lactulose, PEG was found to be more effective in catharsis or relieving constipation. Similar results were found in this study, suggesting that bowel cleansing with PEG is an immediate, effective, rapid, and safe therapeutic strategy for patients with acute HE. This is because PEG electrolyte solution is a more powerful cathartic agent than lactulose and may prevent electrolyte disturbance to help promote the improvement of encephalopathy.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111rSF1p]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

The literature searches were conducted in PubMed, focusing solely on titles and abstracts. The language was restricted to English with no date limitations up to March 5, 2018. The search terms used were 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. All identified articles' abstracts were manually assessed to locate manuscripts containing primary clinical data such as clinical trials, clinical practice studies, observational studies, registry data, health economic studies, and/or survey data, including congress abstracts published in journals if indexed on PubMed. These manuscripts were evaluated to identify studies reporting long-term effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints for lactulose and/or rifaximin. Long-term treatment was defined as at least 6 months, and study results were tabulated for further assessment.

Similar initial searches were conducted with the terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+-ornithine — aspartate', 'hepatic encephalopathy+LOLA', and 'hepatic encephalopathy+ornithine aspartate'. However, only one study reported long-term outcomes (≥ 6 months). Consequently, the review process focused on lactulose and rifaximin evidence only.

Number needed to treat (NNT) analyses were performed for studies reporting significant between-group differences in the rate of OHE recurrence following at least 6 months of secondary prophylaxis with lactulose and/or rifaximin. Studies that investigated primary prophylaxis and different dosing regimens were not the primary focus.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^112oLHKC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

For chronic conditions such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), the success of treatment depends significantly on its tolerability, as patients will only adhere to treatment if it is tolerable over the long term. Long-term tolerability issues, such as adverse gastrointestinal symptoms, also considerably affect health-related quality of life. In the case of lactulose, tolerability is a major clinical consideration. In a study of 137 patients who received long-term secondary prophylaxis with lactulose, 75% experienced overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence, and this was associated with lactulose nonadherence in 38% of these patients, primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse effects like unpredictable diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating. Importantly, all patients who were nonadherent to lactulose therapy, and nearly two-thirds of those who were adherent, experienced OHE recurrence.

There is evidence to suggest that patient acceptance of lactulose is influenced by sociocultural factors. For instance, in a recent survey of 100 outpatients with cirrhosis from India and the United States, who had no prior experience with lactulose but underwent dedicated education about its use for HE prevention, a significantly higher proportion of Indian versus US patients agreed to accept lactulose treatment. In this context, it is noteworthy that a substantial number of the lactulose studies identified in this review were conducted in patients from the Indian subcontinent. These findings underscore the need for additional, effective, and better-tolerated therapeutic options in the long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^112b6aDo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the multicenter, retrospective, observational IMPRESS study of 207 patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (all of whom were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg and 84% of whom received concomitant lactulose), 4.3% of patients had documented adverse events (AEs), most commonly C. difficile infection (n = 4) and rash (n = 2). No serious AEs were reported. Of the four patients who developed C. difficile infection, none had a history of C. difficile, and none was on concomitant antibiotics. All patients continued rifaximin therapy.

In a single-center, retrospective, cohort study that compared the effectiveness of rifaximin (600 mg, twice daily) plus lactulose (n = 318) versus lactulose alone (n = 724) in patients with cirrhosis-related HE who either did or did not have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), C. difficile infection rates were 0.3% with rifaximin plus lactulose versus 1.0% with lactulose alone, over a median follow-up duration of 18.0 months in patients without HCC and 4.4 months in patients with HCC.

In a multicenter, retrospective chart review of 211 patients treated with rifaximin (mean: 1055 mg/day; range: 600–1600 mg/day), in addition to lactulose, over a mean follow-up duration of 250 days, 8% of patients experienced diarrhea, but none experienced C. difficile infection. All cases of diarrhea were resolved with standard antidiarrheal therapy, which was administered after stool analysis excluded C. difficile infection.

Direct head-to-head evidence of the long-term safety and tolerability of rifaximin versus lactulose is limited to a single-center, retrospective chart review, in which 145 patients diagnosed with HE received at least 6 months of treatment.
