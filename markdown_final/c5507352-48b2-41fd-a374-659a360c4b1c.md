## Question

Does salt restriction help in heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dietary sodium restriction benefits patients with heart failure, specifically regarding how much restriction is appropriate and which patients should follow it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "helps" means clinically: does sodium restriction reduce mortality, hospitalizations, or decompensation events. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence, especially SODIUM-HF. Next, I will review meta-analyses and observational data for consistency and potential harm. After that, I need to check guideline positions and how they have evolved. Finally, I will consider practical implementation, adherence, and patient selection, and synthesize a balanced, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical outcomes that matter most: all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and composite cardiovascular events, with secondary attention to symptoms, quality of life, and natriuretic peptide changes, because these are the endpoints repeatedly tested in trials and reviews of sodium restriction in heart failure [^114o9vSe] [^1138LeFP] [^111XVx5j].

> I will now examine the highest-quality randomized evidence. The SODIUM-HF trial randomized 806 ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure receiving guideline-directed therapy to less than 1,500 mg/day sodium versus usual care and found no significant reduction in the composite of cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiovascular emergency department visit, or all-cause death at 12 months, with a hazard ratio of 0.89 and a 95% confidence interval that crossed 1, indicating no benefit, and with a signal toward higher all-cause mortality in the low-sodium arm that did not reach statistical significance, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret that signal [^114o9vSe] [^1163FC53] [^115EtsDP].

> Wait, let me verify whether symptom or biomarker benefits were present despite neutral hard outcomes. SODIUM-HF reported a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life and a higher likelihood of NYHA functional class improvement in the low-sodium group, suggesting potential symptomatic benefit even without event reduction, which aligns with smaller pilot work showing improved quality of life and lower BNP when sodium intake fell to around 1,500 mg/day, although these were not definitive for clinical events [^113X5mdV] [^115YPVdQ].

> Next, I should review meta-analyses for consistency. A 2023 Circulation: Heart Failure meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials found no significant reduction in all-cause death, hospitalization, or the composite with sodium restriction, again with heterogeneity and low-to-moderate quality of evidence, and a 2018 JAMA Internal Medicine review similarly concluded that evidence was limited and inconclusive for hard outcomes, reinforcing that sodium restriction has not demonstrated event reduction in aggregate randomized data [^1138LeFP] [^111XVx5j] [^114aLPVh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for signals of harm. Observational analyses, including the HART dataset, associated sodium restriction below about 2.5 g/day with higher risk of death or heart failure hospitalization, and a Cochrane review suggested increased all-cause mortality with salt reduction in heart failure, although these are observational or older pooled analyses and must be interpreted cautiously; nonetheless, they raise a plausible concern that overly aggressive restriction may activate neurohormonal systems in some patients [^113A5dAX] [^114ST2Ba] [^115BtH51] [^114CEJbW].

> I should confirm how guidelines have responded to this evolving evidence. The 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline gives sodium restriction a Class IIa, Level of Evidence C-LD recommendation to avoid excessive sodium intake to reduce congestive symptoms in stage C heart failure, explicitly noting the low quality of evidence and emphasizing symptom relief rather than mortality or hospitalization benefit, while the 2024 ESC Heart Failure Association consensus advises limiting salt to no more than 5 g/day and cautions against routine fluid restriction, reflecting a more permissive stance than historical teaching [^1171FyQQ] [^111C3CHX] [^11128zrK].

> Let me consider practical implementation and adherence, because even if restriction helps symptoms, it must be feasible. Multiple studies show that achieving less than 1,500 mg/day is difficult in real life without intensive support, and sodium-restricted diets can inadvertently reduce calories and micronutrients; structured approaches such as dietitian counseling, home-delivered DASH-style meals, and medically tailored meals show promise for adherence and may reduce short-term readmissions, though mortality effects remain unproven and sample sizes are modest [^112XbN7R] [^112xHwxU] [^115u3zn4] [^113cKZ13].

> I need to ensure I tailor advice to patient phenotype. In advanced NYHA III–IV heart failure, observational data suggest worse outcomes with very low sodium intake, whereas in milder NYHA I–II disease, very low sodium has been linked to worse outcomes in some cohorts, supporting a more moderate restriction target of roughly 2,000–3,000 mg/day for many patients, with individualized adjustment based on congestion, renal function, and tolerance, and with closer follow-up if sodium intake is reduced to avoid under-resuscitation or neurohormonal activation [^111fuzCT] [^113pAHBa] [^111sKjVz] [^116rf5rA].

> But wait, what if the patient is acutely decompensated or has hyponatremia. In acute decompensated heart failure, randomized data do not show that aggressive sodium and fluid restriction accelerates decongestion or improves short-term outcomes, and fluid restriction should be reserved for select scenarios such as refractory hyponatremia, with careful monitoring to avoid worsening renal perfusion or symptoms, so I should avoid reflexive strict restriction in the inpatient setting [^111aLPFt] [^111dSeUs] [^115CG8Mp].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance of benefits and risks. For hard outcomes, contemporary randomized evidence does not demonstrate that sodium restriction reduces death or hospitalization, while modest improvements in quality of life and functional class are plausible and were observed in SODIUM-HF and smaller trials. Therefore, if used, sodium restriction should be framed as a symptom-targeted strategy rather than disease-modifying therapy, with shared decision-making about goals and monitoring for unintended consequences [^114o9vSe] [^1138LeFP] [^1171FyQQ].

> Putting this together, I should conclude that sodium restriction does not clearly "help" heart failure patients in terms of mortality or hospitalization reduction, but it may modestly improve symptoms and quality of life in some patients when implemented thoughtfully. A pragmatic, individualized target of about 2,000–3,000 mg/day sodium with dietitian support is reasonable for many symptomatic patients, avoidance of excessive sodium above 3,000–3,500 mg/day is sensible, and routine aggressive restriction below 1,500 mg/day should generally be avoided outside of structured programs or specific clinical contexts, with ongoing reassessment of symptoms, renal function, and nutrition [^114o9vSe] [^1171FyQQ] [^11128zrK] [^112XbN7R] [^116rf5rA] [^113pAHBa].

---

Salt restriction is reasonable for heart failure patients with **symptomatic congestion** to reduce edema and dyspnea, but it does not reduce mortality or hospitalizations in robust trials [^114o9vSe] [^1138LeFP]. Very low sodium (< 1,500 mg/day) may worsen outcomes in some patients, so **individualized targets of 2,000–3,000 mg/day** are advised, with dietitian support to balance symptom relief and nutrition [^1171FyQQ] [^116rf5rA]. Avoid excessive sodium (> 3,000 mg/day), especially in advanced HF or with high diuretic doses, and tailor restriction to symptoms, comorbidities, and adherence [^113pAHBa] [^115CG8Mp].

---

## Physiological rationale for sodium restriction

High sodium intake increases extracellular fluid and plasma volume, worsening congestion and symptoms in heart failure [^117PnbKp]. Restriction aims to **reduce fluid overload**, improve symptoms, and lessen diuretic needs [^1171FyQQ].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

### Mortality and hospitalization outcomes

- **SODIUM-HF (2022)**: 806 patients with chronic HF; sodium < 1,500 mg/day vs usual care showed no reduction in cardiovascular hospitalization, ED visits, or all-cause mortality at 12 months (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.63–1.26) [^114o9vSe] [^115EtsDP].
- **Meta-analysis (2023)**: 17 RCTs (1,705 patients) found no reduction in all-cause death, hospitalization, or composite outcomes with sodium restriction [^1138LeFP].
- **Observational data**: Some studies suggest worse outcomes with very low sodium (< 2,000 mg/day), possibly due to neurohormonal activation (RAAS, sympathetic) [^111fuzCT] [^114CEJbW].

---

### Symptom and quality of life outcomes

Symptom and quality-of-life outcomes are mixed: some trials and meta-analyses report **improved NYHA class and quality of life** with sodium restriction, whereas others show no significant benefit [^1138LeFP] [^111XVx5j]. Overall, sodium restriction may modestly improve symptoms and quality of life in selected patients, but effects are inconsistent across studies [^1138LeFP].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** | **Level of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 | Avoid excessive sodium intake to reduce congestive symptoms | Class IIa, Level C-LD [^1171FyQQ] |
| ESC 2024 | Limit salt intake to ≤ 5 g/day (≤ 2 g sodium) in HF patients | Expert consensus [^11128zrK] |
| AND 2017 | Individualize sodium intake to 2,000–3,000 mg/day with dietitian support | Fair, Imperative [^116rf5rA] |

---

These guidelines emphasize **individualized sodium targets** and caution against overly strict restriction, especially in advanced HF or high diuretic doses [^1171FyQQ] [^11128zrK].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Neurohormonal activation**: Very low sodium can activate RAAS and sympathetic systems, potentially worsening HF [^114CEJbW].
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Strict restriction may reduce intake of calcium, thiamine, folate, and other micronutrients, risking malnutrition [^112xHwxU] [^117D1XFZ].
- **Hypotension and renal dysfunction**: Excessive restriction may cause hypotension, renal impairment, and electrolyte disturbances, especially with high-dose diuretics [^113X5mdV].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing sodium restriction

- **Severity of HF**: Advanced HF (NYHA III–IV) may benefit from moderate restriction (2,000–3,000 mg/day), whereas very low intake may be harmful [^1138LeFP] [^113LVPcj].
- **Comorbidities**: Hyponatremia, renal dysfunction, and malnutrition require individualized targets and close monitoring [^113pAHBa] [^115CG8Mp].
- **Adherence and lifestyle**: Social, cultural, and taste factors affect adherence; dietitian-led, culturally tailored counseling improves success [^112XbN7R] [^1148hW8L].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Individualized targets**: Aim for 2,000–3,000 mg/day sodium, adjusted to symptoms, comorbidities, and adherence [^116rf5rA].
- **Dietitian support**: Structured counseling improves adherence and nutritional adequacy [^1148hW8L] [^1171FyQQ].
- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for hypotension, renal dysfunction, and electrolyte disturbances, especially with aggressive restriction or high diuretic doses [^117H1t7w].
- **Avoid excessive restriction**: Do not routinely target < 1,500 mg/day; reserve strict limits for select cases with close monitoring [^11128zrK] [^1138LeFP].

---

Salt restriction is reasonable for HF patients with symptomatic congestion to reduce edema and dyspnea, but it does not improve survival or reduce hospitalizations in robust trials [^114o9vSe] [^1138LeFP]. Use **individualized targets of 2,000–3,000 mg/day** with dietitian support, avoid excessive restriction, and tailor to symptoms, comorbidities, and adherence [^1171FyQQ] [^116rf5rA].

### Estimates of dietary sodium consumption in patients with chronic heart failure [^116bFwUh]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Estimating dietary sodium intake is a key component of dietary assessment in the clinical setting of HF to effectively implement appropriate dietary interventions for sodium reduction and monitor adherence to the dietary treatment. In a research setting, assessment of sodium intake is crucial to an essential methodology to evaluate outcomes after a dietary or behavioral intervention. Current available sodium intake assessment methods include 24-hour urine collection, spot urine collections, multiple day food records, food recalls, and food frequency questionnaires. However, these methods have inherent limitations that make assessment of sodium intake challenging, and the utility of traditional methods may be questionable for estimating sodium intake in patients with HF. Thus, there are remaining questions about how to best assess dietary sodium intake in this patient population, and there is a need to identify a reliable method to assess and monitor sodium intake in the research and clinical setting of HF. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current methods for sodium intake assessment, addresses the challenges for its accurate evaluation, and highlights the relevance of applying the highest-quality measurement methods in the research setting to minimize the risk of biased data.

### Dietary interventions for heart failure in older adults: re-emergence of the hedonic shift [^113kXRM3]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Dietary non-adherence to sodium restriction is an important contribution to heart failure (HF) symptom burden, particularly in older adults. While knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward sodium restriction are important, sodium intake is closely linked to the ability to taste salt. The 'hedonic shift' occurs when sodium restriction induces changes in an individual's salt taste that lower subsequent salt affinity. Older adults often have compromised salt taste and higher dietary salt affinity due to age-related changes. Older HF patients may have additional loss of salt taste and elevated salt appetite due to comorbid conditions, medication use, and micronutrient or electrolyte abnormalities, creating a significant barrier to dietary adherence. Induction of the hedonic shift has the potential to improve long-term dietary sodium restriction and significantly impact HF outcomes in older adults.

### Dietary sodium intake and cardiovascular mortality: controversy resolved? [^111fuzCT]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Universal reduction in sodium intake has long been recommended, largely because of its proven ability to lower blood pressure for some. However, multiple randomized trials have also demonstrated that similar reductions in sodium increase plasma renin activity and aldosterone secretion, insulin resistance, sympathetic nerve activity, serum cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Thus, the health consequences of reducing sodium cannot be predicted by its impact on any single physiologic characteristic but will reflect the net of conflicting effects. Some 23 observational studies (> 360,000 subjects and > 26,000 end points) linking sodium intake to cardiovascular outcomes have yielded conflicting results. In subjects with average sodium intakes of less than 4.5 g/day, most have found an inverse association of intake with outcome; in subjects with average intakes greater than 4.5 g/day, most reported direct associations. Finally, in two, a "J-shaped" relation was detected. In addition, three randomized trials have found that heart failure subjects allocated to 1.8 g of sodium have significantly increased morbidity and mortality compared with those at 2.8 g. At the same time, a randomized study in retired Taiwanese men found that allocation to an average intake of 3.8 g improved survival compared with 5.3 g. Taken together, these data provide strong support for a "J-shaped" relation of sodium to cardiovascular outcomes. Sodium intakes above and below the range of 2.5–6.0 g/day are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This robust body of evidence does not support universal reduction of sodium intake.

Methods

Search strategy

We carried out a search following a strategy developed for a previous meta-analysisthat used keyword searches based on "sodium chloride, dietary", "sodium, dietary", or "diet, sodium-restricted" and "randomized controlled trial", "controlled clinical trial", or "randomized" (supplementary file 1). The databases searched included Ovid MEDLINE(R), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley). The search date was from the start date of the databases to 21 January 2019. Additionally, we reviewed the references of pertinent original studies and review articles to identify additional studies. We imposed no language restriction on our search.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Two of three reviewers (LH, KT, and SY) independently assessed records identified from the search for eligibility. We resolved any discrepancies by consensus. We included only trials with random allocation of participants to reduced dietary sodium intake and usual/higher dietary sodium intake (that is, control). Trials with concomitant interventions (eg, non-pharmacological interventions, antihypertensive or other drugs) were included only if the other interventions were applied equally to all randomised groups of interest. We included only studies with sodium intake estimated by 24 hour urine collection that also had data on systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure measurements. Studies with only mean arterial blood pressure reported were not included unless we could retrieve relevant data from the authors. We excluded studies conducted in children (age < 18 years), pregnant women, or individuals with confounding chronic conditions such as chronic kidney disease or heart failure.

Study quality

Study quality was assessed independently by two reviewers based on the five domains defined by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias version 5.0.1; namely, random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^111a6e15]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Twenty-two guidelines (59%) mentioned race at least once in reference to pharmacology. Guidelines emphasized the need for different first-line medications based on whether a patient belonged to a "Black" or "African American" racial group. A 1991 guideline asserted that "black patients tend to respond better to diuretics and calcium antagonists than to beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as monotherapy". Whelton et al. recommended "[f]or black adults with hypertension (without HF or CKD), initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or CCB". The two most recent hypertension guidelines included in this review recommended different pharmacologic medications based on race.

Fourteen guidelines (38%) referenced interventions designed to address existing differences in hypertension outcomes between racial groups due to lifestyle or behavioral factors. Ten guidelines discussed interventions to decrease sodium intake –, and increase potassium intake. Multiple guidelines described a unique relationship between salt and high blood pressure in African Americans. From the time this association was mentioned in 1991 ("limiting salt intake is recommended for all hypertensive patients, particularly those who are considered salt-sensitive, such as black and older adults"), the reference did not substantially change. A 2006 guideline stated: "The potential benefits of these dietary approaches are amplified because survey data indicate that blacks consume high levels of sodium while their potassium intake is less than that of nonblacks". The AHA's 2014 guideline asserted: "A reduction of salt intake is recommended in patients who are 'salt sensitive', which may be a fairly common finding in black communities". The 2018 guideline on resistant hypertension noted: "Other subgroups of individuals (e.g. those with CKD350 and obesity, blacks) are often more sensitive and can derive particularly robust benefits from sodium restriction". Other guidelines highlighted the need for interventions to increase physical activity, decrease obesity rates, and encourage smoking cessation. For example, Egan et al. wrote, "special attention to smoking cessation is especially important for African Americans with diabetes as they have more lower-extremity amputations than Caucasians with diabetes".

### Skip the strict salt and fluid restriction for hospitalized… [^111aLPFt]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does fluid and sodium restriction increase weight loss and improve clinical stability in hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Bottom Line This study suggests that a low-sodium and fluid-restricted diet, compared with a non-restricted diet, for patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure does not expedite weight loss or decrease congestion. Patients placed on such diets are, as expected, significantly thirstier than their standard-diet counterparts. Synopsis Many patients hospitalized for acute decompensated systolic heart failure are placed on fluid and sodium restriction, but it is unclear whether this practice is beneficial. In this small study, investigators randomized these patients to a fluid-restricted and sodium-restricted diet or a standard hospital diet.

Patients in the intervention group had a fluid intake of 800 mL per day and a sodium intake of 800 mg per day until discharge or hospital day 7, whichever came first. Patients in the control group received liberal fluids and sodium. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Most of the patients were white men, the mean ejection fraction in the entire group was 26%, and almost all patients were classified as New York Heart Association class III or IV. Three days after randomization, there were no significant differences detected in weight loss, clinical stability as assessed by the clinical congestion score, rates of intravenous diuretic or vasodilator use, mean diuretic doses required, or time to transition from intravenous to oral diuretic therapy. Patients in both groups lost approximately 4. 5 kg of body weight during this time.

### The role of dietary salt in metabolism and energy balance: insights beyond cardiovascular disease [^114n2Ybh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 Salt reduction: For better or for worse?

Given the deleterious effects of salt intake on CVD, salt reduction has been suggested to reduce the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular events. Previous studies have reported that reductions in dietary salt can protect against salt‐associated diseases, lowering BP and decreasing the risk of CVD. In a 4‐month RCT among healthy families, individuals receiving salt‐reduced bread had beneficial changes in cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, low‐salt diets can significantly reduce SBP in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In light of such findings, in another RCT, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, rich in whole grains, poultry, fish and nuts but lower in sodium, was used for 30 days, and participants were found to have reduced BP. In a prospective observational study involving 36 019 participants, the DASH diet was associated with a lower incidence of HF and reduced HF hospitalization. Therefore, all HF clinical practice guidelines recommend sodium restriction for patients with HF, including the 2022 ACC/AHA heart failure guidelines. The beneficial effects of sodium restriction on HF are thought to be achieved by reducing SBP and DBP, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness, inflammation, and aldosterone levels.

Despite the CVD benefits associated with sodium restriction, salt reduction interventions have also been observed to cause contrasting, paradoxical effects on cardiovascular health. In a recent open‐label RCT (the SODIUM‐HF study) in patients with HF recruited from six countries across the globe, the authors reported sodium restriction resulted in minimal effects on future adverse cardiovascular events. Previous evidence has shown that salt deficiency elevated low‐density lipoprotein, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. A recent observational study analysed data from the HART study and demonstrated that sodium restriction (< 2.5 g/d) in patients with HF was associated with an increased risk of death or hospitalization compared to those without a sodium‐restricted diet. Likewise, low sodium intake showed worsened systemic inflammation in HF patients. Moreover, studies showed that sodium restriction can cause inadequacies in macronutrients and micronutrients that could be associated with clinical instability. Therefore, due to inconsistent evidence, there has been some debate about the clinical benefits or harm of sodium/salt restriction in HF patients. As such, more randomized clinical trials with larger sample sizes and sufficient racial and ethnic diversity are needed to definitively address the role of sodium restriction in HF management. Finally, it is important to note that effective salt reduction is very difficult to achieve at the individual level.

### The long-term effects of dietary sodium restriction on clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure. the SODIUM-HF (study of dietary intervention under 100 mmol in heart failure): a pilot study [^115YPVdQ]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing a low-sodium to a moderate-sodium diet in heart failure (HF) patients.

Methods and Results

Patients with HF (New York Heart Association classes II-III) were randomized to low (1500 mg/d) or moderate-sodium (2300 mg/d) diet. Dietary intake was evaluated using 3-day food records. The end points were changes in quality of life as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels from baseline to 6 months of follow-up presented as medians [25th, 75th percentiles]. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (19/group). After 6 months, median sodium intake declined from 2137 to 1398 mg/d in the low-sodium and from 2678 to 1461 mg/d in the moderate-sodium diet group. Median BNP levels in the low-sodium diet group declined (216–71 pg/mL, P = .006), whereas in the moderate-sodium diet group, there was no change in BNP (171–188 pg/mL, P = .7; p = 0.17 between groups). For 6 months, median KCCQ clinical score increased in both groups (63–75 [P = .006] in the low-sodium diet group and 66–73 [P = .07] in the moderate-sodium group; p = 0.4 between groups). At 6 months, a post hoc analysis based on the dietary sodium intake achieved (> or ≤ 1,500 mg/d) in all patients showed an association between a sodium intake ≤ 1,500 mg/d and improvement in BNP levels and KCCQ scores.

Conclusions

A dietary intervention restricting sodium intake was feasible, and achievement of this sodium goal was associated with lower BNP levels and improved quality of life in patients with HF.

### Nutritional interventions in heart failure: a systematic review of the literature [^1158VC3w]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a major health care burden and there is a growing need to develop strategies to maintain health and sustain quality of life in persons with HF. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the components of nutrition interventions and to establish an evidence base for future advances in HF nutrition research and practice.

Methods and Results

Cinahl, Pubmed, and Embase were searched to identify articles published from 2005 to 2015. A total of 17 randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Results were divided into 2 categories of nutrition-related interventions: (1) educational and (2) prescriptive. Educational interventions improved patient outcomes such as adherence to dietary restriction in urine sodium levels and self-reported diet recall. Educational and prescriptive interventions resulted in decreased readmission rates and patient deterioration. Adherence measurement was subjective in many studies. Evidence showed that a normal-sodium diet and 1-liter fluid restriction along with high diuretic dosing enhanced B-type natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-6 markers.

Conclusions

Educational nutrition interventions positively affect patient clinical outcomes. Although clinical practice guidelines support a low-sodium diet and fluid restriction, research findings have revealed that a low-sodium diet may be harmful. Future research should examine the role of macronutrients, food quality, and energy balance in HF nutrition.

### Dietary sodium and fluid intake in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^11128zrK]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium and fluid restriction has traditionally been advocated in patients with heart failure (HF) due to their sodium and water avid state. However, most evidence regarding the altered sodium handling, fluid homeostasis and congestion-related signs and symptoms in patients with HF originates from untreated patient cohorts and physiological investigations. Recent data challenge the beneficial role of dietary sodium and fluid restriction in HF. Consequently, the European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines have gradually downgraded these recommendations over time, now advising for the limitation of salt intake to no more than 5g/day in patients with HF, while contemplating fluid restriction of 1.5–2L/day only in selected patients. Therefore, the objective of this clinical consensus statement is to provide advice on fluid and sodium intake in patients with acute and chronic HF, based on contemporary evidence and expert opinion.

### Rationale and design of the study of dietary intervention under 100 MMOL in heart failure (SODIUM-HF) [^112PWZ4q]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) remain at high risk for future events despite medical and device therapy. Dietary sodium reduction is often recommended based on limited evidence. However, it is not known whether dietary sodium reduction reduces the morbidity or mortality associated with HF.

Methods

The SODIUM study is a pragmatic, randomized, open-label trial assessing the efficacy of dietary sodium reduction to < 1500 mg daily counseling compared to usual care for patients with chronic HF. The intervention is provided by trained personnel at the site and uses 3-day food records for directing counseling. The primary outcome is an intention-to-treat analysis on the time to first cardiovascular event or death measured at 12 months. Secondary end points include the change in quality of life (using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), change in New York Heart Association class, and change in 6-minute walk test. The first patient was enrolled in March 2014, and subsequently, 27 sites in 6 countries enrolled patients.

Conclusions

The SODIUM-HF trial will provide a robust evaluation of the effects of dietary sodium reduction in patients with HF. Results are expected in 2020.

### Naproxen sodium [^116ntFJn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Heart Failure and Edema

The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.

Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Avoid the use of naproxen sodium in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If naproxen sodium is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

Since each naproxen sodium tablet contains 25 or 50 mg of sodium (about 2 mEq per each 500 mg of naproxen), this should be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted.

### Reduced salt intake for heart failure: a systematic review [^111XVx5j]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recent estimates suggest that more than 26 million people worldwide have heart failure. The syndrome is associated with major symptoms, significantly increased mortality, and extensive use of health care. Evidence-based treatments influence all these outcomes in a proportion of patients with heart failure. Current management also often includes advice to reduce dietary salt intake, although the benefits are uncertain.

Objective

To systematically review randomized clinical trials of reduced dietary salt in adult inpatients or outpatients with heart failure.

Evidence Review

Several bibliographic databases were systematically searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. The methodologic quality of the studies was evaluated, and data associated with primary outcomes of interest (cardiovascular-associated mortality, all-cause mortality, and adverse events, such as stroke and myocardial infarction) and secondary outcomes (hospitalization, length of inpatient stay, change in New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, adherence to dietary low-salt intake, and changes in blood pressure) were extracted.

Findings

Of 2655 retrieved references, 9 studies involving 479 unique participants were included in the analysis. None of the studies included more than 100 participants. The risks of bias in the 9 studies were variable. None of the included studies provided sufficient data on the primary outcomes of interest. For the secondary outcomes of interest, 2 outpatient-based studies reported that NYHA functional class was not improved by restriction of salt intake, whereas 2 studies reported significant improvements in NYHA functional class.

Conclusions and Relevance

Limited evidence of clinical improvement was available among outpatients who reduced dietary salt intake, and evidence was inconclusive for inpatients. Overall, a paucity of robust high-quality evidence to support or refute current guidance was available. This review suggests that well-designed, adequately powered studies are needed to reduce uncertainty about the use of this intervention.

### Self-care of heart failure patients: practical management recommendations from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^113pAHBa]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Fluid and salt intake
Fluid intake: Guidelines suggest that patients should limit fluid intake to 1.5–2 L in severe HF to relieve symptoms, and increase intake (and/or reduce diuretics) in hot and humid weather or in case of fluid loss. 14, 15 Very limited data with low level of evidence suggest that fluid restriction may reduce the risk for HF hospitalization, 16, 17 whereas other reports suggest it is not helpful for improving outcomes and is worse for patients' quality of life. 16 Fluid restriction is believed to be especially important in patients with hyponatraemia, but in one observational study of hospitalized patients with HF and hyponatraemia, fluid restriction was not associated with a meaningful increase in serum sodium. 18
Salt intake: There is no robust evidence for benefits of limiting salt intake in HF. In New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III–IV HF, ingesting > 3 g salt per day was associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death 19, 20 whereas in NYHA class I–II HF, an intake of < 2 g salt was associated with increased risk. 19 Others describe that sodium restriction is associated with increased risk of HF hospitalization. 21 A recent systematic review of nine trials involving 479 HFrEF patients was inconclusive. 22 Strict salt intake reduction is not recommended further than the recommendation for the general population by the World Health Organization for a healthy salt intake of < 5 g a day.

### Nutrition in cardiovascular disease: salt in hypertension and heart failure [^117PnbKp]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

There is much evidence for a causal relationship between salt intake and blood pressure (BP). The current salt intake in many countries is between 9 and 12 g/day. A reduction in salt intake to the recommended level of 5–6 g/day lowers BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals. A further reduction to 3–4 g/day has a much greater effect. Prospective studies and outcome trials have demonstrated that a lower salt intake is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence also suggests that a high salt intake is directly related to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) independent of BP. Both raised BP and LVH are important risk factors for heart failure. It is therefore possible that a lower salt intake could prevent the development of heart failure. In patients who already have heart failure, a high salt intake aggravates the retention of salt and water, thereby exacerbating heart failure symptoms and progression of the disease. A lower salt intake plays an important role in the management of heart failure. Despite this, currently there is no clear evidence on how far salt intake should be reduced in heart failure. Our personal view is that these patients should reduce their salt intake to < 5 g/day, i.e. the maximum intake recommended by the World Health Organisation for all adults. If salt intake is successfully reduced, there may well be a need for a reduction in diuretic dosage.

### Reduced salt intake for heart failure… [^114aLPVh]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the evidence that reduced dietary salt intake benefits adults with heart failure. Findings In this systematic review of 9 unique studies of 479 unique patients with heart failure, an overall paucity of robust high-quality evidence was available to support or refute the use of reduced dietary salt intake. Meaning Despite broad advocacy, uncertainty about the robustness of advice to reduce salt intake in patients with heart failure remains. Importance Recent estimates suggest that more than 26 million people worldwide have heart failure. The syndrome is associated with major symptoms, significantly increased mortality, and extensive use of health care. Evidence-based treatments influence all these outcomes in a proportion of patients with heart failure. Current management also often includes advice to reduce dietary salt intake, although the benefits are uncertain.

Objective To systematically review randomized clinical trials of reduced dietary salt in adult inpatients or outpatients with heart failure. Evidence Review. Several bibliographic databases were systematically searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. The methodologic quality of the studies was evaluated, and data associated with primary outcomes of interest and secondary outcomes were extracted.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111RKLXp]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

### Sodium and fluid restriction-reply… [^117V3nRi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In Reply We appreciate the interest by Yeh and Jain in our article and the recognition that it adds more data to the continuing controversy surrounding salt restriction on health. We all know that restricting salt is the current consolidated practice in patients with acute heart failure. 1 However, this practice is definitely not evidence based. Our study is consistent with at least 2 other previous studies that have tested similar interventions. 2, 3 These studies and ours4 constitute the contemporaneous body of evidence on salt and water restriction in patients with heart failure. We agree with Yeh and Jain that the number of patients in our trial was not large, but when we checked other studies' numbers, we see that our study sample is actually the largest. These consistencies in data may have contributed in assuming salt and water restriction as "unnecessary". Aliti G, Rabelo ER, Beck-da-Silva L. Sodium and Fluid Restriction — Reply.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Avoiding repeated hospital admissions — The heart failure (HF) specialist should be thoroughly familiar with the transition of care at the time of hospital discharge and identify patients likely to decompensate and require readmission; this allows management of frequent follow-up visits, careful medication adjustment, and development of a strategy for surveillance of electrolytes and renal function. The HF specialist should provide comprehensive education to both patient and family about the disease process, nonpharmacological therapy and elements of self-management, including dietary sodium restriction, and adherence to the medication regimen and follow-up appointments. The guidelines recommend multidisciplinary disease management programs for patients at risk of clinical deterioration or readmission to address barriers to adherence and reduce hospitalization; if a program is not available at the clinician's institution, the HF specialist should be familiar with and establish a referral relationship with a disease management program elsewhere. The HF specialist should facilitate integration and coordination of care with primary care physicians, internists, and other groups, including cardiac rehabilitation and home nursing services.

### Home-delivered meals postdischarge from heart failure hospitalization [^115u3zn4]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Background In patients with heart failure (HF), malnutrition and dietary sodium excess are common and may worsen outcomes. No prior studies have provided low-sodium, nutritionally complete meals following HF hospitalization. Methods and Results The GOURMET-HF study (Geriatric Out-of-Hospital Randomized Meal Trial in Heart Failure) randomized patients discharged from HF hospitalization to 4 weeks of home-delivered sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension meals (DASH/SRD; 1500 mg sodium/d) versus usual care. The primary outcome was the between-group change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score from discharge to 4 weeks postdischarge. Additional outcomes included changes in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score and cardiac biomarkers. All patients were followed 12 weeks for death/all-cause readmission and potential diet-related adverse events (symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury). Sixty-six patients were randomized 1:1 at discharge to DASH/SRD versus usual care (age, 71 ± 8 years; 30% female; ejection fraction, 39 ± 18%). The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score increased similarly between groups (DASH/SRD 46 ± 23–59 ± 20 versus usual care 43 ± 19–53 ± 24; P = 0.38), but the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score increase tended to be greater in DASH/SRD participants (47 ± 22–65 ± 19 versus 45 ± 20–55 ± 26; P = 0.053). Potentially diet-related adverse events were uncommon; 30-day HF readmissions (11% versus 27%; P = 0.06) and days rehospitalized within that timeframe (17 versus 55; P = 0.055) trended lower in DASH/SRD participants. Conclusions Home-delivered DASH/SRD after HF hospitalization appeared safe in selected patients and had directionally favorable effects on HF clinical status and 30-day readmissions. Larger studies are warranted to clarify the effects of postdischarge nutritional support in patients with HF. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

### Nutrient deficiencies in heart failure: a micro problem with macro effects? [^112GjWkG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Current HF guidelines recognize that although nutrition is likely important, more data are needed to provide adequate dietary guidance. 15 Work centered on single micronutrient deficiency and supplementation in HF has produced mostly neutral results in clinical trials. 3 This fact, along with increasing controversy related to dietary sodium restriction, 16 has led to growing interest in overall dietary quality. In the Women's Health Initiative cohort, participants with HF who had greater adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating pattern had slightly lower mortality over a median of 4 years, with a similar trend for Mediterranean diet adherence. 17 However, even the best observational studies can be limited by the logistical challenges and accuracy of nutrient measurement, and resulting associations between diet and outcomes can be affected by unmeasured confounders. 18

A few small clinical trials have moved beyond dietary risk assessment in cohort studies and the supplementation of single micronutrients to directly assess the effects of nutritional support in HF. The PICNIC (Nutritional Intervention Program in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure Who Are Malnourished) study randomized 120 Spanish inpatients with HF at risk for nutritional complications to a multidisciplinary dietary intervention. The program involved tailored dietary recommendations delivered through monthly in‐person nutrition‐focused visits. With this intensive support, 27% of patients died or were hospitalized for HF over 12 months of follow‐up, versus 61% in the usual care group. 19 The recently published GOURMET‐HF (Geriatric Out‐of‐Hospital Randomized Meal Trial in Heart Failure) pilot study randomized 66 US patients with HF at hospital discharge to 4 weeks of home‐delivered, low‐sodium, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension–compliant meals compared with usual care. Although the primary outcome of disease‐specific quality of life did not differ between groups, secondary analyses showed a trend toward reduction in HF symptoms and 30‐day readmissions in the group receiving meals. 20

The study by Lennie and colleagues 7 provides another important link between micronutrient deficiencies and outcomes in patients with HF. The findings promote much‐needed thinking beyond sodium restriction or individual nutrient supplementation toward maintaining overall dietary quality. The time is right to conduct larger clinical trials of comprehensive dietary support in HF, which hold strong potential to improve quality of life and outcomes in this vulnerable population.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Tailored advice for patients and their caregivers should be provided considering their actual food and fluid intake, symptoms and current medication use. Severely ill patients with HF with low quality of life and decreased life expectancy should not be burdened with extensive lifestyle changes which may be of limited benefit.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Do not judge others for their lifestyle choices or behaviour.
Educate the patient on a healthy, varied diet. This can be done by a team member of the HF team and specialist consultation of a dietician might be needed.
Because weight reduction may confer metabolic and functional benefits, it is reasonable to recommend weight loss for selected patients, especially if young, functionally limited by overweight, and morbidly obesity (e.g. BMI > 35 kg/m 2). However, weight loss may be especially challenging for patients and caregivers already managing chronic HF. 10
Ask during every outpatient encounter about food intake. It is reasonable for patients with HF to be screened for unintentional weight loss at least annually, because of the strong association between cachexia and adverse clinical outcomes. It is important to detect early weight loss and loss of appetite. Research primarily focused on cancer patients found that identification of so‐called 'pre‐cachexia' and the provision of tailored nutritional counselling, helped maintain nutritional status, improve treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes. 35 Such findings might be applicable to a HF population. Consider regular (twice yearly) blood tests to check for iron levels and other micronutrients if history suggests this may be required. 10
Offer counselling to those who present with malnutrition or alcohol dependency. Referral to nutritionist or dietician with CV expertise should be offered to patients with cachexia, morbid obesity, or unhealthy food intake. Consider referral for support (addiction expertise) if the patient wishes to stop drinking alcohol.
Ask patients if they take any supplements (including vitamins) and the rationale for it. Supplements have not been studied in large randomized trials and the general recommendation is to gain these micronutrients from a varied diet to prevent depletion. Some supplements might be expensive, some contain high levels of sodium or potassium without the patient and health care provider knowing about it.

Recommendations for future research

Weight management tailored for overweight patients with HF.
Optimal fluid and salt management in patients with HF.
The need for micronutrient supplementation in patients with HF.
Optimal dietary advice for cachectic patients

Dietary and exercise guideline alignment in heart failure — Dietary restrictions and exercise recommendations: Typical dietary guidelines for the HF population state that sodium restriction or fluid restriction in patients with severe HF with congestion and with hyponatremia is reasonable; otherwise, there are no specific recommendations for caloric intake or dietary composition in current guidelines, other than nutritional supplements not being recommended as treatment of HF in patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF. With this background, the Heart Failure Society of America, European Society of Cardiology, ACC, and AHA recommend exercise training or regular physical activity in patients with HF.

### Sodium restriction in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1138LeFP]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium restriction is a nonpharmacologic treatment suggested by practice guidelines for the management of patients with heart failure (HF). In this study, we synthesized the data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of sodium restriction on clinical outcomes in patients with HF.

Methods

In this aggregate data meta-analysis, Cochrane Central, MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), Embase Ovid, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) Plus databases were searched up to April 2, 2022. RCTs were included if they investigated the effects of sodium/salt restriction as compared to no restriction on clinical outcomes in patients with HF. Outcomes of interest included mortality, hospitalization, change in New York Heart Association functional class, and quality of life (QoL).

Results

Seventeen RCTs were identified (834 and 871 patients in intervention and control groups, respectively). Sodium restriction did not reduce the risk of all-cause death (odds ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.58–1.58]), hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.62–1.13]), or the composite of death/hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.63–1.23]). The results were similar in different subgroups, except for the numerically lower risk of death with reduced sodium intake reported in RCTs with dietary sodium at the 2000 to 3000 mg/d range as opposed to < 2000 mg/d (and in RCTs with versus without fluid restriction as a co-intervention). Among RCTs reporting New York Heart Association change, 2 RCTs (which accounted for two-thirds of the data) showed improvement in New York Heart Association class with sodium restriction. Substantial heterogeneity existed for QoL: 6 RCTs showed improvement of QoL and 4 RCTs showed no improvement of sodium restriction on QoL.

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis of RCTs, sodium restriction was not associated with fewer deaths or hospitalizations in patients with HF. Dietary sodium restriction may be associated with improvements in symptoms and QoL.

### Medically tailored meals in heart failure: a systematic review of the literature, 2013–2023 [^113cKZ13]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dietary interventions have potential to improve symptoms and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), but there are barriers to eating nutrient-dense diets. One strategy to address challenges is to provide medically tailored meals (MTMs), fully prepared meals that align with an individual's nutritional needs. In this systematic review, we examined clinical outcomes of studies that provided MTMs to patients with HF.

Methods and Results

We searched CINAH, EBSCO/MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify MTM interventions published between 2013 and 2023. We included six studies. Five studies involved sodium restriction. Four of these were randomized control trials and one was a matched cohort study. Sample sizes ranged from 31 to 641. Patient populations included individuals who had heart failure, acute decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. One study involved energy restriction in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity. This was a randomized controlled study with a sample size of 100. Sodium-restriction interventions, when aligned with Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension goals, reduced 90-day HF readmissions in one study and trended towards improving 30-day and 12-week HF readmissions in another. The energy-restriction intervention reduced diastolic blood pressure, weight, and inflammatory biomarkers, and improved quality of life (QoL) and cardiorespiratory fitness. Neither intervention had an impact on mortality.

Conclusions

Provision of sodium-restricted MTMs to patients with HF may reduce the risk of rehospitalization. Provision of energy-restricted MTMs to patients with HF and obesity can improve symptoms, weight loss, QoL, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these effects and investigate underlying mechanisms.

### Recommendation of low-salt diet and short-term outcomes in heart failure with preserved systolic function [^112ynLEi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary sodium indiscretion frequently contributes to hospitalizations in elderly heart failure patients. Animal models suggest an important role for dietary sodium intake in the pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved systolic function. The documentation and effects of hospital discharge recommendations, particularly for sodium-restricted diet, have not been extensively investigated in heart failure with preserved systolic function.

Methods

We analyzed 1700 heart failure admissions to Michigan community hospitals. We compared documentation of guideline-based discharge recommendations between preserved systolic function and systolic heart failure patients with chi-squared testing, and used logistic regression to identify predictors of 30-day death and hospital readmission in a prespecified follow-up cohort of 443 patients with preserved systolic function. We hypothesized that patients who received a documented discharge recommendation for sodium-restricted diet would have lower 30-day adverse event rates.

Results

Heart failure patients with preserved systolic function were significantly less likely than systolic heart failure patients to receive discharge recommendations for weight monitoring (33% vs 43%) and sodium-restricted diet (42% vs 53%). Upon propensity score-adjusted multivariable analysis, patients with preserved systolic function who received a documented sodium-restricted diet recommendation had decreased odds of 30-day combined death and readmission (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.79; p = 0.007). No other discharge recommendations predicted 30-day outcomes.

Conclusions

Clinicians document appropriate discharge instructions less frequently in heart failure with preserved systolic function than systolic heart failure. Selected heart failure patients with preserved systolic function who receive advice for sodium-restricted diet may have improved short-term outcomes after hospital discharge.

### Tolvaptan [^111g178i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with hyponatremia (defined as < 135 mEq/L), serum sodium concentration increased to a significantly greater degree in tolvaptan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients as early as 8 hours after the first dose, and the change was maintained for 30 days. The percentage of patients requiring fluid restriction (defined as ≤ 1 L/day at any time during the treatment period) was also significantly less (p = 0.0017) in the tolvaptan-treated group (30/215, 14%) as compared with the placebo-treated group (51/206, 25%).

Figure 1 shows the change from baseline in serum sodium by visit in patients with serum sodium < 135 mEq/L. Within 7 days of tolvaptan discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations in tolvaptan-treated patients declined to levels similar to those of placebo-treated patients.

In the open-label study SALTWATER, 111 patients, 94 of them hyponatremic (serum sodium < 135 mEq/L), previously on tolvaptan or placebo therapy, were given tolvaptan as a titrated regimen (15 to 60 mg once daily) after having returned to standard care for at least 7 days. By this time, their baseline mean serum sodium concentration had fallen to between their original baseline and post-placebo therapy level. Upon initiation of therapy, average serum sodium concentrations increased to approximately the same levels as observed for those previously treated with tolvaptan and were sustained for at least a year. Figure 3 shows results from 111 patients enrolled in the SALTWATER Study.

14.2	Heart Failure

In a phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EVEREST), 4133 patients with worsening heart failure were randomized to tolvaptan or placebo as an adjunct to standard of care. Long-term tolvaptan treatment (mean duration of treatment of 0.75 years) had no demonstrated effect, either favorable or unfavorable, on all-cause mortality [HR (95% CI): 0.98 (0.9, 1.1)] or the combined endpoint of CV mortality or subsequent hospitalization for worsening HF [HR (95% CI): 1.0 (0.9, 1.1)].

### Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^115BtH51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

An earlier Cochrane review of dietary advice identified insufficient evidence to assess effects of reduced salt intake on mortality or cardiovascular events.

Objectives

1. To assess the long term effects of interventions aimed at reducing dietary salt on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity.2. To investigate whether blood pressure reduction is an explanatory factor in any effect of such dietary interventions on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect (DARE)), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched through to October 2008. References of included studies and reviews were also checked. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Trials fulfilled the following criteria: (1) randomised with follow up of at least six-months, (2) intervention was reduced dietary salt (restricted salt dietary intervention or advice to reduce salt intake), (3) adults, (4) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data was available. Two reviewers independently assessed whether studies met these criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and study validity were compiled by a single reviewer, and checked by a second. Authors were contacted where possible to obtain missing information. Events were extracted and relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs calculated.

Main Results

Seven studies (including 6,489 participants) met the inclusion criteria - three in normotensives (n = 3518), two in hypertensives (n = 758), one in a mixed population of normo- and hypertensives (n = 1981) and one in heart failure (n = 232) with end of trial follow-up of seven to 36 months and longest observational follow up (after trial end) to 12.7 yrs. Relative risks for all cause mortality in normotensives (end of trial RR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.12, 60 deaths; longest follow up RR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.40, 79 deaths) and hypertensives (end of trial RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.13, 513 deaths; longest follow up RR 0.96, 95% CI; 0.83 to 1.11, 565 deaths) showed no strong evidence of any effect of salt reduction. Cardiovascular morbidity in people with normal blood pressure (longest follow-up RR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.20, 200 events) or raised blood pressure at baseline (end of trial RR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.23, 93 events) also showed no strong evidence of benefit. Salt restriction increased the risk of all-cause death in those with congestive heart failure (end of trial relative risk: 2.59, 95% 1.04 to 6.44, 21 deaths). We found no information on participants health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (665 deaths in some 6,250 participants), there is still insufficient power to exclude clinically important effects of reduced dietary salt on mortality or cardiovascular morbidity in normotensive or hypertensive populations. Further RCT evidence is needed to confirm whether restriction of sodium is harmful for people with heart failure. Our estimates of benefits from dietary salt restriction are consistent with the predicted small effects on clinical events attributable to the small blood pressure reduction achieved.

### Hyponatremia and vasopressin antagonism in congestive heart failure [^115sgsXe]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

In a national heart failure registry, hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L) was initially reported in 5% of patients and considered a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. In a chronic heart failure study, serum sodium level on admission predicted an increased length of stay for cardiovascular causes and increased mortality within 60 days of discharge. Hyponatremia in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with a higher mortality rate. Also, by monitoring and increasing serum sodium levels during hospitalization for CHF, patient outcomes may improve. This review describes the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in relation to CHF, including the mechanism of action of vasopressin receptors in the kidney, and assesses the preclinical and clinical trials of vasopressin receptor antagonists — agents recently developed to treat hyponatremia. In hospitalized patients with CHF, hyponatremia plays a major role in poor outcomes. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials in patients with hyponatremia.

Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the composite of HF hospitalizations or CV death (Panel B), and of CV death alone (HR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.76–0.97; P = 0.01), death from any cause (HR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82–0.99; P = 0.03), total hospitalizations for HF (HR 0.71; 95% CI: 0.65–0.78; P < 0.001), and MACE (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.80–0.99; P = 0.02). In this patient-level meta-analysis, there was no evidence that the effects of dapagliflozin differed by LVEF.

Several papers addressed the issue of diuresis, renal function, sodium, and potassium.

The issue of sodium restriction in HF has been disputed for long, and the study of dietary intervention under 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF) was designed to test whether or not a reduction in dietary sodium reduces the incidence of future clinical events.SODIUM-HF enrolled 806 patients with chronic HF receiving guideline-directed medical treatment, and randomized them to either usual care according to local guidelines or a low sodium diet (LSD) of < 100 mmol (this is < 1500 mg/day). The median sodium intake decreased from 2286 mg/day (interquartile range 1653–3005) to 1658 mg/day (1301–2189) in the low sodium group and from 2119 mg/day (1673–2804) to 2073 mg/day (1541–2900) in the usual care group. By 12 months, the primary composite endpoint of CV-related admission to hospital, CV-related emergency department visit, or all-cause death had occurred in 15% of patients in the LSD group and 17% in the usual care group (HR 0.89; 95% CI: 0.63–1.26; P = 0.53). So, a dietary intervention to reduce sodium intake does not reduce clinical events.

### In patients with heart failure, a low-sodium diet does not improve… [^112RqM17]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

American Family Physician associate editor Barry Weiss, MD discussed several studies showing that a low-sodium diet produced no benefits and increased mortality compared to a normal diet in heart failure patients in the outpatient and inpatient settings. Consequently, he advised that "based on current evidence and until further studies are completed, patients with heart failure should probably be discouraged from reducing their sodium consumption to less than 2, 300 mg per day". Two subsequent systematic reviews of studies of dietary sodium restriction in heart failure also questioned low-sodium dogma. A 2018 review of 9 randomized trials with 479 participants with heart failure found insufficient data on cardiovascular-associated and all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction and conflicting evidence on changes in New York Heart Association functional class.

Last month, the Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure trial, with 806 participants from 26 sites in Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and New Zealand reported its primary findings. All participants in this pragmatic randomized trial were receiving optimally tolerated guideline-directed medical treatment for chronic heart failure. Participants were randomly assigned to usual care or a low sodium diet of < 100 mmol/day. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular-related hospitalization, emergency department visit, and all-cause mortality within 12 months. Median sodium intake decreased in the low-sodium group from 2, 286 mg to 1, 658 mg/day and in the usual care group from 2, 119 mg to 2, 073 mg/day by the end of the trial. However, in an intention-to-treat analysis, researchers found no statistical differences between the groups in the composite outcome or in each of the individual outcomes. As Dr.

Weiss cautioned in his AFP editorial, "the possibility that aggressive sodium restriction may lead to unfavorable outcomes in patients with heart failure should not. be misconstrued as meaning that we should lose our focus on reducing sodium intake in the general population. " Indeed, there is good evidence that population-level interventions are effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, including a large Chinese randomized trial of a salt substitute that Dr.

2.1 Effect of high salt intake on hypertension

Hypertension is one of the most common chronic vascular diseases, affecting 1.39 billion adults globally as of 2010. Hypertension was traditionally defined as a persistent systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg. In the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, the diagnostic criterion for hypertension has been reduced to ≥ 130/80 mm Hg with SBP/DBP ranges of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg defined as Stage 1 hypertension, and ≥ 140/90 mm Hg as Stage 2 hypertension. The purpose of this reduction was to promote earlier interventions to reduce CVD risks and prevent major adverse CVD outcomes. However, there has been some controversy concerning BP measurements, BP cut‐offs, the target BP values to strive for, the timing and intensity of antihypertensive treatment, and the benefits of lowering BP targets in different age groups and ethnicities. In view of this, some clinical practice guidelines (ie, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension, the 2019 National Institute of Health and Care Excellence [NICE], and the 2020 International Society of Hypertension guidelines) still use the 140/90 mm Hg cut‐off for hypertension diagnosis. Nevertheless, all the guidelines have substantial accordance in their recommendations. Hypertension can be classified as primary (essential) or secondary. Primary hypertension is by far the most common typeand refers to high BP of unknown, idiopathic origin. Poorly controlled hypertension increases the risk of HF, heart attack, stroke, renal failure and even death. The development of hypertension is influenced by various genetic, environmental and dietary factors, involving complex neuronal and hormonal regulation. High salt intake is strongly associated with the development of hypertension. In light of this, understanding the underlying mechanisms of salt‐induced hypertension is an important area in cardiovascular health. Multiple factors have been studied and established as playing important roles in salt‐induced hypertension, including increased activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS), endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity, impaired renal and intestinal ion transport, altered natriuretic peptides (NPs) and others. As salt‐induced hypertension has been reviewed in depth in previous reports, here we describe some updates regarding these mechanisms that mediate salt‐induced hypertension.

### Heart failure events in randomized controlled trials for adults receiving maintenance dialysis: a meta-epidemiologic study [^114MJGcX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome with symptoms and/or signs caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality corroborated by objective evidence of congestion and/or elevated ventricular filling pressures. Heart failure is a common comorbidity in patients with kidney failure receiving dialysis and is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality. While cardiovascular (CV) events are clearly recognized as important to patients with kidney disease, there is uncertainty as to whether CV events, including heart failure, are defined adequately in patients with kidney failure. Heart failure events are particularly problematic because they share many features of pure volume overload due to dietary sodium and fluid non-adherence or underdialysis that can make the entities frequently clinically indistinguishable in clinical and research settings.

In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), outcome events are ideally important to both patients and clinicians by virtue of their prognostic relevance (e.g. impact on survival, function, or quality of life). Outcome events should also be easily differentiated from other events that are dissimilar in their importance and pathophysiology. We make a distinction between a diagnostic definition, which provides the concept of a diagnosis (e.g. elevated cardiac filling pressures due to cardiac dysfunction), and diagnostic criteria, which provide explicit criteria that clinicians can use to establish a diagnosis (e.g. diagnostic criteria for heart failure requires dyspnoea and at least one of the of the following signs [i.e. elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), respiratory crackles, S3] and either radiographic findings [i.e. vascular redistribution, interstitial pulmonary oedema] with implementation of heart failure treatments such as diuretics or ultrafiltration and documented clinical improvement). When diagnostic criteria are poorly specified, they introduce 'noise', which quickly diminishes statistical power and makes the interpretation of treatment effects challenging. In heart failure populations without concomitant kidney failure, standardized consensus diagnostic criteria for heart failure events exist and these diagnostic criteria help ensure events are of similar meaning to stakeholders (i.e. patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, researchers, industry, regulators), are prognostically relevant, comparable across clinical studies, and ideally have shared pathophysiology to facilitate the identification of effective therapies.

Self‐care Management behaviour

Self‐care behaviour to respond appropriately to symptoms

Appropriate responses to symptoms include patients adjusting their diuretic dose, contacting a health care provider, and decreasing activity level as well as fluid and salt intake.

Current guidelines and evidence

HF guidelines recommend diuretics to improve symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with signs and/or symptoms of congestion, and they should likewise be considered to reduce the risk of hospitalization in these same patients. 14
A flexible and individualized diuretic dosing regimen may improve quality of life and help reduce emergency department visits and HF‐related hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF. 116
Despite the guideline recommendation to use the lowest possible dose of diuretics and discontinue loop diuretics if possible, little information is available on discontinuing loop diuretics in contemporary treated patients with HF. 117, 118

### The relationship of diuretics and dietary sodium in patients with heart failure: an analysis of the SODIUM-HF trial [^1158wFDG]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

SODIUM-HF was a large clinical trial testing dietary sodium restriction compared to usual care in patients with heart failure that showed no reduction in clinical events. It has been suggested that diuretic doses in response to dietary sodium modification may have influenced the trial results.

Objective

We assessed the effects of baseline diuretic dose and diuretic dose changes on clinical outcomes in the SODIUM-HF trial.

Methods

Diuretics were converted to furosemide-equivalent diuretic total daily doses. Furosemide dose was treated as a continuous variable and also stratified into 0mg, 1mg to 39mg, 40mg, 41mg to 80mg, and > 80mg daily. The baseline diuretic dose and change in diuretic dose were assessed and correlated with dietary sodium restriction and changes in dietary sodium intake. We then examined the relationship between diuretic dosing and the primary outcomes of SODIUM-HF (cardiovascular-related emergency department visit, cardiovascular-related hospitalization, and all-cause mortality).

Results

Of the 806 patients enrolled in the SODIUM-HF trial, 784 had known diuretic status at baseline: 209 patients (26.7%) with 0mg, 134 patients (17%) with 1mg to 39mg, 205 patients (26.1%) with 40mg, 118 patients (15.1%) with 41mg to 80mg, and 118 patients (15.1%) with > 80mg. No correlation was found between dietary sodium intake and diuretic dose, either at baseline or change throughout the study (P > .05). For the primary outcomes, the 2-year risk of primary outcomes was strongly correlated with diuretic dose at baseline across the overall SODIUM-HF population (P < .001). No significant association was found between the treatment arm and the risk of primary outcomes, within each baseline diuretic dose range or with change in diuretic dose (both P > .05).

Conclusions

Although a higher baseline diuretic dose was associated with worse clinical outcomes, no association was found between dietary sodium restriction, baseline or change in diuretic dose and the primary outcomes.

### Nutrition assessment and dietary interventions in heart Failure: JACC review topic of the Week [^115pEvtg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of nutrition disorders in patients with heart failure (HF), major HF guidelines lack specific nutrition recommendations. Because of the lack of standardized definitions and assessment tools to quantify nutritional status, nutrition disorders are often missed in patients with HF. Additionally, a wide range of dietary interventions and overall dietary patterns have been studied in this population. The resulting evidence of benefit is, however, conflicting, making it challenging to determine which strategies are the most beneficial. In this document, we review the available nutritional status assessment tools for patients with HF. In addition, we appraise the current evidence for dietary interventions in HF, including sodium restriction, obesity, malnutrition, dietary patterns, and specific macronutrient and micronutrient supplementation. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility and challenges associated with the implementation of multimodal nutrition interventions and delineate potential solutions to facilitate addressing nutrition in patients with HF.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — general measures for patients with current or prior symptoms of heart failure: Moderate sodium restriction with daily weight measurement is indicated to permit effective use of diuretic drugs, and immunization with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines may reduce respiratory infection risk; physical activity should be encouraged except during acute exacerbations or suspected myocarditis. Three classes of drugs can exacerbate HF and should be avoided in most patients — antiarrhythmic agents (with only amiodarone and dofetilide shown not to adversely affect survival), calcium channel blockers (with only the vasoselective ones shown not to adversely affect survival), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can cause sodium retention, peripheral vasoconstriction, and attenuate the efficacy and enhance the toxicity of diuretics and ACEIs. Patients with HF should be monitored carefully for changes in serum potassium, every effort should be made to prevent hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, and many experts believe serum potassium concentrations should be targeted in the 4.0 to 5.0 mmol per liter range; in some patients deficits may require supplementation of magnesium and potassium, whereas in others (particularly those taking ACEIs alone or with aldosterone antagonists) routine potassium salts may be unnecessary and potentially deleterious. Patient education and close supervision, including surveillance by the patient and family, can reduce nonadherence and enable early detection of changes in body weight or clinical status to allow treatments that can prevent clinical deterioration.

Several dietary guidelines, health organizations and government policies recommend population-wide sodium restriction to prevent hypertension and related comorbidities like heart failure (HF). The current European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Heart Failure guidelines recommend restricting sodium in HF patients. However, these recommendations are based on expert opinion (level C), leading to wide variability in application and lack of consensus among providers pertaining to dietary salt restriction. To evaluate the strength of current evidences to recommend dietary salt restriction among HF patients, we performed a comprehensive literature review and explored the safety and efficacy of such recommendations.

### Characteristics and in-hospital outcomes for nonadherent patients with heart failure: findings from get with the guidelines-heart failure (GWTG-HF) [^112DJpgk]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Medication and dietary nonadherence are precipitating factors for heart failure (HF) hospitalization; however, the characteristics, outcomes, and quality of care of patients with nonadherence are unknown. Recognizing features of nonadherent patients may provide a means to reduce rehospitalization for this population.

Methods

GWTG-HF registry data were collected from 236 hospitals and 54,322 patients from January 1, 2005 to December 30, 2007. Demographics, clinical characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and quality of care were stratified by precipitating factor for HF admission. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of nonadherence with length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Clinicians documented dietary and/or medication nonadherence as the reason for admission in 5576 (10.3%) of HF hospitalizations. Nonadherent patients were younger and more likely to be male, minority, uninsured, and have nonischemic HF. These patients had lower ejection fractions (34.9% vs 39.6%, P < .0001), more frequent previous HF hospitalizations, higher brain natriuretic peptide levels (1813 vs 1371 pg/mL, P < .0001), and presented with greater signs of congestion. Despite this, nonadherent patients had shorter LOS (odds ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.92–0.97) and lower in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.51–0.83) in multivariate analysis. Although nonadherent patients received high rates of Joint Commission core measures, rates of other evidence-based treatments were less optimal.

Conclusions

Nonadherence is a common precipitant for HF admission. Despite a higher risk profile, nonadherent patients had lower in-hospital mortality and LOS, suggesting that it may be easier to stabilize nonadherent patients by reinstituting sodium and/or fluid restriction and resuming medical therapy.

### Assessing barriers to healthy eating in hospitalized older adults with heart failure: psychometric properties of two questionnaires [^114ZCsk2]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dietary sodium excess and malnutrition have been associated with poor outcomes in heart failure (HF). Few previous studies have examined the barriers to following a low-sodium, nutritionally robust diet in hospitalized patients with HF.

Methods and Results

As part of a dietary intervention pilot study, 76 inpatients with HF (age 71 ± 8 years, 30% female, 30% black, 36% Hispanic/Latino) completed 2 questionnaires, the Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DSRQ) and the Brief Dietary Psychosocial Scale (BDPS), to assess challenges in following a low-sodium, nutritionally complete diet. We assessed the factor structure of the DSRQ and BDPS with confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis (CFA and EFA). CFA did not support the established 3-factor solution for the DSRQ; instead, EFA indicated that a 2-factor solution (subjective norms/attitudes and perceived behavioral control) provided the best fit for the data. EFA supported 4 separate factors for the BDPS, as in its original derivation. Cronbach's alphas supported internal consistency reliability for both scales (DSRQ: 0.85–0.94; BDPS: 0.72–0.95).

Conclusions

In a mixed-ethnicity group of hospitalized older patients with HF, the DSRQ and BDPS have reasonable psychometric properties. These questionnaires may help identify barriers to healthy dietary practices and facilitate nutritional interventions in this high-risk population.

Nonpharmacological management — fluid restriction for hyponatremia in advanced heart failure carries a Class of Recommendation 2b and Level of Evidence C-LD: For patients with advanced HF and hyponatremia, the benefit of fluid restriction to reduce congestive symptoms is uncertain. Supportive text notes that in a registry study of hyponatremia in acute decompensated HF, fluid restriction only improved hyponatremia marginally; a registered dietitian–guided fluid and sodium restriction intervention improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were not in stage D HF, and fluid restriction improved quality of life (QOL) in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with HFrEF and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (NYHA class I to IV); however, in a meta-analysis of RCTs, restricted fluid intake compared with free fluid consumption did not result in reduced hospitalization or mortality rates, changes in thirst, the duration of intravenous diuretic use, serum creatinine, or serum sodium levels, and the validity of a prior trial supporting clinical benefits of fluid restriction is in serious question.

10.2. Fluid management and diuretics — Loop diuretics are commonly used as first-line therapy either with intermittent dosing or as a continuous infusion, and continuous infusions of loop diuretics may be of increased benefit in neonates and children with HF who are critically ill by increasing the likelihood of achieving a negative fluid balance and mitigating rapid fluid shifts, while a low sodium diet and fluid restriction are often considered there are no data (even in adults) to support this practice. Recommendations: An initial and ongoing assessment of fluid status should be performed in all patients admitted to the hospital with acute HF (Class I, Level of Evidence C). Diuretics are the first-line therapy for patients with acute HF with evidence of fluid overload (Class I, Level of Evidence C). Careful monitoring for side effects of anticongestive therapies, including renal function, electrolytes, and hypotension, should be performed in all patients with acute HF (Class I, Level of Evidence C).

### Salt, No salt, or less salt for patients with heart failure? [^114CEJbW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Restricting dietary sodium is a common recommendation given by clinicians to patients with heart failure and is one supported by current guidelines. However, the quality of evidence for this recommendation is suboptimal, and there is no consensus on the optimal level of sodium intake. Though excessive sodium intake is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertension, recent data have suggested that very low sodium intake is paradoxically associated with worse outcomes for patients with heart failure. This is possibly explained by the association between low sodium intake and activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. Nevertheless, sodium restriction is routinely recommended and remains a cornerstone of heart failure and blood pressure therapy. In this review we discuss the pros and cons of sodium restriction for patients with heart failure from the current literature.

### Reduction of dietary sodium to less than 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF): an international, open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^114o9vSe]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Dietary restriction of sodium has been suggested to prevent fluid overload and adverse outcomes for patients with heart failure. We designed the Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure (SODIUM-HF) to test whether or not a reduction in dietary sodium reduces the incidence of future clinical events.

Methods

SODIUM-HF is an international, open-label, randomised, controlled trial that enrolled patients at 26 sites in six countries (Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and New Zealand). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class 2–3), and receiving optimally tolerated guideline-directed medical treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), using a standard number generator and varying block sizes of two, four, or six, stratified by site, to either usual care according to local guidelines or a low sodium diet of less than 100 mmol (ie, < 1500 mg/day). The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular-related admission to hospital, cardiovascular-related emergency department visit, or all-cause death within 12 months in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all randomly assigned patients). Safety was assessed in the ITT population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02012179, and is closed to accrual.

Findings

Between March 24, 2014, and Dec 9, 2020, 806 patients were randomly assigned to a low sodium diet (n = 397) or usual care (n = 409). Median age was 67 years (IQR 58–74) and 268 (33%) were women and 538 (66%) were men. Between baseline and 12 months, the median sodium intake decreased from 2286 mg/day (IQR 1653–3005) to 1658 mg/day (1301–2189) in the low sodium group and from 2119 mg/day (1673–2804) to 2073 mg/day (1541–2900) in the usual care group. By 12 months, events comprising the primary outcome had occurred in 60 (15%) of 397 patients in the low sodium diet group and 70 (17%) of 409 in the usual care group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·89 [95% CI 0·63–1·26]; p = 0·53). All-cause death occurred in 22 (6%) patients in the low sodium diet group and 17 (4%) in the usual care group (HR 1·38 [0·73–2·60]; p = 0·32), cardiovascular-related hospitalisation occurred in 40 (10%) patients in the low sodium diet group and 51 (12%) patients in the usual care group (HR 0·82 [0·54–1·24]; p = 0·36), and cardiovascular-related emergency department visits occurred in 17 (4%) patients in the low sodium diet group and 15 (4%) patients in the usual care group (HR 1·21 [0·60–2·41]; p = 0·60). No safety events related to the study treatment were reported in either group.

Interpretation

In ambulatory patients with heart failure, a dietary intervention to reduce sodium intake did not reduce clinical events.

### A high-sodium diet is associated with acute decompensated heart failure in ambulatory heart failure patients: a prospective follow-up study [^114Eexi9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A low-sodium diet is an accepted treatment of patients with heart failure (HF), although minimal evidence exists on the appropriate amount of sodium intake for this population. Certain HF guidelines have liberalized dietary sodium recommendations, which actually exceed guidelines for healthy adults.

Objectives

We tested the hypothesis that high sodium intake is related to acute decompensated HF (ADHF) in ambulatory HF patients. Secondary outcomes included all-cause hospitalization and mortality.

Design

We prospectively enrolled medically stable, ambulatory patients with systolic HF (n = 123; mean ± SD age: 60 ± 13 y) from 2 outpatient HF clinics from 2003 to 2007. Baseline estimates of dietary sodium and other nutrient intakes were obtained from two 3-d food records.

Results

The median follow-up time was 3.0 y. Mean (± SD) sodium intakes were 1.4 ± 0.3, 2.4 ± 0.3, and 3.8 ± 0.8 g Na/d in the lower, middle, and upper tertiles, respectively. Cumulative ADHF event rates at 3 y were 12 ± 6%, 15 ± 7%, and 46 ± 11% in the low, middle, and upper tertiles, respectively (log-rank P = 0.001). For ADHF, the upper tertile was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.55 (95% CI: 1.61, 4.04; P < 0.001). Time-to-event probabilities were significant for mortality (log-rank P = 0.022) but not for all-cause hospitalization (log-rank P = 0.224). The high-sodium tertile was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.83; P = 0.018) for all-cause hospitalization and 3.54 (95% CI: 1.46, 8.62; P = 0.005) for mortality.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this study provides the first prospective evidence that ambulatory HF patients who consume higher amounts of sodium are at greater risk of an ADHF event. These data provide support for more stringent sodium intake guidelines than those currently recommended for HF patients.

### Low-versus moderate-sodium diet in patients with recent hospitalization for heart failure: the PROHIBIT (prevent adverse outcomes in heart failure by limiting sodium) pilot study [^115ttrnW]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility, on-study retention, trends in natriuretic peptide levels, quality of life, and safety of a 12-week feeding trial with 1500- versus 3000-mg daily sodium meals in high-risk patients with heart failure.

Methods

Of 196 patients with recent (≤ 2 weeks) hospitalization for heart failure, ejection fraction ≤ 40%, on optimal medical therapy, functionally independent, and able to communicate, 83 (47%) consented to participate. Of these, 27 (age, 62 ± 11 years; 22 men; 20 white; ejection fraction, 26 ± 8%) had 24-hour urine sodium ≥ 3000 mg and agreed to randomly receive either 1500-mg (N = 12) or 3000-mg (N = 15) sodium meals.

Results

On-study retention at 12 weeks was 77% (82% versus 73%; P = 0.53); 6 patients (2 in 1500-mg, 4 in 3000-mg arm) withdrew before study completion. Food satisfaction questionnaires indicated that both diets were well tolerated. Quality of life improved in the 1500-mg arm at 12 weeks but did not change in the 3000-mg arm. Average compliance with meals was 52% (based on urinary sodium) and was not significantly different between arms (42% versus 60%; P = 0.25). Study meals reduced 24-hour urinary sodium by 137 ± 21 mmol (1500-mg arm) and 82 ± 16 mmol (3000-mg arm), both P < 0.001; between-arms difference was 55 mmol (95% CI, 3–107; P = 0.037). NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) was not affected. Hospitalizations and low blood pressure events did not differ significantly between arms. Serum creatinine decreased more (by 0.17 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.06–0.28]; P = 0.003) in the 1500-mg arm. Creatinine increases > 0.5 mg/dL over baseline only occurred in 1 patient in the 3000-mg arm.

Conclusions

Even with prepared meals, investigating optimal dietary sodium in heart failure comes with challenges, including need for extensive screening, reluctance to participate, and compliance issues. Because both diets reduced urinary sodium without adverse safety or quality of life signals, a larger trial, with modifications to improve participation and compliance, would be ethical and feasible.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1171FyQQ]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — dietary sodium restriction: Recommendation (COR 2a; LOE C-LD): For patients with stage C heart failure (HF), avoiding excessive sodium intake is reasonable to reduce congestive symptoms. Restricting dietary sodium is a common nonpharmacological treatment for patients with HF symptomatic with congestion, but specific recommendations have been based on low-quality evidence. The AHA currently recommends a reduction of sodium intake to < 2300 mg/d for general cardiovascular health promotion; however, there are no trials to support this level of restriction in patients with HF. Sodium restriction can result in poor dietary quality with inadequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake, and nutritional inadequacies have been associated with clinical instability, while routine supplementation of oral iron, thiamine, zinc, vitamin D, or multivitamins has not proven beneficial. The DASH diet can achieve sodium restriction without compromising nutritional adequacy when accompanied by dietary counseling and may be associated with reduced hospitalizations for HF. Supportive data include that a registered dietitian– or nurse-coached intervention with 2 to 3 g/d sodium restriction improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); in a nonrandomized study (> 2.5 g/d versus < 2.5 g/d), lower dietary sodium was associated with worse all-cause mortality in HFrEF; and in small randomized controlled trials, aggressive sodium restriction (0.8 g/d) during decompensated HF has not reduced weight, congestion, diuretic use, rehospitalization, or all-cause mortality in HFrEF or in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115CG8Mp]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Diuretics and sodium/fluid restriction in chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — Diuretics remain the mainstay of therapy to treat congestion in CRHF, but because patients with RHF can have normal or low LV filling pressures, clinical monitoring is necessary to prevent prerenal azotemia and worsening renal function; patients with CRHF frequently require large diuretic doses, combination therapy including loop diuretics with thiazides may be helpful to augment natriuresis via sequential nephron blockade, and compared with furosemide, torsemide has more consistent absorption during decompensation and may be a preferred loop diuretic in CRHF. According to the AHA/American College of Cardiology HF practice guidelines, sodium restriction is considered reasonable for patients with symptomatic HF to reduce symptoms of congestion, clinicians should consider some degree (ie, < 3 g/d) of sodium restriction in patients with symptomatic CRHF, and fluid restriction (1.5–2 L/d) is considered reasonable in patients with refractory congestion and hyponatremia.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^116s4jCZ]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Diuretics in heart failure — patient selection and dosing advises that diuretics should be prescribed to all patients who have evidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, fluid retention and should generally be combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker, as few patients with HF will be able to maintain dry weight without diuretics; for initiation and maintenance, the most commonly used loop diuretic is furosemide, though some respond to torsemide due to superior absorption and longer duration of action; outpatient therapy is commonly started with low doses and increased until urine output rises and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily, with further dose or frequency escalations (i.e., twice-daily dosing) possibly required; the ultimate goal is elimination of clinical evidence of fluid retention, and diuretics are generally combined with moderate dietary sodium restriction (3 to 4 g daily).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Advanced heart failure (HF) — management of fluid status includes that control of fluid retention may require progressive increments in the loop diuretic dose and frequently the addition of a second diuretic that has a complementary mode of action (e.g., metolazone). If volume overload persists despite these measures, hospitalization is generally required for further adjustment of therapy, possibly including intravenous dopamine or dobutamine, and ultrafiltration or hemodialysis may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention; the use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of loop diuretics. In general, patients should not be discharged from the hospital until a stable and effective diuretic regimen is established, and ideally, not until euvolemia is achieved, after which the patient's dry weight can guide dose adjustments; many patients are able to modify their own diuretic regimen in response to changes in weight that exceed a predefined range. The restriction of dietary sodium (to 2 g a day or less) can greatly assist in the maintenance of volume balance, and patients with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction and high-dose diuretic use may benefit from review of fluid intake and restriction to 2 liters daily; the ongoing control of fluid retention may be enhanced by enrollment in an HF program.

### Influence of sodium intake and change in sodium intake on plasma-renin in man [^111XKVNs]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

A protocol is registered in PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020150355). The review is conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelinesand is based on an updated (March 18th 2020) identification of studies included in a previous meta-analysis (updated March 10th 2016).

2.1 Search strategy and selection criteria

Types of studies: RCTs, double-blind or open, allocating participants to diets with different sodium contents, and in which the sodium intake was estimated by the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion.

Types of participants: Study populations were included irrespective of sex and age and stratified by blood pressure (BP) (normotension/hypertension). Hypertension was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg. Study populations, in which participants were treated with antihypertensive treatments, were excluded, as such treatments have an influence on PRA. Studies systematically investigating participants with comorbidities, for instance diabetes or heart failure, were excluded. Studies, which tested for sodium sensitivity and excluded participants, who were either sodium sensitive or sodium resistant, were excluded.

Types of interventions: The intervention was a change in sodium intake, the study populations randomly being divided into a group eating a "low" sodium diet or a "usual/high" sodium diet. Confounding was not allowed, i.e. studies treating persons with a concomitant intervention were only included if the concomitant intervention was identical during the low and the high-sodium diet and the concomitant intervention did not have an impact on PRA. Studies, which reported renin in units, which cannot be directly translated to the most frequent unit (ng/ml/h) were also excluded.

Types of outcome measures: The outcome was the effect on PRA.

Search methods for identification of studies: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist conducted systematic searches in MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov using the following combinations of search terms: 1) salt or sodium, 2) restriction or dietary, 3) blood pressure or hypertension, 4) randomized or random. Similar searches were made for hormones and lipids changing the third search term (blood pressure or hypertension) with the hormone or lipid term. The search string is shown in the appendix.

Selection of studies: Two review authors (NG and GJ or NG and THG) independently performed study selection. Discrepancies were resolved by agreement.

### Altered dietary salt intake for people with chronic kidney disease [^115A9CQA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence indicates that reducing dietary salt may reduce the incidence of heart disease and delay decline in kidney function in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of altering dietary salt for adults with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 October 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more levels of salt intake in adults with any stage of CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, conducted risk of bias evaluation and evaluated confidence in the evidence using GRADE. Results were summarised using random effects models as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 21 studies (1197 randomised participants), 12 in the earlier stages of CKD (779 randomised participants), seven in dialysis (363 randomised participants) and two in post-transplant (55 randomised participants). Selection bias was low in seven studies, high in one and unclear in 13. Performance and detection biases were low in four studies, high in two, and unclear in 15. Attrition and reporting biases were low in 10 studies, high in three and unclear in eight. Because duration of the included studies was too short (1 to 36 weeks) to test the effect of salt restriction on endpoints such as death, cardiovascular events or CKD progression, changes in salt intake on blood pressure and other secondary risk factors were examined. Reducing salt by mean -73.51 mmol/day (95% CI -92.76 to -54.27), equivalent to 4.2 g or 1690 mg sodium/day, reduced systolic/diastolic blood pressure by -6.91/-3.91 mm Hg (95% CI -8.82 to -4.99/-4.80 to -3.02; 19 studies, 1405 participants; high certainty evidence). Albuminuria was reduced by 36% (95% CI 26 to 44) in six studies, five of which were carried out in people in the earlier stages of CKD (MD -0.44, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.30; 501 participants; high certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lower salt intake on weight, as the weight change observed (-1.32 kg, 95% CI -1.94 to -0.70; 12 studies, 759 participants) may have been due to fluid volume, lean tissue, or body fat. Lower salt intake may reduce extracellular fluid volume in the earlier stages of CKD (-0.87 L, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.58; 3 studies; 187 participants; low certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of lower salt intake on reduction in antihypertensive dose (RR 2.45, 95% CI 0.98 to 6.08; 8 studies; 754 participants). Lower salt intake may lead to symptomatic hypotension (RR 6.70, 95% CI 2.40 to 18.69; 6 studies; 678 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Data were sparse for other types of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found high certainty evidence that salt reduction reduced blood pressure in people with CKD, and albuminuria in people with earlier stage CKD in the short-term. If such reductions could be maintained long-term, this effect may translate to clinically significant reductions in CKD progression and cardiovascular events. Research into the long-term effects of sodium-restricted diet for people with CKD is warranted.

### Reduction of dietary sodium to less than 100 mmol in heart failure (SODIUM-HF): an international, open-label, randomised, controlled trial [^1163FC53]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study SODIUM-HF was published by Justin A Ezekowitz and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the SODIUM-HF study, the trial question was: what is the role of dietary intervention to reduce sodium intake in patients with HF? In the SODIUM-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SODIUM-HF study, the population was: 806 patients (268 female, 538 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with chronic HF receiving optimally tolerated medical treatment. The key exclusion criteria were average dietary intake of sodium < 1,500 mg/day; serum sodium < 130 mmol/L; renal failure; hepatic failure; uncontrolled thyroid disorder; uncontrolled AF; hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes in the previous month. In the SODIUM-HF study, the interventions were: n = 397 reduced sodium intake (sodium intake < 1,500 mg/day) n = 409 usual sodium intake (usual care according to local guidelines). In the SODIUM-HF study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in a composite of admission to hospital for cardiovascular causes, emergency department visit for cardiovascular causes, or death from all causes at 12 months (15% vs. 17%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.26). In the SODIUM-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes (6% vs. 4%; HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.6) No significant difference in hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (10% vs. 12%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.24) No significant difference in cardiovascular-related emergency department visits (4% vs. 4%; HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.41). In the SODIUM-HF study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with chronic HF receiving optimally tolerated medical treatment, reduced sodium intake was not superior to usual sodium intake with respect to a composite of admission to hospital for cardiovascular causes, emergency department visit for cardiovascular causes, or death from all causes at 12 months.

### Sodium restriction in heart failure: how low should you… [^115J4HRw]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

The notion that sodium restriction might be of value for patients with heart failure has been around since at least the 1940s. 1 In recent years, sodium restriction has become a standard component of heart failure treatment. A variety of professional organizations now recommend that patients with heart failure, and indeed all adults, limit their sodium intake because of concerns that high sodium intake leads to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. On follow-up six months later, the group consuming a low-sodium diet had experienced a higher rate of readmission to the hospital and more deaths. One explanation suggested for these differences is that sodium restriction combined with diuretic therapy leads to higher levels of aldosterone and renin secretion, and this may adversely affect cardiac function.

In another study, patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure were randomized to a diet with sodium restriction plus fluid restriction or to a standard hospital diet. Follow-up results showed no advantage to sodium restriction. There was no difference in weight loss between patients on low-sodium vs. standard diets. There was also no difference in clinical improvement scores or 30-day readmission rates. 4 Compared with the control groups, the sodium-restriction groups had nearly double the rate of all-cause mortality and more than double the rate of readmission for heart failure. After the publication of the systematic review, it was discovered that patients in two of the trials were the same patients.

For this reason, the results of the analysis have been called into question, and the article reporting the results has been retracted pending further analysis of the original data. 5 Despite the uncertainty raised by the retraction, it was one of the largest analyses of the issue of sodium restriction in patients with heart failure, and its results had been considered in a 2013 report from the Institute of Medicine on the benefits and risks of sodium restriction. 6 Furthermore, all six trials reported that among patients randomized to a sodium-restricted diet, there was an increased rate of heart failure–related readmissions to the hospital, and the four trials that evaluated mortality rates all showed higher rates among those randomized to a sodium-restricted diet. So, the findings of the meta-analysis should still be taken seriously.

### Nonlethal inhibition of gut microbial trimethylamine N-oxide production improves cardiac function and remodeling in a murine model of heart failure [^112kNyKq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of death, afflicting > 6.5 million people in the United States 1. It is predicted that by 2030 the prevalence of HF will increase ≈50% and will have an economic burden that exceeds ≈$70 billion in the United States alone. 1 With a limited number of effective drugs to treat HF, there is a necessity to focus on nutrition and lifestyle alterations in patients with HF. Currently, there is a limited set of dietary guidelines that have concentrated on limiting sodium and fluid consumption for HF patients. 2 While this has been the primary focus, there is a paucity in outcomes data to support these alterations. The increasing prevalence of HF and mounting economic burden provide an impetus to discover novel therapeutic targets and lifestyle modifications to treat HF and the associated underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)/comorbidities.

### Education by a dietitian in patients with heart failure results in improved adherence with a sodium-restricted diet: a randomized trial [^1148hW8L]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) programs reduce hospital readmission and improve clinical outcomes. Although dietitians are often members of such teams, no randomized studies have demonstrated the independent benefit of dietitian-administered dietary counseling for patients with HF. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietitian education on adherence to a sodium-restricted diet in ambulatory patients with stable HF.

Methods

Patients with HF (left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%) were randomized into a dietitian education group (n = 23) or a usual care group (n = 24), then observed for 3 months. Both groups received a 2 g/d dietary sodium prescription. The usual care group received nutrition advice by way of self-help literature, whereas the dietitian education group returned for 2 counseling sessions with a dietitian.

Results

Dietitian education resulted in a significant decrease in sodium intake at 3 months (2.80 ± 0.30 to 2.14 ± 0.23 g/d, P < .05). In contrast, there was no change in sodium intake in the usual care group (3.00 ± 0.31 to 2.74 ± 0.35 g/d, P = ns).

Conclusions

Dietitian-administered counseling was more effective than providing literature in reducing dietary sodium intake in patients with stable HF.

### Relation of lack of knowledge about dietary sodium to hospital readmission in patients with heart failure [^116B5kTk]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

It has previously been demonstrated that patients with heart failure (HF) in an urban public hospital had significant gaps in knowledge regarding dietary sodium restriction. The objective of this study was to determine what risk factors were associated with such gaps in knowledge and to determine if these gaps in knowledge would increase the risk for HF readmission. A standardized test of sodium knowledge (scored 0 to 10) was administered prospectively to 97 hospitalized patients with HF < 48 hours before discharge. The incidence of 90-day hospital readmission for HF was compared between subjects with low dietary sodium knowledge (score 0 to 3) and the remainder of the cohort (score 4 to 10) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Another 48 patients with HF were prospectively recruited, and the dietary sodium knowledge test and a survey of psychosocial and other parameters, including the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, a validated measure of health literacy, were administered. The 90-day readmission rate for HF was 3 times higher in those with low sodium knowledge than in the remainder of the cohort (28% vs 9%, p = 0.02). This association persisted in multivariate models adjusting for potential confounders. Low health literacy, but not other psychosocial parameters, was associated with low dietary sodium knowledge. In conclusion, low dietary sodium knowledge was an independent risk factor for 90-day HF hospital readmission in the urban setting. Deficiency in dietary sodium knowledge is one pathway through which low health literacy leads to adverse outcomes in patients with HF.

### Dietary counseling to reduce moderate sodium intake. concerns about the methods, evidence and feasibility of lowering sodium intake [^113hGS6c]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Smyth et al. do not provide adequate context when stating that "observational studies report conflicting findings on the association of low sodium intake with CVD and mortality, with some studies reporting a higher risk at low intake (< 3 g/day) compared to moderate intake", and that a recent large RCT in patients with heart failure did not report a lower risk of mortality of CVD with low sodium intake. Smyth et al. also state long term dietary advice studies are ineffective at reducing sodium below 3000 mg/day which contrasts with major trials of dietary advice that lowered sodium intake to less than 3000 mg/day.

A meta-analysis of RCTs based on dietary advice had an average reduction in sodium intake from 3646 to 2690 mg/day with a 26% reduction in CVD and a linear association of CVD with sodium intake down to 2300 mg/day. Thus, dietary advice is feasible to lower dietary sodium below 3000 mg/day and reduces CVD. Furthermore, an analysis of cohort studies that used the recommended multiple 24 h urine collections found a linear association of sodium intake from 1846 to 5230 mg/day with CVD. The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and 75 national and international nongovernmental organizations have stated that low quality research, such as the cohort studies Smyth et al. cited as showing higher CVD with lower sodium intake, are a driver of the controversy regarding the health benefits of reducing dietary sodium and that nongovernmental organizations have also expressed concern that misinformation about dietary sodium is also a driver of controversy. The change in dietary sodium in the large RCT in heart failure, based on dietary advice, that Smyth et al. cited, reduced dietary sodium from 2286 to 1658 mg/day, far lower than Smyth et al. claim is not feasible and the reduction was associated with an improvement in quality of life and NYHA functional class of heart failure (although mortality was not significantly changed).

The study by Smyth et al. shows that in the current food environment, it is difficult for individuals to sustain lower sodium intake long-term. Thus, upstream interventions, (e.g. mandatory sodium targets for processed foods), are urgently needed and strongly recommended to improve the food system to reduce sodium intake.

### Three Gram sodium intake is associated with longer event-free survival only in patients with advanced heart failure [^113LVPcj]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence to support the recommendation that patients with heart failure (HF) restrict sodium intake. The purpose of this study was to compare differences in cardiac event-free survival between patients with sodium intake above and below 3 g.

Methods

A total of 302 patients with HF (67% male, 62 ± 12 years, 54% New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III/IV, ejection fraction 34 ± 14%) collected a 24-hour urine sodium (UNa) to indicate sodium intake. Patients were divided into 2 groups using a 3-g UNa cutpoint and stratified by NYHA Class (I/II vs. III/IV). Event-free survival for 12 months was determined by patient or family interviews and medical record review. Differences in cardiac event-free survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier survival curve with log-rank test and Cox hazard regression.

Results

The Cox regression hazard ratio for 24-hour UNa ≥ 3 g in NYHA Class I/II was 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20–0.97) and 2.54 (95% CI = 1.10–5.84) for NYHA III/IV after controlling for age, gender, HF etiology, body mass index, ejection fraction, and total comorbidity score.

Conclusions

These data suggest that 3 g dietary sodium restriction may be most appropriate for patients in NYHA functional Classes III and IV.

### Response to letter by Campbell et al. regarding the results of the COSTICK trial [^112CVvrM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We thank Cambpell et al. for taking the time to read our trial reportand pleased to respond to their comments and queries.

Cambpell et al. cite the SODIUM-HF trial as evidence to support the feasibility of reducing sodium intake below 2.0 g/day (salt intake of below 5 g/day). However, the SODIUM-HF trial measured sodium intake using 3-day food records, which may underestimate sodium intake (compared to 24-h urine assessments). In the COSTICK trial, participants reported a change in their discretionary use of salt, which did not translate into reductions in 24-h urinary excretion, possibly related to compensatory changes in non-discretionary salt intake. Moreover, dietary intake in patients with heart failure is not expected to be representative of the general population. Patients with heart failure are often heavily counselled to reduce dietary sodium intake as part of routine clinical care, and, those with more advanced disease are likely to have a lower caloric intake and, by extension, lower sodium intake. In contrast, our trials included a population with less morbidity and a more heterogenous population of free-living adults, with high quality diets (as evidenced by high diet quality scores and high potassium excretion).

### Clinical importance of urinary sodium excretion in acute heart failure [^115m9E7M]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, a position paper on diuretic therapy has proposed to use a biologically plausible response variable early after diuretic initiation, which could be either urinary sodium concentration and/or urinary volume. 8 There are, however, only limited data on urinary sodium excretion in (acute) heart failure to provide scientific back up for the proposed algorithm. Singh et al. 14 showed in 52 patients with AHF that urinary sodium was associated with diuretic response, and together with urinary furosemide concentrations was also associated with clinical outcome. In a larger study, lower urinary sodium concentration at admission was associated with more evidence of neurohormonal activation, poorer diuretic response, and also worse clinical outcome. 15 In another study including over 170 advanced heart failure patients admitted to an ambulatory heart failure clinic, urinary sodium was associated with 3 h diuresis, and with subsequent heart failure events. 16 In a recent paper, the importance of lower urinary sodium excretion in the week before a heart failure readmission has been shown, highlighting the pathophysiological importance of urinary sodium excretion. 17 In data from ROSE‐AHF, urinary sodium excretion after 24 h was associated with mortality, even in the setting of a negative fluid balance. 18 Finally, Biegus et al. 19 recently reported on spot urinary sodium concentration in little over 100, mostly male, AHF patients. In this prospective cohort, they found a small increase in spot urinary sodium concentration after admission (and start of intravenous diuretic), followed by a decrease. They also showed that lower urinary sodium concentration was associated with increased 1‐year mortality rates, independent of covariates, and that a decrease in urinary sodium concentration was also associated with all‐cause mortality. However, none of these studies investigated absolute sodium excretion as early as 6 h after start of diuretic therapy.

Heart failure dietary sodium restriction — pilot randomized controlled trials: A recent pilot RCT (N = 27) showed that providing patients with 1.5 g/d sodium meals can reduce urinary sodium and improve QOL but not improve clinical outcomes. Another recent pilot RCT (N = 38) of 1.5 versus 2.3 g/d sodium resulted in improvement in BNP levels and QOL in the 1.5 g/d sodium intake arm; the full trial is due to be completed in 2022. A third pilot RCT (N = 66) of home-delivered 1.5 g/d meals showed favorable but nonsignificant trends toward improvement in clinical status and readmission rates, and results from RCTs have shown that reducing dietary sodium is difficult to achieve in patients with HF, even with prepared meals or home visits.

### Heart failure events in randomized controlled trials for adults receiving maintenance dialysis: a meta-epidemiologic study [^11412cKp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Volume overload due to dietary salt and water excess or inadequate fluid removal with dialysis rather than primary cardiac dysfunction can appear identical to heart failure in dialysis and have similar associations with morbidity and mortality. However, imagine an intervention that acts purely by improving cardiac structure and function. While this would reduce the risk of episodes of heart failure, it may have no effect on episodes of pure volume overload due to dietary non-adherence or inadequate fluid removal with dialysis. In a population where 50% of the events that look like heart failure are due to actual heart failure and 50% are due to volume overload, the effect of the treatment, which is only on actual heart failure, would be cut in half if the two types of event cannot be reliably distinguished. For an intervention that works purely on volume overload and not on heart failure, the same issue but in reverse applies. The situation is even more difficult because the pathophysiology of heart failure and volume overload are complex and invariably intertwined and interventions could act, to varying degrees, on both clinical syndromes. The issue of differentiating heart failure events from volume overload is not new to nephrology and RCTs have had to consider this issue for many years. To help consider the current state of heart failure events, and their diagnostic criteria and shape future definitions in dialysis, we systematically reviewed heart failure events, and how they are defined in RCTs of patients receiving maintenance dialysis.

### Sodium intake and incident atrial fibrillation in individuals with vascular disease [^111kBm3M]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Low sodium intake, at levels consumed by less than 3% of the population in our study, was associated with increased AF risk when early AF events were included. Low sodium intakes could lead to AF through orthostatic hypotension, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as increased adrenaline excretion. Besides observational studies that have reported J- or U-shaped associations between sodium intake and cardiovascular outcomes, there are also data from interventional studies, including a recent meta-analysis showing an increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with heart failure on sodium-restricted diets in clinical trialsand data showing an inverse correlation between country-level sodium intake and life expectancy. Despite this, current guidelines recommend lowering sodium intake to a goal of between less than 1.50 g/d to less than 2.40 g/d. Our study found no evidence to support low sodium intakes (< 3.00 g/d) compared with moderate levels (ie, at the population mean of 3.00–5.00 g/d), and there may be a higher risk of AF with low compared with moderate sodium intakes.

### The current state of evidence for sodium and fluid restriction in heart failure [^111JUVNC]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The field of heart failure has evolved in terms of the therapies that are available including pharmaceutical and device therapies. There is now substantial randomized trial data to indicate that dietary sodium restriction does not provide the reduction in clinical events with accepted heterogeneity in the clinical trial results. Dietary sodium restriction should be considered for some but not all patients and with different objectives than clinical outcomes but instead for potential quality of life benefit. In addition, fluid restriction, once the mainstay of clinical practice, has not shown to be of any additional benefit for patients in hospital or in the ambulatory care setting and therefore should be considered to be used cautiously (if at all) in clinical practice. Further developments and clinical trials are needed in this area to better identify patients who may benefit or have harm from these lower cost interventions and future research should focus on large scale, high quality, clinical trials rather than observational data to drive clinical practice.

### Autonomic nervous system: a therapeutic target for cardiac end-organ damage in hypertension [^115zRkcg]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Dietary Sodium Restriction

A meta-analysis of 85 studies reports an approximately linear relation between dietary sodium intake and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in normotensive individuals and in patients with hypertension. The current guidelines on hypertension recommend a dietary intake of sodium restricted to < 100 mmol (≈5.8 g sodium chloride) per day. A high dietary sodium intake is considered to enhance sympathetic activity, likely mediated by the brainstem. Direct infusion of sodium into cerebrospinal fluid elevated blood pressure and increased sympathetic activity in the adrenal glands of rodents. Accordingly, a high sodium intake is associated with high levels of plasma norepinephrine in patients with salt-sensitive hypertension. It is unknown whether ANS modulation by dietary sodium restriction influences HF and AF. However, sodium restriction is recommended in patients with HF to reduce congestive symptoms, likely by attenuating fluid retention.

### Effect of a sodium-restricted diet on intake of other nutrients in heart failure: implications for research and clinical practice [^112xHwxU]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium restriction is the primary dietary therapy for heart failure (HF) patients. Currently, it is unknown if changing diets to reduce dietary sodium in HF causes secondary changes to the intake of other nutrients in this patient population already at nutritional risk.

Methods and Results

HF patients (n = 16; 52 ± 12 years old; 78% male) followed a sodium-restricted diet for 1 week. Nutritional changes were documented at baseline and after a < 2,000 mg/d sodium-restricted diet, as measured by food records before baseline and each day during the study. After a 49% reduction in dietary sodium (3,626 ± 956 to 1,785 ± 696 mg/d), we observed a significant reduction in calorie (2,467 ± 748 to 1,931 ± 388 kcal/d; P < .016), carbohydrate (293 ± 108 to 232 ± 56 g/d; p = 0.013), calcium (995 ± 496 to 609 ± 208 mg/d; P < .004), thiamine (2.0 ± 0.8 to 1.5 ± 0.8 mg/d; p = 0.020), and folate (412 ± 192 to 331 ± 172 μg/d; p = 0.019) intakes. There was a decrease in saturated fat (32 ± 18 to 21 ± 6 g/d; p = 0.032) and a trend to lower total fat (89 ± 34 to 68 ± 19 g/d; p = 0.066) and higher potassium (1,262 ± 328 to 1,405 ± 268 mg/1,000 kcal; p = 0.055) intakes.

Conclusions

We found multiple unintentional nutritional consequences with dietary sodium reduction in HF patients. These findings highlight the need to consider the whole diet when counseling HF patients to lower sodium intake.

### Dietary interventions in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: a scoping review [^113X5mdV]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Dietary patterns

Sodium restriction and the DASH diet

Dietary sodium restriction is one of the most common self-care recommendations for patients with HF. Increased sodium intake frequently occurs before HF decompensation, and HF hospitalizations increase in parallel with reported sodium consumption. However, concerns exist about neurohormonal activation and decreased renal perfusion if dietary sodium restriction is too strict. Current guidelines only state that avoiding excessive sodium intake is "reasonable" for symptomatic patients with HF, reflecting a lack of strong evidence for this practice.

To date, the only trial conducted solely in patients with HFpEF randomized 53 inpatients to aggressive sodium (800 mg/d) and fluid (800 ml/day) restriction, with no difference in weight loss or congestion score over 7 days, with an increase in thirst and reduction in calorie intake in the intervention group. The SODIUM-HF (Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure) trial randomized 806 patients with chronic HF (277 with left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 40%) to dietitian-guided sodium restriction (goal 1,500 mg/day) vs usual dietary guidance. Overall, there was no difference in cardiovascular hospitalization or mortality over 12 months of follow-up, and no significant interaction by EF. Patients in the intervention group had modest improvement in disease-related quality of life (+3.38 points adjusted difference in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, P = 0.011) and were more likely to improve NYHA functional class, but these data have not been reported in the LVEF > 40% subgroup. A recent meta-analysis of 17 dietary intervention trials that followed the publication of SODIUM-HF found no reduction in hospitalization or mortality with sodium restriction in patients with HF.

### Salt and nutritional content of foods advertised during televised professional football games [^115F5Phf]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Modest restriction of dietary sodium intake for individuals with heart failure (HF), including those with concomitant kidney failure and advanced disease, may improve symptoms and quality of life. A registered dietitian- or nurse-coached intervention with 2 to 3 g/d sodium restriction improved New York Heart Association functional class and leg edema in individuals with HF with reduced ejection fraction. However, excess dietary intake is frequent with ingestion of processed and prepared foods, including those from high-volume restaurants or other food establishments. Additionally, excess fat and caloric intake may influence the natural history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and other conditions. Since advertising by the food and restaurant industry influences consumer behavior and meal option selections, we analyzed advertisements transmitted during televised professional football games in the US to assess the nutritional content by serving.

### Dietary sodium restriction for heart failure: a systematic review of intervention outcomes and behavioral determinants [^112XbN7R]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The 1500 mg/d dietary sodium restriction commonly recommended for patients with heart failure has recently been questioned. Poor adherence to sodium-restricted diets makes assessing the efficacy of sodium restriction challenging. Therefore, successful behavioral interventions are needed. We reviewed sodium restriction trials and descriptive studies of sodium restriction to: 1) determine if sodium restriction was achieved in interventions among heart failure patients; and 2) characterize predictors of successful dietary sodium restriction. Among 638 identified studies, 10 intervention trials, and 25 descriptive studies met inclusion criteria. We used content analysis to extract information about sodium restriction and behavioral determinants of sodium restriction. Dietary sodium was reduced in 7 trials; none achieved 1500 mg/d (range 1938–4564 mg/d). The interventions implemented in the interventional trials emphasized knowledge, skills, and self-regulation strategies, but few addressed the determinants correlated with successful sodium restriction in the descriptive studies (eg, social/cultural norms, social support, taste preferences, food access, self-efficacy). Findings suggest that incorporating determinants predictive of successful dietary sodium restriction may improve the success of interventional trials. Without effective interventions to deploy in trials, the safety and efficacy of sodium restriction remains unknown.

### Dietary interventions in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: a scoping review [^114rZbf9]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern encourages intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and promotes intake of nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy, and lean protein. Hummel et al studied the effects of a sodium-restricted DASH diet (1,500 mg sodium/2,100 kcal) in 13 well-compensated patients with HFpEF and treated hypertension. After 21 days, the study diet substantially lowered clinic and ambulatory blood pressure and indices of left ventricular diastolic function, large-arterial stiffness, ventricular-arterial coupling, and 6MWT distance improved. The GOURMET-HF (Geriatric OUt-of-hospital Randomized MEal Trial in Heart Failure) study randomized 66 older patients to receive low-sodium, DASH-compliant home-delivered meals for 4 weeks posthospital discharge. In participants with HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%), the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary score (physical limitations and symptoms domains) improved between baseline and 4 weeks in the patients receiving meals (41 ± 24 points to 57 ± 17 points, P = 0.01), but not in the usual care group (43 ± 20 points to 49 ± 24 points, P = 0.28). Larger trials of the DASH sodium-restricted diet are needed to investigate the impact of this dietary pattern on hospitalization and mortality.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: rationale and design of the pragmatic urinary sodium-based treatment algoritHm in acute heart failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^111dwxam]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the world, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and as such responsible for a large proportion of health care expenses. Treatment of congestion in acute HF remains the Achilles' heel of contemporary HF management and is mostly limited to the administration of loop diuretics. A large number of acute HF patients display an insufficient diuretic response, which is associated with residual congestion and an increased risk of mortality and HF rehospitalization. It is therefore important to identify patients with a poor diuretic response early after hospital admission. Given the mode of action of loop diuretics, natriuresis might be a sensitive, objective, quantifiable, and reliable marker to assess response. Recently, a small number of studies have shown that insufficient natriuretic response in acute HF patients was associated with an increased risk of poor outcome. Furthermore, even early assessment of natriuresis (1–2 h after initiation of loop diuretics) in acute HF patients has been shown to be an accurate marker of insufficient diuretic response during hospitalization. Based on these observational findings, it has been hypothesized that interventions aimed at improving decongestion using a stepwise intensified diuretic treatment approach based on natriuresis, has the potential to significantly improve effectiveness of decongestion, speed up in‐hospital treatment, and prevent readmissions for HF. The Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has already incorporated early measurement of urinary sodium as a marker of diuretic response and as guidance of diuretic treatment in acute HF patients in a recent position paper, and this has furthermore recently been endorsed and included in the 2021 ESC HF guidelines. However, to date, no prospective randomized natriuresis‐guided studies have been performed in patients with acute HF. The Pragmatic Urinary Sodium‐based treatment algoritHm in Acute Heart Failure (PUSH‐AHF) study has been designed to evaluate the hypothesis that natriuresis‐guided therapy in patients with acute HF improves natriuresis and clinical outcomes compared with standard of care.

### Impact of dietary sodium restriction on heart failure outcomes [^113A5dAX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the impact of sodium restriction on heart failure (HF) outcomes.

Background

Although sodium restriction is advised for patients with HF, data on sodium restriction and HF outcomes are inconsistent.

Methods

We analyzed data from the multihospital HF Adherence and Retention Trial, which enrolled 902 New York Heart Association functional class II/III HF patients and followed them up for a median of 36 months. Sodium intake was serially assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Based on the mean daily sodium intake prior to the first event of death or HF hospitalization, patients were classified into sodium restricted (< 2,500 mg/d) and unrestricted (≥ 2,500 mg/d) groups. Study groups were propensity score matched according to plausible baseline confounders. The primary outcome was a composite of death or HF hospitalization. The secondary outcomes were cardiac death and HF hospitalization.

Results

Sodium intake data were available for 833 subjects (145 sodium restricted, 688 sodium unrestricted), of whom 260 were propensity matched into sodium restricted (n = 130) and sodium unrestricted (n = 130) groups. Sodium restriction was associated with significantly higher risk of death or HF hospitalization (42.3% vs. 26.2%; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 2.84; p = 0.004), derived from an increase in the rate of HF hospitalization (32.3% vs. 20.0%; HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.96; p = 0.015) and a nonsignificant increase in the rate of cardiac death (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 0.70 to 3.73; p = 0.257) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.074). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that sodium restriction was associated with increased risk of death or HF hospitalization in patients not receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (HR: 5.78; 95% CI: 1.93 to 17.27; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

In symptomatic patients with chronic HF, sodium restriction may have a detrimental impact on outcome. A randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively address the role of sodium restriction in HF management. (A Self-management Intervention for Mild to Moderate Heart Failure [HART]; NCT00018005).

### Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (cochrane review) [^114ST2Ba]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of salt reduction report a reduction in the level of blood pressure (BP), the effect of reduced dietary salt on cardiovascular disease (CVD) events remains unclear.

Methods

We searched for RCTs with follow-up of at least 6 months that compared dietary salt reduction (restricted salt dietary intervention or advice to reduce salt intake) to control/no intervention in adults, and reported mortality or CVD morbidity data. Outcomes were pooled at end of trial or longest follow-up point.

Results

Seven studies were identified: three in normotensives, two in hypertensives, one in a mixed population of normo- and hypertensives and one in heart failure. Salt reduction was associated with reductions in urinary salt excretion of between 27 and 39 mmol/24 h and reductions in systolic BP between 1 and 4 mm Hg. Relative risks (RRs) for all-cause mortality in normotensives (longest follow-up-RR: 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58–1.40, 79 deaths) and hypertensives (longest follow-up RR 0.96, 0.83–1.11, 565 deaths) showed no strong evidence of any effect of salt reduction CVD morbidity in people with normal BP (longest follow-up: RR 0.71, 0.42–1.20, 200 events) and raised BP at baseline (end of trial: RR 0.84, 0.57–1.23, 93 events) also showed no strong evidence of benefit. Salt restriction increased the risk of all-cause mortality in those with heart failure (end of trial RR 2.59, 1.04–6.44, 21 deaths). We found no information on participant's health-related quality of life.

Conclusions

Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of RCTs (665 deaths in some 6,250 participants) there is still insufficient power to exclude clinically important effects of reduced dietary salt on mortality or CVD morbidity. Our estimates of benefits from dietary salt restriction are consistent with the predicted small effects on clinical events attributable to the small BP reduction achieved.

Other measures for prevention — There is no direct evidence that control of dietary sodium or participation in regular exercise can prevent the development of HF; however, in patients with hypertension or other vascular disease, these efforts may have other health benefits and may enhance a general sense of well-being. There is also no evidence that routine use of nutritional supplements can prevent dysfunction or injury to the heart.

### A review of the DASH diet as an optimal dietary plan for symptomatic heart failure [^117BC2ab]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Despite tremendous focus, effort, drug and device development and resources dedicated to the care of patients at risk for and with heart failure (HF), the epidemic continues. The HF patient presents with a widely deranged physiology and typically at the same time is malnourished adding to the disease complexity and therapeutic challenges. Most nutritional approaches for patients with HF focus on dietary restrictions (of salt and water) and lack uniformity or clarity or focus on meeting nutritional needs, barriers and deficits of the patient with HF. Finally, it seems reasonable to anticipate that any dietary program recommendation should contribute in a positive way toward HF management goals and at its foundation positively contribute to the deranged physiology. In many ways the "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension" (DASH) dietary program fulfills these needs and early evidence supports the notion that the DASH diet may be optimal for patients with HF. This brief review examines some of this evidence and provides recommendations for the HF community.

### The role of diet and nutrition in heart failure: a state-of-the-art narrative review [^111QCmbB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure (HF) incidence is increasing steadily worldwide, while prognosis remains poor. Though nutrition is a lifestyle factor implicated in prevention of HF, little is known about the effects of macro- and micronutrients as well as dietary patterns on the progression and treatment of HF. This is reflected in a lack of nutrition recommendations in all major HF scientific guidelines. In this state-of-the-art review, we examine and discuss the implications of evidence contained in existing randomized control trials as well as observational studies covering the topics of sodium restriction, dietary patterns and caloric restriction as well as supplementation of dietary fats and fatty acids, protein and amino acids and micronutrients in the setting of pre-existing HF. Finally, we explore future directions and discuss knowledge gaps regarding nutrition therapies for the treatment of HF.

### The role of dietary salt in metabolism and energy balance: insights beyond cardiovascular disease [^111uYc95]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dietary salt (NaCl) provides the body with sodium, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and a variety of physiological functions. Sodium plays a pivotal role in maintaining extracellular fluid volume and osmolality, as well as in transmembrane transport, particularly by mediating membrane and action potentials via sodium/potassium exchange. It is well established that the quantity of salt required to maintain normal physiological homeostasis in adult humans is < 1.25 g/d. However, in modern diets, daily salt intake far exceeds this amount. For example, epidemiological studies demonstrate that the average daily sodium consumption of most people in the United States is > 3.2 g (equivalent to > 8 g salt, sodium × 2.5 = salt). The general average intake of salt reached 10.06 g/d, and in some populations it has reached approximately 15 to 25 g/d. Ample evidence has shown that long‐term over‐consumption of salt is harmful to health, contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly hypertension. As such, health organizations around the world have established dietary guidelines for daily salt intake. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020‐2025 recommend that daily sodium intake in healthy adults should not exceed 2.3 g (5.75 g salt). The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to lower daily dietary salt intake to < 5 g/d. In addition to avoiding excess consumption, low‐salt diets have been encouraged for patients with CVD, particularly heart failure (HF). However, given that sodium ions are an essential noncaloric nutrient, there has been some controversy in the field concerning how large the reduction in salt intake should be. In light of the potential shortcomings of sodium restriction, salt replacement therapy has been proposed as an alternative treatment strategy; this has been tested in the population, with encouraging results.

### Dietary sodium intake and outcomes: a secondary analysis from sodium-HF [^1126mKjJ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This post hoc analysis of SODIUM-HF (Study of Dietary Intervention under 100 mmol in Heart Failure) assessed the association between baseline dietary sodium intake and change at 6 months with a composite of cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations, emergency department visits and all-cause death at 12 and 24 months.

Background

Dietary sodium restriction is common advice for patients with heart failure (HF). Randomized clinical trials have not shown a beneficial effect of dietary sodium restriction on clinical outcomes.

Methods

A multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to assess the association of dietary sodium intake measured at randomization with primary and secondary endpoints.

Results

The study included 792 participants. Baseline sodium intake was ≤ 1500 mg/day in 19.9% (n = 158), 1501–3000 mg/day in 56.5% (n = 448) and > 3000 mg/day in 23.4% (n = 186) of participants. The factors associated with higher baseline sodium intake were higher calorie consumption, higher body mass index and recruitment from Canada. Multivariable analyses showed no association between baseline sodium intake nor magnitude of 6-month change or 12- or 24-month outcomes. In a responder analysis, participants achieving a sodium intake < 1500 mg at 6 months showed an association with a decreased risk for the composite outcome (adjusted HR 0.52 [95% CI 0.25, 1.07] P = 0.08) and CV hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.24, 1.09] P = 0.08) at 12 months.

Conclusion

There was no association between dietary sodium intake and clinical outcomes over 24 months in patients with HF. Responder analyses suggest the need for further investigation of the effects of sodium reduction in those who achieve the targeted dietary sodium-reduction level.

### Nutrition, obesity, and cachexia in patients with heart failure: a consensus statement from the Heart Failure Society of America scientific statements committee [^117D1XFZ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Dietary guidance for patients with heart failure (HF) has traditionally focused on sodium and fluid intake restriction, but dietary quality is frequently poor in patients with HF and may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Restrictive diets can lead to inadequate intake of macronutrients and micronutrients by patients with HF, with the potential for deficiencies of calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, thiamine, vitamins D, E, and K, and folate. Although inadequate intake and low plasma levels of micronutrients have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes, evidence supporting therapeutic repletion is limited. Intravenous iron, thiamine, and coenzyme Q10 have the most clinical trial data for supplementation. There is also limited evidence supporting protein intake goals. Obesity is a risk factor for incident HF, and weight loss is an established approach for preventing HF, with a role for bariatric surgery in patients with severe obesity. However weight loss for patients with existing HF and obesity is a more controversial topic owing to an obesity survival paradox. Dietary interventions and pharmacologic weight loss therapies are understudied in HF populations. There are also limited data for optimal strategies to identify and address cachexia and sarcopenia in patients with HF, with at least 10%-20% of patients with ambulatory systolic HF developing clinically significant wasting. Gaps in our knowledge about nutrition status in patients with HF are outlined in this Statement, and strategies to address the most clinically relevant questions are proposed.
