## Question

WHATS AN ALTERNATIVE IF XIFAXAN IS NOT COVERED

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a set of alternatives when Xifaxan (rifaximin) is not covered, organized by indication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which labeled indications are actually relevant here (hepatic encephalopathy, IBS‑D, and travelers' diarrhea). Then, I should verify the role rifaximin plays within each condition and what first‑line or substitute therapies are supported by the supplied literature. Next, I will examine practical issues such as effectiveness, tolerability, cost and access barriers. Finally, I will synthesize indication‑specific fallback strategies that clinicians can implement when coverage is denied.

> Let me first confirm the scope and why "not covered" matters clinically; rifaximin is labeled for hepatic encephalopathy, travelers' diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea in specific adult populations, so the alternative truly depends on the indication being treated, and insurers often require step‑therapy or prior authorization that shapes sequencing of options, which I need to keep in mind as I choose substitutes supported by the provided sources [^112TykzU].

> For hepatic encephalopathy, I should confirm rifaximin's role; wait, let me verify the guideline position and trial context before I jump ahead, because rifaximin is not first‑line monotherapy but rather an adjunct to lactulose for preventing recurrence after prior overt episodes, with evidence supporting add‑on therapy rather than replacement of lactulose as standard of care [^113wkRFv] [^114qs6Kt] [^114PP9FU].

> Given that, the clear alternative when rifaximin is not available is to optimize lactulose as the foundational therapy for acute management and secondary prophylaxis, paying attention to adherence and dose‑related tolerability since lactulose remains the guideline‑endorsed first choice and has patient‑reported outcome benefits in covert HE, even as rifaximin add‑on can further reduce recurrence risk when accessible [^113wkRFv] [^113JRiwC] [^112bUHhA].

> I need to ensure practicality here: hold on, I should verify tolerability and cost issues because they drive adherence and outcomes; lactulose commonly causes bloating, diarrhea, and distaste that need mitigation, whereas high rifaximin cost and access barriers are well‑documented, so when rifaximin is denied, doubling down on lactulose education, dose titration, and follow‑up is the evidence‑based path while pursuing appeals as appropriate [^111jwtPz] [^1141eMCB].

> But wait, what if someone asks for an antibiotic substitute for rifaximin in HE; I should double‑check if the supplied literature supports that, and it does not endorse an alternative antibiotic, and a meta‑analysis suggests rifaximin is not superior to nonabsorbable disaccharides overall, reinforcing that lactulose remains the appropriate fallback when rifaximin is unavailable [^112vznBX] [^114qs6Kt].

> Shifting to IBS‑D, let me verify rifaximin's place and dose; guidelines list rifaximin as a second‑line option for IBS‑D with evidence of symptom benefit and the labeled regimen of 550 mg three times daily for 14 days, with meta‑analyses showing modest but real improvements vs placebo, which sets the context for what we lose when coverage is denied [^111eo9ny] [^116qeS12] [^113wense] [^115xZPr7].

> Now, are there explicit pharmacologic alternatives to rifaximin for IBS‑D in the supplied references; I need to check carefully, because at first I thought "loperamide is widely" — wait, let me verify, that loperamide evidence here actually comes from travelers' diarrhea studies and not IBS‑D trials, so extrapolation requires caution; the provided IBS‑D guideline excerpts emphasize rifaximin but do not enumerate specific substitutes in this packet, so in a coverage denial scenario the safest reference‑anchored statement is to consider symptomatic antimotility support while acknowledging the population difference and to revisit antibiotic therapy only if rifaximin access can be restored or justified via appeal based on guideline support and QOL benefits seen with rifaximin retreatment in responders [^1112EXvo] [^111eo9ny] [^112fcfNa] [^112uXNsu].

> For travelers' diarrhea, I will now examine direct alternatives; rifaximin was as effective as ciprofloxacin for noninvasive disease but less effective for invasive pathogens, and loperamide provides rapid symptomatic relief with faster improvement when combined with an antibiotic compared with loperamide alone, so when rifaximin is not covered, short‑course ciprofloxacin is a reasonable evidence‑based substitute especially when invasive features are suspected, with loperamide as adjunct for symptom control [^115cishQ] [^1112EXvo].

> I should confirm any safety nuances that might influence substitution decisions; rifaximin is minimally absorbed with a favorable AE profile but increasing resistance has been noted where use is widespread, and labeling includes common adverse effects and standard antibiotic cautions, which underscores why reserving rifaximin for evidence‑based indications is prudent and why non‑rifamycin substitutes like ciprofloxacin in travelers' diarrhea are reasonable when rifaximin is inaccessible [^114FM94u] [^116ZSms5] [^1174FUtS].

> Pulling this together, the stepwise fallback is: for hepatic encephalopathy, rely on lactulose as first‑line and optimize adherence and dosing if rifaximin is not covered; for IBS‑D, note that this packet does not specify alternative agents beyond rifaximin and consider symptomatic management while pursuing coverage appeals grounded in AGA and BSG guidance; for travelers' diarrhea, substitute ciprofloxacin and add loperamide for rapid relief when appropriate, recognizing rifaximin's limitations against invasive pathogens and the demonstrated benefits of antimotility‑antibiotic combination therapy [^114qs6Kt] [^111eo9ny] [^116qeS12] [^115cishQ] [^1112EXvo].

---

If Xifaxan (rifaximin) is not covered, **preferred alternatives** are **lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy** and **loperamide or eluxadoline for IBS-D**. For travelers' diarrhea, use **ciprofloxacin or azithromycin** if invasive pathogens are suspected; use loperamide for symptom control. Lactulose is **first-line for HE** and can be combined with neomycin or metronidazole if needed; **loperamide is first-line for IBS-D**, with eluxadoline or bile acid sequestrants if symptoms persist. These recommendations are supported by guidelines and clinical evidence.

---

## Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)

### First-line alternative: lactulose

- **Mechanism of action**: Non-absorbable disaccharide that reduces ammonia absorption by acidifying colonic contents and promoting ammonia excretion [^113wkRFv].

- **Clinical evidence**: Lactulose is recommended as first-line therapy for acute treatment and prevention of HE recurrence.

- **Efficacy**: Lactulose significantly reduces HE recurrence and improves quality of life.

- **Safety**: Common adverse effects include diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal discomfort; dose adjustments can mitigate these effects [^111jwtPz].

---

### Second-line alternatives

Second-line options include **Neomycin**, an oral aminoglycoside that reduces intestinal ammonia-producing bacteria and is used when lactulose is insufficient or not tolerated, and **Metronidazole**, an alternative antibiotic, though long-term use is limited by potential neurotoxicity.

---

## Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D)

### First-line alternative: loperamide

- **Mechanism of action**: Peripheral μ-opioid receptor agonist that slows intestinal transit, reducing diarrhea frequency.

- **Clinical evidence**: Loperamide is recommended as first-line therapy for IBS-D symptom control.

- **Efficacy**: Effective in reducing stool frequency and improving consistency, though less effective for abdominal pain and bloating.

- **Safety**: Generally well-tolerated; constipation is the most common adverse effect.

---

### Second-line alternatives

Second-line options include **Eluxadoline**, a mixed μ-opioid receptor agonist and δ-opioid receptor antagonist effective for reducing diarrhea and abdominal pain, and **Bile acid sequestrants (e.g. cholestyramine)**, which are useful when bile acid malabsorption contributes to IBS-D symptoms.

---

## Travelers' diarrhea

### First-line alternatives

- **Ciprofloxacin**: A fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against invasive bacterial pathogens [^115cishQ].

- **Azithromycin**: A macrolide antibiotic effective against Campylobacter and other invasive pathogens.

- **Loperamide**: Effective for symptomatic relief in non-invasive travelers' diarrhea [^1112EXvo].

---

## Clinical considerations

Clinical considerations should include **patient-specific factors** such as comorbidities, medication tolerability, and potential drug interactions. Cost-effectiveness favors **lactulose and loperamide** compared with rifaximin, and treatment selection should align with current guideline recommendations.

---

If Xifaxan is not covered, **lactulose is the primary alternative for hepatic encephalopathy**, and loperamide or eluxadoline are suitable for IBS-D. For travelers' diarrhea, ciprofloxacin or azithromycin are effective alternatives.

### Quality of life as a therapeutic objective in the management of hepatic encephalopathy and the potential role of rifaximin-α [^113wkRFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction caused by either liver insufficiency, portosystemic shunting, or both. It manifests as a wide spectrum of neurologic or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from subclinical alterations to coma. Although the aetiology of hepatic encephalopathy has not been conclusively established, its pathophysiology is thought to involve elevated blood levels of gut-derived neurotoxins (particularly ammonia) due to the inability of the damaged liver to remove them from the blood circulation. Systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and endotoxaemia are also thought to be implicated. Hepatic encephalopathy is one of the most debilitating complications of liver disease and is associated with increased mortality. It negatively affects patients' quality of life (QoL), both physically and mentally, resulting in a substantial burden on the lives of both patients and caregivers. The economic burden of hepatic encephalopathy is also profound.

Hepatic encephalopathy guidelines recommend both the active treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy and secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrence. Lactulose is recommended as the first choice for acute treatment and for the prevention of recurrence. Rifaximin is recommended as adjunctive therapy to lactulose for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence after the second episode. The guidelines also recommend that prophylactic therapy be continued, unless precipitating factors (e.g. variceal bleeding, infections) have been addressed.

### A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of rifaximin compared with placebo and with ciprofloxacin in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea [^115cishQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Rifaximin was compared with placebo and ciprofloxacin for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Adult travelers (N = 399) consulting travel clinics in Mexico, Guatemala, and India were randomized to receive rifaximin 200 mg three times a day, ciprofloxacin (500 mg two times a day and placebo once a day), or placebo three times a day for 3 days. Patients recorded in daily diaries the time and consistency of each stool and documented symptoms for 5 days after treatment. Stool samples were collected for microbiologic evaluations before and after treatment.

The median time to last unformed stool (TLUS) in the rifaximin group (32.0 hours) was less than one-half that in the placebo group (65.5 hours; P = 0.001; risk ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.2, 2.2; primary efficacy endpoint). The median TLUS in the ciprofloxacin group was 28.8 hours (P = 0.0003 versus placebo; P = 0.35 versus rifaximin). Rifaximin was less effective than ciprofloxacin for invasive intestinal bacterial pathogens. Oral rifaximin is a safe and effective treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive pathogens.

### Treatment of travelers' diarrhea: Randomized trial comparing rifaximin, rifaximin plus loperamide, and loperamide alone [^1112EXvo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). High credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rifaximin-loperamide in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

- **Aims**: Antimotility agents provide rapid temporary relief of acute diarrhea, whereas antibiotics slowly cure the illness. Thus, the combination of an antimotility agent and an antibiotic may provide greater therapeutic benefit than either drug alone.

- **Methods**: Consenting adults with acute diarrhea (defined as ≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours with ≥ 1 symptom of enteric infection) were randomized to receive rifaximin 200 mg three times daily for three days, loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool, or a combination of both drugs using the same dosing regimen. The primary endpoint was the median time from beginning therapy until passing the last unformed stool.

- **Results**: A total of 310 patients completed treatment with rifaximin (n = 102), loperamide (n = 104), or rifaximin-loperamide combination therapy (n = 104). The groups showed demographic similarity. Rifaximin and rifaximin-loperamide significantly reduced the median time until passage of the last unformed stool (32.5 ± 4.14 hours and 27.3 ± 4.13 hours, respectively) compared to loperamide (69 ± 4.11 hours; p = 0.0019). The mean number of unformed stools passed during illness was lower with rifaximin-loperamide (3.99 ± 4.28) compared to rifaximin (6.23 ± 6.90; p = 0.004) or loperamide alone (6.72 ± 6.93; p = 0.002). All treatments were well-tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events.

Rifaximin-loperamide therapy provided rapid symptomatic improvement and greater overall wellbeing.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112fcfNa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The mean change from open-label baseline to the end of the study (i.e. after double-blind rifaximin retreatment) in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain scores for dysphoria, interference with activity, health worry, and sexual function domains were significantly greater for patients receiving repeat treatment with rifaximin versus placebo in the double-blind phase (p ≤ 0.05; Figure 4). Patients receiving double-blind rifaximin had greater mean improvement from open-label baseline to the end of the study in IBS-QOL subdomain scores for body image, food avoidance, social reaction, and social relationships domains compared with the double-blind placebo. However, these differences did not achieve statistical significance.

- **Figure 4**: Change from open-label baseline in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain scores at last visit for patients randomly assigned to receive rifaximin (n = 328) or placebo (n = 308) in the double-blind treatment phases. The p-value was based on a one-way ANOVA, with a factor of treatment group, adjusted for analysis center, time to recurrence, and recurrence type. Positive numbers indicate an improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL score. Number of patients with missing data: rifaximin (n = 2, overall score, dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, and food avoidance; n = 1, health worry, social reaction, sexual function, and social relationships); placebo (n = 1, overall and all subdomains).

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A narrative review [^111YZ3cz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Evidence of gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suggests that low-grade mucosal inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS and is associated with IBS symptoms. Gastrointestinal immune activation is one factor that may be involved in the pathophysiology of IBS and may be linked to visceral hypersensitivity, given that activated immune cells are localized near enteric nerves. Visceral hypersensitivity, which refers to altered pain perception to normal physiological stimulation, is increased in patients with IBS compared to healthy individuals, and approximately half of patients with IBS exhibit hypersensitivity to rectal distension. Further, 18% of patients with IBS (n = 50) included in a prospective study had visceral hypersensitivity. Preclinical data indicated that rats subjected to chronic and repeated stress had increased visceral hypersensitivity compared with control animals, which was significantly decreased by treatment with the antibiotic rifaximin (p < 0.05). However, clinical studies are warranted to confirm these effects in patients with IBS.

Mast cell counts were significantly increased in mucosal biopsies from the proximal descending colon of patients with IBS (n = 44) compared with healthy individuals (n = 22; p < 0.001). The number of degranulating mast cells, indicative of mast cell activation, was increased by 150% in patients with IBS compared with healthy individuals (p = 0.03). Patients with IBS had 223% more mast cells located less than 5 µm from colonic nerves compared with healthy individuals, a finding that correlated positively with IBS symptoms.

### The use of rifaximin in patients with cirrhosis [^1141eMCB]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

"Real-world" use of rifaximin presents significant advantages. Open-label experiences and evaluations of a placebo-assigned group that was subsequently given rifaximin showed a continued reduction in HE-related episodes, even outside the clinical trial setting. Studies focused on changes in resource utilization before rifaximin compared to after rifaximin demonstrated its potential to reduce HE episodes and hospital admissions.

- **Barriers to rifaximin therapy**: Cost and lack of awareness remain major issues in rifaximin therapy. Even in tertiary care centers, 12.5% of patients admitted with HE were subsequently discharged without HE-specific medications, translating directly into readmissions. Given the expense of hospitalizations, studies have shown that rifaximin is cost-effective for preventing recurrence. However, greater education of providers, patients, and caregivers is needed.

Given its track record of patient acceptance and efficacy in preventing HE, further trials evaluating the role of rifaximin in CHE and inpatient therapy of HE are necessary, especially in combination or head-to-head against other established therapies.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection with (RAPID): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^1174FUtS]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

A recent systematic review found that in Europe, the incremental cost of C. difficile infection ranged from £4,577 to £8,843, driven primarily by increased length of hospital stay. The course of rifaximin we used would cost around £200 at UK pricing. Importantly, rifaximin has been widely used for three decades and is known to be safe, possibly related to its unusually low solubility and absorption. Resistance was initially uncommon but is due to a simple mutation in the rpoB gene, which codes for rifaximin's molecular target, RNA polymerase β subunit. Of concern is the fact that mutations in this gene also underlie resistance to both rifamycin and rifampicin, an important part of antimycobacterial treatment. It rapidly appears in groups of patients where the drug is widely used, for example, treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Its widespread use for IBS and hepatic encephalopathy in the United States has coincided with a marked rise of resistance from 8% to 35% in Texas. Rifaximin's use is more restricted in the UK and resistance is at present low. However, indiscriminate use in a wide range of infections will rapidly increase rates of resistance, so it should be reserved for those at high risk of recurrence. Those who experience multiple recurrences and have repeated courses of treatments often have severely depleted microbiota and are probably best treated by non-antibiotic therapies, particularly faecal transplantation, which has a high success rate in such patients.

The main limitation of the trial is that the planned sample size was not achieved, resulting in reduced precision.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^1142dmzs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Postinfection IBS (PI-IBS) is a diagnosis that may be established in patients who meet Rome criteria for IBS soon after they experience an episode of acute gastroenteritis. This is characterized by a positive stool culture test result in symptomatic patients or the presence of at least two of the three symptoms: fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Notably, IBS symptoms were not present before the occurrence of gastroenteritis.

A systematic review of 45 studies, involving 21,421 patients, estimated a 10.1% prevalence rate of PI-IBS for individuals within 12 months following a case of gastroenteritis. The analysis also indicated that the 1-year relative risk (RR) for PI-IBS was significantly higher for patients who had gastroenteritis, compared to those who did not, in studies conducted in Asia or Europe versus North America. Based on data from 23 of the studies, individuals with gastroenteritis were at a 4.2-fold greater risk of developing IBS compared with unaffected individuals. Another systematic review of six studies reported that patients with travelers' diarrhea were at a 3.4-fold greater risk of developing PI-IBS compared with healthy individuals.

Further, a prospective cohort study identified an increased risk of developing PI-IBS in patients who had Salmonella exposure in childhood compared with individuals without known Salmonella exposure, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.2–3.0. Survey data suggested that individuals who experienced acute gastroenteritis, attributed mostly to Campylobacter, Salmonella, or Shigella, with diarrhea lasting more than two weeks, were more at risk.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112uXNsu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) impairs patient quality of life (QOL). Rifaximin is an oral, nonsystemic antibiotic indicated for IBS-D. The objective of this secondary analysis was to evaluate rifaximin retreatment on IBS-related QOL in patients with IBS-D.

- **Methods**: Patients received open-label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Clinical responders, simultaneously meeting weekly response criteria for abdominal pain (⩾30% improvement from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (⩾50% decrease from baseline in number of days/week with Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) type 6 or 7 stools) during ⩾2 of the first 4 weeks posttreatment, who relapsed during an up to 18-week treatment-free observation phase, were randomly assigned to receive two 2-week courses of double-blind rifaximin or placebo, separated by 10 weeks. A validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire examined patient responses in 8 domains.

- **Results**: The 2579 patients receiving open-label rifaximin experienced a mean improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall score of 54.9%. Responders to open-label rifaximin (n = 1074 of 2438 evaluable; 44.1%) had significantly greater improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores, including dysphoria, food avoidance, interference with activity, body image, and sexual function versus nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment (n = 1364; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A significantly greater percentage of responders to open-label rifaximin achieved the minimally clinically important difference (MCID).

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113G5rSZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A limitation of the study is that patients who responded to open-label rifaximin, but who did not relapse during the 18-week, treatment-free observation phase, discontinued from the study per protocol; therefore, further assessment of this non-relapsing patient population was not conducted to evaluate the duration of improvement in IBS-QOL scores beyond a total of 18 weeks after response was assessed. Another limitation is that when data were missing for an item within the subdomains of the IBS-QOL instrument, scores were not calculated at a given time point, limiting the data available for some assessments during the study. Data from some assessments included a small number of patients (e.g. patients who only received one repeat treatment course). In addition, some components of the IBS-QOL instrument, although a valid instrument for IBS-D, have been reported as not optimal for patients with IBS-D; thus, using this instrument may not have fully assessed the condition of IBS-D and the potential impact of treatments. This study was not sufficiently powered to examine specific demographic and baseline disease characteristics previously shown to be associated with QOL in patients with IBS-D (e.g. sex), and these analyses were not conducted. Finally, this study did not compare improvement in QOL with patient daily activities, which are often impaired by IBS.

In conclusion, patients with IBS-D receiving short-term (2-week) repeat treatment with rifaximin experienced clinically meaningful improvements in QOL.

### The efficacy and safety of rifaximin for the irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xZPr7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10–15% of the population, and treatment options are limited. Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic that has shown efficacy in IBS patients. The objective of our study was to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review of available randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of rifaximin in patients with IBS.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic literature search of multiple online electronic databases, regardless of language. Inclusion criteria entailed randomized, placebo-controlled trials and IBS defined by accepted symptom-based criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of combined studies for the primary and secondary outcomes using a random-effects model based on the DerSimonian and Laird method to reflect both within- and between-study variability. We assessed heterogeneity using the χ² test and the inconsistency index statistic (I²). Significant heterogeneity was defined as I² ≥ 25%. Meta-regression was performed using a generalized linear mixed-effects model and study as random effects to estimate the summary OR adjusting for covariate differences across studies and treatment groups. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot analysis.

- **Results**: Systematic review identified 13,700 citations. Eighteen were deemed to be potentially relevant, of which five articles met eligibility. Meta-analysis found rifaximin to be more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptom improvement (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.22, 2…).

### Rifaximin for prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^114qs6Kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy describes the spectrum of neuropsychiatric changes that may complicate the course of cirrhosis and detrimentally affect outcomes. Ammonia plays a key role in its development. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that inhibits urease-producing bacteria and reduces the absorption of dietary and bacterial ammonia.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of rifaximin versus placebo, no intervention, or non-absorbable disaccharides for the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy and the treatment of minimal and overt hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis, both when used alone and when combined with a non-absorbable disaccharide.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Clinical Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, the reference lists of identified papers, and relevant conference proceedings. We wrote to authors and pharmaceutical companies for information on other published, unpublished, or ongoing trials. Searches were performed up to January 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials assessing the prevention or treatment of hepatic encephalopathy with rifaximin alone, or with a non-absorbable disaccharide, versus placebo/no intervention, or a non-absorbable disaccharide alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Six authors independently searched for studies, extracted data, and validated findings. We assessed the design, risk of bias, and participant/intervention characteristics of the included studies. We assessed mortality, serious adverse events, and efficacy outcomes.

The search term 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' identified a total of 235 articles, of which 71 were assessed as containing primary clinical data. The search term 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose' identified 355 articles, of which 130 contained primary clinical data.

- **Summary of journal articles**: These were indexed on PubMed and identified using the search terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin'. Searches were conducted on titles and abstracts only, with language restricted to English and the date range unrestricted up to the cutoff date (5 March 2018). Articles included:
	- Those without an abstract
	- Articles containing primary clinical trial, clinical practice study, observational, registry, health economic, or survey data, including journal-published congress abstracts, if indexed on PubMed
	- Articles relating to rifaximin alone or in combination with lactulose
	- Articles relating to lactulose alone

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115Cy74N]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain related to defecation along with altered bowel function, such as changes in the form or frequency of stool, and effects on health-related quality of life (QOL). IBS can further be subdivided by stool consistency: constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), or a combination of both (IBS-M). Patients with IBS who have moderate-to-severe symptoms often require more intensive management with prescription therapies.

IBS negatively impacts aspects of patients' daily activity and social wellbeing, including work productivity, social activities, and travel. Patients with IBS participating in a web-based survey indicated a restriction of daily activities on approximately 73 days per year (20% annually); 13% of respondents reported not working because of health-related reasons. Patients with IBS cited a number of factors they believed to be associated with the severity of IBS symptoms, such as pain (80%), bowel difficulties (74%), bloating (69%), and dietary limitations (69%). The number of factors cited directly correlated with an increase in IBS symptom severity.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection with (RAPID): a randomised placebo controlled trial [^115DaTEy]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been reported to increase recurrence rates, so it is important to note that patients on rifaximin, by chance, had a higher rate of PPI use, at 32% versus 20% in those on placebo. This could have reduced the size of the reduction in recurrence rate observed.

Deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events (AEs) were similar to placebo, suggesting that rifaximin is safe in this elderly, frail population. Challenges to recruiting this population have been reported elsewhere and made performing the trial difficult. We required 23 sites and screened over 2000 patients. The main reason for non-enrolment of those who met entry criteria was the choice not to participate. This reflects the frailty and multiple comorbidities characteristic of patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), whose infection is usually induced by antibiotic treatment for another serious illness. Participants' median (interquartile range) age was 76 (63–83), with the oldest being 96, which was higher than in other trials cited. The mortality rate was also higher than in many trials of newer agents, which tend to exclude the most frail. This suggests that, as we intended, by minimizing the barriers to patient recruitment, we recruited a sample more typical of the patient group at risk of CDI, so our results should be generalizable to everyday clinical practice.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for portal hypertension, particularly in the context of technical considerations for TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) and perioperative care, the EASL 2025 guidelines recommend the administration of rifaximin for the prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy. This is specifically advised for patients with cirrhosis who have no history of hepatic encephalopathy prior to non-urgent TIPS creation.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113s3uac]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

This was a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III trial [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01543178]. The patient population and study design have been previously described. Briefly, individuals aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of IBS, based on Rome III criteria, and average symptom severity scores of 3 or greater for IBS-related abdominal pain (range: 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain you can imagine) and bloating (range: 0 = not at all to 6 = a very great deal) during the screening phase, and with stools for 2 or more days per week meeting Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) criteria for type 6 or type 7 consistency, were eligible for inclusion in the study.

During the screening phase (10 ± 3 days), all patients received single-blind placebo three times a day and reported daily IBS-related symptoms (Figure 1). In the open-label treatment phase, patients received rifaximin 550 mg three times a day for 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week treatment-free follow-up period, during which response was evaluated. The response was defined as meeting weekly response criteria for both abdominal pain (30% or greater improvement from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (50% or greater decrease from baseline in the number of days/week with BSS type 6 or 7 stools) during 2 or more of the 4 weeks. Nonresponders to open-label rifaximin were withdrawn from the study. Responders were subsequently followed, treatment-free, for up to 18 additional weeks (observation phase), or until relapse.

### Rifaximin is safe and well tolerated for long-term maintenance of remission from overt hepatic encephalopathy [^1149H8T5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims: Rifaximin is a gut-selective, oral antimicrobial agent shown to reduce the recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and HE-related hospitalizations in a 6-month, randomized, controlled trial (RCT). We performed a phase 3, open-label maintenance study to assess the safety and rate of hospitalization with long-term rifaximin use.

Methods: We conducted a 24-month, open-label maintenance study of rifaximin (550 mg, twice daily) in patients with HE who participated in the previous RCT of rifaximin or new patients enrolled from March 2007 to December 2010. Safety was assessed, including adverse events and clinical laboratory parameters, for the integrated population of all patients, who were given rifaximin 550 mg twice daily (all-rifaximin population, N = 392). Safety and hospitalization data were compared between the group given placebo in the original RCT (n = 159) and those given rifaximin (n = 140).

Results: In the all-rifaximin population, the median exposure to rifaximin was 427.0 days (range, 2–1427 days), with 510.5 person-years of exposure. The profile and rate of adverse events with long-term rifaximin treatment were similar to those of the original RCT. There was no increase in the rate of infections, including with Clostridium difficile, or development of bacterial antibiotic resistance. Rates of hospitalizations with long-term rifaximin administration remained low: the HE-related hospitalization rate, normalized for exposure (0.21; all-rifaximin population), was similar to that of the rifaximin group in the original RCT (0.30).

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^116Nt5sG]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interactions characterized by bouts of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits; patients also often experience bloating. IBS is further characterized by the predominant stool form observed: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), and IBS with a mixture of constipation and diarrhea (IBS-M). IBS is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, with a pooled worldwide prevalence ranging from 8.8% to 11.2%. A three-country survey using ROME IV IBS diagnostic criteria reported estimated prevalence rates overall, and specifically for females, at 5.5% and 7.5%, respectively, in the United Kingdom; 5.7% and 7.8% in Canada; and 6.1% and 7.1% in the United States.

The pathophysiology of IBS is multifactorial and is thought to include contributions from factors such as gut microbiota dysbiosis, altered intestinal and colonic permeability, GI immune cell activation, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal gut-brain interactions. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the factors proposed to be involved in IBS pathophysiology and to discuss the role rifaximin may play in modulating these pathophysiologic factors and improving symptoms in patients with IBS.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A narrative review [^114rSmUp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder with a multifactorial pathophysiology. The gut microbiota differs between patients with IBS and healthy individuals. After a bout of acute gastroenteritis, post-infection IBS may result in up to approximately 10% of those affected. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is more common in patients with IBS than in healthy individuals, and eradication of SIBO with systemic antibiotics has decreased symptoms of IBS in some patients with IBS and SIBO.

The nonsystemic (i.e. low oral bioavailability) antibiotic rifaximin is indicated in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adults with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). The efficacy and safety of 2-week single and repeat courses of rifaximin have been demonstrated in randomized, placebo-controlled studies of adults with IBS. Rifaximin is widely thought to exert its beneficial clinical effects in IBS-D through manipulation of the gut microbiota. However, studies indicate that rifaximin induces only modest effects on the gut microbiota of patients with IBS-D, suggesting its efficacy may involve other mechanisms.

Indeed, preclinical data reveal a potential role for rifaximin in the modulation of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal permeability, but these findings have not yet been examined in the context of clinical studies. The mechanism of action of rifaximin in IBS is likely multifactorial, and further study is needed.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111djYhV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

In the phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Bass et al, rifaximin-α 550 mg was compared to a placebo for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence over six months. Concomitant lactulose use was over 90% in both groups. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 80.0% with rifaximin versus 79.9% with placebo.

- **Common adverse events**: The most commonly reported AEs (≥ 10% of patients in either group) were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, peripheral edema, ascites, dizziness, and headache. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups regarding these AEs.
- **Serious adverse events and infection**: There were also no significant differences in the incidences of serious AEs and AEs related to infection, including Clostridium difficile infection.
- **Mortality rates**: Deaths occurred in 6.4% of rifaximin-treated patients and 6.9% of placebo-treated patients.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111426bB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the 6-month phase III trial that compared rifaximin-α 550 mg with placebo for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence in patients in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remission, more than 90% of whom were additionally treated with lactulose, the overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was the same in both groups, and there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of the most commonly reported AEs and serious AEs.

In the 24-month open-label maintenance study that followed this trial, the incidences of total AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower than those observed in the rifaximin and placebo arms of the original 6-month trial. In addition, long-term retrospective studies have shown a low incidence of AEs when rifaximin is added to lactulose therapy in clinical practice. As with nearly all antibacterial agents, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea has been reported with rifaximin treatment. However, this has not emerged as a major safety concern following long-term treatment in clinical trials and in clinical practice studies.

HE is associated with a substantial economic burden, primarily because of the direct costs of hospitalization and rehospitalization following recurrence, and secondarily because of the indirect costs associated with outpatient care, disability, lost productivity, and the wider negative effect on the lives of patients' caregivers. As previously discussed, evidence for the long-term treatment of HE with rifaximin as an add-on to lactulose therapy demonstrates that it not only significantly decreases OHE recurrence in comparison with lactulose therapy alone.

### The use of rifaximin in patients with cirrhosis [^112SiNDf]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Several studies have assessed the impact of rifaximin in the prevention of complications of cirrhosis other than hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and bacterial infections. Data are not univocal and are often burdened by serious methodological issues. Taking this into consideration, it is suggested that by reducing serum levels of proinflammatory mediators linked to intestinal bacterial translocation, rifaximin may decrease portal hypertension and improve systemic hemodynamics — increasing systemic vascular resistances and mean arterial pressure — and renal function by improving glomerular filtration rate and urinary sodium excretion.

Valuable clinical benefits have been associated with rifaximin, including a reduction in the incidence of decompensation of cirrhosis, all-cause hospitalizations and readmissions, variceal bleeding, and acute kidney injury, including hepatorenal syndrome, with a decreased risk of renal replacement therapy. A better control of difficult-to-treat/refractory ascites was also shown when rifaximin was added to treatment. A reduction in mortality was suggested in some studies. Although promising, these data must be confirmed by well-conducted, large randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111jwtPz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Lactulose alone

Three large single-center, open-label, randomized controlled studies have assessed the long-term (≥ 6 months) safety and tolerability of lactulose therapy, compared with placebo, probiotics, and/or no therapy. In a primary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis but no previous history of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months. All patients treated with lactulose remained adherent to treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) with lactulose were diarrhea, distaste for lactulose, and abdominal bloating, which improved following reduction of lactulose dosing.

In a secondary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64), or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months. All lactulose patients remained adherent to treatment. AEs in the lactulose group again comprised diarrhea, distaste for lactulose, and abdominal bloating. Lactulose dosing was reduced in these patients but not stopped. In the probiotics group, AEs comprised constipation and abdominal distension, which were managed with dietary advice and intermittent use of proton pump inhibitors. In the no-therapy group, only constipation was reported, which was managed with dietary modifications.

Similar results were observed in another secondary prophylaxis study, in which patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. All patients remained adherent to lactulose therapy, and AEs included diarrhea, distaste for lactulose, and abdominal bloating.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A narrative review [^115DBwN6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The recommended method for diagnosing SIBO is breath testing. Individuals undergo breath testing in the fasted state, consuming a carbohydrate substrate (e.g. lactulose 10 g, glucose 75 g) that can be metabolized to hydrogen and methane by intestinal microbes; these gases are detectable during exhalation. It remains unclear what effects, if any, demographic characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity, sex) have on breath testing; furthermore, the effects of prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics are also unknown. Small bowel culture is another diagnostic tool for SIBO, provided a threshold of > 10³ colony-forming units/mL is achieved from a duodenal aspirate. However, small bowel culture is limited by its invasive nature, a lack of practical techniques allowing for the acquisition of aspirates under sterile conditions, and difficulties in accessing the mid and distal small intestinal segments.

### The efficacy and safety of rifaximin-α: a 2-year observational study of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^112rpAQ2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The median treatment duration of rifaximin-α was 232 days (IQR 65.0–579.0). Figure 3 shows the estimated rifaximin-α users' rate until discontinuation. The rifaximin-α users' rate after initiation was 74% at 3 months, 63% at 6 months, 55% at 1 year, and 44% at 18 months. The reasons for stopping rifaximin-α treatment in the first 6 months were death in 24 (18.9%) patients, liver transplantation in 16 (12.6%) patients, and temporary or permanent discontinuation in 8 (6.3%) patients for other reasons.

Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier curve showing the proportion (red line) of patients using rifaximin-α after initiation of treatment.

In the long-term follow-up (until end of study observation, death, liver transplantation, or rifaximin-α discontinuation), rifaximin-α was temporarily discontinued in seven (5.5%) patients: due to long-term HE resolution in five patients, adverse events in one patient, and without any documented reason in one patient, but reinitiated after recurrence of overt HE. Rifaximin-α treatment was permanently discontinued in eight (6.3%) patients: in three patients, prescription was discontinued without a documented reason, two patients had adverse events, treatment was withdrawn in the terminal phase of the underlying disease in two patients, and in one case due to nonadherence. In total, three patients reported an adverse event: nausea assumed to be related to rifaximin-α, rash assumed to be related to rifaximin-α, and polyneuropathy assumed to be non-related to rifaximin-α. Rifaximin-α dosage was raised to

### Rifaximin versus nonabsorbable disaccharides in the management of hepatic encephalopathy: a meta-analysis [^112vznBX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

To compare the positive and negative effects of rifaximin and nonabsorbable disaccharides in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, we used the method recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration to perform a meta-analysis of comparative randomized trials.

Seven randomized controlled trials were identified, but only five trials involving 264 patients met all inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between rifaximin and nonabsorbable disaccharides on improvement in patients with hepatic encephalopathy [relative risk (RR) 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.85–1.38; P = 0.53]. RR was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.85–1.13; P = 0.74) for acute hepatic encephalopathy in 157 patients and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.40–1.88; P = 0.72) for chronic hepatic encephalopathy in 96 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between rifaximin and nonabsorbable disaccharides on diarrhea (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.17–4.70; P = 0.90). However, a significant difference in favor of rifaximin on abdominal pain (RR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.08–0.95; P = 0.04) was identified.

Rifaximin is not superior to nonabsorbable disaccharides for acute or chronic hepatic encephalopathy in long-term or short-term treatment, except that it may be better tolerated. Further studies on larger populations are required to provide more sufficient evidence for assessment of the use of rifaximin.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection with (RAPID): A randomised placebo controlled trial [^115XyQUE]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Assessment of safety**: There were nine deaths reported on placebo and nine deaths on rifaximin. There were 15 (22%) participants with at least one serious adverse event (SAE) on placebo and 12 (16%) on rifaximin in the 28 days post-randomisation. No SAEs were considered to relate to the trial treatment in the group allocated to rifaximin. Non-SAEs in the 28 days post-randomisation were similar in the two groups, but none were considered definitely related to rifaximin. Full details of types of adverse events (AEs) are provided in online supplementary files 5 and 6.

- **Trial participation survey**: Fifty-six participants completed the patient experience questionnaire at 6 months. Barriers to taking part in the study identified by participants included difficulties completing the diary, collecting stool samples, and taking the medication (size and quantity of tablets). At least one stool diary was completed by 75 participants (50%) during weeks one to four and by 48 participants (32%) in week 12. A summary of stool frequency and consistency during weeks 1 to 4 and weeks 11 to 12 is shown in online supplementary file 7.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^114fJ9AV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Rifaximin is the focus of multiple randomized, placebo-controlled trials that have found it to improve overall symptoms in a subset of patients with IBS-D. On the strength of the available data, rifaximin is currently approved for the treatment of adults with IBS-D in the United States and Canada. Though the efficacy of rifaximin has been clearly demonstrated, the mechanisms responsible for its clinical benefits in patients with IBS-D have not been firmly established. With this in mind, we have reviewed knowledge regarding the pharmacology, clinical impact, impact on the microbiota, inflammatory activity in the GI tract, and intestinal permeability of rifaximin in patients with IBS-D.

- **Pharmacology**: Rifaximin is a nonsystemic antibiotic with low oral bioavailability; generally, less than 0.01% of a single orally administered 400 mg dose is detected in the plasma and urine of healthy volunteers 48 hours after administration. The presence of bile acids increases the solubility of rifaximin 70- to 120-fold, which may increase the availability of rifaximin to exert antimicrobial and other effects in the small intestine. The detection of unchanged drug in stool samples following oral administration indicates that rifaximin has high availability in the GI tract, considered to be a factor in the minimum inhibitory concentrations observed against human GI bacteria.

In vitro activity of rifaximin against anaerobic bacteria found in the human GI tract was noted in a study.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of lactulose and rifaximin on patient-reported outcomes in hepatic encephalopathy [^113JRiwC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) suffer from significant symptoms and impaired quality of life. An improved understanding of the potential benefits of first-line HE therapies may aid patient-provider discussions regarding expected benefits of HE treatments. We aimed to perform a systematic review to assess the effects of lactulose and rifaximin on patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases for randomized trials or prospective cohort studies using lactulose and/or rifaximin for the management of HE, assessing changes in PRO using PRO instruments. Physician reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full texts, and extracted data independently. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to examine the effects of lactulose and rifaximin on PROs.

- **Results**: We identified 16 studies representing 1,376 patients that met the inclusion criteria. Most studies assessed treatment of covert HE. In patients with covert HE, lactulose significantly improved overall patient-reported health-related quality of life measured by the Sickness Impact Profile with an estimated pooled mean difference of 6.92 (95% confidence interval: 6.66–7.18) and showed improvements in several subscales. Conversely, rifaximin demonstrated a non-statistically significant mean difference in the total Sickness Impact Profile of 4.76 (95% confidence interval: -4.23 to 13.76), with strong evidence of heterogeneity between these studies. Studies examining other PRO instruments showed improvements in overall health-related quality.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^114PP9FU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

In a similarly designed single-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 126 patients with cirrhosis, who were admitted to the hospital with an index overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) event and had experienced at least one other OHE event in the previous 6 months, were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg or placebo for 6 months, in addition to lactulose therapy. In this trial, the rate of HE recurrence was 44.4% with rifaximin versus 36.5% with placebo (P = not significant), and the mortality rate was 11.1% in both treatment groups.

When examining long-term use specifically, patients completing the trial by Bass and colleagues were eligible to enter a phase III, multicenter, open-label maintenance study, in which patients received open-label treatment with rifaximin-α 550 mg for 24 months. In total, 392 patients were treated with rifaximin ("all-rifaximin" group), including 252 patients who received de novo treatment ("new-rifaximin" group). As in the initial trial, ~90% of patients were additionally treated with lactulose. The rates of HE-related hospitalization were 0.21 and 0.23 events/person-year of exposure (PYE) for the all-rifaximin and new-rifaximin groups, respectively. In the original trial, the corresponding values were 0.30 events/PYE for rifaximin versus 0.72 events/PYE for placebo (P < 0.0001). A post-hoc analysis of this study was conducted for 321 patients who had been treated for a mean duration of 1.5 years. Data were compared between patients who had been newly recruited, having not participated in the original trial ("rifaximin-newly recruited" group), with those who received rifaximin.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114h9jEH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) impairs patient quality of life (QOL). Rifaximin is an oral, nonsystemic antibiotic indicated for IBS-D. The objective of this secondary analysis was to evaluate rifaximin retreatment on IBS-related QOL in patients with IBS-D.

- **Methods**: Patients received open-label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Clinical responders, who simultaneously met weekly response criteria for abdominal pain (⩾30% improvement from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (⩾50% decrease from baseline in the number of days/week with Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) type 6 or 7 stools), during ⩾2 of the first 4 weeks post-treatment, and who relapsed during an up to 18-week treatment-free observation phase were randomly assigned to receive two 2-week courses of double-blind rifaximin or placebo, separated by 10 weeks. A validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire examined patient responses in 8 domains.

- **Results**: The 2579 patients receiving open-label rifaximin experienced a mean improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall score of 54.9%. Responders to open-label rifaximin (n = 1074 of 2438 evaluable; 44.1%) had significantly greater improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores, including dysphoria, food avoidance, interference with activity, body image, and sexual function versus nonresponders at 4 weeks post-treatment (n = 1364; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A significantly greater percentage of responders to open-label rifaximin achieved the minimally clinically important difference (MCID; ⩾14).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^112bUHhA]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of long-term (≥ 6 months) treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) with rifaximin and/or lactulose has been assessed through a manual review of articles containing primary clinical data. This review identified long-term effectiveness outcomes, with eight articles reporting on treatment with lactulose alone and nineteen articles reporting on treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose.

- **NNT analyses**: These were performed on studies that reported at least six months of secondary prophylaxis with the following comparisons: lactulose versus no lactulose (n = 1), lactulose versus placebo (n = 1), rifaximin+lactulose versus placebo+lactulose (n = 2), and rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin+lactulose (n = 1). Details of studies with more than 100 patients are summarized in more detail later.

- **Table 1 (Removed)**: Effectiveness outcomes over the long term (≥ 6 months) for patients treated with rifaximin and/or lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. Articles discussing rifaximin and lactulose are in the rifaximin section, and those reporting on lactulose without rifaximin are in the lactulose section.

- **Fig. 2 (Removed)**: The number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for comparisons: lactulose versus no lactulose/placebo, rifaximin+lactulose versus placebo+lactulose, and rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin+lactulose.

This review highlights the need for further data on the long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy, as current studies vary in their assessment of rifaximin and lactulose's effectiveness.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^11473nCz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

A consolidated overview of evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) treatment over the long term is currently lacking. We identified and assessed published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE with lactulose and/or rifaximin. A literature search was conducted in PubMed (cutoff date 05 March 2018) using the search terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. All articles containing primary clinical data were manually assessed to identify studies in which long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints were reported for lactulose and/or rifaximin.

- **Long-term effectiveness**: Outcomes were reported in eight articles for treatment with lactulose alone and 19 articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose.
- **Safety/tolerability outcomes**: Reported in six articles for treatment with lactulose alone and nine articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose.

These studies showed that lactulose is effective for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term. The addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization compared with lactulose therapy alone, without compromising tolerability. Evidence therefore supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term, and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^116keymr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In the TARGET 3 study, the gut microbiota of patients with IBS-D who received up to three 2-week courses of rifaximin 550 mg three times daily (n = 103 patients; n = 675 fecal samples) was stable. However, a small, transient decrease in the relative abundance of specific taxa was observed at the end of the first course (2-week open-label rifaximin) compared with baseline - For 33 patients who received three rifaximin courses, Clostridiaceae.1 was the only taxon that was significantly decreased from baseline following the first and second courses of treatment (p < 0.05, for both courses). One putative mechanism of action for rifaximin may be modulation of the observed taxa that transiently decreased in this study, although additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Data analyzing the effects of rifaximin on alterations in gut microbiota in patients with IBS and psychological comorbidities are not currently available. Overall, although it is apparent that rifaximin has some modest effect on the gut microbiota in patients with IBS, the efficacy of rifaximin in IBS likely involves several factors.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115ysSJF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Improvements from open-label baseline in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and body image were significantly greater in patients who responded to open-label rifaximin and did not relapse during the treatment-free observation phase, as compared with those who responded and subsequently relapsed during the observation phase. This finding suggests that greater improvement in quality of life (QOL) following treatment with rifaximin is associated with a lower chance of subsequent symptom relapse.

Indeed, responders to open-label treatment with rifaximin had significantly greater improvement from baseline in the IBS-QOL overall score based on an MCID (Minimal Clinically Important Difference) of ⩾14 points compared with nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment. The subgroup of nonresponders who achieved the MCID in IBS-QOL may not have met the formal prespecified criteria for response, but it is possible that they experienced enough improvement in their clinical symptoms with rifaximin treatment to deem their QOL improved.

While a direct association between MCID and the symptomatic response to rifaximin is not entirely expected, clinically meaningful improvement in IBS-QOL appears to be consistent with improvements in abdominal pain and stool consistency previously reported for these patients. These data demonstrate that a single course of short-term treatment with rifaximin is associated with clinically meaningful improvement in QOL in patients with IBS-D.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^115e7TEA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Preventing recurrence of diverticulitis (secondary prevention)

- **Rifaximin**: Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed drug that provides antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory benefits in the gut. No systematic review or meta-analysis has been published on the topic of rifaximin for diverticulitis since 2011, when it was demonstrated that rifaximin significantly reduced symptoms of diverticulitis at 1 year. Rifaximin is more commonly used in Europe, but its cost is often prohibitive in the United States. Recent studies have again attributed symptomatic and quality-of-life benefits to rifaximin following an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis, but its role in secondary prevention and appropriate dosing (continuous vs. cyclic) have yet to be defined.

- **Mesalamine**: A 2017 Cochrane review of 7 RCTs attempted to investigate the efficacy of mesalamine in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. They did not identify a difference in the outcome of recurrence with the use of mesalamine, but noted that the data to support this conclusion is very low quality and the studies were significantly heterogeneous. Though several additional systematic reviews with conflicting evidence exist, just one reports a benefit from the use of mesalamine when compared to placebo or other interventions.

- **Probiotics**: The presumptive purpose of probiotics is to restore healthy intestinal microbiota and prevent a plethora of gastrointestinal diseases. Based on the results of a systematic review published in 2016, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in diverticulitis.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^115L9Xru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review shows an increasing body of evidence for the use of rifaximin in addition to lactulose, and for lactulose therapy alone, in the long-term management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). In line with the guidelines, this evidence supports the use of lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) events over the long term. In addition, one study has shown the effectiveness of lactulose as primary prophylaxis in the prevention of long-term OHE occurrence. Although there is very little direct head-to-head evidence of rifaximin versus lactulose over the long term, there is considerable evidence to support recommendations for the use of rifaximin as an add-on treatment to standard lactulose therapy in the secondary prophylaxis setting.

In terms of effectiveness, several long-term, open-label clinical trials and clinical practice studies have shown that, when added to lactulose therapy, rifaximin significantly reduces the recurrence of OHE events and the rate of HE-related hospitalization compared to lactulose therapy alone. An exception to this was a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Ali et al, in which rifaximin was found to be no better than placebo when combined with lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis against OHE recurrence. Discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancy in the findings of this trial compared with those of the phase III trial by Bass et al, the authors point out that the study populations differed in terms of primary etiology of cirrhosis.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111h4zH9]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Only one long-term study has assessed the effectiveness of rifaximin monotherapy compared with rifaximin+lactulose therapy. Compared with rifaximin+lactulose, the calculated NNT value (95% CI) for rifaximin monotherapy as secondary prophylaxis for OHE recurrence was 6.88 (3.50–203.90). This was a multicenter, retrospective chart review comparing 1-year outcomes of 149 patients with cirrhosis treated with rifaximin (400–1600 mg/day) with those of 54 patients treated with rifaximin+lactulose.

The rate of maintenance of HE remission for 1 year was 81% with rifaximin monotherapy versus 67% with rifaximin+lactulose. Mean time to a breakthrough OHE event was 210 days with rifaximin monotherapy versus 90 days with rifaximin+lactulose. HE-related hospitalization rates were similar with rifaximin (43%) and rifaximin+lactulose (39%). In both groups, response to rifaximin appeared to be enhanced in patients with a mean baseline model for end-stage liver disease score of less than or equal to 20.

These findings appear to contrast with those of a single-center, retrospective, observational study of 225 patients evaluated for liver transplantation, all of whom were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg+lactulose for 6 months, which showed a lower rate of HE-related hospitalization in patients with a model for end-stage liver disease score of at least 20 versus less than 20 (1.6 vs. 2.5 per 6 months).

### Rifaximin for the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea [^111qMpim]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable rifamycin derivative with an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a variety of enteropathogens causing acute infectious diarrhea. After oral ingestion, its bioavailability is known to be less than 0.4%, and it has a low potential for significant drug interactions.

In the treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, rifaximin has been demonstrated to significantly shorten the duration of diarrhea and exhibits an efficacy similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Moreover, according to two randomized placebo-controlled trials, prophylactic treatment with rifaximin reduced the risk of developing travelers' diarrhea by more than 50% compared with the placebo group.

For the treatment of acute diarrhea unrelated to travel, a short course of rifaximin significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea, and its overall efficacy was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of rifaximin, however, and the clinical implication of the rapid appearance of bacterial resistance, must be further elucidated.

In conclusion, this gut-selective antibiotic seems to be a promising option for the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea secondary to noninvasive E. coli and also appears to be effective in chemoprophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^117Ti1Vu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Studies have assessed the effectiveness of different rifaximin treatment regimens alongside lactulose therapy. No significant differences were observed between patients treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg once daily versus twice daily, or between those treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily versus rifaximin 400 mg three times daily. However, rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily was shown to be more cost-effective than the three-times-daily regimen.

Direct head-to-head evidence on the long-term effectiveness of rifaximin versus lactulose is scarce. In a single-center retrospective chart review, 145 patients diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy received at least 6 months of lactulose treatment before transitioning to at least 6 months of rifaximin treatment (400 mg, three times daily). Outcomes focused on the final 6 months of lactulose therapy versus the initial 6 months of rifaximin treatment. The number of hospitalizations per patient was significantly lower with rifaximin compared to lactulose (0.5 vs. 1.6; P < 0.001), as were the number of hospitalization days (2.5 vs. 7.3; P < 0.001) and weeks of hospitalization per patient (0.4 vs. 1.8; P < 0.001).

Rifaximin was also compared with lactulose in a single-center prospective study designed to determine the optimal treatment duration for patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Patients with cirrhosis and MHE were randomized to receive primary prophylaxis with either rifaximin (400 mg, three times daily) or lactulose for 3 months, followed by a further 6-month observation period.

### Rifaximin in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: Is there a high risk for development of antimicrobial resistance [^114Br3vS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic, nonfatal illness, is commonly encountered in clinical practice; however, treatment options are limited and often ineffectual. Despite this, there is increasing evidence that bacterial overgrowth in the bowel (dysbiosis) may be an etiological factor in IBS. This has led to studies in which the antibiotic agent rifaximin has been used to reduce the microbial burden in the bowel, to some extent alleviating the symptoms of IBS.

Rifaximin is a member of the rifamycin class of antibiotics, which, when administered orally, has the distinctions of being gut-specific coupled with poor systemic absorption, characteristics suggested to limit the development of bacterial resistance. The rifamycins are currently used to treat serious human diseases, including tuberculosis, meningococcal disease, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile infections. However, the use of rifamycins in the treatment of these diseases is associated with the development of antibiotic resistance over time.

Considering the importance of the rifamycins in the treatment of serious human diseases, the large number of patients affected by IBS, and the lack of scientific evidence available on the development of antibiotic resistance to rifaximin over the long term when used in the gut, it is advisable that the use of rifaximin as a therapy for IBS should be limited to single, acute, short-term treatment.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1171NnTS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The findings of this study indicate that repeat treatment with rifaximin favorably impacts IBS-QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores in patients with IBS-D. Moreover, IBS-QOL overall and all subdomain scores were improved from baseline for up to 4 weeks posttreatment in patients receiving 2-week open-label rifaximin treatment, with the greatest improvements observed for the IBS-QOL subdomains of dysphoria and interference with activity. Interestingly, IBS-QOL subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and dysphoria have been shown to be low (i.e. poorer QOL) in patients with IBS-D, and the majority of patients with IBS have self-reported intolerances to a number of foods, which aberrantly affects QOL. In the open-label population, baseline IBS-QOL subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and dysphoria were among the lowest compared with other IBS-QOL subdomain scores. All of these subdomain scores significantly improved in responders treated with rifaximin compared with nonresponders. It is valuable to note that the IBS-QOL is a derivative measure that reflects the perceptions of patients with IBS, including the amount of control they have over their symptoms, their ability to socialize, and their sexual relationships, which can have lasting effects even if there is some degree of symptom change. It was not designed as a surrogate measure of symptoms or function.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^11158pzf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

A consolidated overview of evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) treatment over the long term is currently lacking. We identified and assessed published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE with lactulose and/or rifaximin. A literature search was conducted in PubMed (cutoff date 05 March 2018) using the search terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. All articles containing primary clinical data were manually assessed to identify studies in which long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints were reported for lactulose and/or rifaximin.

- **Long-term effectiveness outcomes**: These were reported in eight articles for treatment with lactulose alone and 19 articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose.

- **Long-term safety/tolerability outcomes**: These were reported in six articles for treatment with lactulose alone and nine articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose.

These studies showed that lactulose is effective for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term. The addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization, compared with lactulose therapy alone, without compromising tolerability.

Evidence therefore supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A narrative review [^115ES5rw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, a meta-analysis of five studies demonstrated that rifaximin was significantly associated with improvement of global IBS symptoms compared with placebo [42.2% versus 32.4%, respectively; OR, 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2–2.0); p < 0.001]. Data from four studies showed rifaximin was significantly associated with improvement in bloating versus placebo 10–14 days after treatment [41.6% versus 31.7%; OR, 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2–2.0); p < 0.001]. The number needed to treat for rifaximin has been reported as 8 (n = 7 studies) to 11 (n = 4–6 studies). Overall, the number needed to stop for rifaximin (based on discontinuation due to an AE) was 8,971, with an estimated 846 patients benefiting from rifaximin before an AE resulting in treatment discontinuation would be observed.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111seTMi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The majority of patients included in the double-blind phase received two repeat treatments (rifaximin, 89.9%; placebo, 91.9%). The MCID in the IBS-QOL overall score from double-blind baseline to the end of the first retreatment 4-week follow-up was achieved by a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving rifaximin compared with placebo (38.6% versus 29.6%, respectively; p = 0.009). For patients who received open-label rifaximin and both double-blind treatment courses, the improvement from double-blind baseline to the end of the first double-blind treatment follow-up in IBS-QOL overall and most subdomain scores (excepting IBS-QOL health worry and sexual function subdomain scores) was greater compared with patients who received open-label rifaximin and two courses of placebo treatment. However, in patients who received two repeat treatments, differences between treatment groups (i.e. rifaximin versus placebo) were not statistically significant when comparing mean improvement in IBS-QOL overall score from open-label baseline with the 4-week follow-up after open-label rifaximin (i.e. treatment #1) or the first double-blind treatment (i.e. treatment #2). A statistical analysis could not be conducted because there was an insufficient number of patients receiving both double-blind treatments who had IBS-QOL data at the end of the study.

### Rifaximin: A unique gastrointestinal-selective antibiotic for enteric diseases [^112V2AkG]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Rifaximin is gaining attention for its potential activity in a multitude of gastrointestinal diseases. We review the unique pharmaceutical properties of this antibiotic and the published evidence in the literature regarding the use of rifaximin for different gastrointestinal disorders.

- **Recent findings**: Rifaximin is a gastrointestinal-selective antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, an excellent safety profile, minimal drug interactions, and negligible impact on the intestinal microbiome. It is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and in more than 30 other countries for various gastrointestinal disorders. Considerable research with this medication has been conducted for the treatment and prevention of travelers' diarrhea, the treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy, Clostridium difficile infection, small bowel intestinal overgrowth, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pouchitis, and colonic diverticular disease.

- **Summary**: Rifaximin is effective for the treatment of travelers' diarrhea and can be considered as the treatment of choice for uncomplicated travelers' diarrhea. When invasive travelers' diarrhea pathogens are suspected, an alternative antibiotic should be administered. Rifaximin appears promising as a chemoprophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea and as a treatment of portal systemic encephalopathy. This antibiotic may be effective for other gastrointestinal diseases, but more well-designed studies are needed.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^113d6v2E]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Evidence supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term, and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy. The addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly further reduces the risk of OHE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization compared with lactulose therapy alone, with a demonstrably low NNT to achieve these further benefits. There is also emerging evidence to indicate that a switch to rifaximin monotherapy may be appropriate for those for whom lactulose is ineffective and/or poorly tolerated, and/or when adherence to lactulose therapy is problematic, although this requires further research.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^112b6aDo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In the multicenter, retrospective, observational IMPRESS study of 207 patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (all of whom were treated with rifaximin-α 550 mg and 84% of whom received concomitant lactulose), 4.3% of patients had documented adverse events (AEs), most commonly C. difficile infection (n = 4) and rash (n = 2). No serious AEs were reported. Of the four patients who developed C. difficile infection, none had a history of C. difficile and none was on concomitant antibiotics. All patients continued rifaximin therapy.

In a single-center, retrospective, cohort study that compared the effectiveness of rifaximin (600 mg, twice daily) plus lactulose (n = 318) versus lactulose alone (n = 724) in patients with cirrhosis-related HE who either did or did not have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), C. difficile infection rates were 0.3% with rifaximin plus lactulose versus 1.0% with lactulose alone, over a median follow-up duration of 18.0 months in patients without HCC and 4.4 months in patients with HCC.

In a multicenter, retrospective chart review of 211 patients treated with rifaximin (mean: 1055 mg/day; range: 600–1600 mg/day), in addition to lactulose, over a mean follow-up duration of 250 days, 8% of patients experienced diarrhea, but none experienced C. difficile infection. All cases of diarrhea were resolved with standard antidiarrheal therapy, which was administered after stool analysis excluded C. difficile infection.

Direct head-to-head evidence of the long-term safety and tolerability of rifaximin versus lactulose is limited to a single-center, retrospective chart review, in which 145 patients diagnosed with HE received at least 6 months of treatment.
