## Question

Choice of fluids for sickle cell pain crisis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the choice of fluids for sickle cell pain crisis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pathophysiology that make fluid choices important. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines actually recommend. Next, I will examine the evidence base, including any randomized or quasi-experimental data and observational studies. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits versus harms of different fluid types and volumes. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, risk-stratified approach and highlight knowledge gaps and monitoring needs, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too strong before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why fluids matter mechanistically. In vaso-occlusive crisis, dehydration increases plasma osmolality and promotes red cell dehydration, which accelerates HbS polymerization and microvascular obstruction; conversely, overhydration can precipitate fluid overload, especially in patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidity or renal dysfunction, so balance is key [^8d109acd] [^839f41bc].

> Wait, let me verify what the highest-credibility guidelines say. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 pain guideline explicitly issues a nonrecommendation for routine IV fluids in acute SCD pain, stating that the panel could not recommend for or against IV fluids and emphasizes that fluids may be given for clinically significant dehydration, with no preference stated for normal saline versus half-normal saline or other crystalloids, which means routine fluids are not advised in euvolemic patients [^bff47c3a] [^f71ab5c0] [^9cfcf844].

> I should confirm the evidence base supporting that stance. The Cochrane review found zero randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing routes, types, or volumes of fluids for acute painful crises, underscoring a critical evidence gap and explaining the ASH nonrecommendation [^5e2d0f20]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it does mean practice should be conservative and individualized until better data emerge [^5e2d0f20].

> Next, I should review indirect and observational signals that might inform fluid choice when fluids are actually indicated. In vitro and translational data suggest normal saline may increase sickle RBC stiffness and worsen microvascular transit, whereas more balanced or lower-chloride solutions may be less harmful, though this remains indirect and not definitive for clinical outcomes [^839f41bc] [^4162e073]. A large multicenter retrospective cohort using target trial emulation found that lactated Ringer's was associated with more hospital-free days, shorter length of stay, and lower 30-day readmissions compared with normal saline when patients received 2 liters or more, suggesting a potential advantage of LR over NS in real-world inpatient VOC care, but I need to emphasize confounding and the need for randomized confirmation before changing practice broadly [^a10a47c0].

> I will now examine harms from routine fluids to ensure we are not over-treating. Observational cohorts show fluid overload occurs in roughly 20–30% of VOC admissions and is associated with longer hospital stays; importantly, many patients with prior fluid overload did not have their IV fluid orders adjusted, indicating preventable harm and the need for vigilant monitoring and individualized dosing [^120f440f] [^704a7335]. But wait, what if we use fixed-rate protocols like 3 liters per day of saline? That approach has been linked to frequent fluid overload, reinforcing that one-size-fits-all hydration is unsafe in this population [^120f440f].

> Let me consider special scenarios where fluids are clearly indicated and how to choose them. For dehydration or hypovolemia, isotonic crystalloids are appropriate to restore intravascular volume, with some clinicians preferring lactated Ringer's over normal saline when larger volumes are anticipated, given the physiologic rationale and the observational signal, while acknowledging the evidence quality [^a10a47c0] [^839f41bc]. For maintenance in euvolemic patients who cannot take oral fluids, hypotonic dextrose-containing solutions such as dextrose in half-normal saline are commonly used to avoid excess chloride and hyperchloremia, though again this is based on indirect evidence and expert opinion rather than RCTs [^839f41bc] [^e228ca10].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances. Pediatric protocols often use total fluid targets around 3 liters per square meter per 24 hours, combining oral and IV intake, and favor hypotonic dextrose-containing solutions for maintenance; however, even in pediatrics, routine IV fluids without indication are discouraged, and oral hydration should be prioritized when feasible to avoid iatrogenic overload [^e228ca10] [^35324c61].

> I need to ensure we integrate comorbidity risk. Patients with renal dysfunction, heart failure, or pulmonary disease have higher risks of fluid overload; in these cases, fluids should be minimized, used only if clearly indicated, and monitored closely with strict intake and output, daily weights, and serial exams for edema or respiratory compromise [^839f41bc] [^120f440f]. Let me reconsider the default of "gentle hydration"; even that phrase can be misleading if it leads to fixed-rate infusions without reassessment, so I should emphasize dynamic, response-guided titration instead [^120f440f].

> Next, I should review what to do when fluids are not indicated. The cornerstone of VOC management remains rapid, appropriately dosed analgesia with frequent reassessment, NSAIDs when not contraindicated, oxygen for hypoxemia, and monitoring for complications such as acute chest syndrome; routine IV fluids should not substitute for analgesia or delay escalation of pain control [^ae17019e] [^62edaca6] [^5fe6f8bd]. I should double-check that ASH prioritizes analgesia within 1 hour and ongoing reassessment every 30–60 minutes, which is a strong recommendation despite low-certainty evidence due to the certainty of harm from delays [^ae17019e].

> Let me translate this into a practical, risk-stratified approach. If the patient is euvolemic and can take oral fluids, prioritize oral intake and avoid IV fluids; if oral intake is limited, use small-volume, short-duration IV maintenance with hypotonic dextrose-containing solutions and reassess frequently. If dehydrated or hypovolemic, give isotonic crystalloid boluses guided by clinical response, consider LR when larger volumes are anticipated, and transition promptly to oral intake. If high risk for fluid overload, use the lowest effective volume, monitor closely, and be ready to stop or diurese if signs of overload emerge [^f71ab5c0] [^839f41bc] [^a10a47c0].

> I should confirm knowledge gaps and ongoing work. There is an active randomized trial comparing restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in VOC, which may clarify optimal volumes and safety; until then, shared decision-making and individualized care are essential, and clinicians should document rationale and monitoring plans when fluids are used [^46a0961e]. But wait, what if guidelines change soon? Even if new data emerge, the principle of right-sizing fluids to volume status and comorbidity risk is unlikely to change, so dynamic reassessment will remain central [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and evidence-aligned. Routine IV fluids are not recommended for euvolemic patients with VOC; fluids are appropriate for dehydration or when oral intake is inadequate, with a preference for lower-chloride options like lactated Ringer's when larger resuscitation volumes are needed, while maintaining vigilant monitoring for fluid overload and tailoring to comorbidities; the evidence is largely indirect, so shared decision-making and careful reassessment are critical until randomized trials define best practice [^bff47c3a] [^a10a47c0] [^839f41bc] [^120f440f].

---

For sickle cell pain crisis, **routine IV fluids are not recommended** unless there is clinical dehydration or inability to hydrate orally [^bff47c3a] [^f71ab5c0]. If fluids are needed, use **isotonic or mildly hypotonic solutions** (e.g. 0.45% saline with dextrose) and avoid large boluses to reduce the risk of fluid overload and acute chest syndrome [^839f41bc] [^120f440f]. Fluid choice should be individualized, with close monitoring for overload, especially in patients with cardiac or renal comorbidities [^9cfcf844] [^839f41bc].

---

## Pathophysiology and rationale for fluid management

During a VOC, **sickled RBCs obstruct microvessels**, causing ischemia and pain. Dehydration increases plasma osmolality, promotes RBC dehydration, and worsens sickling; thus, hydration is thought to mitigate this. However, **excessive fluids can cause overload**, particularly in patients with cardiac or renal disease, and may precipitate acute chest syndrome (ACS) [^120f440f].

---

## Evidence and guidelines for fluid management

- **ASH 2020 guidelines**: No recommendation for or against routine IV fluids in acute pain crises; fluids may be used for clinically significant dehydration or when oral intake is inadequate [^bff47c3a] [^f71ab5c0].

- **NHLBI 2014 guidelines**: Emphasize rapid analgesia and supportive care; no specific fluid recommendations for VOC.

- **Cochrane review (2007)**: No randomized trials establish optimal route, type, or volume of fluids in VOC, highlighting an evidence gap [^5e2d0f20].

---

## Risks associated with intravenous fluids

IV fluids carry **significant risks** in VOC:

- **Fluid overload**: Common, prolongs hospital stay, and increases risk of ACS [^120f440f] [^704a7335].

- **Acute chest syndrome**: Linked to fluid overload and increased mortality.

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis can occur.

---

## Recommended fluid types and compositions

When fluids are indicated, **the following are recommended**:

| **Fluid type** | **Composition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) | - 154 mmol/L Na+ <br/> - 154 mmol/L Cl- | - Used for dehydration <br/> - Avoid large boluses due to overload risk [^839f41bc] |
| Half-normal saline (0.45% NaCl) with dextrose | - 77 mmol/L Na+ <br/> - 77 mmol/L Cl- <br/> - 2.5–5% dextrose | - Preferred for maintenance <br/> - Lower sodium load <br/> - Dextrose provides calories [^839f41bc] |
| Lactated Ringer's solution | - 130 mmol/L Na+ <br/> - 109 mmol/L Cl- <br/> - 28 mmol/L lactate | - Balanced solution <br/> - May reduce hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis risk [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring intravenous fluids

IV fluids are **indicated** in the following scenarios:

- **Clinically significant dehydration**: Unable to maintain oral intake or excessive losses.

- **Severe pain with vomiting**: Prevents oral hydration.

- **Complications**: Acute chest syndrome, sepsis, or acute kidney injury requiring careful fluid management.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of fluid therapy

Patients receiving IV fluids require **close monitoring**:

- **Vital signs**: Frequent assessment for respiratory distress or hypertension.

- **Fluid balance**: Strict intake/output and daily weights.

- **Electrolytes**: Regular checks for hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic disturbances.

- **Clinical signs**: Watch for edema, crackles, or oxygen requirement suggesting overload [^e228ca10].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Lower fluid volumes (typically 1.5–2 times maintenance) and careful monitoring are essential [^e228ca10].

- **Pregnant patients**: Increased risk of fluid overload; monitor closely [^94e114d5].

- **Renal or cardiac disease**: Use minimal fluids and monitor closely for overload [^839f41bc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine IV fluids**: Not recommended unless clinically indicated [^bff47c3a].

- **Preferred fluids**: Isotonic or mildly hypotonic solutions (e.g. 0.45% saline with dextrose) [^839f41bc].

- **Avoid**: Large boluses and prolonged IV therapy without indication [^120f440f].

- **Monitor**: Closely for fluid overload and adjust therapy accordingly [^839f41bc].

---

Fluid management in sickle cell pain crisis should be **individualized**, with fluids used only when clearly indicated and monitored closely for complications.

The pharmacologic options of pain management in vaso-occlusive crisis

Pain management in vaso-occlusive crisis is equally complex and requires multiple interventions such as pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and preventive therapeutic interventions.–For instance, extra fluids are routinely administered as adjunct treatment, irrespective of the patient's hydration status; this measure aims to retard or stop the sickling process, which helps to achieve pain relief. Although this practice has long been advocated, it is largely not evidence-based and may result in circulatory overload. However, given that dehydration is one of the triggers of vaso-occlusive crisis, administration of fluids in this instance may be beneficial in managing crisis-related pain. Other investigators have also reported the possible efficacy of vitamin D replacement in SCD chronic pain because severe vitamin D deficiency has been observed in adolescents with this morbidity.

Background

Treating vaso-occlusive painful crises in people with sickle cell disease is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids are routinely given as adjunct treatment, regardless of the individual's state of hydration with the aim of slowing or stopping the sickling process and thereby alleviating pain.

Objectives

To determine the optimal route, quantity and type of fluid replacement for people with sickle cell disease with acute painful crises.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted searches of EMBASE, LILACS and the website www. ClinicalTrials.gov. Date of most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: February 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the administration of supplemental fluids adjunctive to analgesics by any route in people with any type of sickle cell disease during an acute painful episode, under medical supervision (inpatient, day care or community).

Data Collection and Analysis

No relevant trials have yet been identified.

Main Results

Sixteen trials were identified by the initial search. Of these, 15 were not suitable for inclusion in this review and one study is awaiting further assessment.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating vaso-occlusive crises is complex and requires multiple interventions. Extra fluids, generally oral or intravenous, are routinely administered during acute painful episodes to people with sickle cell disease regardless of the individual's state of hydration. Reports of their use during these acute painful episodes do not state the efficacy of any single route, type or quantity of fluid compared to another. However, there are no randomized controlled trials that have assessed the safety and efficacy of different routes, types or quantities of fluid. This systematic review identifies the need for a multicentre randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy and possible adverse effects of different routes, types and quantities of fluid administered to people with sickle cell disease during acute painful episodes.

Acute painful episodes are the most common reason for emergency department visits among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Early and aggressive pain management is a priority. Emergency providers (EPs) must also diagnose other emergent diagnoses in patients with SCD and differentiate them from vaso-occlusive crisis. EPs should be aware of cognitive biases that may misdirect the diagnostic process. Administration of intravenous fluids should be used judiciously. Blood transfusion may be considered. Coordination of care with hematology is an important part of the effective emergency department and long-term management of patients with SCD.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^2df50b4c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of inherited hemoglobin disorders that results in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusion, pain, and end organ damage. Surgery in the SCD population requires careful planning, as perioperative stressors can lead to increased sickling and risk of inducing or further exacerbating vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs). Additionally, the underlying hypercoagulability and immunocompromised state due to SCD places patients at increased risk of both venous thromboembolism and infection. Judicious fluid administration, temperature regulation, thorough preoperative and postoperative analgesic planning, and preoperative transfusion are all crucial components of decreasing risks of surgery in patients with SCD.

Sickle cell disease pain guidelines — interpretation of recommendation strength and good practice statements: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests"). For strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, most individuals should follow it, the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, and it is supported by credible research making additional research unlikely to alter its direction. For conditional recommendations, a majority of individuals would want the suggested course but many would not; clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate and help each patient arrive at a decision consistent with their values and preferences; policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders and performance measures should focus on if an appropriate decision-making process is duly documented; and the recommendation is likely to be strengthened by additional research. Good practice statements endorse interventions or practices with unequivocal net benefit, are not based on a systematic review of available evidence, and may be interpreted as strong recommendations; the panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty in the evidence and formulate recommendations.

American Society of Hematology sickle cell disease pain guideline — aims and audience focus on providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate management of acute and chronic pain in individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD), targeting patients and their caregivers, hematologists, general practitioners, internists, emergency medicine providers, and other clinicians and decision makers. Through improved provider and patient education regarding the available evidence and evidence-based recommendations, these guidelines aim to support shared decision making, and because most recommendations are conditional, shared decision making is necessary between patients and providers before a definitive decision on implementation of the considered therapies. These recommendations take into consideration acceptability, feasibility, cost effectiveness, resource use, and impact on health equity, and the panel acknowledged variability in patient and provider knowledge as well as variability in their perceptions of harms vs benefits and other patient-important outcomes when developing these recommendations.

Key points include: Assess for life-threatening complications of sickle cell disease – these patients have significantly higher risk of numerous complications in addition to pain crises, and provide appropriate treatment for pain, respiratory distress, and shock. These patients may have a higher tolerance to narcotic pain medications if they are taking them on a regular basis, these patients will tolerate acute blood loss poorly due to baseline anemia, and patients with sickle cell trait can have acute pain crises in extreme conditions (e.g., heat exhaustion, dehydration) and several college athlete deaths have been linked to sickle cell trait.

### Don't routinely transfuse patients with sickle cell disease for chronic… [^01ee8405]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with sickle cell disease are especially vulnerable to potential harms from unnecessary red blood cell transfusion. In particular, they experience an increased risk of alloimmunization to minor blood group antigens and a high risk of iron overload from repeated transfusions. Patients with the most severe genotypes of sickle cell disease with baseline hemoglobin values in the 7 to 10 g/dL range can usually tolerate further temporary reductions in Hb without developing symptoms of anemia. Many patients with sickle cell disease receive intravenous fluids to improve hydration when hospitalized for management of pain crisis, which may contribute to a decrease in hemoglobin by 1 to 2 g/dL. Routine administration of red blood cells in this setting should be avoided. Moreover, there is no evidence that transfusion reduces pain due to vaso-occlusive crises.

For a discussion of when transfusion is indicated in sickle cell disease, readers are referred to recent evidence-based guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

GENERAL CONSIDERATION

Fluid Management

Fluid management in the SCD population can be complicated by the presence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease and renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction is not always reflected in serum estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and patients with normal serum creatinine values may still have degrees of tubular acidification defects, impaired potassium secretion, and decreased concentrating ability. These impairments increase the risk of dehydration and electrolyte derangements in patients with SCD. Frequent reassessments of serum chemistries and fluid balance status are recommended to avoid both complications in this population. Specifically, underhydration can lead to decreased intravascular volume, which can increase the risk of sickling, and potentially increase the risk of a VOE. On the other hand, overhydration, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, can lead to pulmonary edema and increased risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS). Additionally, prolonged intravenous (IV) fluid use can lead to undesired fluid shifts, and rates of administration should be adjusted when patients have resumed adequate oral intake. Currently, there is no evidence to support an optimal rate or type of fluid. Normal saline (NS) is typically avoided due to in vitro studies suggesting that NS increases sickle red blood cell stiffnessand potentially increases the risk of microvascular occlusion. Additionally, a pediatric emergency room retrospective study found that patients who received NS boluses had poorer pain control; however, this was compared to no bolus rather than to bolus with a different type of fluid. While the use of isotonic balanced crystalloids such as Lactated Ringer's (LR) has been shown to decrease renal complications and risk of death in critically ill adults compared to NS, they have not been thoroughly investigated in the SCD population. Unless giving rapid bolus infusions, it is still recommended to use hypotonic solutions such as dextrose-containing half-NS, rather than isotonic fluids such as NS or LR, for prolonged maintenance fluid therapy given the above limited data in patients with SCD.

In all patients with SCD, we recommend careful monitoring of hydration and electrolyte status with regular chemistries, strict measurement of intake and output, and daily weights. Careful timing of surgery, preferably first case, should be undertaken to avoid prolonged NPO times and prevent intravascular volume depletion.

Temperature Regulation

Cold weather and temperatures have been noted to precipitate VOEs, and patients with SCD may additionally be hypersensitive to warming and cooling. Optimization and thermoregulation with a warmed blanket, optimal operating room temperature, and warmed fluids are recommended.

### Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors [^8d109acd]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute painful vaso‐occlusive crisis (VOC) is one of the clinical hallmarks of sickle cell disease (SCD).VOCs account for the vast majority of SCD‐related hospital admissions and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and negatively impact quality of life., Despite the improvements made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of VOC, its treatment still primarily consists of supportive care. Besides treatment of a potential underlying cause, extra [intravenous (IV)] fluids, (opioid) analgesics, and occasionally oxygen support are part of the treatment of VOC.

Intake of ample fluids or administration of IV fluids is by many perceived as an important part of VOC treatment, as a decrease in body fluid levels is thought to promote and sustain the sickling process. Patients with SCD are particularly prone to dehydration due to multiple factors. Renal concentrating defects as a result of continuous haemolytic and vaso‐occlusive damage of the renal medulla render patients with SCD susceptible to hypovolaemia and dehydration. Additionally, patients with SCD tend to reduce their intake during a period of illness and especially during severe pain. The resulting increased plasma osmolality may lead to red blood cell (RBC) dehydration, thereby contributing to increased sickle haemoglobin (HbS) polymerisation and ultimately vaso‐occlusion.

Specific background — burden and evidence gaps: Noncrisis and chronic pain are common in patients with SCD, particularly among adults, with near-daily pain estimated at > 25% and pain most days at > 50%; current evidence suggests that greater levels of chronic pain are associated with increases in acute pain, and despite some evidence for preventing and treating crisis pain acutely, the treatment of noncrisis and chronic pain in SCD lacks a firm evidence base.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) sickle cell disease — values and preferences: The panel placed a higher value on outcomes related to pain relief and optimizing patient function encompassing improvements in patient-reported outcomes when making recommendations, and strongly considered the balance between benefits and harms for each intervention. Particular attention was paid to both pediatric and adult age groups because evidence was not always available for all ages. The panel placed a lower value on cost.

### Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors [^4162e073]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous research has shown that isotonic saline (NaCl 0·9%) induces increased stiffness of sickle erythrocytes, prolonged transit time and a decreased time to occlusion compared to more balanced fluids with lower osmolality. Additionally, the relatively high concentrations of chloride in NaCl 0·9% may result in iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, resulting in lower pH levels, which can induce HbS polymerisation. Also, (rapid) administration of hypotonic fluids during VOC resulted in improvement of pain and decrease of sickle cells in the circulation. Based on the above‐mentioned evidence, in 2018 the Dutch guideline changed its recommendation of IV‐FT from NaCl 0·9% to NaCl 0·65%. In the present study, we did not detect any differences between patients receiving NaCl 0·9% (before 2018) and NaCl 0·65% (in 2018). However, only a minority of the patients in our present study received NaCl 0·65%, which limited the power of this comparison.

Guideline development methods — clinical questions and evidence review were structured using GRADE: the panel "used an iterative process" that allowed "a maximum of 10 questions to be addressed," selected "outcomes of interest for each question a priori," and "first brainstormed all possible outcomes before rating their relative importance for decision making following the GRADE approach"; for each question, "the Mayo Center prepared a GRADE EtD framework," and systematic reviews "followed the general methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions"; for some topics, "a systematic search identified few or no studies of patients with SCD."

Sickle cell disease pain management — interpretation of strong versus conditional recommendations is outlined for key stakeholders as follows: For patients under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not," whereas under a conditional recommendation "A majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences." For clinicians under a strong recommendation, "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences," while under a conditional recommendation clinicians should "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences." For policymakers, a strong recommendation means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator," whereas a conditional recommendation means "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision making is appropriate." For researchers, a strong recommendation indicates "The recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendation," while a conditional recommendation indicates "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determine the conditional (rather than strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps."

Emergency providers are likely to encounter sickle cell disease-related emergencies. The pathophysiology of emergent complaints are usually related to either an acute anemia or a vasoocclusive crisis. Differentiating between the two is the first step in the workup. Anemic crises must then be differentiated by the source. Vasoocclusive crises must be appropriately treated with aggressive pain management, gentle hydration, and other appropriate adjuncts. Early recognition and treatment are key in providing excellent emergency care to those with sickle cell disease.

In HI countries, VOCs were reported as being most frequently managed by overnight hospitalization (34%); 28%, 24%, and 15% of VOCs were managed at home, in the community, and in the ER, respectively. In LMI countries, VOCs were reported as being most frequently managed by overnight hospitalization (32%), then in the ER (26%), in the community (25%), and at home (17%). The most common reasons for home management of VOCs in HI countries (n = 607) were a patient‐reported poor experience at the hospital or ER (n = 282, 46%), thinking that medical assistance was not necessary (n = 194, 32%), and believing that HCPs do not understand SCD (n = 183, 30%); in LMI countries (n = 278), the most common reasons for home VOC management were that it is too expensive to go to the hospital for every VOC (n = 102, 37%), thinking that medical assistance was not necessary (n = 69, 25%), that patients feel the pain is too severe to leave the house (n = 63, 23%) and a patient‐reported poor experience at the hospital or ER (n = 63, 23%).

The most common VOC management strategies used at home overall (Figure S6; n = 885) were taking fluids (n = 660 [75%]), rest/sleep (n = 654 [74%]), and taking opioid analgesia (n = 509 [58%]).

The most common VOC management strategies at home in HI countries (n = 607) were taking fluids (n = 518, 85%), rest/sleep (n = 507, 84%), and taking opioid analgesia (n = 414, 68%); in LMI countries (n = 278), they were rest/sleep (n = 147, 53%), taking fluids (n = 142, 51%), and use of topical pain medications (n = 127, 46%). 34% (n = 95) of patients in LMI countries managed VOCs at home with opioid analgesia.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) sickle cell disease — chronic transfusion therapy for pain: For adults and children with SCD and recurrent acute pain, the panel suggests against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as a first-line strategy to prevent or reduce recurrent acute pain episodes, with a conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects. In remarks, the panel notes that in unique circumstances when all other measures have failed and when shared decision making can be fully applied, a trial of monthly transfusions may be reasonable; decisions should be individualized and informed by patient preference with education and shared decision making around initiation and cessation; IV access and adherence to chelation and erythrocytapheresis can favor monthly transfusions in exceptional circumstances; and cessation can be associated with other SCD complications, so caution, initiation of other disease-modifying therapies, and increased surveillance are important. For adults and children with chronic pain from SCD, the panel makes no recommendation for or against chronic monthly transfusion therapy as an option for pain management.

### Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors [^120f440f]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on the reduced concentrating capacity of the kidneys in SCD, leakage of fluids from damaged RBCs and the above‐mentioned in vitro evidence, there is sufficient grounds for providing patients with SCD with some degree of FT during VOC. However, current protocols of (IV) FT are not based on strong clinical evidence. Our present study illustrates that IV‐FT of 3 l/24 h is associated with significant complications potentially leading to a longer hospital stay. While a randomised clinical trial comparing various fluid volumes and routes of administration is warranted for future treatment of VOC and more insight in its complications, for the time being we recommend a stronger realisation of fluid overload as a complication of IV‐FT and a personalised approach in patients with SCD during IV‐FT as treatment of VOC.

A limitation of the present study is the retrospective character. Some data regarding (mild) episodes of fluid overload and changes in IV‐FT (volume, type and exact duration) might have been missed. Nonetheless, as all medication and IV fluids are prescribed and registered electronically, we assume that our data are complete. However, we are not informed about the oral intake and fluid output in adult patients, as this is not routinely monitored. Therefore, we were not able to evaluate a potential association between fluid balance and fluid overload. Finally, consecutive admissions of the same patients were included, potentially introducing bias. To minimise this limitation, most analyses were performed in a subset of each patient's first hospitalisation during the study period (in patients without fluid overload) or the first hospitalisation with fluid overload (in patients with fluid overload).

In conclusion, the present study illustrates that fluid overload is a frequently encountered complication of IV‐FT during VOC admissions, suggesting that the volume of hydration therapy as currently recommended by several guidelines might be too high. History of fluid overload, high LDH levels at presentation and top‐up blood transfusion during admission were independently associated with fluid overload. Hydration therapy was not reduced in most patients with a prior history of fluid overload, nor in patients receiving top‐up blood transfusions, indicating a need for more awareness of this complication and personalised fluid management. A prospective randomised study assessing the value of hydration therapy, the best volume and route of administration and its complications is warranted.

### Management of sickle cell disease: summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^24e52f98]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused.

Objective

To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD.

Evidence Review

Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

Findings

Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.

### 2019 sickle cell disease guidelines by the American Society of Hematology: methodology, challenges, and innovations [^2cc72fb5]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) convened 5 guideline panels to develop clinical practice recommendations addressing 5 management areas of highest importance to individuals living with sickle cell disease: pain, cerebrovascular complications, pulmonary and kidney complications, transfusion, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Panels were multidisciplinary and consisted of patient representatives, content experts, and methodologists. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted systematic reviews based on a priori selected questions. In this exposition, we describe the process used by ASH, including the GRADE approach (Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) for rating certainty of the evidence and the GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework. We also describe several unique challenges faced by the guideline panels and the specific innovations and solutions used to address them, including a curriculum to train patients to engage in guideline development, dealing with the opioid crisis, and working with indirect and noncomparative evidence.

The panel reached consensus on 18 recommendations specific to acute and chronic pain that reflect a broad pain management approach encompassing pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions and analgesic delivery. Because of low-certainty evidence and closely balanced benefits and harms, most recommendations are conditional, and patient preferences should drive clinical decisions; randomized controlled trials and comparative-effectiveness studies are needed for chronic opioid therapy, nonopioid therapies, and nonpharmacological interventions.

Remarks state this assumes readily available code team coverage and that more detailed cost analyses may be warranted; they note such facilities tend to be cost effective to the extent they reduce emergency department visits and admissions, although overall acute care utilization may increase, and that most evidence places pain treatment within complex comprehensive care models.

### Sickle cell pain: a critical reappraisal [^6ee0bcb7]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Sickle cell pain includes 3 types: acute recurrent painful crises, chronic pain syndromes, and neuropathic pain. The acute painful crisis is the hallmark of the disease and the most common cause of hospitalization and treatment in the emergency department. It evolves through 4 phases: prodromal, initial, established, and resolving. Each acute painful episode is associated with inflammation that worsens with recurrent episodes, often culminating in serious complications and organ damage, such as acute chest syndrome, multiorgan failure, and sudden death. Three pathophysiologic events operate in unison during the prodromal phase of the crisis: vaso-occlusion, inflammation, and nociception. Aborting the acute painful episode at the prodromal phase could potentially prevent or minimize tissue damage. Our hypothesis is that managing these events with hydration, anti-inflammatory drugs, aggressive analgesia, and possibly vasodilators could abort the crisis and prevent or minimize further damage. Chronic pain syndromes are associated with or accompany avascular necrosis and leg ulcers. Neuropathic pain is not well studied in patients with sickle cell disease but has been modeled in the transgenic sickle mouse. Management of sickle cell pain should be based on its own pathophysiologic mechanisms rather than borrowing guidelines from other nonsickle pain syndromes.

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^93aa34b7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In summary, perioperative planning is critical to reduce risks of surgery in patients with SCD. Preoperatively, careful consideration with regard to timing of surgery, rate and type of IV fluid, and operating room temperature can help decrease the need for prolonged NPO times, risk of underhydration or overhydration with IV fluids, and potential risks of VOE precipitation or volume overload (Figure 3). Patients with SCD and VTE are managed the same as the general population with regard to holding anticoagulation before the procedure, and prompt resumption of anticoagulation (or VTE prophylaxis for those without current VTE disease) is important given the increased risk of postprocedural VTE risk in this population. Intraoperatively, general knowledge of the anesthetic plan and its associated risks aid in planning for possible postprocedure complications, such as hypotension or rebound pain.

Figure 3.
Sickle cell disease-specific perioperative checklist. Adapted from the work by Sanders et al.

Preoperative transfusion is recommended for all patients with SCD who are undergoing surgery that either requires general anesthesia or any moderate anesthesia lasting > 1 hour. This evidence-based recommendation is aimed mainly at reducing the high-mortality postprocedure risk of ACS. Preoperative transfusion should be done on an individualized basis, taking into account the patient's SCD genotype and disease severity, history of antibodies and/or transfusion reactions, risk of surgery, and baseline hemoglobin levels. Extra time may need to be allotted for potential extended phenotyping matching in those patients with a history of alloimmunization, and the associated time it takes to receive matched RBC units for those patients. Preoperative transfusion planning should always be done in conjunction with the patient's primary hematologist to assist with determining whether the patient would benefit from simple or partial exchange transfusion and what hemoglobin level to target posttransfusion.

### Implementing ASH's guidelines for acute medical care for incarcerated children and adults with sickle cell disease [^feadd0b7]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The NHLBI systematic review recommendations for fever management

The management of fever in children and adolescents was not included in the ASH systematic review panel guidelines but had recommendations in the 2014 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines for SCD. The ASH special panel endorses the NHLBI guidelines for fever (≥ 38.5°C), which indicate that clinicians should respond in a timely fashion because fever in a child with SCD represents a potentially life-threatening event that may be associated with sepsis.

The ASH special panel's implementation strategy for fever management in children, adolescents, and adults held in custody

The ASH special panel recommends that fever in a child or adolescent with SCD requires rapid assessment of vital signs and pulse oximetry along with a triage call, per established facility procedures, that would result in communication with the licensed medical provider overseeing the patient's care. The medical provider should address the patient's disposition after the initial triage assessment. Children with SCD and fever should promptly receive a physical examination and have laboratory studies performed to include a complete blood count, reticulocyte count, and blood culture. Blood culture should be drawn before empirical administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics; standard care is to provide the antibiotics within several hours after the onset of the fever because of the concern of septic shock leading to death. The laboratory values must be returned and reviewed promptly to allow for a disposition based on clinical surveillance, laboratory data, and the medical provider's impression of the underlying cause. Acute management of fever associated with acute vaso-occlusive pain, abdominal pain with or without emesis, and increased respiratory rate should be managed at an ED or acute care medical facility outside of the custodial facility unless the custodial facility has physicians accustomed to managing acute care of individuals with SCD, and the ability to begin IV treatments including antibiotics, fluids, and pain medication.

The ASH special panel recommends the same approach for adults as for children regarding assessment, triage, laboratory evaluation with prompt, empirical administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, preferable acute management in an ED or acute medical facility, and communication with the responsible licensed medical provider in the facility. However, the epidemiology of fever and its sequelae in adults is far less well-defined, but there is still a risk of life-threatening complications.

Sickle cell disease pain definitions — Acute pain is defined as "pain that results in an unplanned visit to an acute care setting for treatment," with acute care settings including "ED, day hospital, infusion center, observation unit, acute pain center, or inpatient unit." The panel notes this scope choice because "this definition may not encompass all acute pain that is experienced by individuals, because acute pain is often managed at home." Chronic pain is defined as "reports of ongoing pain present on most days over the past 6 months in either a single location or multiple locations."

### Interventions for treating painful sickle cell crisis during pregnancy [^c809d07b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is a group of genetic haemoglobin disorders. All over the world, about 300,000 children with these disorders are born each year. Acute sickle cell pain episodes are the most common cause of hospitalisation. Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease is associated with an increased incidence of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The painful crisis is a severe complication of this illness, and it requires several interventions: packed red cell transfusion, fluid replacement therapy, analgesic drugs, oxygen therapy and steroids; but the approach is not standardised.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different regimens of packed red cell transfusion, oxygen therapy, fluid replacement therapy, analgesic drugs, and steroids for the treatment of painful sickle cell crisis during pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register (October 2007), LILACS database (1982 to December 2007) and the following web sites: ClinicalTrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) (December 5, 2007); Current Controlled Trials (http://controlled-trials.com/) (December 5, 2007), and Sistema de Información Esencial en Terapéutica y Salud (http://www.icf.uab.es/informacion/Papyrus/sietes.asp) (December 1, 2007). We also handsearched the European Haematology Association conference (June 2007), the American Society of Hematology conference (December 2007) and reference lists of all retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We intended to include randomised clinical trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We intended to summarise data by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies.

Main Results

We could not find any randomised clinical trials on interventions (packed red cell transfusion, oxygen therapy, fluid replacement therapy, analgesic drugs, and steroids) for the treatment of painful sickle cell crisis during pregnancy.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no randomised clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of interventions for treating painful sickle cell crisis during pregnancy. The effects of interventions need to be tested in randomised clinical trials.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^741c2428]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of acute and chronic pain for individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) is a clinical challenge. This reflects the paucity of clinical SCD pain research and limited understanding of the complex biological differences between acute and chronic pain. These issues collectively create barriers to effective, targeted interventions. Optimal pain management requires interdisciplinary care.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines developed by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in pain management decisions for children and adults with SCD.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel, including 2 patient representatives, that was thoroughly vetted to minimize bias from conflicts of interest. The Mayo Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic reviews. Clinical questions and outcomes were prioritized according to importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used, including GRADE evidence-to-decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel reached consensus on 18 recommendations specific to acute and chronic pain. The recommendations reflect a broad pain management approach, encompassing pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions and analgesic delivery.

Conclusions

Because of low-certainty evidence and closely balanced benefits and harms, most recommendations are conditional. Patient preferences should drive clinical decisions. Policymaking, including that by payers, will require substantial debate and input from stakeholders. Randomized controlled trials and comparative-effectiveness studies are needed for chronic opioid therapy, nonopioid therapies, and nonpharmacological interventions.

### Crises in sickle cell disease [^9a65661b]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

In spite of significant strides in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), SCD crises are still responsible for high morbidity and early mortality. While most patients initially seek care in the acute setting for a seemingly uncomplicated pain episode (pain crisis or vaso-occlusive crisis), this initial event is the primary risk factor for potentially life-threatening complications. The pathophysiological basis of these illnesses is end-organ ischemia and infarction combined with the downstream effects of hemolysis that results from red blood cell sickling. These pathological changes can occur acutely and lead to a dramatic clinical presentation, but are frequently superimposed over a milieu of chronic vasculopathy, immune dysregulation, and decreased functional reserve. In the lungs, acute chest syndrome is a particularly ominous lung injury syndrome with a complex pathogenesis and potentially devastating sequelae, but all organ systems can be affected. It is, therefore, critical to understand the SCD patients' susceptibility to acute complications and their risk factors so that they can be recognized promptly and managed effectively. Blood transfusions remain the mainstay of therapy for all severe acute crises. Recommendations and indications for the safest and most efficient implementation of transfusion strategies in the critical care setting are therefore presented and discussed, together with their pitfalls and potential future therapeutic alternatives. In particular, the importance of extended phenotypic red blood cell matching cannot be overemphasized, due to the high prevalence of severe complications from red cell alloimmunization in SCD.

Table II
Characteristics of individual patients during hospital admission (n = 100).

Hospitalisations resulting in fluid overload had a significantly longer duration of hospital stay compared to those not developing fluid overload, at a median (IQR) of 6·0 (4–10) versus 4·0 (3–6) days (P = 0·037). There were no differences in antibiotics use, ACS occurrence, readmission rates or ICU transfers.

Figure 1 shows selected criteria for subgroup analysis of admissions in adult patients with a positive history of fluid overload. IV‐FT was not adjusted in 86% of hospital admissions of adult patients with a documented positive history of fluid overload. Moreover, in 11 (20%) of these hospitalisations, IV‐FT was extended beyond 72 h or > 3 l of IV fluid/24 h was given, mainly due to severe or persistent pain.

Fig 1
The use of intravenous (IV) fluid therapy (FT) during vaso‐occlusive crisis (VOC) in adult patients with a previous history of fluid overload. IV fluid regimen was extracted for all patients and compared to the standard Dutch protocol for adult patients with sickle cell disease: 3 l/24 h of sodium chloride (NaCl) 0·65%, regardless of their concomitant oral intake. a In patients with a positive history of fluid overload, IV‐FT was often not adjusted and in some cases standard IV‐FT protocol was exceeded. a Only adults were included due to the use of a different protocol in paediatric patients. Protocol violation depicts admissions wherein a higher daily fluid volume than 3 l/24 h for 72 h was given, or admissions wherein IV‐FT was continued for > 72 h.

Remarks state that in unique circumstances when all other measures to control recurrent pain episodes have failed (eg, hydroxyurea, other disease-modifying therapies) and when shared decision making can be fully applied, a trial of monthly transfusions may be reasonable; the decision should be influenced primarily by patient preference where patients appreciate the uncertainty in benefit over the burden and risks of monthly transfusion; integration of education and informed shared decision making around initiation and/or cessation of chronic transfusion therapy are important; access and adherence to chelation and erythrocytapheresis are also considerations that could favor monthly transfusions in the exceptional circumstances noted above; and because the cessation of chronic transfusions can be associated with other SCD complications, it is important to ensure evaluation if cessation of chronic transfusion is considered, including initiation of other disease-modifying therapies and increased surveillance.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease: clinical report [^35324c61]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Pain in pediatric sickle cell disease is characterized by unpredictable, severe episodes; many uncomplicated episodes can be managed at home with oral fluids, rest, heat, oral analgesics (using full doses of both mild opioid and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications), comfort measures, and distraction, with nonpharmacologic methods reinforced during acute care visits. When home measures fail, it is essential that patients receive rapid triage, assessment, and aggressive, appropriately monitored parenteral analgesia in medical facilities; for severe pain, parenteral opioids, such as morphine, are indicated and administered by scheduled around-the-clock dosing or patient-controlled analgesia, along with hydration, monitoring of oxygenation and cardiorespiratory status, incentive spirometry, and close observation for complications, particularly acute chest syndrome. It is important to note that transfusion is of no acute benefit for resolution of painful episodes. Patients are particularly at risk for discrimination, delays in addressing, and undertreatment of SCD pain; if pain is present, it is to be treated aggressively, and, if possible, according to a predetermined personalized analgesic plan of care.

Chronic pain management — general comments in sickle cell disease state that the evidence base directly addressing this serious issue is grossly deficient and rectifying this should be a high priority for research in the field. The panel agreed that in practice, the treatment of chronic pain has extended from and mirrored treatment of acute pain in SCD, which is not likely to produce optimal results. These guidelines focused on the evidence base supporting individual interventions for chronic pain in SCD; however, the panel agreed that another important clinical matter is the lack of an integrated, evidence-supported multidisciplinary team model for chronic pain in SCD, and this model would leverage evidence and expertise from multiple disciplines to help patients achieve maximal function and QOL while minimizing risks and interference from treatment; furthermore, research into system barriers and solutions to those barriers is needed to provide the evidence base that can facilitate successful implementation of such a care model.

### How would you treat this patient with acute and chronic pain from sickle cell disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^6473b2a4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease is prevalent in large numbers of patients in the United States and has a significant global impact. Its complications span numerous organs and lead to reduced life expectancy. Acute and chronic sickle cell pain is a common cause of patient suffering. The American Society of Hematology published updated guidelines on management of acute and chronic pain from sickle cell disease in 2019. Several of the recommendations are conditional and leave specific decisions to the treating physician. These include conditional recommendations about the use of ketamine for acute pain and the initiation and discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Here, 2 hematologists discuss these guidelines and make contrasting recommendations for the management of acute and chronic pain for a patient with sickle cell disease.

Strategies to improve pain management

Finally, the modality of analgesic administration is equally important as it can influence treatment outcomes. For example, some authors developed a protocol to determine whether commencement of patient-controlled analgesia in a pediatric ED would reduce the length of time between opioid bolus doses and initiation of patient-controlled analgesia as compared with standard in-patient initiation of patient-controlled analgesia. They also compared patient satisfaction and inpatient length of stay for the two groups. Notably, the authors reported that this protocol not only reduced the time of initiating patient-controlled analgesia in the emergency setting but was also associated with patient preference. Generally, the use of patient-controlled analgesia has positive outcomes for patients in both pain management and satisfaction. It is a method that entails administering parenteral analgesics (especially opioids) through a microprocessor-controlled infusion pump used by patients once pain is felt by them. Patient-controlled analgesia is predicated on the patient's ability to assess the pain intensity and the analgesic potency. At the beginning of pain, the patient activates the dosing system and receives a doctor-programmed analgesic dose, which is followed by activation of a protection system to circumvent overdose.

Furthermore, a report shows that opioid delivery in nebulized form can be an effective modality in the management of acute chest pain in patients with SCD. It has, therefore, been recommended as a preferable alternative in patients with difficult venous access and may more specifically target chest pain. Interestingly, it has been observed that the type of health care personnel administering analgesia in sickle cell patients may also affect treatment outcomes. For instance, a single-center retrospective review of pain-management patterns and outcomes in adult patients admitted for vaso-occlusive crisis revealed that patients managed by hospitalists had shorter duration of admission, and did not have a significant increase in readmission rates when compared with those managed by hematologists. Similarly, nursing knowledge has been reported as fundamental to the reduction of stigma and in the improvement of pain management in SCD, as nurses play a key role in the introduction of evidence-based practice within the clinical setting. A group of researchers also assessed whether a clinical pathway improves the acute management of crisis pain in the pediatric ED. Interesting findings of the study include significant improvements of time interval to first analgesic use from 74 to 42 minutes and to first opioid use from 94 to 46 minutes, and significant increase in the percentage of patients who received ketorolac from 57% to 82%, suggesting that the use of a clinical pathway for vaso-occlusive crisis in this setting can improve important parameters of pain management.

Care delivery models and scope of questions — the panel noted that care delivery of pain treatment, including site of care and protocol for opioid delivery, is vital to optimal outcomes; the emergency department (ED) is the most common site of care for acute pain treatment, but alternative models such as day hospitals and infusion clinics have emerged, prompting evaluation of their impact on outcomes important to patients and of variability in opioid delivery including time to first dose, individualized dosing, and modes such as basal IV opioid infusion or as part of patient-controlled analgesia during hospitalization. The panel agreed that the guideline needed to address both acute and chronic pain, that final recommendations should be distinct for these sub-classes to reflect variation in manifestations and etiology that may require different treatment approaches, and because optimal pain management is interdisciplinary, it addressed opioid therapy, nonopioid pharmacological therapies, nonpharmacological and integrative therapies, and the role of chronic transfusion therapy; there was panel consensus that it was vital to propose all important questions regardless of potentially available data to drive research if deficiencies in the evidence base were identified. Clearly established a priori definitions of acute and chronic pain for individuals living with SCD were integral to the development of the questions and systematic review of the evidence.

### Impact of sickle cell disease on patients' daily lives, symptoms reported, and disease management strategies: results from the international sickle cell world assessment survey (SWAY) [^de8500c8]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, 66% of patients scored 5‐7 on the Likert scale (indicating that they agreed or strongly agreed with a given statement) when reporting that their treatment effectively managed their symptoms (n = 1393/2123) and controlled their SCD (n = 1394/2123). However, patients had concerns about the short‐term (n = 1086/2123 [51%]) and long‐term (n = 1283/2123 [60%]) side effects of their treatments. Patientsʼ concerns over specific side effects were not explored in the survey. Of the patients currently taking any pain management medication (n = 1353), 72% would like an alternative medication (Table S7). Most patients (n = 1507/2145 [70%]: HI, n = 853/1204 [71%]; LMI, n = 654/941 [70%]) were confident (score 5‐7) in the assessment/treatment they received from their HCP (Figure S8): the majority were managed by an SCD specialist (n = 1296 [60%]: HI, n = 849/1204 [71%]; LMI, n = 447/941 [48%]) (Table S8).

The most commonly selected treatment goal was to improve QoL (n = 1187/2145, 55%); selected by 55% (n = 668/1204) of patients in HI countries and 55% (n = 519/941) in LMI countries. Other common treatment goals were to prevent worsening of SCD (n = 930 [43%]: HI, n = 577 [48%]; LMI, n = 353 [38%]), reduce the number of severe pain crises (n = 638 [30%]: HI, n = 386 [32%]; LMI, n = 252 [27%]), improve overall symptoms (n = 618 [29%]: HI, n = 339 [28%]; LMI, n = 279 [30%]), and improve long‐term survival (n = 602 [28%]: HI, n = 338 [28%]; LMI, n = 264 [28%]).

Introduction

Sickle cell disease causes chronic haemolytic anaemia, dactylitis, and painful acute crises. It also increases the risk of stroke, organ damage, bacterial infections, and complications of blood transfusion. In sub-Saharan Africa, up to a third of adults are carriers of the defective sickle cell gene, and 1% to 2% of babies are born with the disease.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: what are the effects of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent sickle cell crisis and other acute complications in people with sickle cell disease? What are the effects of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to treat pain in people with sickle cell crisis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 38 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, antibiotic prophylaxis in children < 5 years of age, antibiotic prophylaxis in children > 5 years of age, aspirin, avoidance of cold environment, blood transfusion, codeine, corticosteroid (with narcotic analgesics), diflunisal, hydration, hydroxyurea, ibuprofen, ketorolac, limiting physical exercise, malaria chemoprophylaxis, morphine (controlled-release oral after initial intravenous bolus, repeated intravenous doses), oxygen, paracetamol, patient-controlled analgesia, pneumococcal vaccines, and rehydration.

### Management of vasoocclusive pain events in sickle cell disease [^575f37a7]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). Vasoocclusive pain events (VOEs) are the primary cause of morbidity and account for most emergency department visits and hospitalizations for patients with SCD in the United States and Europe. The nature of VOE makes its management extremely challenging. There are no large controlled trials of analgesic regimens for VOE, and smaller trials have generally failed to produce an optimal course of therapy. Therefore, treatment recommendations are largely based on expert opinion and anecdotal experience. Although VOEs are not life-threatening, inadequate treatment may result in unnecessary morbidity and life-threatening complications. Health care providers caring for patients with SCD must be well informed about the management of VOE. This continuing medical education article will provide a summary of the management of acute pain events in SCD with particular emphasis on adequate analgesia.

Acute sickle cell pain — indirect evidence on continuous basal opioid infusion plus on-demand patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) derives from postoperative populations, including a meta-analysis that analyzed 14 articles with 402 participants in the basal opioid infusion plus on-demand PCA group and 394 participants in the on-demand opioid via PCA group, with results supporting some concern for increased risk of respiratory depression. Another systematic review and meta-analysis in postoperative children analyzed 7 articles that encompassed 383 participants; five studies reported 12- and 24-hour pain intensity scores in the basal opioid infusion plus on-demand PCA group (n = 108) and in the on-demand opioid via PCA group (n = 95). Basal plus on-demand dosing (n = 174) did not differ from on-demand dosing alone (n = 164) in total opioid consumption, and there were no differences in harm (nausea/vomiting or excessive sedation) in 4 studies reporting these variables. Because these studies consisted primarily of opioid-naive and postoperative patients and may be less relevant to patients with SCD who are likely to be opioid tolerant, the panel did not have evidence on which to base a recommendation and put forth a nonrecommendation for this question.

### Emergency provider analgesic practices and attitudes toward patients with sickle cell disease [^11bfe983]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether emergency provider attitudes and demographics are associated with adherence to national guidelines for the management of acute sickle cell disease pain.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of emergency providers at the 2011 annual American College of Emergency Physicians Scientific Assembly, using a validated instrument to assess provider attitudes and self-reported analgesic practices toward patients with sickle cell disease. Multivariable, relative risk regressions were used to identify factors associated with adherence to guidelines.

Results

There were 722 eligible participants, with a 93% complete response rate. Most providers self-reported adherence to the cornerstones of sickle cell disease pain management, including parenteral opioids (90%) and redosing opioids within 30 minutes if analgesia is inadequate (85%). Self-reported adherence was lower for other recommendations, including use of patient-controlled analgesia, acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hypotonic fluids for euvolemic patients. Emergency providers in the highest quartile of negative attitudes were 20% less likely to redose opioids within 30 minutes for inadequate analgesia (risk ratio 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7 to 0.9). High-volume providers (those who treat more than 1 sickle cell disease patient per week), were less likely to redose opioids within 30 minutes for inadequate analgesia (risk ratio 0.9; 95% CI 0.8 to 0.9). Pediatric providers were 6.6 times more likely to use patient-controlled analgesia for analgesia (95% CI 2.6 to 16.6).

Conclusion

The majority of emergency providers report that they adhere to national guidelines about use of opioids for sickle cell disease-related acute pain episodes. Other recommendations have less penetration. Negative attitudes toward individuals with sickle cell disease are associated with lower adherence to guidelines.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease (SCD) pain guideline — psychological and integrative approaches: Interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), coping skills training, and guided imagery have some evidence base for SCD, although mainly in children and for episodic pain, and cognitive and behavioral pain management strategies should be used in conjunction with other treatments as part of a comprehensive and multimodal pain management plan. The panel notes barriers including time, financial costs, availability, and training of therapists and patient burden, and there is currently a lack of evidence in children; however, some pediatric patients may be using these treatments at home. For adults with SCD who have chronic pain related to SCD, the ASH guideline panel suggests other provider-delivered integrative approaches (eg, massage therapy and acupuncture), and these approaches should be delivered in the context of a comprehensive disease and pain management plan (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Given psychological comorbidities present in the context of pain, it is good practice to routinely screen for depression and anxiety and to perform targeted screening for other psychological comorbidities.

### A novel, effective, and efficient strategy for treating sickle cell vaso-occlusive events in the infusion center setting [^51ca7624]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Sickle cell disease (SCD) describes any of several related genetic disorders that affect nearly 100 000 individuals in the United States and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The most common complication of SCD, a painful vasoocclusive event (VOE), is typically managed in the home with heat, relaxation, and hydration, frequently combined with oral opioid and nonopioid adjuvants.

Patients with VOEs who are unresponsive to home-care pain-management strategies frequently require urgent medical evaluation and treatment with IV opioids delivered at high doses or for prolonged intervals. Guidelines recently published by the American Society of Hematology recommend repeated IV analgesics beginning within 1 hour of patient presentation. In practice, patients who present for emergency department (ED) care are frequently met by long delays until the first administration of analgesic, resulting in rapid progression of the VOE condition and an increased likelihood of inpatient admission. In contrast, patients who are evaluated and managed in hematology/oncology outpatient infusion centers more commonly receive guideline-concordant care with a concomitant reduction in hospital admission., Although the benefit of rapid analgesia in this setting is clear, there is little evidence that directly speaks to other determinants of successful pain management: specifically, the frequency and quantity of second and subsequent opioid doses. There is a critical need for evidence that supports specific pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of painful VOE, with the goal of improving patient response, reducing encounter duration, and decreasing the incidence of therapeutic failures that can lead to ED and/or inpatient admissions.

To streamline patient care and to establish evidence-based pain management strategies for treating acute sickle cell VOEs, we implemented an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Penn Comprehensive Sickle Cell Program (CSCP) and the Hematology-Oncology Evaluation Center (OEC) at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The OEC is a same-day outpatient infusion clinic where advanced practice providers evaluate and manage patients for symptoms related to their specific hematology/oncology conditions. As part of this mission, the OEC cares for patients with sickle cell VOEs who are referred by their Penn CSCP providers. The present study reports early data on a novel treatment paradigm that improves the efficiency of patient care without sacrificing therapeutic effectiveness. Specifically, we hypothesized that administration of IV opioids at 15-minute intervals (short interval), rather than the customary 60-minute intervals (standard interval), would provide adequate analgesia, reduce the total dose of opioids administered, and shorten the duration of the OEC encounter.

ASH 2020 sickle cell disease acute pain — opioid dosing recommendation: For adults and children with sickle cell disease (SCD) presenting to an acute care setting with acute pain for whom opioid therapy is indicated, the panel suggests tailored opioid dosing based on baseline opioid therapy and prior effective therapy; for adults this is a conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty (⊕⊕⊕◯) and for children a conditional recommendation based on low certainty (⊕⊕◯◯). Individualized care plans that include effective medications and doses can be embedded in the electronic medical record to guide dosing, and for a minority of patients frequent acute care treatment using individualized opioid dosing may be ineffective or detrimental to long-term care goals, warranting a more chronic care paradigm. Patient preferences should be incorporated into shared decision-making with education on limitations and harms, and adequate clinical infrastructure including appropriate records, communication between facilities, and a multidisciplinary team is needed to create or update care plans.

### Efficacy of liberal versus restricted IV fluid approach in… [^46a0961e]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Sickle cell disease is a prevalent inherited blood disorder characterized by vaso-occlusive crises, which lead to severe pain and complications. Despite hydration being a cornerstone of VOC management, the optimal fluid strategy remains uncertain. This study evaluates restrictive versus liberal fluid management strategies in patients with acute VOC. This multi-center, open-label, non-inferiority RCT will enroll patients with SCD presenting with acute VOC. Participants will be randomized to either a restrictive or liberal intravenous fluid management protocol. Primary outcome is pain score reduction.

Secondary outcomes include time to pain resolution, ED length of stay, hospital admission rate, cumulative opioid dose, adverse events, acute chest syndrome, incidence of acute kidney injury, revisit rates within 72 hours of ED discharge, need for intensive care or high-dependency unit admission, need for additional interventions, and 28 days overall mortality. Data will be analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. We hypothesize that a restrictive fluid strategy will achieve non-inferior pain control compared to a liberal strategy, while minimizing fluid-related complications. This study will provide evidence to inform clinical guidelines for fluid management in SCD patients experiencing VOCs. This study is a prospective, non-inferiority, open-label, multicenter randomized-controlled trial conducted in the emergency departments of tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia.

The primary objective is to compare two fluid management strategies- restrictive vs. liberal in adult sickle cell disease patients hospitalized for VOC. The study evaluates whether a restrictive fluid approach is non-inferior to a liberal strategy in terms of pain resolution, hospitalization duration, and other clinical outcomes.

### Pharmacological interventions for painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults [^013d343e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders of haemoglobin (Hb) structure in a person who has inherited two mutant globin genes (one from each parent), at least one of which is always the sickle mutation. It is estimated that between 5% and 7% of the world's population are carriers of the mutant Hb gene, and SCD is the most commonly inherited blood disorder. SCD is characterized by distorted sickle-shaped red blood cells. Manifestations of the disease are attributed to either haemolysis (premature red cell destruction) or vaso-occlusion (obstruction of blood flow, the most common manifestation). Shortened lifespans are attributable to serious comorbidities associated with the disease, including renal failure, acute cholecystitis, pulmonary hypertension, aplastic crisis, pulmonary embolus, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and sepsis. Vaso-occlusion can lead to an acute, painful crisis (sickle cell crisis, vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or vaso-occlusive episode). Pain is most often reported in the joints, extremities, back or chest, but it can occur anywhere and can last for several days or weeks. The bone and muscle pain experienced during a sickle cell crisis is both acute and recurrent. Key pharmacological treatments for VOC include opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, and combinations of drugs. Non-pharmacological approaches, such as relaxation, hypnosis, heat, ice and acupuncture, have been used in conjunction to rehydrating the patient and reduce the sickling process.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pharmacological interventions to treat acute painful sickle cell vaso-occlusive crises in adults, in any setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid and LILACS, from inception to September 2019. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and searched online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, controlled, double-blind trials of pharmacological interventions, of any dose and by any route, compared to placebo or any active comparator, for the treatment (not prevention) of painful sickle cell VOC in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. Our primary outcomes were participant-reported pain relief of 50%, or 30%, or greater; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) very much improved, or much or very much improved. Our secondary outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included nine studies with data for 638 VOC events and 594 participants aged 17 to 42 years with SCD presenting to a hospital emergency department in a painful VOC. Three studies investigated a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) compared to placebo. One study compared an opioid with a placebo, two studies compared an opioid with an active comparator, two studies compared an anticoagulant with a placebo, and one study compared a combination of three drugs with a combination of four drugs. Risk of bias across the nine studies varied. Studies were primarily at an unclear risk of selection, performance, and detection bias. Studies were primarily at a high risk of bias for size with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm; two studies had 50 to 199 participants per treatment arm (unclear risk). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The efficacy was uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved, and PGIC much or very much improved (no difference; 1 study, 21 participants; very low-quality evidence). Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the NSAIDs group (16/45 adverse events, 1/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events) and the placebo group (19/45 adverse events, 2/56 serious adverse events, and 1/56 withdrawal due to adverse events). Opioids compared with placebo No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30%, PGIC, or adverse events (any adverse event, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events). Opioids compared with active comparator No data were reported regarding participant-reported pain relief of 50% or 30% or greater. The results were uncertain regarding PGIC very much improved (33% of the opioids group versus 19% of the placebo group). No data were reported regarding PGIC much or very much improved. Very low-quality, uncertain results suggested similar rates of adverse events across both the opioids group (9/66 adverse events, and 0/66 serious adverse events) and the placebo group (7/64 adverse events, 0/66 serious adverse events). No data were reported regarding withdrawal due to adverse events. Quality of the evidence We downgraded the quality of the evidence by three levels to very low-quality because there are too few data to have confidence in results (e.g. too few participants per treatment arm). Where no data were reported for an outcome, we had no evidence to support or refute (quality of the evidence is unknown).

Authors' Conclusions

This review identified only nine studies, with insufficient data for all pharmacological interventions for analysis. The available evidence is very uncertain regarding the efficacy or harm from pharmacological interventions used to treat pain related to sickle cell VOC in adults. This area could benefit most from more high quality, certain evidence, as well as the establishment of suitable registries which record interventions and outcomes for this group of people.

### Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: current paradigm on pain management [^e6be7f5e]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

This narrative review aims to highlight the current paradigm on pain management in sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis. It specifically examines the pathophysiologic mechanisms of sickle cell pain as well as the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of pain management. Recurrent painful episodes constitute the major morbidity in sickle cell disease (SCD). While adolescents and young adults experience mostly acute episodic nociceptive pain, it is now recognized that a significant number of adult patients develop chronic neuropathic and centralized pain. In fact, current evidence points to an age-dependent increase in the frequency of SCD patients with chronic pain. Management of disease-related pain should be based on its pathophysiologic mechanisms instead of using recommendations from other non-SCD pain syndromes. Pain management in vaso-occlusive crisis is complex and requires multiple interventions such as pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and preventive therapeutic interventions. Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of non-opioid and opioid analgesics, and adjuvants – either singly or in combination – depending on the severity of pain. The basic approach is to treat SCD pain symptomatically with escalating doses of non-opioid and opioid analgesics. Given the moderate-to-severe nature of the pain usually experienced in this form of SCD crisis, opioids form the bedrock of pharmacologic treatment. Multimodal analgesia and structured, individualized analgesic regimen appear more effective in achieving better treatment outcomes. Although the current evidence is still limited on the supportive role of cognitive behavioral therapy in pain management, this nonpharmacologic approach is reportedly effective, but needs further exploration as a possible adjunct in analgesia.

### Lactated ringer vs normal saline solution during sickle cell vaso-occlusive episodes… [^a10a47c0]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the comparative effectiveness of lactated Ringer solution vs normal saline for fluid resuscitation in inpatients with sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive episodes. Findings In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, use of lactated Ringer solution was associated with more hospital free-days, shorter hospital length of stay, and lower 30-day readmission risk compared with normal saline. Meaning In a multicenter retrospective cohort study and target trial emulation, patients with sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive episodes who received lactated Ringer solution had small but significant improvements in outcomes compared with patients who received normal saline. Importance. Sickle cell disease, a clinically heterogenous genetic hemoglobinopathy, is characterized by painful vaso-occlusive episodes that can require hospitalization.

Patients admitted with VOEs are often initially resuscitated with normal saline to improve concurrent hypovolemia, despite preclinical evidence that NS may promote erythrocyte sickling. The comparative effectiveness of alternative volume-expanding fluids for resuscitation during VOEs is unclear. Objective To compare the effectiveness of LR to NS fluid resuscitation in patients with SCD and VOEs. Design, Setting, and Participants This multicenter cohort study and target trial emulation included inpatient adults with SCD VOEs who received either LR or NS on hospital day 1. The Premier PINC AI database, a multicenter clinical database including approximately 25% of US hospitalizations was used. The analysis took place between October 6, 2023, and June 20, 2024.

Differences in HFDs between LR and NS were heterogenous based on fluid volume received: among patients who received less than 2 L, there was no difference in LR vs NS; among those who received 2 or more L, LR was superior to NS. Conclusion and Relevance This cohort study found that, compared with NS, LR had a small but significant improvement in HFDs and secondary outcomes including 30-day readmission. These results suggest that, among patients with VOEs in whom clinicians plan to give volume resuscitation fluids on hospital admission, LR should be preferred over NS.

### Exercise and training in sickle cell disease: safety, potential benefits, and recommendations [^fe1affb9]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by complex pathophysiological mechanisms leading to vaso-occlusive crisis, chronic pain, chronic hemolytic anemia, and vascular complications, which require considerations for exercise and physical activity. This review aims to elucidate the safety, potential benefits, and recommendations regarding exercise and training in individuals with SCD. SCD patients are characterized by decreased exercise capacity and tolerance. Acute intense exercise may be accompanied by biological changes (acidosis, increased oxidative stress, and dehydration) that could increase the risk of red blood cell sickling and acute clinical complications. However, recent findings suggest that controlled exercise training is safe and well tolerated by SCD patients and could confer benefits in disease management. Regular endurance exercises of submaximal intensity or exercise interventions incorporating resistance training have been shown to improve cardiorespiratory and muscle function in SCD, which may improve quality of life. Recommendations for exercise prescription in SCD should be based on accurate clinical and functional evaluations, taking into account disease phenotype and cardiorespiratory status at rest and in response to exercise. Exercise programs should include gradual progression, incorporating adequate warm-up, cool-down, and hydration strategies. Exercise training represents promising therapeutic strategy in the management of SCD. It is now time to move through the investigation of long-term biological, physiological, and clinical effects of regular physical activity in SCD patients.

### Fluid overload due to intravenous fluid therapy for vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: incidence and risk factors [^e228ca10]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient selection and definitions

Data were collected in two hospitals in the Netherlands (Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, tertiary SCD hospital, and Flevo Hospital, Almere). Electronic records of patients with SCD [sickle cell anaemia (HbSS), sickle‐haemoglobin C disease (HbSC), HbS‐β 0 thalassaemia (HbSβ 0 ‐thal) and HbS‐β⁺ thalassaemia (HbSβ + ‐thal)] admitted for VOC between September 2016 and September 2018 were screened. The current Dutch guideline recommends 3 l/24 h of NaCl 0·65% in adult patients with SCD during VOC, regardless of their concomitant oral intake. Before 2018, adult patients were primarily treated with NaCl 0·9%. In paediatric patients a total fluid intake (oral + IV NaCl 0·45%/glucose 2·5%) of 3 l/m 2 /24 h is recommended. We will refer to these guidelines as IV‐FT (for VOC) throughout this manuscript. Patients are generally also encouraged to drink actively. A fluid bolus is not given, as is supported by previous data. IV‐FT is tapered or stopped after 72 h. To reliably study IV‐FT per protocol, admissions in which IV‐FT was not started and hospitalisations of < 72 h were excluded. Repetitive admissions of the same patient were allowed for inclusion. For each eligible admission, patient and disease characteristics were collected.

Electronic patient records were reviewed manually by two study physicians to capture all study variables and characteristics. Additionally, several automatic search terms were used to detect cases of fluid overload. If fluid overload was described by the treating physician at the time of hospitalisation, these cases were retrospectively reviewed by the two study physicians to adjudicate a case of fluid overload using a combination of clinical parameters and symptoms. At least one of the following criteria was mandatory: lung oedema on chest X‐ray, weight gain, or increased peripheral oedema. In all cases, these criteria were accompanied by one or more of the following items: signs of lung crackles, dyspnoea and/or oxygen requirement, reduction or stop if IV‐FT and/or treatment with diuretics. In case of doubt by the two reviewing physicians, the episode of presumed fluid overload was not defined as such in this study.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: management of acute and chronic pain [^fdde077c]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology 2020 SCD acute pain — panel considerations for recommendations 2a to 2d emphasize nonopioid options and feasibility: The panel agreed that identifying nonopioid pharmacological treatments that have benefit for the treatment of acute pain in patients with SCD was a priority, and patients and caregivers place a high value on options that may be effective and opioid sparing. The panel discussed lack of perceived efficacy of opioids for acute SCD pain and risks including tolerance, dependence, addiction, and chronic pain. Evidence was largely of low or very low certainty, there were no data on cost effectiveness, and feasibility depends on resource and technical requirements affecting equity and acceptability; for example, some institutions do not allow subanesthetic ketamine infusions on a general medical floor and instead require intensive care unit placement and administration only by pain medicine physicians or anesthesiologists.
