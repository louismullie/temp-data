## Question

What is a physiologic tremor

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what physiologic tremor is, how it differs from enhanced physiologic tremor, and how to distinguish it from pathologic tremors, with attention to mechanisms, measurement, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and universal presence of physiologic tremor. Then, I should verify the typical frequency range and the mechanical versus central components. Next, I will examine what converts physiologic tremor into enhanced physiologic tremor and its diagnostic features. After that, I should compare physiologic tremor with essential tremor and Parkinson's disease tremor. Finally, I will consider measurement tools, clinical implications, and a concise synthesis that ties these points together.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition. Physiologic tremor is the normal, low-amplitude, high-frequency, involuntary oscillation present in all healthy individuals at rest and during action; it is not reported as symptomatic in everyday life and reflects normal neuromuscular physiology rather than disease, which is why distinguishing it from pathologic tremors is essential in clinical practice.

> Wait, let me verify the frequency characteristics before I overgeneralize. I initially thought physiologic tremor is uniformly 8–12 Hz, but hold on, I should double-check because frequency is context dependent; in distal hand muscles, the mechanical component often sits around 8–12 Hz, whereas in the forearm during quiet stance, frequencies in the 3–5 Hz range can be observed, reflecting joint and limb mechanics and measurement context, so I need to correct that oversimplification and emphasize frequency dependence on biomechanics and recording site [^113GGMCZ].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Physiologic tremor arises from two interacting components: a peripheral mechanical component linked to limb and joint inertias and stretch–reflex loops, and a central component comprising rhythmic motor unit firing patterns and spinal–supraspinal oscillations; together they produce a stable, low-amplitude oscillation that is a normal feature of motor control rather than a pathological pacemaker [^111w9mHo].

> Next, I should review what converts physiologic tremor into enhanced physiologic tremor. Enhanced physiologic tremor is a visible, higher-amplitude postural tremor that emerges when normal tremor is amplified by systemic or contextual factors such as anxiety, fatigue, caffeine, thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycemia, catecholamine excess, or medications like beta-agonists, corticosteroids, or calcineurin inhibitors; importantly, it lacks other neurologic signs and typically normalizes when the provoking factor is corrected, which helps distinguish it from primary tremor disorders [^115DhfEt] [^1158NTE1] [^115PP6tN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without objective features. I should confirm the neurophysiological criteria that support enhanced physiologic tremor: a frequency typically above 6 Hz, frequency variability across postural tasks greater than about 1.75 Hz, and a frequency decrease of more than 1 Hz with limb loading; meeting at least two of these three features yields high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for enhanced physiologic tremor and helps separate it from essential tremor and other syndromes [^115gxP9q] [^116ucm16].

> Let me consider how to distinguish physiologic tremor from essential tremor. Essential tremor is a pathologic action tremor with a broader frequency range, often 4–12 Hz, that is typically bilateral, distal, and persistent; unlike physiologic tremor, ET shows corticomuscular coherence and tremor-related cortical activity, and it does not show the marked frequency drop with limb loading that characterizes enhanced physiologic tremor, which are key discriminators at the bedside and with electrophysiology [^114DtLJJ] [^111PrqnJ] [^115gxP9q].

> I need to ensure I differentiate physiologic tremor from Parkinson's disease tremor as well. PD tremor is classically a rest tremor around 3–6 Hz that diminishes with movement and may re-emerge after a delay in posture (re-emergent tremor); by contrast, physiologic tremor is an action phenomenon and lacks the bradykinesia, rigidity, and dopaminergic deficit that define PD, so careful examination of activation conditions and associated signs is crucial [^1158NTE1] [^114naAFH] [^111xzqvP].

> Next, I should review how we measure and quantify tremor in practice. Clinical rating scales capture disability and distribution, while motion transducers and accelerometry quantify frequency and amplitude with greater precision; however, within-subject variability is substantial, so transducers complement rather than replace clinical ratings, and electrophysiology can help adjudicate borderline cases or research questions, including detecting corticomuscular coherence in ET that is not seen in enhanced physiologic tremor [^113ftMMT] [^114DtLJJ].

> But wait, what if the tremor is task-specific or context-dependent; I should double-check for confounders. Physiologic tremor can be modulated by contralateral limb use, attention, and arousal, and in high-precision tasks such as microsurgery, its amplitude at the tool tip can approach or exceed 100 micrometers, which is why robotic assistance is used to filter physiologic tremor and improve accuracy; recognizing these performance-limiting contexts prevents overcalling disease when the substrate is normal physiology [^112aiYcj] [^1117AtLC] [^113ahFpu].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications and synthesize. Physiologic tremor is a universal, low-amplitude, context-dependent oscillation that reflects normal mechanical and central mechanisms; it becomes clinically meaningful when amplified into enhanced physiologic tremor by identifiable systemic or pharmacologic factors, which should prompt targeted history, examination, and reversible-cause management rather than a search for neurodegenerative disease; distinguishing it from ET and PD relies on activation conditions, associated signs, frequency behavior with loading, and, when needed, electrophysiology or imaging of dopaminergic systems [^112U7JpS] [^115DhfEt] [^115gxP9q].

---

Physiologic tremor is the **normal, low-amplitude, high-frequency (8–12 Hz)** [^113GGMCZ] involuntary oscillation present in all healthy individuals [^114aYVCh], typically invisible at rest and visible only with sustained posture or movement [^1158NTE1]. It arises from a combination of **mechanical-reflex and central neural oscillations** [^111w9mHo] and is amplified by anxiety, fatigue, caffeine, or medications [^115FZayg]. Physiologic tremor is distinguished from pathologic tremors by its low amplitude, high frequency, and absence of other neurologic signs; it requires no treatment unless it causes functional impairment, in which case management targets triggers and may include beta-blockers or lifestyle changes [^112U7JpS] [^115DhfEt] [^114fx1H9].

---

## Definition and clinical features

Physiologic tremor is the **normal involuntary oscillation** of body parts, typically the hands and fingers, present in all healthy individuals [^114aYVCh]. It is characterized by:

- **Frequency**: 8–12 Hz, though lower frequencies (3–5 Hz) can occur depending on limb mechanics and measurement context [^113GGMCZ].
- **Amplitude**: Low, often subclinical and visible only under magnification or with sensitive instruments [^112U7JpS].
- **Activation**: Present at rest, accentuated with sustained posture or movement [^112U7JpS].
- **Distribution**: Most commonly affects distal upper limbs, but can involve other body parts [^115DhfEt].

---

## Pathophysiology

Physiologic tremor arises from the interaction of **mechanical-reflex and central neural mechanisms**:

- **Mechanical-reflex component**: Reflects the inherent mechanical properties of muscles and joints, including inertia, elasticity, and damping, combined with stretch reflexes [^111w9mHo].
- **Central neural component**: Generated by rhythmic neural activity within central motor circuits, including spinal and supraspinal oscillators [^111w9mHo].

These components interact to produce a **stable, low-amplitude oscillation** that is typically imperceptible under normal conditions [^115FZayg].

---

## Factors influencing physiologic tremor

Several factors can **amplify physiologic tremor**, making it more noticeable:

| **Factor** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Anxiety, stress | Increased sympathetic activity and muscle tension [^1158NTE1] |
| Fatigue | Reduced muscle endurance and increased instability [^1158NTE1] |
| Caffeine, stimulants | Increased sympathetic activity and excitability [^1158NTE1] |
| Medications (e.g. beta-agonists, antidepressants) | Pharmacological enhancement of tremor amplitude [^114rtP23] |
| Metabolic disturbances (e.g. hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia) | Altered metabolic state affecting neuromuscular function [^111PrqnJ] |

---

## Differentiation from pathological tremors

Physiologic tremor must be **distinguished from pathological tremors**, such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease tremor, and psychogenic tremor [^115FMAEh]. Key distinguishing features include:

| **Feature** | **Physiologic tremor** | **Pathological tremor** |
|-|-|-|
| Amplitude | Low, often invisible | Higher, visible |
| Frequency | 8–12 Hz | Variable, often lower |
| Associated neurological signs | Absent | Present (e.g. bradykinesia, rigidity, dystonia) |
| Response to triggers | Amplified by anxiety, fatigue, caffeine | Less consistent response |
| Treatment | No treatment required unless symptomatic | Specific treatments required |

---

## Clinical significance and management

Physiologic tremor is generally benign and requires **no treatment** [^notfound]. However, if it becomes bothersome or interferes with daily activities, management focuses on identifying and addressing underlying triggers (e.g. anxiety, fatigue, caffeine intake, medications) [^115DhfEt]. In some cases, beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) may be used to reduce tremor amplitude, particularly if anxiety or stress-related factors are present [^114fx1H9].

---

## Measurement and assessment

Physiologic tremor is typically assessed using **clinical observation**, accelerometry, and electromyography (EMG) [^113ftMMT]. Accelerometry provides objective quantification of tremor frequency and amplitude, while EMG helps differentiate physiologic tremor from other movement disorders by analyzing muscle activation patterns [^113ftMMT].

---

Physiologic tremor is a normal, **low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillation** present in all healthy individuals. It arises from the interaction of **mechanical-reflex and central neural mechanisms** and is typically invisible at rest, becoming visible only with sustained posture or movement. Management focuses on identifying and addressing underlying triggers, and **treatment is generally unnecessary** unless the tremor causes functional impairment [^1158NTE1].

### Tremor [^114aYVCh]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Tremor, defined as a rhythmic and involuntary movement of any body part, is the most prevalent movement disorder, affecting millions of people in the United States. All adults have varying degrees of physiological tremor so it is imperative to distinguish physiological tremor from pathological tremor types. Tremor is not inherently dangerous, but it can cause significant disability at home and in the workplace. Common tremors like essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor can be recognized by most clinicians at the early stages for the initiation of disease-specific medical therapies. Less common tremors, such as those induced by drugs or brain lesions, are also important to recognize because they may be more refractory to medical therapies and may require earlier referral to a neurological specialist. In patients with the most progressive and severe tremors that are resistant to medical therapies, surgical interventions are available and typically target deep brain regions with stimulation or lesioning. This Grand Rounds review describes the evaluation and evidence-based management of the most common tremors, essential tremor and Parkinson disease tremor.

### Myogenic tremor-a novel tremor entity [^113GVzNZ]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Tremor is a common neurological symptom with a plethora of potential etiologies. Apart from physiological tremor, the vast majority of tremor syndromes are linked to a pacemaker in the central nervous system (CNS) or, less common, in the peripheral nervous system. Myogenic tremor is a novel tremor entity, first reported in 2019 and believed to originate in the muscle itself. In this review, we describe the clinical properties of myogenic tremor and discuss its presumed pathogenesis on the basis of all of the patient cases published so far.

Recent Findings

Myogenic tremor manifests itself as a high frequency, postural, and kinetic tremor with onset in infancy. To date, only myopathies affecting the contractile elements, in particular myosin and a myosin-associated protein, have been recognized to feature myogenic tremor. The generator of the tremor is believed to be located in the sarcomere, with propagation and amplification of sarcomeric oscillatory activity through CNS reflex loops, similar to neuropathic tremor.

Summary

True myogenic tremor must be distinguished from centrally mediated tremor due to myopathies with central nervous system involvement, i.e., mitochondrial myopathies or myotonic dystrophies. The presence of myogenic tremor strongly points toward a sarcomere-associated mutation and may thus be a valuable clinical tool for the differential diagnosis of myopathies.

### Tremor [^116yt8io]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Tremor, a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of body parts, is the most common movement disorder. Tremors are classified as rest or action tremors. Rest tremor occurs when the affected body part is completely supported against gravity. Action tremors are produced by voluntary muscle contraction and are further divided into postural, isometric, or kinetic tremors. This article describes clinical signs and symptoms of six tremor syndromes, including physiologic tremor, essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, toxic and drug-induced tremor, cerebellar tremor, and psychogenic tremor, and presents a detailed diagnostic approach to tremor. Although new technologies such as positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography are under investigation for possible use in diagnosing specific tremor syndromes, they have no widespread applicability or use at this time. The history and physical examination remain the most important diagnostic tools available to clinicians in identifying and classifying tremor syndromes.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^115FMAEh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although tremor is the most common movement disorder and therefore frequently encountered by neurologists, diagnosing tremor accurately can be challenging. The clinical presentation of a patient with tremor can range from a relatively isolated symptom to a complex syndrome, incorporating multiple signs and symptoms. In 2018, the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published a consensus statement in which a tremor classification along two independent axes is proposed: determination of a clinical syndrome based on clinical features (axis 1), and determination of an aetiology (axis 2). For example, a bilateral upper limb action tremor without other neurological signs is classified as essential tremor (ET) on axis 1. The same patient may have a mutation in a gene that often causes dystonia; this is classified as the aetiology on axis 2. However, the axis 1 diagnosis of ET is not changed until dystonia develops (if it ever does). In the current paper, we propose a practical approach in line with the consensus statement, to aid practising clinicians in diagnosing patients with tremor. While this approach has not been tested yet, it is based on the current literature and in line with the steps taken at our Expertise Centres for Movement Disorders. The first three steps we propose will lead to identification of a clinical syndrome, corresponding to axis 1. The subsequent steps will help in establishing an aetiology where possible (axis 2). Because of its prevalence and diagnostic complexity, we will focus on visible upper limb tremor, and omit discussion of related movement disorders such as palatal tremor and orthostatic tremor. Our aims are to provide organising principles on how to interpret clinical symptoms, and to provide guidelines for diagnostic testing, in which we recommend what is indicated while steering clear from unnecessary investigations. We acknowledge that many of these recommendations are based on expert opinion. This reflects the current state of the field, given that many clinical tremor syndromes lack a gold standard against which clinical signs or ancillary investigations can be tested. A systematic approach to phenotype patients with upper limb tremor will, however, make it easier to test and validate new biomarkers in future research. Our stepwise approach to tremor diagnosis is presented in figure 1.

### Differentiation and diagnosis of tremor [^112U7JpS]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Tremor, an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part, is the most common movement disorder encountered in clinical practice. Rest tremors occur in a body part that is relaxed and completely supported against gravity. Action tremors occur with voluntary contraction of a muscle and can be further subdivided into postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors. All persons have low-amplitude, high-frequency physiologic tremors at rest and during action that are not reported as symptomatic. The most common pathologic tremor is essential tremor. In one-half of cases, it is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and it affects 0.4 to 6 percent of the population. More than 70 percent of patients with Parkinson disease have tremor as the presenting feature. This tremor is typically asymmetric, occurs at rest, and becomes less prominent with voluntary movement. Features consistent with psychogenic tremor are abrupt onset, spontaneous remission, changing tremor characteristics, and extinction with distraction. Other types of tremor are cerebellar, dystonic, drug- or metabolic-induced, and orthostatic. The first step in the evaluation of a patient with tremor is to categorize the tremor based on its activation condition, topographic distribution, and frequency. The diagnosis of tremor is based on clinical information obtained from a thorough history and physical examination. For particularly difficult cases, single-photon emission computed tomography to visualize the integrity of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain may be useful to diagnose Parkinson disease.

### The pathophysiology of tremor [^111w9mHo]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

Tremor is defined as rhythmic oscillatory activity of body parts. Four physiological basic mechanisms for such oscillatory activity have been described: mechanical oscillations; oscillations based on reflexes; oscillations due to central neuronal pacemakers; and oscillations because of disturbed feedforward or feedback loops. New methodological approaches with animal models, positron emission tomography, and mathematical analysis of electromyographic and electroencephalographic signals have provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying specific forms of tremor. Physiological tremor is due to mechanical and central components. Psychogenic tremor is considered to depend on a clonus mechanism and is thus believed to be mediated by reflex mechanisms. Symptomatic palatal tremor is most likely due to rhythmic activity of the inferior olive, and there is much evidence that essential tremor is also generated within the olivocerebellar circuits. Orthostatic tremor is likely to originate in hitherto unidentified brainstem nuclei. Rest tremor of Parkinson's disease is probably generated in the basal ganglia loop, and dystonic tremor may also originate within the basal ganglia. Cerebellar tremor is at least in part caused by a disturbance of the cerebellar feedforward control of voluntary movements, and Holmes' tremor is due to the combination of the mechanisms producing parkinsonian and cerebellar tremor. Neuropathic tremor is believed to be caused by abnormally functioning reflex pathways and a wide variety of causes underlies toxic and drug-induced tremors. The understanding of the pathophysiology of tremor has made significant progress but many hypotheses are not yet based on sufficient data. Modern neurology needs to develop and test such hypotheses, because this is the only way to develop rational medical and surgical therapies.

### Aging, hypertension and physiological tremor: the contribution of the cardioballistic impulse to tremorgenesis in older adults [^111ESa9V]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

For older adults, an increase in physiological tremor is a common motor feature. This increase is believed to primarily reflect a general decline in function of the neuromuscular system. However, given that tremor is derived from a number of intrinsic sources, age-related changes in other physiological functions like the cardiac system may also negatively alter tremor output. The aim of this study was to examine what impact age and increased cardiac input (hypertension) have on physiological tremor. Heart rate, blood pressure, and postural/resting tremor were recorded in three groups; 1) young, healthy adults, 2) old, normotensive adults, and 3) old, hypertensive adults. The results demonstrated that the old hypertensive adults had greater postural tremor compared to the young healthy individuals. Coherence analysis revealed significant coupling between blood pressure-tremor and between heart rate-tremor for all individuals. The strength of this coupling was greatest for the older, hypertensive individuals. Together these results show that, for older adults, the combined effects of age and cardiac disease have the greatest impact on physiological tremor rather than any single factor alone.

### Electrophysiologic transition from physiologic tremor to essential tremor [^114HzvQE]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

We electrophysiologically examined the transition from physiologic tremor to essential tremor in people at risk for familial essential tremor. Two healthy people from different families with hereditary essential tremor were studied on multiple occasions. A 23-year-old man was studied in 1995, 1997, and 2004, and a 44-year-old woman was studied in 1993, 1995, 1997, and 2003. Hand acceleration and forearm electromyographic readings were measured with and without 300-g loading to determine the characteristic frequency-invariant motor unit entrainment of essential tremor. Clinically and electrophysiologically, the man and woman had normal tremor until the last examination, when both exhibited a fine tremulousness in the outstretched hands and frequency-invariant motor unit entrainment at 7.5 and 6.5 Hz, respectively. At no time did either patient exhibit a prominent 8–12 Hz component of physiologic tremor. Essential tremor in young adults may begin at frequencies less than 8–12 Hz, and this electrophysiologic abnormality is detectable when clinical examinations reveal only questionably abnormal tremor. More young adults at risk for essential tremor must be studied to determine whether initial frequencies less than 8 Hz are the rule or the exception. Nevertheless, the data from our 2 patients demonstrate that a prominent 8–12 Hz component of physiologic tremor does not always precede the development of essential tremor; therefore, the origins of essential tremor and the 8–12 Hz component of physiologic tremor may be different.

### Challenges in describing tremor and dystonia [^112Ffco7]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tremor is defined as an oscillatory and rhythmical movement. By contrast, dystonia is defined by sustained or intermittent abnormal postures, repetitive movements, or both. Tremor and dystonia often coexist in the same individual. Sometimes tremor and dystonia occur in the same body region, and sometimes they occur in separate body regions. In other cases, dystonic movements are rapid and repetitive, and they may mimic tremor. The varied clinical phenomenology of dystonia and tremor were recognized in the earliest descriptions of dystonia, and various terms have been used to describe the relationships between tremor and dystonia. The term dystonic tremor was first introduced to distinguish tremor-like movements in dystonia from more common tremors such as essential tremor. Subsequently, the same term was adopted to refer to any combination of dystonia and tremor in the same body region. Both applications of this term continue to be used in the modern literature. Other related terms have also been proposed such as tremor associated with dystonia, tremulous dystonia, dystonia-tremor syndrome, and dystonia with tremor. The proliferation of terms has become confusing, and expert opinion regarding application of these terms is divided, so a group of specialists was assembled to review the terminology and to develop recommendations for a more consistent approach. The group agreed that the term tremor should exclusively refer to rhythmic movements. The group also agreed that repetitive dystonic movements that are grossly arrhythmic should not be labeled with terms that imply they are a type of tremor. Moreover, when tremor and dystonia coexist, it may be clinically more useful to describe them separately, using descriptive terms rather than hybrid terms that imply suspected etiology. Easy-to-use clinical terms are essential, although bedside discrimination of movements may sometimes be challenging. In the future, motion analysis or physiologic measures may aid in the discrimination of movements that remain clinically uncertain.

### Tremor: sorting through the differential diagnosis [^115FZayg]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part. It is the most common movement disorder encountered in primary care. The diagnosis of tremor is based on clinical information obtained from the history and physical examination. The most common tremors in patients presenting to primary care physicians are enhanced physiologic tremor, essential tremor, and parkinsonian tremor. All persons have low-amplitude, high-frequency physiologic tremors at rest and during action that are not reported as symptomatic, but can be enhanced by anxiety, medication use, caffeine intake, or fatigue. Features consistent with psychogenic tremor are abrupt onset, spontaneous remission, changing tremor characteristics, and extinction with distraction. Other types of tremor include cerebellar, dystonic, and drug- or metabolic-induced. The first step in evaluating a patient with tremor is to categorize the tremor based on its activation condition, topographic distribution, and frequency. Resting tremors occur in a body part that is relaxed and completely supported against gravity. Action tremors occur with voluntary contraction of a muscle and can be further subdivided into postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors. The most common pathologic tremor is essential tremor, which affects 0.4% to 6% of the population. In one-half of cases, it is transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion. More than 70% of patients with Parkinson disease have tremor as the presenting feature. This tremor is typically unilateral, occurs at rest, and becomes less prominent with voluntary movement. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, single-photon emission computed tomography can be used to visualize the integrity of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain, and transcranial ultrasonography may be useful to diagnose Parkinson disease.

### Clinical features, pathophysiology, treatment, and controversies of tremor in dystonia [^1162ydwj]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Dystonia and tremor frequently co-occur. In some cases, they have shared biological mechanisms, while in others dystonia and tremor are two comorbid conditions. The term "dystonic tremor" is used to describe tremor in those who have dystonia. Two mutually exclusive definitions of "dystonic tremor" were proposed. According to one definition, dystonic tremor is the tremor in the dystonic body part. An alternate definition of dystonic tremor entails irregular and jerky oscillations that have saw tooth appearance with or without overt dystonia. This paper outlines the differences in two definitions of dystonic tremor and identifies their limitations. Given the diverse views defining "dystonic tremor", this paper will use the term "tremor in dystonia". In addition, we will outline different ways to separate the subtypes of tremor in dystonia. Then we will discuss pathophysiological mechanisms derived from the objective measures and single neuron physiology analyses of tremor in dystonia. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### Two different pathogenetic mechanisms in psychogenic tremor [^111PzRca]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiologic mechanism underlying psychogenic tremor is not clear. Continuous voluntary production of tremor may be uncovered by a positive entrainment of tremor in different limbs. But some patients have tremor ongoing during their waking time which is unlikely to be produced voluntarily. Therefore, nonvoluntary physiologic oscillatory mechanisms must be considered.

Methods

Fifteen patients with psychogenic tremor manifesting in both hands, who were diagnosed using established criteria, were examined. Postural tremor was recorded with accelerometry and electromyography (EMG) while the hands were held against gravity. Power spectral peak frequencies and accelerometric total power as a measure of amplitude were determined. Coherency spectra between the EMG signals from the right and left arm were calculated.

Results

Seven of 15 patients showed a significant coherency between the two hands; the remaining 8 patients maintained independent oscillations. Clinical presentation, tremor frequencies, and amplitudes were not significantly different between the two groups.

Conclusions

Two different pathogenetic mechanisms may play a role in psychogenic tremor. Bilateral voluntary movements are typically coherent. Thus, coherent psychogenic tremor would be in keeping with voluntarily produced oscillations. Absent coherence is an indication of another, possibly nonvoluntary mechanism like clonus or enhanced physiologic tremor.

### New horizons in late-onset essential tremor: a pre-cognitive biomarker of dementia? [^114iHP59]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tremor is defined as an involuntary and rhythmic oscillatory movement of a body part, and may be categorised as rest, postural or kinetic, depending on when it manifests maximally (see Table 1 ;). Tremor disorders are increasingly common with age and reported to affect approximately 17% of adults ≥ 64 years; common causes include essential tremor (ET), Parkinson's disease, dystonia, metabolic disorders, drug-induced tremor and enhanced physiological tremor.

Table 1
Tremor classification (adapted from)

The most common cause of tremor in older adults is ET but, it is increasingly recognised that ET has a high misdiagnosis rate, especially in older adults. The accuracy of clinicians correctly diagnosing ET is only in the range of 50–70%, and it tends to be over-diagnosed rather than missed. Parkinson's disease and dystonic tremor are common causes of erroneous ET diagnoses. Acknowledging this, the 2018 International Movement Disorders Society (MDS) expert consensus statement paper on tremor introduced the term 'ET-Plus' to describe people with ET-like tremor plus additional atypical features such as dystonia, ataxia and cognitive decline. Gait ataxia was previously considered part of the 'typical' ET phenotype but now has been highlighted as an atypical clinical feature. Similarly, an association between cognitive decline and ET was reported in several studies previously, but is now considered an atypical feature in ET. The MDS recommends that clinicians carefully follow up people with ET-Plus as their diagnoses are particularly likely to be revised over time.

### Bilaterally coherent tremor resembling enhanced physiological tremor: report of three cases [^115ELhRj]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

The contribution of the central nervous system to tremor pathogenesis is unclear. Poor side-to-side coherence in physiological, essential, and parkinsonian tremors suggests distinct bilateral generators. By contrast, significant bilateral coherence demonstrated in orthostatic tremor and in enhanced physiological tremor (EPT) in patients with persistent mirror movements favours single or closely linked bilateral oscillators. We describe three patients (aged 21–37 years) who developed unusual bilateral postural and kinetic tremors at 6–13 Hz resembling EPT. The tremor involved all limbs, and in two cases the face or jaw, in the absence of other significant neurological features. Significant side-to-side coherence was demonstrated in each case using cross-correlation of electromyographic recordings from homologous muscle pairs. We postulate that these unusual tremors originate from a single brainstem source or from bilateral oscillators closely linked at or below this level.

### Comparison of clinical vs. electrophysiological methods of diagnosing of essential tremor [^116tjb6h]. Movement Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) may be differentiated from normal or enhanced physiological tremor based on a clinical examination or electrophysiological tests such as quantitative computerized tremor analysis. There have been few head to head comparisons of the two methods. Our objective was to estimate diagnostic agreement between these two methods. Cases and controls underwent a clinical evaluation (interview and videotaped examination) and an electrophysiological evaluation (quantitative computerized tremor analysis using accelerometry and electromyography) on the same day, and diagnoses were independently assigned using clinical vs. electrophysiological criteria. Agreement between diagnoses was assessed with a concordance rate and kappa statistic (kappa). Thirty-two (59.3%) of 54 subjects were diagnosed clinically as ET (possible, probable, or definite), compared with 35 (64.8%) of 54 based on tremor analysis. The concordance rate between the two methods of diagnosis was 94.4% (51 of 54). Kappa was 0.88, indicating a level of agreement between diagnoses that was in the "near perfect" range. All of the subjects who received electrophysiological diagnoses of definite ET also received clinical diagnoses of ET. Conversely, all of the subjects who received clinical diagnoses of definite ET also received electrophysiological diagnoses of ET. The agreement between the clinical and electrophysiological diagnosis of ET was substantial, suggesting that study protocols that were to utilize either technique would arrive at similar diagnostic conclusions. In addition, physiological testing can quantify potentially valuable subclinical measurements as well as detect possible additional cases of ET not diagnosed as such during clinical assessments.

### Physiological and brain mechanisms contributing to postural tremor in aging with and without alcohol use disorder [^113MvXi1]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our search for physiological and brain structural factors contributing to postural tremor during quiet standing in aging and AUD largely supported the three main hypotheses tested: truncal tremor was greater in the AUD than control group and advanced with aging in AUD and control participants but did so at similar rates; AUD men exhibited greater tremor than AUD women; and greater truncal tremor in the AUD men correlated with smaller brain volumes of motor network structures. In addition, greater tremor was related to poorer 2-point pedal discrimination in control men and women and AUD men and to alcohol consumption levels that exceeded NIAAA guideline limits in AUD men estimated from their reported drinking patterns over the year prior to testing. Together, these findings point to both peripheral and central nervous system contributions and recent heavy drinking to postural instability notable in AUD men.

### A generalizable and open-source algorithm for real-life monitoring of tremor in Parkinson's disease [^113GGMCZ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

For its application in continuous, real-life monitoring of tremor, we prioritized high specificity, even at the expense of a slight decrease in sensitivity. A high specificity will limit the amount of false positives, which is important for continuous monitoring given the significant amount of time without tremor. Although our trained classifier combined with filtering by a clinical criterion achieved high specificity, it may not be feasible to eliminate all false positives using gyroscope signals, because we observed several rhythmic activities that closely resembled tremor (examples included e.g. brushing teeth, stirring in a cup of tea, nodding). Besides, the wrist-worn gyroscope sensor may detect subtle physiologic tremor in the forearm. Physiologic tremor is often described as a 8–12 Hz tremor, but its frequency depends on the mechanical characteristics of the joint. The frequency of the unexplained rhythmic, oscillatory signals that were detected as tremor in the control group of PD@Home corresponded to normal forearm tremor at 3–5 Hz.

### Tremor after solid organ transplantation: results from the TransplantLines biobank and cohort study [^111ZWttn]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of tremor in solid organ transplant recipients and characterize the tremor syndrome. We hypothesized that the tremor syndrome best fits an enhanced physiological tremor. By using both clinical and neurophysiological measurements, in contrast to previous literature, and studying the largest population described in the literature to date, we were able to provide a reliable prevalence and diagnosis of the tremor syndrome. This comprehensive approach enables us to further confirm and investigate any potential association with tacrolimus use.

### Essential pitfalls in "essential" tremor [^116Cu73d]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although essential tremor has been considered the most common movement disorder, it has largely remained a diagnosis of exclusion: many tremor and nontremor features must be absent for the clinical diagnosis to stand. The clinical features of "essential tremor" overlap with or may be part of other tremor disorders and, not surprisingly, this prevalent familial disorder has remained without a gene identified, without a consistent natural history, and without an acceptable pathology or pathophysiologic underpinning. The collective evidence suggests that under the rubric of essential tremor there exists multiple unique diseases, some of which represent cerebellar dysfunction, but for which there is no intrinsic "essence" other than a common oscillatory behavior on posture and action. One approach may be to use the term essential tremor only as a transitional node in the deep phenotyping of tremor disorders based on historical, phenomenological, and neurophysiological features to facilitate its etiologic diagnosis or serve for future gene- and biomarker-discovery efforts. This approach deemphasizes essential tremor as a diagnostic entity and facilitates the understanding of the underlying disorders to develop biologically tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Characterization of subclinical tremor in Parkinson's disease [^111ZGAN5]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The physiological or pathological nature of subclinical tremor amplitude in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well established. We analyzed characteristics of resting and postural tremors of subclinical amplitude in 17 patients with idiopathic PD without visible resting tremor, having a postural tremor in their least-affected hand rated 0 (12 subjects) or 1 (5 subjects) on Item 21 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, compared to 17 control subjects matched for age, sex, and handedness. Tremor was recorded at the tip of the index finger using a displacement laser transducer. Overall results show that subclinical resting tremor in PD is significantly different from physiological tremor in terms of amplitude fluctuation, frequency dispersion, harmonic index, and proportional power in 4 to 6 Hz. No significant differences were found for postural tremor. These differences appear to originate mainly from patients with the mixed form of the disease. This study also confirms the preservation of physiological tremor likely originating from a distinct central oscillator in PD. The use of this method in the early and detailed characterization of PD tremors when amplitude is still within normal limits is proposed.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^112ecd6Q]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease is a surprisingly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. The classical triad of motor symptoms includes resting tremor, akinesia and rigidity. However, the expression of these cardinal motor symptoms varies markedly between patients. This review focuses on the occurrence of tremor, a striking example of this phenotypic heterogeneity. While some patients with Parkinson's disease have a prominent and disabling tremor, others never develop this symptom. This observation formed the basis for classifying patients with Parkinson's disease into tremor-dominant and non-tremor subtypes. Moreover, patients with Parkinson's disease can manifest different types of tremor: at rest, with action or postural, including orthostatic. The reason for this marked phenotypic heterogeneity remains unclear. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the expression of tremor could help clarify tremor pathophysiology, and as such offer potential new avenues for symptomatic treatment. Here, we will review some salient clinical features of tremor in Parkinson's disease, discuss recent studies on the pathophysiology of tremor and review a newly proposed model (b) to explain the cerebral mechanisms involved in generating resting tremor in Parkinson's disease.

### Tremor disorders [^112ewQqP]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The pathophysiology of tremor disorders is reviewed in the context of pharmacologic and surgical treatment.

Recent Findings

The anatomical origin and pathophysiologic mechanism of tremorogenic oscillation are unknown for all tremor disorders. Except for Parkinson tremor and rhythmic cortical myoclonus, the discovery of drugs for tremor disorders has been largely serendipitous. The cerebellothalamocortical pathway is involved in essentially all pathologic tremors, and stereotactic destruction or deep brain stimulation of the ventrolateral thalamus has been efficacious in all tremor disorders, despite widely varying tremor pathophysiology. The ventrolateral thalamocortical loop appears to amplify all forms of tremor deleteriously, regardless of origin.

Summary

A better understanding of pathophysiology of the thalamocortical loop in tremorogenesis could lead to better pharmacotherapy for most or all forms of pathologic tremor.

### Cerebellar dysfunction in essential tremor [^115KVhJu]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Few neurophysiological studies have investigated cerebellar function in patients with essential tremor, even though the cerebellum may contribute to tremor generation. Here, we studied cerebellar function in patients with essential tremor using 2 physiological methods.

Methods

Participants were 20 patients with essential tremor and 30 age-matched healthy volunteers, and the results were compared across the groups. We studied motor cortical inhibition using cerebellar magnetic stimulation and prism adaptation.

Results

Both cerebellar inhibition and prism adaptation were affected in patients with essential tremor. The degree of tremor did not correlate with the degree of abnormality in either of the 2 experiments.

Conclusions

The simplest explanation for the present results is that the cerebellum itself, including the Purkinje cells, is involved in essential tremor, which may reflect a primary pathogenic lesion or secondary compensatory physiological phenomenon to an original pathogenic lesion elsewhere. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Tremor after solid organ transplantation: results from the TransplantLines biobank and cohort study [^115gxP9q]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Moreover, three clinical neurophysiological parameters were used to investigate enhanced physiological tremor as the likely phenotype: (i) tremor frequency > 6 Hz, (ii) frequency variability across multiple postural tasks > 1.75 Hz, and (iii) a decrease in tremor frequency of > 1 Hz upon loading of the affected arm. Combination of these features results in a known useful diagnostic scoring tool; presence of two of the three criteria establishes enhanced physiologic tremor with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 94%.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS version 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Normality tests and descriptive statistics were performed. Correlation between tremor amplitude and FTM‐TRS‐C score was assessed using the Spearman rank test. We tested the correlation between tremor amplitude and tacrolimus full blood level using the Spearman rank test, as well as the correlation between tremor amplitude and time since transplantation, age, and polyneuropathy score. A multivariate binominal logistic regression analysis including all transplant recipients was performed with the presence of tremor in a patient as the dependent variable, and tacrolimus full blood level, time since transplantation, and polyneuropathy score as independent variables (predictors). A p ‐value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

### Tremor after solid organ transplantation: results from the TransplantLines biobank and cohort study [^115PP6tN]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering reasons for the development of enhanced physiological tremor in transplantation recipients, medication seems most likely. Organ transplantation recipients are frequently treated with calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which can lead to tremor as a side effect. Tacrolimus is favored over cyclosporine, but has previously been shown to be associated with more tremor. Also in our population, most patients were treated with tacrolimus, higher tacrolimus blood levels were associated with tremor amplitude, and higher tacrolimus blood levels increased the recipients' chances of having a tremor. The negative correlation between tremor amplitude and time since transplantation, the negative correlation between time since transplantation and tacrolimus blood levels, and the finding that time since transplantation had no independent predictive association suggest that the tremor is influenced by medication levels that are tapered in the period after transplantation. As the median time interval since transplantation was 5 years in our population, we speculate that the tremor prevalence in the first year after transplantation is even higher than the 52% that we report in this study. However, the time course would be best investigated with repeated assessments. Calcineurin inhibitors can also give rise to (poly)neuropathy as a side effect, which could lead to the development of neuropathic tremor. Apart from immunosuppressants, we found that the use of other medication with tremor as potential side effect was higher in patients with tremor. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to find evidence for the causality between medication use and tremor. Other tremor‐predisposing or interacting factors may be the patient's underlying illness, comorbidity, and their metabolic state.

### The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease tremor [^111xzqvP]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Tremor is one of the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), and it is characterized by a highly phenomenological heterogeneity. Clinical and experimental observations suggest that tremor in PD cannot be interpreted merely as an expression of dopaminergic denervation of the basal ganglia. Accordingly, other neurotransmitter systems and brain areas are involved. We here review neurochemical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging data as the basis of the presence of a dysfunctional network underlying tremor in PD. We will discuss the role of altered oscillations and synchronization in two partially overlapping central motor circuitries, e.g., the cerebello-thalamo-cortical and the basal ganglia-cortical loops. We will also emphasize the pathophysiological consequences of the abnormal interplay between the two systems. While there are many currently unknown and controversial aspects in the field, we will highlight the possible translational and practical implications of research advances in understanding tremor pathophysiology in PD. A better understanding of this issue is likely facilitating future therapeutic approaches to PD patients based on medications and invasive and non-invasive stimulation techniques.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^115DhfEt]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

A second consideration is whether the clinical phenotype fits the diagnosis of enhanced physiological tremor (EPT). The limbs and head, when unsupported, exhibit slight tremor in every living person, and it is this physiological tremor that is exacerbated in EPT. When taking the patient's history, search for an influence of provoking factors such as anxiety, fatigue, thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycaemia, pheochromocytoma or tremor inducing medication. The typical phenotype consists of a bilateral, distal, mostly postural tremor, which is a little faster than ET, and has a lower amplitude than ET. The diagnosis is confirmed by normalisation of the tremor after management of the provoking condition.

The last group of isolated tremors consists of other isolated tremor syndromes. These syndromes might develop over time into a combined tremor syndrome, for example, primary writing tremor may evolve to dystonic tremor syndrome, or an isolated rest tremor may be precursor of PD. We distinguish four other isolated tremor syndromes:

Isolated rest tremor: rest tremor without other clinical features (such as bradykinesia or dystonia) most commonly occurs in an upper or lower limb or as a hemitremor, but it may occur elsewhere (eg, lips, jaw or tongue). If an isolated rest tremor has the clinical features of a Parkinson tremor (figure 2), nuclear imaging may be considered if there is doubt about the presence or absence of bradykinesia (step 7).
Isolated intention tremor: intention tremor < 5 Hz without localising signs, which is very rare.
Isolated focal tremors (voice, head, jaw, face, others), for example, isolated voice tremor: visible and/or audible tremor of the vocal apparatus (not in the context of dystonia) or isolated head tremor: shaking of the head like yes-yes or no-no, or variable directions, etc.
Isolated task-specific and position-specific tremors (writing, sports, musicians): occur during a specific task or posture (eg, primary writing tremor or yips in golfers).

### Orthostatic tremor: a cerebellar pathology? [^113QXu35]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary orthostatic tremor is a rare condition characterized by singular symptoms including a high frequency 13–18 Hz tremor of the legs and trunk that appears in the standing position, and which is associated with a strong feeling of instability, fear of falling, fatigue, and often pain. Subjective unsteadiness worsens over time, while posturographic measurements reveal an increase of the total sway path without concomitant change of the tremor frequency. Whether impaired balance control is the consequence of a pathological orthostatic tremor or whether the tremor is the response to a primarily abnormal control of balance is still under debate. This latter hypothesis came from the finding that, in healthy humans, postural instability caused by galvanic stimulation or leaning backwards elicited coherent EMG bursts at ∼16 Hz, similar to the orthostatic tremor frequency.

### Robot-assisted tremor control for performance enhancement of retinal microsurgeons [^1117AtLC]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pars plana vitrectomy is a challenging, minimally invasive microsurgical procedure due to its intrinsic manoeuvres and physiological limits that constrain human capability. An important human limitation is physiological hand tremor, which can significantly increase the risk of iatrogenic retinal damage resulting from unintentional manoeuvres that affect anatomical and functional surgical outcomes. The limitations imposed by normal physiological tremor are more evident and challenging during 'micron-scale' manoeuvres such as epiretinal membrane and internal limiting membrane peeling, and delicate procedures requiring coordinated bimanual surgery such as tractional retinal detachment repair. Therefore, over the previous three decades, attention has turned to robot-assisted surgical devices to overcome these challenges. Several systems have been developed to improve microsurgical accuracy by cancelling hand tremor and facilitating faster, safer and more effective microsurgeries. By markedly reducing tremor, microsurgical precision is improved to a level beyond present human capabilities. In conclusion, robotics offers potential advantages over free-hand microsurgery as it is currently performed during ophthalmic surgery and opens the door to a new class of revolutionary microsurgical modalities. The skills transfer that is beyond human capabilities to robotic technology is a logical next step in microsurgical evolution.

Differential Diagnostic Approaches for Tremor

Axis 1 includes tremor characteristics as the position most accentuating the tremor (rest, posture, action) which allows a syndromic approach for a precise classification (Table 2). The most common syndromes presenting with postural tremor are enhanced physiological tremor, essential tremor, and drug-induced tremor. The differential diagnosis must also include dystonic tremor and psychogenic tremor, while metabolic tremor caused by thyrotoxicosis should be considered in any recent-onset postural tremor.

Table 2
Combination of different activation conditions of tremor syndromes

+ +, typically present; +, may be present; +/−, occasionally present. ET: essential tremor; PD: Parkinson's disease

Between essential tremor, dystonic tremor, and PD tremor syndromes, there is gray area in terms of diagnostic as resting and postural tremor may coexist. PD tremor most commonly occurs at rest, when the body part is relaxed and not in use, but can also be seen in the postural position, often referred to as re-emergent tremor. A clinical test can distinguish PD tremor from ET tremor with a fairly high degree of reliability by assessing the suppression of rest tremor during movement.

Also distinguishing dystonic and essential tremor might be challenging in some patients. In the case of an accompanying vocal tremor, laryngoscopy accompanied by a speech specialist might be a useful diagnostic tool, to analyze tremorous vocalizations, to classify different tremors by vocal tremor patterns.

For only few cases, electrophysiological or nuclear medicine methods must be applied going beyond purely clinical diagnostics. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a presynaptic protein used as a biomarker for dopaminergic neurons. Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) with cocaine derivative tracers binding to DAT can be used as a measure of dopamine deficiency. DAT-SPECT shows high selectivity to distinguishing PD and ET.

Certain tremor etiologies allow specific therapeutic approaches. Due to the knowledge of specific pathomechanisms which promote tremor-related syndromes, disease/tremor-modifying approaches are available to treat several tremor etiologies. Examples are listed in Table 3.

### Advantages of robotic assistance over a manual approach in simulated subretinal injections and its relevance for gene therapy [^113ahFpu]. Gene Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Physiologic hand tremor and visual depth resolution are two major limitations for eye surgeons while carrying out high precision tasks. Tremor in dynamic tasks recorded during retinal surgery averages around 100 µm at the tip of an instrument. In static positioning, micro jerks can push the instrument off target by 250 µm or more. Limited depth perception through a microscope decreases the surgeon's ability to perform precision task. Taken together, these observations indicate that surgery aimed at the subretinal space is literally at the limit of human physiology.

Technological innovations can assist surgeons in overcoming physiological limitations, using robotics, precision micromanipulators, and live intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT). Of particular interest to eye surgeons, the Preceyes Surgical System (PSS; Preceyes BV, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) is currently the only robotic-based technology dedicated to ophthalmology that has reached a commercial stage of development. It has been safely and successfully used in humans to peel epiretinal membranes and to subretinally inject recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients with subretinal hemorrhages. PSS is a telemanipulation robotic system designed to filter out a surgeon's tremor and to scale, limit or positionally assist movements of intraocular instruments. This enhances tool-tip positional stability and allows for a placement accuracy of 10 microns or less. A combination with high precision imaging provided by intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) devices or instrument-based OCT systems further enhances the ability to target retinal tissue with precision.

While the requirements for SIs using a robotic-based system are known, an assessment of human performance with and without robotic enhancement has not yet been reported.

In the present paper, we used a state-of-the-art surgical ophthalmic microscope to compare manual and PSS-assisted injections in a newly developed artificial retina model.

DISCUSSION

In this study, our aims were to establish the objective tremor prevalence and the tremor syndrome in patients after solid organ transplantation.

First, we established that at least half of the transplant recipients exhibited tremor after solid organ transplantation (52%). To our knowledge, this is the first large study where tremor prevalence was measured objectively with accelerometry. Previously, the prevalence reported in studies investigating subjective self‐reported tremor ranged from 40% to 79%. Furthermore, two studies assessed tremor prevalence objectively. One study found a tremor prevalence of 69% in a population 126 kidney transplant recipients, but they did not perform clinical neurophysiological tests. Another study described the clinical tremor syndrome and reported an objective tremor prevalence of 60%. However, this study is limited by a small population size of 35 liver transplant recipients. Here, we measured tremor amplitude using accelerometry, and defined the presence of tremor as an amplitude higher than the 95th percentile of what we found in our healthy participants. We believe this method to be a major strength of this study, as it takes into account normal variants of physiological movement in healthy participants and uses this physiological variation to define pathological tremor in an objective way. This way, we were able to establish tremor prevalence objectively using accelerometry in a large population of transplant recipients for the first time.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^112WEWFk]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Tremor in Parkinson's disease has several mysterious features. Clinically, tremor is seen in only three out of four patients with Parkinson's disease, and tremor-dominant patients generally follow a more benign disease course than non-tremor patients. Pathophysiologically, tremor is linked to altered activity in not one, but two distinct circuits: the basal ganglia, which are primarily affected by dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease, and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit, which is also involved in many other tremors. The purpose of this review is to integrate these clinical and pathophysiological features of tremor in Parkinson's disease. We first describe clinical and pathological differences between tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease subtypes, and then summarize recent studies on the pathophysiology of tremor. We also discuss a newly proposed 'dimmer-switch model' that explains tremor as resulting from the combined actions of two circuits: the basal ganglia that trigger tremor episodes and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit that produces the tremor. Finally, we address several important open questions: why resting tremor stops during voluntary movements, why it has a variable response to dopaminergic treatment, why it indicates a benign Parkinson's disease subtype and why its expression decreases with disease progression.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^1122usVM]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Why does resting tremor stop during voluntary movements?

A characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease resting tremor is its decrease during voluntary movements. This feature is routinely used in clinical practice to distinguish resting tremor from other tremor forms, for example from dystonic tremor where a decrease with movement is typically absent. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the interaction between voluntary movements and resting tremor remain unclear. As outlined above, parkinsonian tremor results from altered responses in both the basal ganglia and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. This indicates that voluntary movements may interact with resting tremor in either or both of these circuits.

Clinical Phenotype

Step 1. Is it a movement disorder?

The first step is to distinguish normal, physiological developmental motor patterns and pathological movement disorders. Infantile fidgety movements and startles resembling chorea and myoclonus normally disappear around the age of 3 months. 4 Dystonic‐like features may appear from birth and can persist until the age of 16 years. 4 The development of goal‐directed movements (3–6mo) coincides with the occurrence of ataxic‐like features which can persist until the age of 12 years. 4 It may be difficult to distinguish physiological developmental motor patterns from pathological movement disorders. Children should be monitored to evaluate how the movement pattern develops. In general, physiological patterns will subside with typical psychomotor development. Besides developmental features, other neurological diseases (such as epilepsy) may resemble movement disorders.

Step 2. Classify the movement disorder phenotype and which movement disorder is the most prominent

The second step is to classify the movement disorder phenotype and denote which movement disorder is the most prominent. Clinical clues can be used to distinguish between different movement disorder phenotypes. Movement disorders are classified into three major groups: hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders and ataxia. In children, hyperkinetic movement disorders are more prevalent and include tics, dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor. Hypokinetic movement disorders, including Parkinsonism, are rare in children. Ataxia is not a hypo‐ or hyperkinetic movement disorder, but includes disorganized and poorly executed movements, and is relatively common in children. 5

Hyperkinetic movement disorders

Tics

Tics are defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, non‐rhythmic movements or vocalizations (Video S1, online supporting information; descriptions of the videos are found in Appendix S1, online supporting information). 6 A distinction is made between motor and phonic tics and each is subdivided as simple or complex. Simple motor tics comprise a single muscle or localized muscle group, such as eye blinking. Complex motor tics involve either a cluster of simple actions or a coordinated sequence of movements. Simple phonic tics include sounds and noises such as humming or sniffing, whereas complex phonic tics comprise the repetition of words, syllables, or phrases. Positive clues are a waxing and waning course, worsening by stress or excitement, the report of a premonitory sensation, and brief voluntary suppressibility followed by a rebound. 1, 7

### Clinical and electromyographic examinations of patients with tremor after chronic occupational lead exposure [^114fx1H9]. Occupational Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Tremor is considered to be a clinical sign of patients with chronic lead exposure. However, the type of tremor and its pathophysiological mechanisms are controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical and electromyographic characteristics of tremor in patients with chronic lead exposure. Twenty-three men, 27–49 years old, participated in the study. The tremor activity was detected using surface electrodes from a pair of antagonistic hand muscles. Serum lead concentrations were measured on the day of examination. Our results revealed 12 Hz postural and kinetic tremor, with characteristics of enhanced physiological tremor. Different pathophysiological mechanisms might be responsible for the enhanced physiological tremor of patients with chronic lead exposure. In conclusion, the tremor of patients with chronic lead exposure is an enhanced physiological one. It is probable that this tremor could be influenced by beta-blockers, known to influence the enhanced physiological tremor in anxiety. This will be of benefit for patients disturbed by persistent tremor.

### Prevalence and clinical classification of tremor in elderly – a community-based survey in Brazil [^111Y5KFF]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Prevalence data on different types of tremor among the elderly population are very scarce. The objective of this study was to study the prevalence of tremor in a community-dwelling elderly population in the town of Bambuí, Brazil. The authors studied 1186 inhabitants aged ≥ 64 years. This was a 2-phase study in which all participants who screened positive in a questionnaire for tremor and parkinsonism or who used drugs capable of causing/suppressing tremor were examined. In this population, the prevalence rate was 17.4% for tremor, 7.4% for essential tremor, 5.6% for parkinsonian tremor, 2.8% for enhanced physiological tremor, and 1.6% for other causes. There were no gender differences in prevalence rates for all types. Patients who had Parkinson's disease with tremor were older than those who had essential tremor, whereas patients who had enhanced physiological tremor were significantly younger. The age-specific prevalence of tremor increased with advancing age for both men and women. The prevalence of tremor in the studied population was high and increased with advancing age. Essential tremor, parkinsonian tremor, and enhanced physiological tremor were the most commonly identified causes. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Tremor is a frequent complaint of solid organ transplant recipients. We report on the largest population investigated with clinical neurophysiological methods. Our aim is to objectively establish the tremor prevalence and syndrome in the largest population of solid organ transplant recipients.

Methods

Tremor was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and lung recipients, using accelerometers during rest, postural, and weight‐loaded conditions. The 95th percentile of healthy kidney donors' tremor amplitude was used as the cutoff to determine the presence of tremor in transplant recipients. Tremor frequency, frequency variability, and effect of loading were used to investigate enhanced physiological tremor as the likely tremor syndrome. Impact on activities of daily life was assessed, and correlations with tacrolimus blood levels were investigated.

Results

Tremor was present in 52% of 246 transplant recipients, typically in postural positions. Mean tremor frequency was 6.1 (± 2.0) Hz; mean tremor variability was 2.6 (± 1.8) Hz. A frequency decrease upon loading was found in 83% of patients with tremor. Sixty‐five percent of patients met formal clinical neurophysiological criteria for enhanced physiological tremor. Tremor‐related impairment was present in 55% and correlated with tremor amplitude (ρ = 0.23, p ≤ 0.001). In a binominal regression analysis, tacrolimus blood levels were independently associated with tremor prevalence (p = 0.009).

Conclusions

More than half of solid organ transplant recipients experience a tremor that best fits the syndrome of enhanced physiological tremor. This is the first objective study on tremor that has established a better understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of tremor in a large population of solid organ transplant recipients.

### Amitriptyline enhances the central component of physiological tremor [^114rtP23]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Postural tremor is a regularly encountered side effect of amitriptyline which can be strong enough to cause discontinuation of therapy. The aim was to characterise amitriptyline induced tremor and to assess if the central or reflex component of physiological tremor was modulated by this drug.

Methods

The postural hand tremor was measured in 15 patients on a clinical rating scale, by power spectral analysis of accelerometer, forearm flexor, and extensor EMG before and after the beginning of amitriptyline treatment for major depression or chronic pain syndrome. A coherence analysis between flexor and extensor muscles on the same side was performed.

Results

There was a clinically visible increase in postural tremor in a third of these patients. The tremor amplitude measured by accelerometer total power increased in every patient under amitriptyline. The EMG synchronisation as reflected by significant peaks in the flexor or extensor spectrum generally occurring at higher frequencies (8–18 Hz) than the accelerometric tremor frequencies (6–11 Hz) did not change. The number of patients with a significant flexor-extensor coherence in the 7–15 Hz range increased significantly under amitriptyline, the frequency bands of significant coherence corresponded with the EMG frequencies, and both were independent of changes to the hand's resonant frequency by added inertia.

Conclusions

An enhancement of postural tremor under amitriptyline is a common phenomenon although not always clinically apparent. The increase in EMG-EMG coherence indicates an increased common central drive to the motor units as its frequency is not influenced by peripheral resonance or reflex mechanisms. This is the first account of a drug induced enhancement of the central component of physiological tremor.

INTRODUCTION

Patients who have received a solid organ transplant may report tremor as a bothersome symptom. Clinically, tremor is defined as involuntary, rhythmic movement of a body part. Any limb can be affected, as well as the head and the voice. Many tremor syndromes exist, with a range of clinical features, etiologies, and treatment options. Tremor can have an impact on a patient's daily life, as has been studied most extensively in patients with essential tremor, with complaints ranging from impairment in their ability to handle cutlery, to interference with the use of their phone. Some patients may need to change professions as a consequence. Moreover, as it is such a visible symptom, patients are prone to embarrassment and social disability. Given these findings, it is unsurprising that several studies describe surveys in which patients self‐report tremor in their top 10 most distressing symptoms after kidney or heart transplantation.

The impact of the symptoms, as indicated by patients, warrants further investigation of tremor in organ transplant recipients. Currently, neither the objective prevalence nor the tremor syndrome is completely clear. Although previous efforts have been made, past studies have either been relatively small and specific to certain organs or have lacked proper investigation of the tremor syndrome from a neurological perspective, without the application of clinical neurophysiological methods such as electromyography or accelerometry. Subjective self‐reported tremor prevalence ranges from 40% to 79% in different studies. Two studies employing objective clinical rating scales to investigate prevalence found tremor in 69% of 126 kidney transplant recipients and 60% of 35 liver transplant recipients. The occurrence of tremor among transplant recipients could be attributable to the necessity of calcineurin inhibitor use to prevent graft rejection. Unfortunately, this group of drugs is known to have neurotoxic effects. Therefore, with regard to the tremor syndrome, an enhanced physiological tremor would seem most probable, because this is the most frequent phenotype found in tremor induced by medication. A decrease of the tremor frequency after adding a weight to the affected limb, a feature of enhanced physiological tremor, which was described in a single small study on calcineurin inhibitor‐induced tremor that incorporated accelerometry, also fits this hypothesis. However, a diagnosis of enhanced physiological tremor is best supported by a combination of clinical neurophysiological features, which has not been reported in solid organ transplant recipients yet.

### Tremor after solid organ transplantation: results from the TransplantLines biobank and cohort study [^113hTCWa]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Tremor is a frequent complaint of solid organ transplant recipients. We report on the largest population investigated with clinical neurophysiological methods. Our aim is to objectively establish the tremor prevalence and syndrome in the largest population of solid organ transplant recipients.

Methods

Tremor was measured in heart, kidney, liver, and lung recipients, using accelerometers during rest, postural, and weight-loaded conditions. The 95th percentile of healthy kidney donors' tremor amplitude was used as the cutoff to determine the presence of tremor in transplant recipients. Tremor frequency, frequency variability, and effect of loading were used to investigate enhanced physiological tremor as the likely tremor syndrome. Impact on activities of daily life was assessed, and correlations with tacrolimus blood levels were investigated.

Results

Tremor was present in 52% of 246 transplant recipients, typically in postural positions. Mean tremor frequency was 6.1 (± 2.0) Hz; mean tremor variability was 2.6 (± 1.8) Hz. A frequency decrease upon loading was found in 83% of patients with tremor. Sixty-five percent of patients met formal clinical neurophysiological criteria for enhanced physiological tremor. Tremor-related impairment was present in 55% and correlated with tremor amplitude (ρ = 0.23, p ≤ 0.001). In a binominal regression analysis, tacrolimus blood levels were independently associated with tremor prevalence (p = 0.009).

Conclusions

More than half of solid organ transplant recipients experience a tremor that best fits the syndrome of enhanced physiological tremor. This is the first objective study on tremor that has established a better understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of tremor in a large population of solid organ transplant recipients.

### Managing essential tremor [^112QbxCo]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The management of essential tremor covers two important aspects. The first is diagnostic with the main questions is for accuracy of diagnosis and not to overlook specifically treatable etiologies. A new tremor classification has laid new foundations for this. The second is to understand and interpret the needs of the patient. The spectrum of complaints varies considerably from patient to patient. Essential tremor (ET) is a lifelong lasting syndrome and young patients may have different demands than the elderly. Essential tremor is a progressive syndrome and patients early during the course of the disease may have different problems from those with advanced ET. Men and female can both have essential tremor but the complaints may differ for them. For all these aspects, it is important to know about the spectrum of manifestations of the condition but also about the ways to measure tremor severity and complaints. The selection of treatment is critically depending on the knowledge of these subjective complaints.

### Essential tremor, deceptively simple [^116DLJ5M]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of essential tremor appears deceptively simple. However, isolated mild tremor may be difficult to classify, and if the patients have any additional features the diagnosis is more difficult. Management can be challenging, despite the numerous treatments available, because so many patients are not benefited adequately and some not at all. However, as we gain a better understanding of the disorder, more effective therapies with fewer adverse effects are sure to follow.

### TACS motor system effects can be caused by transcutaneous stimulation of peripheral nerves [^113Wj7ho]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4
tACS entrainment of physiological and pathological tremor. Effects of focused tACS applied over the motor cortex physiological tremor were tested for three amplitude conditions (OFF, LOW and HIGH) and two topical scalp anesthesia conditions — no anesthesia (blue) and with anesthesia (red). The top two rows show phase-difference histograms and corresponding phase locking values (PLVs) that, in this experiment, quantify the amount of tremor entrainment. The top row shows that increasing tACS amplitude caused an increase in tremor entrainment in one example subject during the no anesthesia condition. The next row shows data from the same subject when the contribution from transcutaneous stimulation of peripheral nerves in the skin was reduced using topical anesthesia. In this condition, increasing stimulation amplitude does not increase tremor entrainment. The gray lines show the smoothed version of the histogram bin values and serve only to highlight the contour. The panel in the third row shows the mean PLV for each condition for all subjects (n = 12). Individual data points (averaged over three repetitions) from the same subject are shown as gray dots and connected with a line. Error bars show the confidence intervals. Significantly different conditions (exploratory post-hoc testing) are indicated with a star. The bottom left panel shows each individual data point (repetitions not averaged), with the gray circles indicating the examples shown in the top two rows. The trend lines were calculated by fitting a linear mixed model to the PLV data and using amplitude and anesthesia as predictors. As expected, increasing stimulation amplitude causes a significant increase in tremor entrainment (p < 0.001). Interestingly, anesthetizing the scalp causes a significant decrease in tremor entrainment (p = 0.020). The center and right panels on the bottom row show data from a similar experiment on 12 essential tremor patients with two amplitude conditions (OFF and ON). In the group that received no topical anesthesia (n = 6, center panel), motor cortex tACS entrained pathological tremor. In the group that did receive topical anesthesia (n = 6, right panel), motor cortex tACS did not entrain pathological tremor (one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank). Individual patient data points (averaged over five repetitions) are shown as dots and lines connect the same subject. Error bars show confidence intervals

### Essential tremor pathology: neurodegeneration and reorganization of neuronal connections [^1127SY68]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is the most common tremor disorder globally and is characterized by kinetic tremor of the upper limbs, although other clinical features can also occur. Postmortem studies are a particularly important avenue for advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of ET; however, until recently, the number of such studies has been limited. Several recent postmortem studies have made important contributions to our understanding of the pathological changes that take place in ET. These studies identified abnormalities in the cerebellum, which primarily affected Purkinje cells (PCs), basket cells and climbing fibres, in individuals with ET. We suggest that some of these pathological changes (for example, focal PC axonal swellings, swellings in and regression of the PC dendritic arbor and PC death) are likely to be primary and degenerative. By contrast, other changes, such as an increase in PC recurrent axonal collateral formation and hypertrophy of GABAergic basket cell axonal processes, could be compensatory responses to restore cerebellar GABAergic tone and cerebellar cortical inhibitory efficacy. Such compensatory responses are likely to be insufficient, enabling the disease to progress. Here, we review the results of recent postmortem studies of ET and attempt to place these findings into an anatomical-physiological disease model.

### Essential tremor-plus: a controversial new concept [^116gX3w4]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

In addition to redefining essential tremor (ET), the 2018 consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society on tremor coined a new term: essential tremor-plus (ET-plus). This term is uncertainly defined as tremor with the characteristics of ET, with additional neurological signs of uncertain clinical significance. If ET-plus had been defined on the basis of a difference in underlying pathology or an appreciable difference in prognosis, it would have a valid, scientific rationale, as does the term Parkinson-plus. However, there is no such evidence, so the basis for the term is questionable. In fact, ET-plus might only represent a state condition (ie, patients with ET might develop these additional clinical features when the disease is at a more advanced stage). We caution against coining new terms that are not supported by a firm scientific basis and encourage research into the creation of essential tremor subsets that are defined with respect to differences in underlying causes or pathophysiology.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^117F3D23]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Why does tremor indicate a benign Parkinson's disease subtype?

We have reviewed and discussed several clinical and pathophysiological differences between tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease subtypes. We suggest that pallidal dopamine depletion is related to tremor, while other pathophysiological markers could explain a more benign disease course. First, there is converging evidence from post-mortem and nuclear imaging studies that patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease have relatively benign nigrostriatal degeneration. This may explain why other features of Parkinson's disease also take a more benign course in tremor-dominant patients. Second, there is post-mortem evidence that patients with non-tremor Parkinson's disease have more cortical lesions than patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease, and this may explain the worse cognitive dysfunction of patients with non-tremor Parkinson's disease. Appearance of such cortical lesions with advancing disease may also explain why tremor can diminish or even disappear after several years in some patients, because the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit now becomes damaged. Finally, resting tremor may emerge as a collateral effect of cerebral mechanisms that compensate for pathophysiological changes producing akinesia. Voluntary movement arises in phase with the tremor, suggesting that the tremor may facilitate the ability to initiate movement in the face of akinesia. This possibility finds support in the fact that — in MPTP primate models of Parkinson's disease — tremor usually appears several days after akinesia and rigidity, i.e. its appearance coincides with the time when compensatory mechanisms are presumably being activated. This does not yet prove any causal relationship, but one possibility is that such compensatory changes — for example in the motor cortex and cerebellum — may render these regions more susceptible to pathological influences (tremor triggers) from the basal ganglia. For example, a study that used transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses to probe the excitability of the primary motor cortex showed that, when tested at rest, the slope of the input–output relationship between stimulus intensity and response size is steeper in patients with Parkinson's disease than in controls. Although this could be the result of a primary basal ganglia deficit (loss of normal inhibition), it could also reflect an attempt to cortically compensate for the slow recruitment of commands to move, by making it easier to recruit activity from a resting state. Similarly, increased activity of the cerebellum during movements has been observed frequently in Parkinson's disease — perhaps to compensate for dysfunction of dopamine-dependent circuits. The increased cerebellar activity may sensitize the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit to perturbing influences from the basal ganglia, resulting in tremor. This suggests that a combination of basal ganglia pathology (i.e. pallidal dopamine depletion) and compensation in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit leads to tremor, explaining why tremor and a benign disease course are seen in the same patients.

### Physiological mechanisms of thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus stimulation for tremor suppression [^113Ss9KA]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tremor is characterized by involuntary rhythmic muscle contractions that can occur in one or more body parts. It can occur alone as in essential tremor, or with other motor symptoms as in Parkinson's disease and occasionally dystonia. Essential tremor is currently the most prevalent movement disorder in man, and three of four patients with Parkinson's disease develop tremor at some point during the disease process. In Parkinson's disease, tremor is typically present at rest, while essential tremor patients possess postural or kinetic tremor. Tremor is regarded as the most difficult to treat symptom of Parkinson's disease as it may not respond well to dopamine replacement therapy, and essential tremor has also proven quite intractable to treat pharmaceutically in a subset of patients. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) is an efficacious and reversible standard of care that has largely replaced Vim thalamotomy for the amelioration of tremor. Numerous studies have supported the central origin of tremor by hypothesizing the presence of a single pathological oscillation frequency between 4 and 6 Hz.

### Tremor after solid organ transplantation: results from the TransplantLines biobank and cohort study [^113irbFE]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In terms of subjective measures, half of the transplant recipients reported impairments in daily life due to tremor, which is in line with previous reports. There was a weak correlation between mean tremor amplitude and impairment score (FTM‐TRS‐C). This is not surprising, as correlations between objective clinician‐based measures and subjective patient‐based measures of tremor are known to be limited. Our finding once again stresses the importance of incorporating both objective and subjective methods when assessing tremor severity.

Second, a picture emerges regarding the tremor syndrome, with several aspects fitting the syndrome of enhanced physiological tremor. First of all, tremor after organ transplantation can be classified as a postural tremor, not a rest tremor. Admittedly, the mean tremor frequency of 6.1 Hz is lower than expected in enhanced physiological tremor. However, we did find tremor frequency to be variable across different postural positions, which does not fit with a stable central oscillator but is compatible with the peripheral machinal reflex component of enhanced physiological tremor. A frequency decrease upon loading, which again indicates an influenceable peripheral reflex component, was found in 83% of patients who had tremor. Together, these characteristics fit the tremor syndrome of enhanced physiological tremor. Formally, the majority of patients (65%) satisfy a set of clinical neurophysiological criteria for enhanced physiological tremor. Out of interest, we performed a subanalysis of the patients who did not meet these criteria. In summary, we found the same profile of postural rather than rest tremor, but with significantly lower tremor frequency (median = 4.6 Hz) and frequency variability (median = 0.9 Hz). Although we realize this is to some extent to be expected given the criteria that separate the EPT− and EPT+ groups, the low tremor frequency stands out. This could fit with neuropathic tremor, in which low frequencies between 3 and 6 Hz are described, as a second tremor syndrome encountered after solid organ transplantation. We were unable to substantiate this hypothesis with a higher polyneuropathy score in these patients, however, as this subjective questionnaire is not validated in transplant recipients, and a previous study found no correlation between subjective and objective polyneuropathy data, neuropathic tremor remains a possibility to be explored in future clinical studies.

### Physiological mechanisms of thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus stimulation for tremor suppression [^114u4WqY]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Ventral intermediate thalamic stimulation is effective in treating essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease, but its precise mechanism of action is unclear. Milosevic et al. show that thalamic inhibition of neuronal firing is necessary for tremor reduction, suggesting that the thalamus acts as a filter for uncoupling central and peripheral tremor networks.

### Physiological and brain mechanisms contributing to postural tremor in aging with and without alcohol use disorder [^114361U3]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Early studies classified postural tremor by frequency and either presumed or measured brain lesion site as the anterior superior vermis of the cerebellum. Of relevance to AUD, truncal tremor, which is associated with anterior cerebellum integrity, a common site of volume deficit and Purkinje cell shrinkage, was pronounced in the 2–5 Hz range. This pattern comports with other studies of non-AUD patients who showed evidence of 3–10 Hz axial postural tremor with suspected pathology of cerebellar outflow pathways.

More recently, application of transmagnetic brain stimulation (TMS) to the left primary motor cortex reduced tremor intensity and improved postural control in all 8 patients examined with orthostatic tremor. The speculation was that TMS disrupted a faulty cerebellar-thalamic-cortical network that caused the tremor, thus invoking a multi-site source of postural instability (cf.). Consistent with this characterization of postural control, we have observed greater tremor during quiet standing while engaged in mental arithmetic in men with AUD than control men or women or women with AUD. We further found a dissociation between local tissue diffusivity, measured with MR diffusion tensor imaging, and tremor frequency exhibited by AUD men but not AUD women or controls. Specifically, greater tremor velocity in the 2–5 Hz range correlated with higher diffusivity in cerebellar and superior cingulate bundle white matter tracts, whereas greater tremor velocity in the 5–7 Hz range correlated with higher diffusivity in the motor cortex and internal capsule. Remaining to be examined are potential relations between alcohol-associated truncal tremor and regional brain volumes of these tremorgenic networks and whether the severity of tremor advances with age or is associated with evidence of pedal somatosensory impairment (cf.).

Accordingly, here we investigated physiological and brain structural factors that may contribute to a mechanistic understanding of postural instability during quiet standing in AUD and tested three hypotheses: truncal tremor would be greater in an AUD than a control group and would accelerate with aging; AUD men would exhibit greater tremor than AUD women; and greater truncal tremor in the AUD men would be related to smaller brain volumes in motor network structures measured with MRI.

### Essential tremor [^114Vn2eM]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological diseases; although it is a disease about which we are only beginning to develop an understanding. Effective treatment options for the disorder are severely limited. The traditional view of ET as a benign, familial, monosymptomatic disorder is being replaced by one of ET as a disease or family of diseases with aetiological, clinical, and pathological heterogeneity. Recent identification of putative environmental toxins linked to ET provide hope for disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to risk factors. Pathological and genetic studies will yield new insights into disease pathogenesis and mechanisms, which may result in the development of more effective symptomatic therapies developed with an understanding of the disease biology. These insights also have the potential to form the basis for neuroprotective therapies.

### Consensus statement on the classification of tremors. from the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society [^115LtVqJ]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.

Objectives

Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.

Methods

Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: "tremor", "tremor disorders", "essential tremor", "dystonic tremor", and "classification" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.

Results

Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.

Conclusions

This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^1178BPMP]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

The distinction between these different tremors is not always visible to the naked eye. For example, resting tremor can re-emerge during postural holding, making it difficult to clinically distinguish it from essential tremor. This distinction can be made by focusing on the delay between adopting a posture and the emergence of tremor: in essential tremor there is no delay, while Parkinson's disease resting tremor re-emerges after a few seconds (on average ± 10 s). Since the frequency of re-emergent and resting tremor can be similar, it has been hypothesized that both tremors share a similar pathophysiological mechanism. One interesting patient with Parkinson's disease had no resting tremor, but a marked 3–6 Hz postural tremor that occurred after a delay of 2–4 s following postural holding, thus resembling re-emergent tremor. Such observations point to heterogeneity in the circumstances under which the classical Parkinson's disease 'resting' tremor occurs.

In the following sections, we will mainly focus on the classic resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. We will first describe the clinical and cerebral differences between patients with tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease. Then we will detail how these differences may inform us about the causes and consequences of Parkinson's disease resting tremor.

### TACS motor system effects can be caused by transcutaneous stimulation of peripheral nerves [^117KQT3P]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Experiment 2 — block the transcutaneous mechanism in humans

tACS can entrain both pathologicaland enhanced physiological tremor, and has been shown to reduce pathological tremor amplitude in Parkinson's disease patients. The tacit assumption is that these effects are caused by transcranial stimulation of cortical neurons. We wanted to test this assumption by using a topical skin anesthetic (lidocaine/prilocaine topical cream) to reduce any potential contribution from transcutaneous stimulation of peripheral nerves. Topical anesthetics block sodium channels in peripheral nerves in the skin, thereby stabilizing the membrane potential and increasing the threshold for firing an action potential.

In Experiment 2A, we tested 12 healthy volunteers (three female, mean 27 ± 4 years old, ± indicates standard deviation). We caused enhanced physiological tremor by asking the subjects to rest their wrist on a table with fingers spread. We applied tACS, matched to the individual's tremor frequency (8.70 ± 0.62 Hz), at three different amplitudes (OFF, LOW and HIGH) over the motor cortex using a focused montage. Mean stimulation peak-amplitudes (not peak-to-peak), across all subjects, in LOW and HIGH condition were 0.588 ± 0.267 mA and 2.192 ± 0.499 mA, respectively (see Supplementary Table 4 for more details). A focused montage was chosen because it limits the spread of current to other cranial nerves such as the optic nerve, and it is known that both visual and electrical stimulation of the optic nerve also causes neural entrainment. Tremor was measured via an accelerometer to the volunteer's middle finger. To measure how much tACS entrains, tremor histograms showing the phase difference between the tACS and tremor signal were calculated for each amplitude condition. During the OFF condition, a simulated tACS signal was used. PLVs were then used to quantify tremor entrainment. Finally, to examine the contribution of the transcutaneous stimulation a local anesthetic was applied to the scalp area under the electrodes. The effect of tACS at each of the three stimulation amplitudes (OFF, LOW and HIGH) on tremor entrainment were measured in each volunteer during two sessions (on two different days) — one with skin anesthesia and one without — using a double blinded, randomized, crossover design. During each session, three repetitions for each amplitude condition were collected.

### Isolated cervical dystonia: diagnosis and classification [^114SsSXg]. Movement Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

The Problem of Isolated Head Tremor

Although dystonia and tremor are considered distinct disorders, they are closely related. In iCD, it is commonly observed that tremor is part of the overall motor phenomenology, as also observed in other dystonia types. The expressions "dystonic tremor" and "tremor associated with dystonia" were introduced to describe cases where tremor manifests in a body part affected by dystonia versus body parts different from the ones affected by dystonia. Although both types of tremor have been recognized in patients with iCD, early observations have also noted that horizontal ("no-no") and less commonly vertical ("yes-yes") tremor can occur in isolation in these patients.

The term isolated head tremor (iHT) indicates an involuntary oscillatory movement of the head without dystonic postures, or other systemic or neurological features. According to the current classification of tremors, iHT causes oscillations of the head in yes-yes, no-no, or variable directions, with no tremor in other body parts. The relative frequency of the different directional components, which may also coexist, has not been ascertained. iHT can persist as an isolated focal head tremor, evolve to iCD (in ~75% of cases within 5 years form onset), or to ET. Oscillations can be regular or jerky and there is no current consensus on physiological measures that are specific or diagnostic.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^111dCsha]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Myoclonus

Myoclonus can be the symptom of a wide variety of acquired and genetic disorders. A (sub‐)acute onset and fast progression points towards acquired causes, whereas young‐onset and a slow progressive course is more characteristic of a genetic disorder. The most common acquired causes include drug‐induced, metabolic derangements, infection, or auto‐immune disorders. In genetic disorders, myoclonus is often accompanied by ataxia, dystonia, or other movement disorders. Isolated myoclonic jerks can be seen in epileptic encephalopathies and familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy; for a comprehensive overview of genetic myoclonus disorders, see van der Veen et al. 22 A diagnostic approach to patients with myoclonus can be found in Zutt et al. 23

Stereotypies

Causes of stereotypies can be divided into four groups. Physiological and primary stereotypies are seen during typical development and they will disappear over time. Secondary stereotypies are seen in children with a variety of underlying disorders, such as developmental delay, autism, (para)infectious, paraneoplastic, auto‐immune, drug induced, or they are due to sensory deprivation. Only in rare cases are stereotypies due to genetic causes, including Rett syndrome. 12 In a typically developing child, stereotypies will not need further diagnostic work‐up. Further diagnostic work‐up (such as infectious, auto‐immune, and/or genetic testing) is indicated only if additional features are present.

Tremor

In patients with tremor it is advisable to look for additional signs, such as dystonia, Parkinsonism, and cerebellar or brainstem signs, pointing towards a combined clinical syndrome that warrants specific diagnostic tests. 14 If no additional signs are present, the patient has an isolated tremor syndrome, such as essential or enhanced physiological tremor. Enhanced physiological tremor can be caused by several reversible conditions, such as anxiety, fatigue, hyperthyroidism, and numerous drugs. 14 Essential tremor is familial in half of the patients. 24

### Tremor rating scales and laboratory tools for assessing tremor [^113ftMMT]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review is to characterize and compare validated clinical rating scales and transducers that are used in the clinical assessment of tremor disorders. Tremor is an involuntary oscillatory movement of a body part. Tremor can be characterized in terms of amplitude and frequency of oscillation, and these kinematic properties vary randomly and with activities of daily living. Clinical rating scales are most useful when performing a comprehensive assessment of tremor severity (amplitude), anatomical distribution, activation conditions, and impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Motion transducers are often used in conjunction with surface electromyography to discern properties of tremor that are important diagnostically. Motion transducers are needed for an accurate determination of tremor frequency and for precise quantification of changes in amplitude and frequency over time. The precision and accuracy of motion transducers exceed that of all clinical rating scales. However, these advantages of transducers are mitigated by the considerable within-subject random variability in tremor amplitude, such that the smallest detectable statistically significant change in tremor amplitude is comparable for scales and transducers. Comprehensive anatomical and behavioral assessment of tremor with transducers is not clinically feasible. Transducers and scales are presently viewed as complementary methods of quantifying tremor amplitude. Transducer measures are logarithmically related to clinical ratings, as predicted by the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. This relationship must be considered when interpreting change in clinical ratings, produced by disease or treatment. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### The role of the cerebellum in degenerative ataxias and essential tremor: insights from noninvasive modulation of cerebellar activity [^113gP9bC]. Movement Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last three decades, measuring and modulating cerebellar activity and its connectivity with other brain regions has become an emerging research topic in clinical neuroscience. The most important connection is the cerebellothalamocortical pathway, which can be functionally interrogated using a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm. Cerebellar brain inhibition reflects the magnitude of suppression of motor cortex excitability after stimulating the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere and therefore represents a neurophysiological marker of the integrity of the efferent cerebellar tract. Observations that cerebellar noninvasive stimulation techniques enhanced performance of certain motor and cognitive tasks in healthy individuals have inspired attempts to modulate cerebellar activity and connectivity in patients with cerebellar diseases in order to achieve clinical benefit. We here comprehensively explore the therapeutic potential of these techniques in two movement disorders characterized by prominent cerebellar involvement, namely the degenerative ataxias and essential tremor. The article aims to illustrate the (patho)physiological insights obtained from these studies and how these translate into clinical practice, where possible by addressing the association with cerebellar brain inhibition. Finally, possible explanations for some discordant interstudy findings, shortcomings in our current understanding, and recommendations for future research will be provided. © 2019 The Authors.

### Tremor after solid organ transplantation: results from the TransplantLines biobank and cohort study [^11267mxC]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has both strengths and limitations. The sizeable cohort containing several types of organ transplantation recipients, increasing the generalizability, can be viewed as a strength. The same holds for the incorporation of a truly objective measure for tremor prevalence, based on the 95th percentile of assessments in healthy participants, and the addition of a subjective measure of tremor severity. The additional measurement of surface electromyography in tandem with accelerometry would have allowed for the verification of rhythmic muscle bursts to further establish pathological tremor; however, we believe our approach using the 95th percentile of tremor amplitude as measured with accelerometry in a cohort of healthy participants as the cutoff between normal and pathological tremor circumvents this issue. A weakness is the lack of assessment before transplantation, which means we can give no information about changes due to transplantation procedures, but solely report our findings after transplantation. Our study would have been improved by a measurement before transplantation. Moreover, future research with repeated measurements at follow‐up would provide information on the tremor disease course after transplantation. Additionally, these measurements both before and after transplantation should include a clinical neurological assessment, with measures for bradykinesia, rigidity, and most importantly polyneuropathy, because some patients seem to suffer from a neuropathic tremor, a finding that would be substantiated by clinical signs. A clinical neurological examination was not deemed feasible beforehand given the extensive assessments in which transplant recipients partake in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study but would have been of great value in hindsight. In the current study, we evaluated the presence of polyneuropathy by means of a subjective questionnaire in a subsection of patients, but clinical neurological examination ideally accompanied by clinical neurophysiological examination remains the gold standard for establishing polyneuropathy.

To conclude, in this study we established tremor to be present in half of solid organ transplant recipients; the tremor characteristics best fit the syndrome of enhanced physiological tremor, with 65% of tremor patients meeting clinical neurophysiological criteria, and neuropathic tremor could be a second tremor syndrome after transplantation.

### Psychogenic tremor: long-term prognosis in patients with electrophysiologically confirmed disease [^115CxVBe]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

We describe the presenting features and long-term outcomes of patients with electrophysiologically-confirmed psychogenic tremor. Clinical information for all patients with psychogenic tremor confirmed by our Movement Disorders Neurophysiology Laboratory (2003–2004) was reviewed. A follow-up questionnaire was administered to all included patients in 2007. Psychogenic tremor was documented in 62 patients; 33 responded to the questionnaire (53%). Median onset-age was 50 years (range, 15–71); 23 were female (70%). Clinical certainty of psychogenic etiology was: definite, 8 (24%); probable, 16 (49%), and possible, 9 (27%). Characteristic electrodiagnostic features of psychogenic tremor were documented in all. All but two patients were ultimately given a definite diagnosis of psychogenic tremor; recommended psychiatric consultation was only done by 12 (36%). Twenty-one patients (64%) rated tremor disability as moderate or severe after a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range, 3.3–19). Improvement occurred spontaneously in 5 (15%), and after a specific intervention in 4 (12%), whereas 3 (9%) had mild but unchanged symptoms. The mean duration of symptoms, prior to diagnosis with psychogenic tremor, was significantly shorter for patients with mild or no tremor at follow-up (P = 0.037). Physiologically-confirmed psychogenic tremor carries a poor prognosis, with unremitting or worse tremor persisting 3-years after diagnosis in most.

### Tremor after solid organ transplantation: results from the TransplantLines biobank and cohort study [^111Uoa64]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tremor prevalence and characteristics

Tremor was present in 129 (52%) of the transplant recipients during at least one unloaded condition. Tremor‐evoking conditions were typically postural; the posture in which patients exhibited tremor most frequently was with pronated outstretched arms and hands, evoking tremor in 33% of transplant recipients. Tremor was observed least frequently at rest; only 5% of patients had a rest tremor. Of these 13 patients, 11 also had a postural tremor with a higher amplitude than the rest tremor, leaving two patients with an isolated rest tremor.

The mean tremor frequency was 6.1 Hz (SD = 2.0) in patients with established tremor (n = 129, 52%; Table 2). The proportion of patients with a tremor frequency > 6 Hz was 47%. Further analyses of tremor variability characteristics were performed in a subgroup (n = 80, 32%) of the transplant recipients, in whom tremor was present during at least two unloaded tasks, because this allows for assessment of variability over multiple tasks. The mean tremor variability was 2.6 Hz (SD = 1.8). The proportion of patients with frequency variability of > 1.75 Hz across all unloaded conditions was 63%. The median effect of loading was a frequency change of −2.0 Hz (interquartile range [IQR] = −4.1 to 0.1) for the position with outstretched hands and a frequency change of −0.5 Hz (IQR = −2.2 to 0.4) for the position with both arms and hands outstretched. The proportion of patients with a frequency decrease of > 1 Hz in at least one of the two loaded versus unloaded conditions was 83%. When combining all three neurophysiological features indicative of enhanced physiological tremor (i.e. tremor frequency > 6 Hz, frequency variability > 1.75 Hz, frequency decrease upon loading > 1 Hz), 65% of the patients scored positive for ≥ 2/3 points (EPT+).

### Phase dependent modulation of tremor amplitude in essential tremor through thalamic stimulation [^113pYNah]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have shown that thalamic DBS at f T altered the temporal profile of the tremor observed in patients with medically refractory essential tremor. Temporal changes took the form of tremor entrainment, and tremor phase-dependent suppression and amplification of tremor. Tremor phase-dependent amplitude modulation of essential tremor has not been previously reported and was significantly different from the spontaneous tremor variation observed when DBS was switched off. The change in tremor amplitude averaged across all stimulation phases promoting suppression and all phases promoting amplification was just under −10% and 10%, respectively. This increased to −27% and +20% if tremor amplitude changes were assessed at the optimum tremor phases for the corresponding effects.

The level of suppression that could be achieved at specific tremor phases correlated with the degree of improvement in essential tremor severity during therapeutic high frequency DBS relative to tremor severity pre-DBS implantation. This suggests that the two phenomena may share a common physiological basis. It has been previously reported that the efficacy of DBS decreases with decreasing DBS frequency. Several experimental and theoretical papers have addressed this dependency. One possible explanation for the relationship between DBS efficacy and DBS frequency was provided by a theoretical model where it was hypothesized that higher DBS frequencies allowed for an increased probability of stimulating the underlying pathological oscillation at the right time and disrupting relay of this oscillation to cortex. The present results with thalamic stimulation at f T confirm the predictions of the theoretical model in so far as tremor amplitude suppression depends on the specific phase of the tremor cycle at which stimulation pulses are delivered.

### Tremor entities and their classification: an update [^1142qaxo]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on important new findings in the field of tremor and illustrates the consequences for the current definition and classification of tremor.

Recent Findings

Since 1998 when the consensus criteria for tremor were proposed, new variants of tremors and new diagnostic methods were discovered that have changed particularly the concepts of essential tremor and dystonic tremor. Accumulating evidence exists that essential tremor is not a single entity rather different conditions that share the common symptom action tremor without other major abnormalities. Tremor is a common feature in patients with adult-onset focal dystonia and may involve several different body parts and forms of tremor. Recent advances, in particular, in the field of genetics, suggest that dystonic tremor may even be present without overt dystonia. Monosymptomatic asymmetric rest and postural tremor has been further delineated, and apart from tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease, there are several rare conditions including rest and action tremor with normal dopamine transporter imaging (scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit) and essential tremor with tremor at rest.

Summary

Increasing knowledge in the last decades changed the view on tremors and highlights several caveats in the current tremor classification. Given the ambiguous assignment between tremor phenomenology and tremor etiology, a more cautious definition of tremors on the basis of clinical assessment data is needed.

### Problems and controversies in tremor classification [^116gShcr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

The Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors, from the Task Force of the International Parkinson's and Movement Disorder Society was published in 2018 in response to advances in the understanding of essential tremor (ET), tremor associated with dystonia and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors. This was a revision of the previous 1998 Consensus Statement. A number of problems arise from this classification and, in this manuscript, we highlight several of these. These problems relate to the definition of tremor, the definition of ET, the proposal of the term 'essential tremor plus', issues related to orthostatic tremor (OT) including the proposal of the term 'orthostatic tremor plus', and the absence of a hierarchy of terms used to classify tremor. Among the proposals we make is that the definition of tremor should acknowledge that tremor is a symptom, ET should be redefined, severity is an important characteristic for classifying and diagnosing tremor, the terms 'essential tremor plus' and 'orthostatic tremor plus' should be abandoned, and classification of tremor requires rules for creating a hierarchy of terminology.

The pathophysiology of orthostatic tremor is unclear. Using neuroimaging to investigate the cerebellar motor pathways in patients, Gallea et al. reveal anatomo-functional changes in the cerebellar vermis, lateral cerebellum and supplementary motor area. Repetitive transcranial cerebellar stimulation reduces the amplitude of the tremor frequency peak and modifies cerebello-cortical connectivity.

### Robotising vitreoretinal surgeries [^112uAUKx]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges of intraocular microsurgery

Intraocular microsurgery remains challenging to perform, with concerns involving accuracy, tremors, precision, depth perception, and dexterity. In vitreoretinal surgeries, high accuracy is required in a small workspace during surgical manipulation. As such, physiological hand tremors becomes a substantial concern. Previous experimental characterizations of physiologic tremors showed that the average root mean square (rms) amplitude of tremor ranged between 14 and 142 µm when holding a tool still, and between 59 and 341 µm when actuating a microsurgical grasper. Tremor data recorded during eye surgery have shown that it is present in the order of 100 µm in all directions of hand movement in its peak-to-peak excursion when transmitted to the tip of the instrument. Previous study also reported a rms amplitude of tremor at 38 µm when tracking the tool motion during epiretinal membrane peeling. This results in difficulty in being absolutely precise in targeting a specific area of concern, or holding the surgical instrument stationary for prolonged durations.

This is particularly of concern in vitreoretinal surgeries, where delicate structures need to be manipulated surgically with surgical tools. Robotic technology has been demonstrated to assist in overcoming physiological tremors for more desired surgical outcomes. With the advent of subretinal gene therapy, such as the recently FDA-approved gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna), elimination of hand tremors to allow for precise delivery with minimal surgical trauma is imperative to improve surgical safety compared to the current manual subretinal injection protocol. Many ongoing clinical trials for gene therapy or stem cell therapy for inherited retinal diseases are currently going on, but precise delivery of such treatment methods is necessary for desired surgical outcomes with reduced reflux and retinotomy sizes. Certain conditions such as retinal vein occlusion which is a highly prevalent disease affecting 16.4 million people worldwide, still have inadequate standard of care. Currently, potentially curative treatment methods are retinal endovascular surgery, but this requires complex surgical manoeuvres exceeding the human skill and human hand's stability.

### The emerging neuropathology of essential tremor [^111zCm5L]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders. At the same time, it is among the most poorly-understood of these disorders. The underlying anatomical pathology of ET has been elusive until recently. Postmortem studies have begun to display some of the underlying brain changes in patients with this disease. These types of investigations are likely to lead the way to additional insights into the pathophysiology of ET and guide the development of therapies for this common movement disorder.

### The digital signature of emergent tremor in Parkinson's disease [^113vH9vQ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we demonstrate that emergent tremor has a unique digital signature during QDG-RAFT, which could be reliably identified and could distinguish involuntary from voluntary strikes, enabling more representative measurement of voluntary motor signs such as bradykinesia and rigidity based on voluntary strikes only. We used labeled datasets that were created based on visual identification of tremor during QDG-RAFT by a blinded movement disorders specialist to develop and investigate the efficacy of two methods for identifying tremor on a strike-by-strike basis: (1) Using physiologically informed thresholds for temporal features of tapping. (2) Supervised-learning-based XGBoost classifier that uses both temporal and amplitude features of tapping as input features. We performed correlations of tremor percentage detected during RAFT and clinical ratings of tremor severity and persistence from the MDS-UPDRS III. Additionally, we evaluated whether metrics of bradykinesia, rigidity, and arrhythmicity were significantly different when measured based on voluntary strikes only, after the exclusion of tremor. Lastly, we assessed whether the change in metrics was associated with the percent duration of tremor in a trial.

### Differences in cross modulation of physiological tremor in pianists and nonmusicians [^112aiYcj]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study was undertaken to investigate the contralateral overflow effect on physiological tremors in pianists and nonmusicians. Group differences in cross modulation on underlying finger fractionated movement were characterized.

Methods

Physiological tremors of the right index, middle, ring, and little fingers were recorded in 12 right-handed pianists and 12 matched nonmusician controls; meanwhile, two contralateral resistance protocols (unilateral handgrip using the left hand at slight and maximal efforts) were randomly conducted.

Results

Digit tremors of the control and pianist groups were differentially modulated with the resistance protocols. An increase in gripping force led to cross excitations over 8–12 Hz digit tremors and interdigit tremor coupling for the nonmusicians. An opposite cross effect was noted for the pianists, who exhibited significant tremor suppression and the release of interdigit tremor coupling. Further analysis of tremor dynamics revealed that contralateral gripping reduced the complexity of digit tremors of the pianists but added to the tremor complexity of the nonmusicians.

Conclusions

Cross modulation on digit tremors suggests that pianists could centrally suppress unintended motor excitation across the midline. When the opposite hand is active, pianists have superior finger independence that allows them to achieve artistic aspects of musical performance.

### Levodopa reversible loss of the piper frequency oscillation component in Parkinson's disease [^114QTAEr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although Parkinson's disease is typically characterised by bradykinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor, the possibility that two additional motor deficits are manifest during small hand muscle activity was explored-namely, weakness and abnormal physiological tremor.

Methods

A paradigm previously used in normal subjects reliably records the strength, tremor and surface EMG of index finger abducting contractions against a compliant (elastic) resistance. In addition to the well known physiological tremor at around 10 Hz, there are other co existing peak tremor frequencies at around 20 and 40 Hz; the last of these frequencies corresponds to the range of EMG Piper rhythm. The same technique was used to study parkinsonian patients while on and off dopaminergic medication.

Results

The maximum strength of finger abduction produced by first dorsal interosseous contraction was considerably lower when patients were off medication (mean (SD) 6.27 (1.49) N when off v 12.33 (3.64) N when on). There was also a marked reduction in the power of Piper frequency finger tremor (p < 0.0005) and EMG (p < 0.0005) oscillations that did not simply result from weaker contraction.

Conclusion

As the components of physiological tremor at higher frequencies are thought to derive from CNS oscillations important in motor control, their loss in parkinsonism in association with severe off symptoms may represent an important pathophysiological link between dopaminergic depletion and parkinsonian motor deficits.

### Integrative brain States facilitate the expression of Parkinson's tremor [^1122MkwG]. Movement Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

Tremor episodes in PD are preceded by a state of increased cerebral integration, which may facilitate the emergence of cerebral tremor‐related activity. In turn, fluctuations in tremor amplitude are tightly locked to fluctuations in arousal, suggesting that arousal has a modulatory role in the production of tremor amplitude. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at attenuating cerebral integration and/or arousal (eg, via β‐blockers or biofeedback cognitive paradigms) may be effective in treating PD resting tremor.

### Phase dependent modulation of tremor amplitude in essential tremor through thalamic stimulation [^1163bD9F]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Thus the present results raise the exciting prospect that clinically useful tremor suppression could be achieved with phase-controlled low frequency stimulation of the thalamus. This would have the advantage that power demands would be much lower than with current high frequency stimulation and specificity would also potentially be improved. Such specificity emerges as a natural consequence of the dependency of the effects of low frequency stimulation on their delivery at critical points in the phase of the oscillations underlying the pathological tremor; physiological patterns of synchronization would not be expected to share this critical phase locking to stimulation and should be relatively unaffected. Furthermore, a stimulation approach that promotes cumulative suppressive plastic effects might offer a means of overcoming the tolerance to prolonged high frequency DBS that sometimes develops with stimulation in essential tremor. Our results suggest that low frequency stimulation at a specific phase relationship with on-going tremor oscillations could interact with the underlying oscillatory network, possibly resetting its intrinsic functional connectivity in a way that does not seem to happen with high frequency DBS in essential tremor. In the latter case stimulation is at too high a frequency to enlist entrainment and to take advantage of cumulative phase-dependent effects, and the response to stimulation over time may even wane through adaptation of the biological response of the neuronal network stimulated at these high frequencies.

Tremor suppression using active phase tracking to deliver electrical current to the motor cortex at the optimal phase for suppression has been piloted in Parkinson's disease. The present findings suggest that active phase tracking could also be employed to control when DBS pulses are delivered to control essential tremor. This would allow treatment effects to be maximized by focussing stimulation on the optimal phase for suppression and by ensuring that this is repeated over many cycles to capture cumulative effects. The current results provide an important impetus for trials of closed-loop phase tracking stimulation regimens in essential tremor.

An algorithm to identify tremor strikes using temporal characteristics and based on video identification

Visual observation between trials with tremor and trials with no tremor suggested that tremor strikes could be distinguished from voluntary tapping by temporal characteristics of a shorter ISI (higher frequency) and shorter dwell time, Fig. 2, which has been previously observed. Four combinations of physiologically informed ISI and dwell time thresholds were systematically applied to classify tremor in strikes from Dataset 1. The efficacy of each ISI and dwell time threshold combination was evaluated based on the sensitivity (True Positive/True Positive + False Negative) and false-positive rate (False Positive/False Positive + True Negative). The most suitable ISI and dwell time thresholds were identified by comparing the resulting sensitivity and false-positive rates of each combination of thresholds.

### The MDS consensus tremor classification: the best way to classify patients with tremor at present [^114ouQUz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2018, the new Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors, by the Task Force on Tremor of the International Parkinson Movement Disorder Society, was published. So far, the article has been cited more than 400 times in peer-reviewed international journals and commonly debated in conferences and meetings due to an enthusiastic welcome from the community. Compared to the previous Consensus Statement (1998), the main novelties are: 1) the classification of tremor according to clinical manifestation (Axis 1) and etiology (Axis 2), and therefore the use of a syndromic approach; 2) the definition of essential tremor as a syndrome; 3) the recognition of the new category essential tremor plus, that derives from the uncertain significance of the soft neurological signs often associated with essential tremor. In this paper, we summarise and explain the most important aspects of the new classification of tremors, highlighting the main novelties, their relevance, and application in clinical practice. Moreover, we discuss its possible weakness and reflect on the critical comments made so far. We believe that this new tremor classification is comprehensive, rigorous, and consistent and, considering our current knowledge of tremor syndromes, it is the best we can do at present.

### Integrative brain States facilitate the expression of Parkinson's tremor [^114EbVEf]. Movement Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

These findings suggest that spontaneous fluctuations in PD rest tremor may be driven by integrative brain states, increased levels of arousal, or a combination of both. We tested this hypothesis by performing resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on 40 tremor‐dominant PD patients with concurrent recordings of tremor (using electromyography [EMG] and accelerometry) and proxy measures of the ascending arousal system (pupil diameter and heart rate). To distinguish between mechanisms that generate versus amplify tremor, we compared baseline episodes, episodes preceding tremor, and tremor episodes. Next, we investigated the temporal relationship between the measures of cerebral integration, the ascending arousal system, and the expression of tremor.

### Cerebral causes and consequences of parkinsonian resting tremor: a tale of two circuits? [^114naAFH]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

The tremors of Parkinson's disease

Tremor is characterized clinically by involuntary, rhythmic and alternating movements of one or more body parts. Parkinson's disease harbours many different tremors. These tremors can vary according to the circumstances under which they occur, the body part that is involved and the frequency at which the tremor occurs. For example, tremor may occur at rest, during postural holding or during voluntary movements; it can be seen in the hands, feet or other body parts; and tremor frequency can vary from low (4–5 Hz) to high (8–10 Hz). A consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society includes a parallel classification scheme that categorizes three tremor syndromes associated with Parkinson's disease. This classification is still used widely today. First, the most common or classical Parkinson's disease tremor is defined as a resting tremor, or rest and postural/kinetic tremor with the same frequency. This tremor is inhibited during movement and may reoccur with the same frequency when adopting a posture or even when moving. When recurring with posture, it has been called re-emergent tremor. Second, some patients with Parkinson's disease develop rest and postural/kinetic tremors of different frequencies, with the postural/kinetic tremor displaying a higher (> 1.5 Hz) and non-harmonically related frequency to the resting tremor. This form occurs in < 10% of patients with Parkinson's disease. Some consider it to be an incidental combination of an essential tremor with Parkinson's disease, but it appears more plausible that postural tremor is a manifestation of Parkinson's disease. Third, isolated postural and kinetic tremors do occur in Parkinson's disease. The frequency of these tremors may vary between 4 and 9 Hz. A specific form of (position-dependent) postural tremor is orthostatic tremor, which may occur in Parkinson's disease at different frequencies (4–6, 8–9 or 13–18 Hz), with or without co-existent resting tremor. Since this tremor type occurs at a higher age of onset than primary orthostatic tremor, and since it may respond to dopaminergic treatment, it has been argued that it is a manifestation of Parkinson's disease rather than a chance association of two tremor syndromes.

### Essential tremor [^1111Cj8C]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders throughout the world, with prevalence in the general population of 0.4–3.9%. Although most people with essential tremor are only mildly affected, those who seek medical care are disabled to some extent, and most are socially handicapped by the tremor.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of drug treatments in people with essential tremor of the hand? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 41 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding mirtazepine to other antitremor drugs; benzodiazepines; beta-blockers other than propranolol; botulinum A toxin-haemagglutinin complex; calcium channel blockers; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; clonidine; flunarizine; gabapentin; isoniazid; Phenobarbital; primidone; propranolol; and topiramate.

### Physiological mechanisms of thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus stimulation for tremor suppression [^1111EYDx]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Essential tremor is regarded as a disorder of the cerebellum. Post-mortem studies have described various levels of neurodegeneration in essential tremor patients including Purkinje cell loss and Purkinje cell axonal swelling in the neocerebellum and vermis. However, other studies have not found neurodegenerative changes, rather that there is neurophysiological evidence of a reduction in GABAergic tone. In the dentate nucleus of essential tremor patients, post-mortem studies have revealed lower levels of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors compared to control subjects. Thus, the restricted inhibitory influence of Purkinje cells may result in increased disinhibition of deep cerebellar neurons, and the subsequent overactivity may spread through the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. Indeed, the Vim has a distinct role within essential tremor pathophysiology. DBS studies have demonstrated tremor-related local field potential clusters and intraoperative studies have shown single-unit tremor-related discharges (tremor cells;) in Vim that are coherent with tremor. What drives these oscillatory networks is still unsubstantiated. Early theories hypothesize that unique ion channel dynamics in the thalamus, inferior olive, and cerebellum can generate oscillations. Movement-related activation of nucleo-olivary cells may cause Purkinje cells to synchronously inhibit deep cerebellar nuclei, which generate oscillatory rebound potentials (inhibition-induced excitation) that make their way through the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. However, studies (reviewed in) have moved away from single oscillator hypotheses, and suggest that there may be shifting modes of cooperation in all nodes of the tremor network, and that all components are capable of acting as resonators and entraining each other.

In this study, we set out to elucidate how electrical stimulation interacts with the brain on a physiological level during therapeutic high-frequency stimulation (HFS) and how it leads to clinical benefit. While modelling studies have been used to predict the effects of thalamic DBS on neuronal firing, our unique intraoperative dual-microelectrode assembly allows us to record the activity of single neurons during stimulation from a nearby electrode while simultaneously quantifying effects on tremor. Our findings suggest that tremor reduction was associated with inhibition of neuronal firing, which occurred after a transient driving of neuronal activity. Additionally, our findings shed light on the complex pathophysiology of tremor-genesis, and could also provide insight for the optimization of DBS technology for the treatment of tremor.

### Tremor – some controversial aspects [^116CbXDm]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

The commonest cause of pathological tremor is essential tremor (ET). However, it has proved difficult to identify genetic mutations causing ET, particularly because other causes of tremor continue to be misdiagnosed as ET. Whether subjects with dystonia or Parkinson's disease (PD) carry an increased genetic risk of developing ET, or vice versa, is controversial. In addition, the notion of a separate disorder of benign tremulous parkinsonism (BTP) has been debated. This article gives a selective viewpoint on some areas of uncertainty and controversy in tremor.

### Tremor stability index: a new tool for differential diagnosis in tremor syndromes [^112vMWAC]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Comparison with state-of-the-art neurophysiology

The only electrophysiological measure so far identified for the differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease tremor and essential tremor with an accuracy > 85% tested in an independent validation cohort is the MHP. We sought to assess the relative performance of TSI against MHP in our data. Across our combined dataset (test and validation cohorts) MHP produced a ROC AUC of 0.89 compared to 0.92 of TSI. Bootstrap analysis revealed that TSI outperformed MHP 72% of the time.

Discriminating Parkinson's disease and essential tremor: is the TSI independent of posture or recording device?

A further analysis, showed that TSI essential tremor versus Parkinson's disease discrimination properties did not depend on whether tremor was recorded at rest or during postural contraction (Supplementary material). In addition, analysis showed that EMG could not replace kinematic sensors like accelerometers or lasers in the estimation of discriminative TSI (Supplementary material).

### Essential tremor: tips and tricks [^112E58Dk]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tremors are a common reason for neurology consultations and can sometimes be a diagnostic challenge. One of the most common causes is essential tremor, which needs to be distinguished from other types of tremors, such as those found in Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease or dystonic tremor. This categorisation is important as their treatment and prognosis differ. This review focuses on two main characteristics of tremor to help with its differential diagnosis: 'The When', or conditions that enhance the tremor, which include action, postural, intentional components and resting tremor; and 'The Where' or the body location, which includes tremor in the upper limbs, head or voice.

### Connecting tremors-a circuits perspective [^116HVcGW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Tremor is one of the most prevalent movement disorders in clinical practice. Here, we review new insights in the pathophysiology of tremor. We focus on the three most common tremor disorders: essential tremor (ET), dystonic tremor syndrome (DTS), and Parkinson's disease (PD) tremor.

Recent Findings

Converging evidence suggests that ET, DTS, and PD tremor are all associated with (partly) overlapping cerebral networks involving the basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Recent studies have assessed the role of these networks in tremor by measuring tremor-related activity and connectivity with electrophysiology and neuroimaging, and by perturbing network components using invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation. The cerebellum plays a more dominant and causal role in action tremors than in rest tremor, as exemplified by recent findings in ET, DTS, and re-emergent tremor in PD. Furthermore, the role of the cerebellum in DTS is related to clinical differences between patients, for example, whether or not the tremor occurs in a dystonic limb, and whether the tremor is jerky or sinusoidal.

Summary

Insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of tremor may provide a more direct window into mechanism-based treatment options than either the etiology or the clinical phenotype of a tremor syndrome.

### Effects of subthalamic nucleus stimulation and medication on resting and postural tremor in Parkinson's disease [^114Z5xea]. Brain (2004). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and antiparkinsonian medication have proved to be effective treatments for tremor in Parkinson's disease. To date it is not known how and to what extent STN DBS alone and in combination with antiparkinsonian medication alters the pathophysiology of resting and postural tremor in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of STN DBS and antiparkinsonian medication on the neurophysiological characteristics of resting and postural hand tremor in Parkinson's disease. Resting and postural hand tremor were recorded using accelerometry and surface electromyography (EMG) from 10 Parkinson's disease patients and 10 matched control subjects. The Parkinson's disease subjects were examined under four treatment conditions: (i) off treatment; (ii) STN DBS; (iii) medication; and (iv) medication plus STN DBS. The amplitude, EMG frequency, regularity, and 1–8 Hz tremor-EMG coherence were analysed. Both STN DBS and medication reduced the amplitude, regularity and tremor-EMG coherence, and increased the EMG frequency of resting and postural tremor in Parkinson's disease. STN DBS was more effective than medication in reducing the amplitude and increasing the frequency of resting and postural tremor to healthy physiological levels. These findings provide strong evidence that effective STN DBS normalizes the amplitude and frequency of tremor. The findings suggest that neural activity in the STN is an important modulator of the neural network(s) responsible for both resting and postural tremor genesis in Parkinson's disease.

### Tremor-correlated cortical activity in essential tremor [^114DtLJJ]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

In patients with parkinsonian resting tremor, tremor-correlated activity in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex has been studied by both magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). In essential tremor, MEG failed to detect cortical involvement. The objective of this study was to investigate whether EEG recording can reveal tremor-correlated cortical activity in patients with essential tremor or enhanced physiological tremor.

Methods

Seven patients with essential tremor and three patients with enhanced physiological tremor participated in the study. Unilateral postural tremor was activated by wrist extension on the right or on the left side. Electromyography (EMG) signals arising from the wrist extensor and flexor muscles, and a high-resolution EEG were recorded simultaneously. Coherences between the time series of the rectified tremor EMG and the EEG were estimated.

Findings

In five of nine arms with essential tremor, we found highly significant coherences at the tremor frequency between the tremor EMG and the EEG. Isocoherence maps illustrating the topography of significant coherences over the scalp showed that the maximum coherences were located over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. In the patients with enhanced physiological tremor, we were unable to detect consistent significant corticomuscular coherences at the tremor frequency.

Interpretation

Using simultaneous EEG-EMG recordings, we showed that significant corticomuscular coherences at the tremor frequency can be found in essential tremor. This finding contrasts with a recent study based on MEG recordings. The results suggest that the sensorimotor cortex is involved in the generation of essential tremor, in a similar way to that previously shown in parkinsonian resting tremor.

### Essential tremor: emerging views of a common disorder [^113wfjm1]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent tremor disorder. ET has traditionally been viewed as a monosymptomatic disorder characterized by a kinetic arm tremor, but this definition is gradually being replaced. The clinical spectrum has come to include several motor features, including tremor and ataxia, and several non-motor features, including possible cognitive impairment and personality disturbances. Postmortem studies are revealing several different patterns of pathology. The emerging view is that ET might be a family of diseases, unified by the presence of kinetic tremor, but further characterized by etiological, clinical and pathological heterogeneity. Effective pharmacological treatments for the disorder remain limited, although new insights into disease mechanisms might result in more-effective therapies. In addition, recent investigations of environmental toxicants that might be linked to ET open the way towards primary disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to these factors.

### Propranolol reduces Parkinson's tremor and inhibits tremor-related activity in the motor cortex: a placebo-controlled crossover trial [^1161wf5t]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of the main ascending neurotransmitter systems, including the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems. Although nigro‐striatal dopamine depletion is related to bradykinesia and rigidity, this association is less clear for resting tremor. Clinical evidence suggests an additional role for the noradrenergic system in the pathophysiology of PD tremor. Specifically, PD tremor increases during experimentally induced stress, such as cognitively demanding tasks, and patients rate tremor as their most stress‐sensitive symptom. Furthermore, although levodopa is effective in reducing tremor, this effect is diminished by stressful contexts. This highlights an important clinical problem that people experience most tremor during psychological stress, when dopaminergic treatment is least effective. These observations suggest that the noradrenergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of PD tremor, but the mechanisms are unclear.

According to the "dimmer‐switch hypothesis" of PD tremor, pathological activity in the striato‐pallidal circuit triggers tremor onset analogous to a light switch, whereas increased activity in the cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical circuit amplifies tremor power analogous to a light dimmer. We have previously shown that cognitive load, which activates the noradrenergic system, increases PD tremor through excitatory influences on the thalamus. Other findings suggest that the involvement of the noradrenergic system in PD tremor may not be restricted to stressful situations, and spontaneous fluctuations in tremor power in the absence of any task were tightly correlated with fluctuations in heart rate and pupil diameter (ie, 2 proxy measures of noradrenergic activity). Imaging and postmortem studies have shown that the integrity of the locus coeruleus (LC), the main cerebral source of noradrenaline, is associated with the presence or absence of PD tremor. Although noradrenergic terminal function was decreased in PD patients versus controls, noradrenergic projections from the LC toward the thalamus were more preserved in patients with prominent tremor. Accordingly, lesioning noradrenergic LC terminals in a PD rat model reduced the development of tremor.

### Diagnosis and management of tremor… [^1158NTE1]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Tremor is the most common involuntary movement disorder. It is differentiated from other involuntary movement disorders, such as chorea, athetosis, ballismus, tics, and myoclonus, by its repetitive, stereotyped, movements of a regular amplitude and frequency. Tremor can be defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, periodic, mechanical oscillation of a body part. This occurs with voluntary muscle contraction and includes postural, kinetic, and isometric tremor. Postural tremor is produced by voluntary maintenance of a particular posture held against gravity. Examples are physiologic tremor, essential tremor, certain drug-induced tremors, and postural tremor of Parkinson disease. Some postural tremors continue when the limb is supported, thus making it difficult to differentiate from resting tremor.

However, tremor amplitude almost always diminishes during target-directed movements in resting tremor, while increasing or constant tremor amplitudes are found during voluntary movements in postural tremor.

1. Physiologic tremor is an action tremor and is present in every healthy person. It becomes more pronounced during periods of muscular fatigue, anxiety, emotional stress, and fear or excitement. Other causes of enhanced physiologic tremor are thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, catecholamine infusion, methylxanthine administration, drug withdrawal states, and alcohol intoxication. Isolated chin tremor, also called geniospasm, is an autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome characterized by episodic, usually stress-induced, high-frequency, contraction of the mentalis muscle. 21 The onset is typically in infancy or childhood.

Usually there is no evidence of any other nervous system abnormality, although abnormal electroencephalographic findings, sleep disorders, and involvement of other facial muscles have been described in rare cases. This is a symptomatic tremor caused by lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or thalamus. It has been labeled in the past as rubral tremor, 29 midbrain tremor, 30 thalamic tremor, 31 myorhythmia, 32 and Benedikt syndrome, but the Ad Hoc Scientific Committee on Movement Disorders has applied the term "Holmes tremor" to all these forms of tremor. 1 The tremors attributed to these different lesions are postural and/or action in nature and worsen during movement and markedly increase during goal-directed movements.

### Classification… [^111PrqnJ]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Tremor — a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of body parts 1 — is the most common movement disorder. 2 The diagnosis is based on a careful assessment of the history and physical examination, although some tests, including positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography, are being investigated as diagnostic aids. 2–5 This article reviews the classification and causes of tremor and provides evaluation guidelines. Tremor Syndromes PHYSIOLOGIC TREMOR Enhanced physiologic tremor is a visible, high-frequency postural tremor that occurs in the absence of neurologic disease and is caused by medical conditions such as thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycemia, the use of certain drugs, or withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines. It is usually reversible once the cause is corrected. Essential tremor develops insidiously and progresses slowly, presenting as a postural, distal arm tremor in 95 percent of patients.

Onset peaks bimodally in the teens and 50s. The tremor may start in a single limb, but it becomes bilateral over time, most often as a flexion-extension movement of the wrist with a frequency of 4 to 12 Hz. CEREBELLAR TREMOR Cerebellar tremor presents as a unilateral or bilateral, low-frequency intention tremor caused by stroke, brainstem tumor, or multiple sclerosis. PSYCHOGENIC TREMOR Psychogenic tremor presents as a variable tremor that may decrease or disappear when not under direct observation, or with psychotherapy or placebo. The patient is asked to tap a beat with the limb contralateral to the tremulous limb: if the tremor decreases or shifts to the frequency of the tapping, psychogenic tremor is suspected. 19 Co-activation of antagonistic muscles of the tremulous limb may be detected clinically or electrophysiologically.
19. Postural tremor can be relatively constant or episodic, and of acute or insidious onset.

It should be noted whether stress or fatigue increases the amplitude of the tremor. If weight loss, irritability, racing heart, or neck swelling is described, the patient should be examined for thyroid enlargement, exophthalmos, brisk reflexes, and tachycardia. The thyroid-stimulating hormone level is checked to rule out hyperthyroidism.
