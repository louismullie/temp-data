## Question

Which clinical signs suggest a blocked bile duct?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which clinical signs suggest a blocked bile duct. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core syndromic presentations, especially the classic signs of acute cholangitis. Then, I should verify the cholestatic symptom cluster that points to impaired bile flow. Next, I will review supportive gastrointestinal and postoperative features, corroborating laboratory patterns, and hallmark imaging findings. Finally, I need to differentiate by common etiologies and flag severity indicators that demand urgent decompression, integrating guideline-based risk tools along the way [^113KsLob] [^111rMqwV].

> Let me consider the clinical context first, because I need to ensure the symptom pattern maps to the likely cause of obstruction. Extrahepatic biliary obstruction commonly stems from choledocholithiasis, benign or iatrogenic biliary strictures, or malignant processes at the hilum, bile duct, or pancreatic head, and the presentation varies by level, completeness, and presence of superimposed infection [^116MRVTF] [^11147iwv] [^116AMF7j].

> I should confirm the cardinal infectious-obstructive syndrome: Charcot's triad of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain is the classic bedside signal of acute cholangitis due to obstruction, and if hypotension and altered mental status are added, that fulfills Reynolds' pentad indicating severe sepsis and organ dysfunction; wait, let me verify that this aligns with the Tokyo framework and contemporary reviews, which it does [^113KsLob] [^113TC6nq] [^114D8yhT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before I examine the cholestatic symptom cluster that specifically points to impaired bile flow. Jaundice together with dark urine from conjugated bilirubinuria and pale or acholic stools from lack of stercobilin are characteristic of obstructive cholestasis, and generalized pruritus from bile salt deposition is a frequent and sometimes early complaint; I should double-check that these features are repeatedly reported across stricture and stone cohorts, which they are [^113eMYsr] [^11147iwv] [^116MRVTF].

> Next, I should review additional gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms that, while less specific, often accompany obstruction and help me gauge acuity. Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and colicky or constant right upper quadrant or epigastric pain are common with choledocholithiasis or tight strictures, and when infection supervenes, fever with chills is typical; in postoperative bile duct injury, I need to check for persistent abdominal pain, distension, and bilious output or collections, which are key early clues and may precede overt jaundice in leaks while strictures tend to present later with recurrent cholangitis [^116MRVTF] [^116XPLCC] [^112281z9].

> I will now examine the objective laboratory pattern because I need to ensure the biochemical profile is cholestatic. A disproportionate elevation in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase with hyperbilirubinemia supports obstruction, with transaminases variably elevated; wait, let me verify prognostic markers in cholangitis, and yes, white blood cell count over twenty thousand and total bilirubin above ten milligrams per deciliter track with worse outcomes and should heighten urgency [^113KsLob] [^113eMYsr].

> Let me think about imaging next, since an anatomic correlate consolidates suspicion. I should confirm that an abdominal ultrasound is the first-line test to look for ductal dilation and stones, with a dilated common bile duct generally over six millimeters when the gallbladder is present and over ten millimeters after cholecystectomy; if the probability of stones is intermediate, MRCP or EUS increases diagnostic yield, and I need to ensure these align with guideline recommendations, which they do [^116G7KBv] [^113TC6nq] [^115iNuFq] [^116MtUyx].

> Now, I should differentiate by underlying cause and timing because the clinical pattern refines pretest probability. For choledocholithiasis, abrupt right upper quadrant pain sometimes radiating to the back with intermittent bouts can occur as stones migrate; for malignant obstruction, I should confirm that painless jaundice, progressive course, weight loss, and the double-duct sign raise concern for periampullary or pancreatic malignancy, although wait, I must note that stones can also produce a double-duct sign and that jaundice markedly increases malignancy likelihood when the sign is present; for postsurgical strictures, delayed cholestatic jaundice with pruritus and recurrent cholangitis weeks to months after cholecystectomy are typical [^116MRVTF] [^111ibRA2] [^116AMF7j] [^11147iwv].

> I need to ensure I flag severity indicators that mandate urgent decompression because delays increase morbidity. Hypotension, altered mental status, acute kidney injury, or other organ dysfunction in the setting of suspected cholangitis signal grade III severity and require prompt biliary drainage, typically with urgent ERCP alongside appropriate resuscitation and antibiotics; let me verify that this is consistent with Tokyo-based recommendations and expert reviews, which it is [^113TC6nq] [^113KsLob].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision frame: jaundice with dark urine and pale stools, right upper quadrant pain, and pruritus comprise a sensitive screening constellation for obstruction, with the addition of fever and a positive Charcot triad substantially increasing specificity; laboratory cholestasis and ductal dilation on ultrasound reinforce the diagnosis, and the ASGE/SAGES criteria help triage the likelihood of common bile duct stones to select MRCP or EUS versus direct ERCP, but wait, I should clarify that while this symptom cluster is highly suggestive of extrahepatic obstruction, intrahepatic cholestasis can occasionally mimic aspects, so imaging and labs remain essential to avoid overcalling obstruction [^111iNMCk] [^114D8yhT] [^117Te9tm] [^116G7KBv].

Blocked bile ducts present with a characteristic clinical and laboratory profile [^116MRVTF]. The most specific signs are **jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, and pale stools** [^1158PRtV] due to impaired bile flow [^113eMYsr]. Right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting are common, and **fever with chills suggests cholangitis** [^113KsLob]. Laboratory tests show **elevated bilirubin, ALP, and GGT** [^111rMqwV] with variable AST/ALT rises [^116MRVTF]. Imaging typically reveals dilated bile ducts and the obstructing lesion [^113eMYsr] [^115iNuFq], and early recognition is essential to prevent complications such as cholangitis [^113KsLob], pancreatitis [^116MRVTF], and biliary cirrhosis [^11147iwv].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms

Blocked bile ducts cause **cholestasis**, leading to bile accumulation and systemic effects. The most common clinical features include:

- **Jaundice**: Yellowing of the skin and sclerae due to elevated bilirubin [^116MRVTF] [^1158PRtV].

- **Pruritus**: Generalized itching from bile salt deposition in the skin [^113eMYsr] [^11147iwv].

- **Dark urine**: Tea- or cola-colored urine from conjugated bilirubin excretion [^111rMqwV] [^116MRVTF].

- **Pale stools**: Clay-colored stools from reduced intestinal bile pigments [^116G7KBv] [^116MRVTF].

- **Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain**: Often colicky, radiating to the back or shoulder [^113eMYsr] [^113KsLob].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common with biliary obstruction [^116MRVTF].

- **Fever and chills**: Suggest cholangitis, a serious infection [^113KsLob].

- **Fatigue and weight loss**: May occur in chronic or malignant obstruction [^1145UGcx] [^113eMYsr].

---

## Laboratory findings

Laboratory tests are **essential** for diagnosing and monitoring blocked bile ducts. Typical abnormalities include:

| **Laboratory test** | **Typical findings in blocked bile ducts** |
|-|-|
| Total bilirubin | Elevated (hyperbilirubinemia) [^111rMqwV] [^116MRVTF] |
| Direct (conjugated) bilirubin | Elevated [^116G7KBv] |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) | Elevated (cholestatic pattern) [^111rMqwV] [^116MRVTF] |
| Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) | Elevated [^111rMqwV] |
| Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) | Mild to moderate elevation [^116MRVTF] |
| Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) | Mild to moderate elevation [^116MRVTF] |
| White blood cell count (WBC) | Elevated in cholangitis or infection [^113KsLob] |

---

## Imaging findings

Imaging studies are **critical** to confirm the diagnosis and identify the cause and location of the obstruction. Common findings include:

- **Dilated bile ducts**: Intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic dilation proximal to the obstruction [^116G7KBv].

- **Visible obstruction**: Stones, strictures, tumors, or other lesions causing blockage [^115iNuFq] [^113eMYsr].

- **Double-duct sign**: Simultaneous dilation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct, often indicating malignancy [^111ibRA2].

- **Bile duct strictures**: Narrowing of the bile ducts, often due to benign or malignant causes [^113eMYsr] [^11147iwv].

---

## Complications of untreated blocked bile ducts

If untreated, blocked bile ducts can cause **severe complications**, including:

- **Cholangitis**: Bacterial infection of the bile ducts, potentially leading to sepsis [^113KsLob].

- **Pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas due to obstruction at the ampulla of Vater [^116MRVTF] [^111Wff3A].

- **Biliary cirrhosis**: Chronic liver damage and scarring from prolonged cholestasis [^11147iwv] [^116aSEYd].

- **Liver failure**: Progressive liver dysfunction due to chronic obstruction [^11147iwv].

- **Biliary strictures**: Permanent narrowing of the bile ducts from chronic inflammation [^11147iwv].

---

Blocked bile ducts present with jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, RUQ pain, and nausea/vomiting [^1158PRtV]. Laboratory tests show elevated bilirubin, ALP, and GGT [^111rMqwV], while imaging reveals dilated bile ducts and the obstruction [^116G7KBv]. Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent complications like **cholangitis [^113KsLob], pancreatitis [^116MRVTF], and biliary cirrhosis** [^116aSEYd].

### Diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis [^113KsLob]. Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholangitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholangitis is a bacterial infection that occurs in the setting of biliary obstruction, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acute cholangitis involves a blockage in the bile ducts, often due to choledocholithiasis or strictures. This blockage allows for the retrograde migration of bacteria from the intestine into the biliary system, leading to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent immune response, which results in inflammation and infection of the bile ducts.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute cholangitis in the US is estimated at 3,000 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute cholangitis often present with the Charcot triad of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain. In severe cases, patients may also exhibit signs of sepsis, such as hypotension and altered mental status.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary and is influenced by factors such as disease severity, the patient's overall health, and the timeliness and effectiveness of treatment. Certain laboratory values, such as a white blood cell count greater than 20,000 cells/mcL and a total bilirubin level greater than 10 mg/dL, have been identified as independent prognostic factors for adverse outcomes.

### Biliary strictures in living donor liver transplantation: Incidence, management, and technical evolution [^11147iwv]. Liver Transplantation (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on biliary stricture:

- **Definition**: Biliary stricture refers to a narrowing or constriction of the bile ducts, which can impede the flow of bile from the liver to the intestine.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology often involves injury to the bile duct, which can result from surgical procedures, trauma, or inflammation due to conditions like cholangitis or choledocholithiasis. This injury can lead to fibrosis and stricture formation.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of biliary stricture is estimated to range between 0.2–0.7% in patients who have undergone cholecystectomy, and 15.2–22.9% at 1 year in living donor liver transplantation.

- **Risk factors**: These include a history of liver transplantation, especially from living donors or following cardiac death, and conditions that cause inflammation or damage to the bile ducts, such as surgical procedures, PSC, and choledocholithiasis.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, biliary stricture can present with jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and abdominal pain. If left untreated, complications can arise, including cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and portal hypertension.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis depends on the underlying cause and the effectiveness of the treatment. However, with appropriate treatment, the prognosis can be favorable.

### Choledocholithiasis: Evaluation, treatment, and outcomes [^116MRVTF]. Seminars in Interventional Radiology (2016). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis is associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions, including liver cirrhosis, nausea, and a dilated common bile duct. Patients may experience pale stools, jaundice, and elevated serum markers such as AST and gamma-glutamyltransferase. Additional symptoms could include loss of appetite, elevated prothrombin time (PT), fever, acute cholecystitis, elevated total bilirubin (TBIL), Crohn's disease, and increased serum triglycerides.

Other related conditions are acute cholangitis, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, rapid weight loss, generalized pruritus, elevated serum ALT, obesity, acute pancreatitis, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), dark urine, and abdominal pain. Hypercholesterolemia, gallstones, vomiting, increased international normalized ratio (INR), and stones in the common bile duct are also possible manifestations.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gallstone disease, specifically in the management of postoperative bile duct injury, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining urgent investigations, including laboratory tests (WBC, bilirubin, LFTs) and imaging (abdominal ultrasound, contrast-enhanced CT, MRCP), to detect bile leaks and/or intra-abdominal fluid in patients suspected of bile duct injury after surgery. The patient should be kept in the hospital under close observation.

### Management of an unclear bile duct stenosis [^11722k2w]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

It is frequently difficult to determine whether a bile duct stricture is benign or harbors a malignant tumor based on medical history alone. Therefore, cholestasis of unknown etiology requires a thorough diagnostic evaluation to make a definitive diagnosis and choose the best course of treatment for the patient. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who developed cholestasis 6 years after undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease. The bile duct was dilated by interventional endoscopy, and a brush cytology was obtained. Cytology revealed an inflammatory reaction. Three months later, the stricture persisted. We performed a forceps biopsy, and the diagnosis of a cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed histologically.

We conclude that a combined application of brush biopsy/forceps biopsy and endoscopic measures is essential in cases of bile duct strictures of unknown etiology. Occasionally, surgical confirmation may be required. In any case, a single brush cytology is insufficient for diagnosis.

### Therapeutic biliary endoscopy [^115QusRE]. Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Some progress has been observed in the field of biliary therapeutic endoscopy. This includes advancements in the understanding and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis, issues related to liver transplantation, malignant biliary strictures, and complications following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, as well as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. These topics are reviewed here.

Tissue sampling can be guided by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if a mass is detected at the level of the biliary stricture. Even if no mass is detected, EUS-guided sampling can still be performed, albeit with lower accuracy. This method also allows for pathological staging of locoregional and distant lymph nodes, the left liver lobe, and ascites that are undetected by other imaging techniques.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) also permits sampling. This can be done at the level of a biliary stricture or the papilla if an ampullary neoplasm or IgG4-associated sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is suspected. Sampling in the biliary tree is recommended whenever a stricture with no established or evident diagnosis, such as an anastomotic stricture following liver transplantation (LT), is demonstrated. Once depreciated, the technique is simple and spares patients from invasive procedures.

Finally, bile may be collected through a nasobiliary or percutaneous drain and prepared for cytopathological examination by centrifugation. Although this technique is cumbersome, it can provide acceptable sensitivity if properly applied on serial samples.

### Impact of gallbladder status on the outcome in patients with retained bile duct stones treated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy [^113FHwNX]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Use of endoscopic therapy in combination with lithotripsy techniques has become increasingly common in patients with complicated common bile duct stones. In many units, although this is controversial, cholecystectomy is then performed, because of possible subsequent cholecystitis and recurrence of choledocholithiasis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether gallbladder status influences the long-term outcome in patients after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) of common bile duct stones.

- **Patients and methods**: Recruited for the study were 120 patients with an average age of 68 years (range 28–86). They were selected from 137 consecutive patients who presented to our department between January 1989 and June 1996 with complicated common bile duct stones, and in whom ESWL was necessary to achieve complete clearance of stones. Follow-up data were obtained from the patients and their general practitioners.

- **Results**: The mean duration of follow-up was 4 years (range 3–9). A total of 37 patients had their gallbladder in situ (group A), while 83 had undergone cholecystectomy. Of these 83 patients, 27 had had a cholecystectomy after ESWL (group B), whereas 56 patients had already had the gallbladder removed when choledocholithiasis was diagnosed (group C). During follow-up, 36 patients (30%) experienced some biliary symptoms. There were no significant differences in the incidence of biliary symptoms between the three groups. Re-exploration of the bile duct by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed important findings.

### Factors impacting the performance characteristics of bile duct brushings: A clinico-cytopathologic analysis of 253 patients [^11263Nv8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Literature on factors impacting bile duct brushings (BDBs) performance characteristics remains limited. This study aims to capture the state of daily practice with BDB sign-out.

Two hundred fifty-three of 444 BDBs signed out by more than seven cytopathologists, with histopathologic and/or clinical follow-up of at least 18 months, were examined. Of these, 135 of 253 BDBs (53%) had histologically confirmed malignancies, 22 (9%) had cancer-related deaths, and 96 (38%) were benign. Cytologic diagnoses in the 444 BDBs were nondiagnostic (11 [2.5%]), negative (284 [64%]), atypical (62 [13.9%]), suspicious (34 [7.7%]), and malignant (53 [11.9%]).

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of malignancy detection were 35%, 100%, 100%, 58%, and 66%, respectively. When atypical, suspicious, and malignant (ASM) categories were combined, sensitivity increased (58%), specificity and PPV dropped (97%), and accuracy increased (73%). Carcinoma type (bile-duct versus pancreatic-ductal) had no effect on accuracy (P = 0.60) or diagnostic class (P = 0.84), nor did time of performance (first 7.5 versus latter 7.5 years, P = 0.13).

Interestingly, ThinPrep + cell block (n = 41) had higher sensitivity (61%) and lower specificity (80%) than ThinPrep only (versus 51% and 100%, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity were higher (47% and 100%) in nonstented than stented specimens (59% and 97%). The relative risk of malignancy for "suspicious" (2.30) and "atypical" (2.28) categories was lower.

### Intraperitoneal bile collections after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: causes, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^111t3En9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2000). Low credibility.

Bile leakage is more common after laparoscopic cholecystectomy than after open surgery. In our department, the rate of postoperative bile collections after open surgery is 0.2% vs. 0.6% after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

- **Methods**: We studied 13 cases of intraperitoneal bile collection without common bile duct damage, drawn from a total of 5,200 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.23%). We analyzed clinical presentation, symptoms, method of diagnosis, causes, time of diagnosis, correlation of time of diagnosis with definitive treatment, and postoperative results.

- **Results**: Symptoms appeared between the 5th and 8th postoperative days. They were observed in patients with either chronic or acute cholecystitis. The main causes were the misapplication of clips at the cystic duct and open Luschka's duct. Ultrasound failed for early recognition of bile collections. Definitive diagnosis was made by repeat ultrasonography, CAT scan, and ERCP.

- **Conclusion**: The ideal treatment in these cases is a minimally invasive procedure. However, since the diagnosis is frequently delayed, open surgery is performed in the majority of patients. There were no mortalities in this group of patients.

### Role of alphavbeta6 integrin in acute biliary fibrosis [^111hWtWw]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute biliary obstruction leads to periductal myofibroblasts and fibrosis, the origin of which is uncertain. Our study provides new information on this question in mice and humans. We show that bile duct obstruction induces a striking increase in cholangiocyte alphavbeta6 integrin and that expression of this integrin is directly linked to fibrogenesis through activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Administration of blocking antibody to alphavbeta6 significantly reduces the extent of acute fibrosis after bile duct ligation. Moreover, in beta6-null mice subjected to the injury, fibrosis is reduced by 50% relative to that seen in wild-type mice, whereas inflammation occurs to the same extent. The data indicate that alphavbeta6, rather than inflammation, is linked to fibrogenesis. It is known that alphavbeta6 binds latent TGF-beta and that binding results in release of active TGFbeta. Consistent with this, intracellular signaling from the TGFbeta receptor is increased after bile duct ligation in wild-type mice but not in beta6(-/-) mice, and a competitive inhibitor of the TGFbeta receptor type II blocks fibrosis to the same extent as antibody to alphavbeta6. In a survey of human liver disease, expression of alphavbeta6 is increased in acute, but not chronic, biliary injury and is localized to cholangiocyte-like cells.

Cholangiocytes respond to acute bile duct obstruction with markedly increased expression of alphavbeta6 integrin, which is closely linked to periductal fibrogenesis. The findings provide a rationale for the use of inhibitors of alphavbeta6 and TGFbeta signaling in acute biliary fibrosis management.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation of suspected choledocholithiasis [^111iNMCk]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). High credibility.

The clinical calculator known as "ASGE/SAGES criteria for stratification of common bile duct stones" is used for conditions such as acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The ASGE/SAGES criteria, also known as the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons criteria, serves as a clinical calculator for stratifying the risk of common bile duct stones. It is specifically applicable to patients suspected of having these stones, particularly those presenting with symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, or abnormal liver function tests.

The clinical utility of the ASGE/SAGES criteria lies in its predictive ability regarding the likelihood of common bile duct stones, thereby informing the need for further diagnostic procedures such as ERCP or intraoperative cholangiography. The criteria consider a variety of factors including clinical symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for employing the ASGE/SAGES criteria. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this scoring system is not applicable to patients without suspected common bile duct stones or those who have already received a definitive diagnosis.

The ASGE/SAGES criteria assist in determining the risk level of having common bile duct stones by evaluating several clinical and laboratory parameters. Here's how it works:

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^114t6MBf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) was founded in 2007 with the mission of promoting training and continuing medical education in emergency general surgery and trauma. Since its establishment, the WSES has curated several clinical guidelines for specific topics related to emergency and trauma surgery, which are regularly updated to provide evidence-based guidance to emergency surgeons in their daily practice. The present manuscript describes the international work conducted by WSES members to build consensus guidelines for detecting and managing one of the most severe complications of cholecystectomy, namely, bile duct injury (BDI).

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard operation for patients with gallstone disease and represents one of the most common routine interventions performed worldwide in both elective and emergency settings. Bile duct injuries (BDIs) are dangerous complications of cholecystectomy, occurring more frequently since the introduction and widespread adoption of laparoscopy (0.4–1.5% of cases) compared to open cholecystectomy (0.2–0.3% of cases). Since early reports, the frequency of BDIs during LC has been progressively decreasing. However, the injuries seen currently tend to be more severe, with the most severe biliary and hepatic artery or portal vein injuries often occurring after conversion from laparoscopy to open cholecystectomy.

BDIs are a surgical challenge associated with significant postoperative sequelae for the patient in terms of morbidity and mortality.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholangitis, specifically in the context of intraoperative management of bile duct injuries, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining intraoperative consultation with an expert center for type D lesions. It is advised to perform only subhepatic drainage initially and refer the patient to an expert center. Late reconstruction should be performed after 6–8 weeks, often using hepatico-jejunostomy.

### The ascending pathophysiology of cholestatic liver disease [^1176nD48]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

In this review, we develop the argument that cholestatic liver diseases, particularly primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), evolve over time with an anatomically ascending course of the disease process. The initial lesions occur in "downstream" bile ducts, eventually leading to cholestasis. This results in bile salt (BS)-mediated toxic injury of the "upstream" liver parenchyma. BS are toxic in high concentrations, which are present in the canalicular network, bile ducts, and gallbladder. Leakage of bile from this network and ducts could be an important driver of toxicity. The liver has a considerable capacity to adapt to cholestasis, potentially contributing to a variable symptom-poor interval that is often observed.

Trials with drugs targeting BS toxicity are effective in only about 50%-60% of primary biliary cholangitis patients, with no effective therapy available for PSC. This motivated us to develop and propose a new view on the pathophysiology of primary biliary cholangitis and PSC, hoping that these new drugs can be used more effectively. These views may lead to better stratification of these diseases and recommendations on a more "tailored" use of the new therapeutic agents currently tested in clinical trials.

- **Apical sodium-dependent BS transporter inhibitors**: These reduce intestinal BS absorption, lower the BS load, and are best used in cholestatic patients.

- **BS synthesis-suppressing drugs**: The effectiveness of drugs such as farnesoid X receptor agonists is greatest when optimal adaptation is not yet established.

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^116NGcw4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Management of minor BDIs: Minor bile duct injuries (e.g. Strasberg A-D) require a step-up approach once diagnosed. Common symptoms, such as abdominal pain or distension, fever, and nausea, when noted in the postoperative period, may indicate postoperative complications. In the presence of bile leakage from the drain, observation and non-operative management are advisable during the first hours. If no drain was placed after surgery and imaging reveals a bile collection with suspicion of minor BDI, such as a cystic duct leak or duct of Luschka, percutaneous drainage of the collection may be the definitive treatment. Several case series have reported the feasibility of drainage under endoscopic ultrasound guidance, but more data are needed before this approach can be recommended for this specific clinical situation.

If no improvements or worsening of symptoms occur, endoscopic management becomes mandatory. The same is true for low output biliary fistulas (i.e. a bile leak from the liver bed such as a Luschka's duct). Various endoscopic treatments, such as biliary stenting, endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy, and nasobiliary drainage, are highly effective to treat biliary leaks, except in the case of transection of the common bile duct or common hepatic duct. The time lapse between biliary injury and endoscopic treatment does not seem to significantly impact treatment outcomes.

Role of ERCP in BDI management: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the key tool in the management of BDIs because it allows the identification of the site of bile leak and, most importantly, permits internal biliary drainage if the diagnosis of minor BDI.

### Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in patients with dilated vs. nondilated bile ducts: technical considerations and complications [^111jxeke]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Complications occurred in 34 out of 253 interventions (13%), with 29 out of 34 being clinically significant. A complication rate of 13.9% (14 out of 101) was observed in interventions with nondilated bile ducts and 9.9% (15 out of 152) for interventions in dilated bile ducts, showing no statistically significant difference (p = 0.33). Post-interventional cholangitis was more frequent in patients with dilated bile ducts compared to those with nondilated bile ducts (9 out of 152 vs. 2 out of 101; p = 0.132). All cases of intervention-associated cholangitis were managed with antibiotic therapy.

Hemorrhage occurred exclusively after interventions in nondilated bile ducts (5 out of 101) and required a blood transfusion in 2 of those 5 cases. In an additional 2 out of 5 patients, coil embolization of pseudoaneurysms of the hepatic artery was necessary to manage the hemorrhage. One patient died due to hemorrhagic shock. This patient had received a biliodigestive anastomosis to repair an iatrogenic bile leakage, which led to septic shock. Thirteen days after the intervention, the patient underwent coil embolization of a pseudoaneurysm of the right hepatic artery due to active bleeding. Despite the intervention, bleeding signs persisted, and a laparoscopy revealed diffuse venous peri-capsular bleeding, which was treated with peri-hepatic packing. The patient died 2 days later due to multiorgan insufficiency. Complications are illustrated in Table 2.

### Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography versus intraoperative cholangiography for diagnosis of common bile duct stones [^1128fpqB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) are tests used in the diagnosis of common bile duct stones in people suspected of having common bile duct stones. There has been no systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of ERCP and IOC.

- **Objectives**: To determine and compare the accuracy of ERCP and IOC for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and ClinicalTrials.gov to September 2012. To identify additional studies, we searched the references of included studies and systematic reviews identified from various databases, such as the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Medion, and Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility (ARIF). We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies that provided the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for ERCP or IOC. We accepted studies that confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones by extraction of the stones, irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods, for a positive test. Absence of common bile duct stones was confirmed by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom-free follow-up for at least six months for a negative test as the reference standard in people suspected of having common bile duct stones.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^1178tsxF]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection, and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery, and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS.

The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then, several developments in management have occurred, along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol, and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholangitis, particularly the intraoperative management of bile duct injuries, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining urgent investigations in patients with suspected bile duct injury after surgery. This includes laboratory tests (such as white blood count, bilirubin, and liver enzymes) and imaging studies (like abdominal ultrasound, contrast-enhanced CT, and MRCP) to detect bile leaks and/or intra-abdominal fluid. Patients should be kept in the hospital under close observation during this process.

### Ultrasound versus liver function tests for diagnosis of common bile duct stones [^116A5Ru9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasound and liver function tests (serum bilirubin and serum alkaline phosphatase) are used as screening tests for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones in people suspected of having common bile duct stones. There has been no systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and liver function tests.

- **Objectives**: To determine and compare the accuracy of ultrasound versus liver function tests for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, BIOSIS, and Clinicaltrials.gov to September 2012. We searched the references of included studies to identify further studies and systematic reviews from various databases (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Health Technology Assessment, Medion, and ARIF - Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility). We did not restrict studies based on language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies that provided the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for ultrasound, serum bilirubin, or serum alkaline phosphatase. We only accepted studies that confirmed the presence of common bile duct stones by extraction of the stones (irrespective of whether this was done by surgical or endoscopic methods) for a positive test result, and absence of common bile duct stones by surgical or endoscopic negative exploration of the common bile duct, or symptom-free follow-up for at least six months for a negative test result.

### A simultaneous endoscopic and laparoscopic approach for management of early iatrogenic bile duct obstruction [^117B5eNE]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Bile duct occlusion secondary to inadvertent application of a surgical clip or suture is usually managed with endoscopic or surgical exploration.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel method of simultaneous endoscopic and laparoscopic approach in patients with acute iatrogenic bile duct obstruction.

- **Design**: Single arm study and single center design.

- **Setting**: University medical center.

- **Patients**: Three consecutive patients diagnosed with complete or near-complete obstruction of a bile duct after cholecystectomy were identified for inclusion.

- **Interventions**: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and laparoscopy were performed simultaneously. The surgeon removes the surgical clips or sutures from the bile duct while the endoscopist uses ERCP to assess and treat bile duct injury following resolution of the block.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Technical and clinical success rate and adverse events.

Results show that all patients were seen between 5 and 7 days after cholecystectomy. The diagnosis of an obstructed bile duct was established by ERCP. The guidewire failed to negotiate across the obstruction in one patient. In another patient, a guidewire could be passed, but a biliary stent could not be deployed across the high-grade stricture. In a third patient, only a single biliary stent (7F × 11 cm) could be placed across the obstruction, with significant difficulty. In all the patients, simultaneous ERCP and laparoscopy were performed immediately to remove the surgical clips and/or sutures from the bile duct, followed by further intervention as necessary.

### Bile duct crystals do not contribute to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction [^113jZGoT]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Microlithiasis has been proposed as a cause of both occult gallbladder disease and idiopathic pancreatitis. Theoretically, microlithiasis could also cause postcholecystectomy pain by causing temporary biliary obstruction and may be more common in patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. The frequency of crystals in bile duct aspirates was assessed from patients with symptoms after cholecystectomy, both with and without elevated baseline sphincter of Oddi pressures.

- **Methods**: A prospective analysis was performed on all patients with recurrent biliary pain after cholecystectomy who presented for ERCP and manometry between January 1998 and June 2000. All patients had aspirates obtained from the common bile duct for crystal analysis using the aspirating port of the manometry catheter before the injection of contrast. Four to 20 mL of bile was examined by microscopy for both cholesterol and bilirubinate crystals.

- **Results**: Sixty patients (83% women, mean age 44 years) were studied. Thirty-five had normal baseline biliary sphincter pressures and 25 had elevated biliary baseline sphincter pressures (> 40 mm Hg). Two patients in the normal pressure group and one in the elevated pressure group had cholesterol crystals present in their aspirate. No patient had bilirubinate crystals present. A 5% frequency of microlithiasis was identified overall.

- **Conclusions**: Bile duct crystals occur infrequently in patients with symptoms after cholecystectomy and are found in patients with both normal and abnormal biliary sphincter manometry.

### Intra and extra-hepatic cystadenoma of the biliary duct. Review of literature and radiological and pathological characteristics of a very rare case [^1159hsAP]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Painless obstructive jaundice is often associated with a malignant disease of the common bile duct or head of the pancreas. The authors present a unique case of a 62-year-old woman affected by an intrahepatic cystadenoma that extended into the common biliary duct. To our knowledge, no previous case reports have been published on similar cases. After undergoing an en-block hepatic and bile duct resection, this patient is doing well without signs of recurrent disease.

### Primary biliary cholangitis and the narrowing gap towards optimal disease control [^115LahSZ]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Although infrequent, primary biliary cholangitis is not indolent and remains a burdensome chronic autoimmune biliary disease. Progressive biliary injury and cholestasis result in complications of biliary cirrhosis, with reduced quality and quantity of life. Treatment advances beyond ursodeoxycholic acid and liver transplantation are notable, as efforts grow to prevent end-stage liver disease. Early identification of individuals at greatest risk for progression, in advance of cirrhosis, enhances treatment benefits. Intuitive care focuses on the best outcomes, such as biochemical control of disease (e.g. normal alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) and mitigation of symptoms (e.g. pruritus). A multi-faceted approach to targeted therapeutic options is emerging to apply therapy beyond bile acid pool modification (ursodeoxycholic acid), including farnesoid X receptor agonism, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonism, and ileal bile acid transporter inhibition.

Obstacles to evaluating treatments include a prolonged clinical course, the difficulty in conducting long-term placebo-controlled studies, and challenges in measuring quality of life effects. Generating robust, contemporaneous real-world evidence is therefore important in the primary biliary cholangitis space.

### What is the role of endotherapy in chronic pancreatitis [^116Djr7d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) can have a debilitating clinical course due to chronic abdominal pain, malnutrition, and related complications. Medical, endoscopic, and surgical treatment of CP should aim to control symptoms, prevent the progression of the disease, and correct complications. Endoscopic management plays a specific role in carefully selected patients as a primary interventional therapy when medical measures fail or in high-risk surgical candidates. Endotherapy for CP is also utilized as a bridge to surgery or to assess potential response to pancreatic surgery.

In this review, we address the role of endotherapy for the relief of pancreatic duct (PD) and bile duct obstruction, closure of PD leaks, and drainage of pseudocysts in the setting of CP. In addition, endotherapy for the relief of pancreatic pain by endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block for CP is discussed.

### Bile duct injury in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^113bdnzK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard of care for symptomatic cholelithiasis, but it is associated with a higher incidence of bile duct injury than the open approach.

- **Methods**: A review was performed of the English language literature on the management of bile duct injury listed on MEDLINE databases.

- **Results and conclusion**: There is consensus that careful dissection and correct interpretation of the anatomy avoids the complication of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy. Routine intraoperative cholangiography is associated with a lower incidence and early recognition of bile duct injury. Early detection and repair are associated with an improved outcome, and the minimum standard of care after the recognition of a bile duct injury is immediate referral to a surgeon experienced in bile duct injury repair. Surgery provides the mainstay of treatment, with proximal hepaticojejunostomy Roux-en-Y being the operation of choice; a selective role for endoscopic or radiological treatment exists. The outcome after bile duct injury remains poor, especially in relation to the initial expectation of the cholecystectomy, often committing patients to a decade of follow-up.

### Diagnosis and management of cholestatic liver disease [^116p4tWE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Cholestasis, the slowing of bile flow, may be acute or chronic and affect any age group. In infants and children, the causes are often congenital or inherited. As a result of improved management, some affected children now survive to adulthood. Although jaundice is a hallmark of cholestasis, it may be absent, particularly in adults with chronic cholestatic liver disease, most of whom are entirely asymptomatic. A detailed history and physical examination are crucial for diagnosis, and noninvasive radiologic tests — such as ultrasound, computerized tomography scan, and magnetic resonance cholangiography — greatly facilitate diagnosis, particularly when the cause is extrahepatic. Only if sufficient portal tracts (more than 10) are present on liver biopsy examination can this test reliably evaluate damage to the small bile ducts.

- **Therapy considerations**: Therapy should address both the cause and the consequences of retained bile acids within the liver and the diminished delivery of bile to the gastrointestinal tract. It should also address symptoms, mostly pruritus, and prevent conditions like osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Portal hypertension can occur early in chronic cholestatic liver disease, sometimes before the development of cirrhosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid improves the biochemical markers of cholestasis regardless of cause and may delay liver disease progression; only a liver transplant is potentially curative.

### Management of extrahepatic bile duct cysts [^116jzQYf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Bile duct cysts are rare anomalies that remain poorly understood. They are more common in the Asian population and are often found and treated during childhood. In Western countries, bile duct cysts are more commonly discovered incidentally in adults or as part of the work-up for jaundice or non-specific upper abdominal symptoms. Often referred to as 'choledochal cysts', even in contemporary literature, biliary dilatation can occur throughout the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. Thus, the terms 'bile duct cyst' or 'biliary tract cyst' are preferred.

### Cholecysto-hepatic duct serving as the only drainage pathway of bile from the intrahepatic to the extrahepatic biliary system in an infant: A case report [^116rhrqm]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

MRCP image shows no common hepatic duct (CHD) in its anatomic location, and there is a duct connecting the right anterior hepatic duct (RAHD) to the neck of the gallbladder (GB) as a cholecystohepatic duct. Trifurcation of the right anterior (RAHD), right posterior (RPHD), and left hepatic duct (LHD) is visualized. The diameter of the common bile duct (CBD) is normal, and the intrahepatic bile ducts are mildly dilated according to the patient's age.

The patient was treated with Cefotaxime and Amikacin due to a positive colostomy culture, along with Ursodeoxycholic acid. The symptoms and laboratory data improved, and the patient was discharged in seven days.

He remained symptom-free in the following six months when he was recalled for the final surgery, at which colon interposition was performed. During this surgery, the porta hepatis was explored as well; no fibroproliferative tissue was present at the anatomic site of the CHD, indicating biliary agenesis rather than atresia. The post-operative days were uneventful, and he was discharged with no symptoms, including icterus.

Concerning the patient's biliary anomaly, and as he remained symptom-free on medical treatment (Ursodeoxycholic acid), close follow-up was preferred upon surgery. He did well in the subsequent 15 months and is yet to be followed.

### Viberzi [^113qZdwX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Viberzi is contraindicated in certain patients due to the increased risk of serious adverse reactions:

- **Patients without a gallbladder**: These patients are at increased risk of developing pancreatitis and/or sphincter of Oddi spasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

- **Patients with known or suspected biliary duct obstruction or sphincter of Oddi disease or dysfunction**: There is an increased risk for sphincter of Oddi spasm in these individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Patients with alcoholism, alcohol abuse, or alcohol addiction, or those consuming more than 3 alcoholic beverages per day**: These individuals face an increased risk for acute pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Patients with a history of pancreatitis or structural diseases of the pancreas, including known or suspected pancreatic duct obstruction**: There is a heightened risk for acute pancreatitis in these cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Patients with known hypersensitivity reaction to Viberzi**: Monitor for allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)**: These patients are at risk for significantly increased plasma concentrations of eluxadoline [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Patients with a history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation, or known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction**: Such patients may be at risk for severe complications of bowel obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Vanishing bile duct syndrome: A sequela of temozolomide and levetiracetam-induced cholestatic liver injury [^115D7FDE]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

If the patient in this case had received weekly or bi-weekly monitoring with liver function tests (LFTs), or if the patient had presented for evaluation immediately after symptom onset, the liver injury may have been detected sooner. With earlier detection, the medications could have been discontinued earlier as well.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can present with three different patterns of injury: hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic. In hepatocellular liver injury, symptoms of fatigue and weakness are most common. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) are markedly elevated, while alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are only mildly elevated. In these cases, liver biopsy will reveal liver cell necrosis and inflammation.

In cholestatic liver injury, the most common symptoms are right upper quadrant pain, itching, and jaundice. Laboratory evaluation will reveal elevated ALP and GGT with minimal elevations in AST and ALT. Histologically, the liver tissue will have evidence of bile stasis, portal inflammation, and injury to the bile ducts. Mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury is most commonly seen with DILI. These cases will have hepatocyte inflammation and necrosis as well as bile stasis.

Vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS) is a rare and serious outcome of DILI. It is identified by the loss of intrahepatic bile ducts on histology. This typically occurs in cholestatic liver injury about 1–6 months after the onset of initial liver injury. Symptoms of VBDS are similar to those of DILI with pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, dyslipidemia, and skin xanthomata. There are three elements in the diagnosis of VBDS. The first is persistent elevations in ALP and bilirubin for more than 6 months.

### Cholestasis-induced adaptive remodeling of interlobular bile ducts [^111oUnaY]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Morphometry of the terminal branches of the biliary tree that penetrate the functional unit of the liver — namely, the hepatic lobules — is only accessible through 3D confocal microscopy. The response of these interlobular ducts has not been documented thus far. The present study provides the first description of the response of structures ranging from 0.207 to 30 μm in 3D, thereby illuminating the blind spot between the large bile ducts and bile canaliculi. Whereas previous studies focusing on large (∼200 μm) bile ducts have reported the major alteration to be an increase in duct diameter, events in the range of smaller bile ducts are much more complex.

The adaptive tissue response described herein seems finely tuned to optimize the interface of the duct lumen to the cholangiocyte apical membrane. The parameter showing the maximal increase is the luminal surface area, which is achieved through lengthening and the hitherto unknown component of corrugation. In contrast, the parameter that would maximize the duct volume — the ductular diameter — remains unchanged. The cholangiocyte apical membrane contains a plethora of bile salt transporters, aquaporins, and ion channels that modulate bile composition. BDL-induced cholestasis can only be resolved by reabsorption of bile constituents via the cholangiocytes.

Adaptive responses at the cellular level, such as up-regulation and recruitment of bile transporters to their apical membrane in response to cholestasis, have been demonstrated previously. The present study describes a tissue-level adaptive response that augments these findings.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^116iJ9kQ]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

In rare cases, there can be retrograde passage of gallstones into the common hepatic duct or the right or left main hepatic ducts, or stones can form in intrahepatic ducts due to biliary stasis.

If a gallstone passes down the common bile duct and comes to rest at the ampulla of Vater, it may block the drainage of the pancreatic duct, causing back pressure on the pancreatic cells and resulting in gallstone pancreatitis. Patients present with epigastric pain radiating to the back, and the severity ranges from mild to severe. There is significant mortality associated with severe pancreatitis, and critically ill patients should be managed in a high dependency or intensive care monitored environment. While imaging is not usually required or indicated to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, an ultrasound of the gallbladder can confirm or rule out the presence of gallstones. CT of the abdomen and pelvis is best performed 48 hours after the onset of symptoms to assess for complications of pancreatitis, such as peripancreatic collections or pancreatic necrosis (Fig. 20).

- **Fig. 20**: Axial contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen (a) and axial fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI of the abdomen (b) in the same patient demonstrating extensive inflammation and edema of the pancreas secondary to gallstone pancreatitis with a peripancreatic collection (arrow).

In general, larger gallstones are more likely to obstruct higher in the common bile duct, and as such, are more likely to cause obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. Smaller gallstones are more likely to cause pancreatitis as they more freely pass through the ductal systems.

### Hepatobiliary anomalies associated with ABCB4/MDR3 deficiency in adults: a pictorial essay [^113WxKJ8]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

When bile duct dilatations are present, they appear as mild to moderate. Rarely, patients may present with more severe dilatations (< 10%). Such severe bile duct dilatation may only involve one or two liver segments or may be diffuse (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). In such cases, and as opposed to ductal plate malformations — such as Caroli disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and congenital cystic anomalies of the common bile duct — which are directly related to abnormal embryological development of the bile ducts, abnormalities are related to a biliogenesis disorder developed on initially normal ducts. Anomalies result from the chronic alteration of bile composition, causing damage to the biliary epithelium.

Bile duct abnormalities are demonstrated as unifocal or multifocal non-cystic large spindle-shaped bile duct dilatations (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). However, ductal plate malformations, particularly Caroli disease, must be ruled out by the absence of specific features, such as the "central dot sign", dilated bile ducts associated with focal areas of cystic ectasia, or the fact that no biliary dilatation can be found in LPAC syndrome without underlying biliary stones. Another possible differential diagnosis is bile duct dilatations related to a focal obstacle on the biliary ducts. Traditionally, downstream-acquired stenosis — such as iatrogenic, biliodigestive anastomosis, sclerosing cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma — can lead to obstructive dilatations that appear more central without intrahepatic lithiasis.

### Intraductal growth-type mucin-producing peripheral cholangiocarcinoma associated with biliary papillomatosis [^115bLJcm]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old woman with upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting was admitted. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked dilation and "crowding" of the segment 4 bile ducts, with an area suspicious for a stone or tumor. Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography revealed multiple filling defects in the segment 4 bile ducts, as well as the left and common hepatic ducts. A left hepatectomy and cholecystectomy was performed. Dilated bile ducts containing mucinous material and a mass in the cystically dilated bile ducts of segment 4 were detected during the gross examination, showing continuity within the surrounding dilated bile ducts. The dilated bile ducts of segments 2 and 3 contained mucinous material without any apparent mass formation.

Microscopically, the bile ducts were lined by biliary epithelium displaying simple and complex papillary structures with moderate to severe degrees of dysplastic changes. The mass was composed of complex papillary structures filling the bile duct with a few foci of invasion. The papillary structures were composed of mucin-producing columnar cells as well as cells with oncocytic appearance. Patchy cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 19, hepatocyte paraffin 1, MUC2, and CDX2 immunopositivities were observed. Biliary papillomatosis, mucin-producing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and intraductal papillary-type peripheral cholangiocarcinoma are part of the same disease spectrum of papillary biliary neoplasm and are termed intraductal papillary neoplasm of the liver. Mucinous hypersecretion and signs of mucobilia are considered specific characteristics.

### Equetro [^117NmBMq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Liver damage**: Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have been reported. In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as serious dermatologic reactions and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms/multiorgan hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

	- Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since liver damage may occur. The drug should be discontinued immediately in cases of aggravated liver dysfunction or active liver disease.

- **AV heart block**: AV heart block, including second and third-degree block, has been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances.

- **Hepatic porphyria**: The use of Equetro should be avoided in patients with a history of hepatic porphyria (e.g. acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda). Acute attacks have been reported in such patients receiving carbamazepine.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^114D8yhT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The Modified American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) / Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) criteria is a clinical calculator used for stratification of common bile duct stones. This scoring system is specifically applicable to patients suspected of having common bile duct stones, often presenting with symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, or abnormal liver function tests.

The clinical utility of the Modified ASGE/SAGES criteria is to predict the likelihood of common bile duct stones and guide the need for further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The criteria consider various factors including clinical symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator. However, it may not be as accurate in patients with atypical presentations or in those with other hepatobiliary diseases that could confound the clinical picture.

The Modified ASGE/SAGES criteria is a tool used to estimate the risk of common bile duct stones by evaluating certain factors. The process involves answering seven questions that relate to specific clinical indicators. Each of these factors, if present, is assigned a predetermined score, and the sum of these scores gives an overall risk level.

Furthermore, an extensive review has been conducted on the benefits (or lack thereof) of preoperative biliary drainage in cases of malignant obstructive jaundice.

### Management of common bile duct stones: Selective endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and endoscopic sphincterotomy: Short- and long-term results [^116VadSx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones are still a frequent problem. Although new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are continually being developed, they remain poorly defined. Therefore, we decided to evaluate our standard method of diagnosing and treating common bile duct stones. The aim of the study was to determine the short- and long-term results of this method.

- **Methods**: Between 1985 and 1995, 552 consecutive patients (200 men and 352 women; median age, 69 years) underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) due to suspected common bile duct stones. If stones were detected, they were treated endoscopically, if possible. The results and complications of this process were recorded. Patients were followed for 1–13 years after undergoing ERC and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES). Long-term results and complications during this period were also recorded.

- **Results**: ERC was attempted in 552 patients and succeeded in 510 patients (92%). Endoscopic sphincterotomy was attempted in 315 patients and failed in five (98%). Duct clearance was achieved in 271 patients; in 26 of these patients, symptoms disappeared spontaneously. Ten patients underwent common bile duct exploration. Complications occurred in 46 patients (8.3%). Mortality was 0.4%; hemorrhage occurred in 3.6%, pancreatitis in 1.4%, sepsis and cholangitis also in 1.4%, and the lithotripter basket became impacted in four patients (0.8%), necessitating common bile duct exploration. During follow-up, 45 patients (8%) returned: 35 with residual stones, five with cholangitis, two with stenosis of the papilla of Vater, and one with biliary obstruction.

### Recurrent pancreatitis as a late complication of endoscopic sphincterotomy for common bile duct stones: Diagnosis and therapy [^111YDK5s]. Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Although long-term complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) have often been reported, the possible effects of the procedure on the pancreatic duct orifice remain virtually unknown. Three female patients are described who developed attacks of recurrent pancreatitis at 2, 7, and 27 months after ES for bile duct stones. These attacks were apparently caused by a partial stenosis of the pancreatic orifice, arising from post-procedure fibrosis and scarring. The patients were evaluated and treated endoscopically. All three patients benefited from endoscopic therapy; two became symptom-free and one improved. Symptoms recurred in the three patients after 26, 41, and 23 months, respectively. In one patient, re-stenosis was documented, and repeat sphincterotomy resulted in complete relief of symptoms during the ensuing 5 months. In the remaining two patients, the symptoms were mild, and no further intervention was needed.

Concerning complications, one patient suffered moderately severe pancreatitis without sequelae. Recurrent pancreatitis may emerge as a late complication after ES for common bile duct stones. It is probably causally related to stenosis of the pancreatic orifice brought about by fibrosis and scarring, which may exceptionally develop after the procedure. Endoscopic therapy should probably be considered in the first instance, but the optimal treatment for this condition remains to be determined.

### Management of malignant biliary obstruction [^112NeQHA]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Malignant bile duct obstruction is not uncommon, particularly in the later stages of disease, and may result in significant deterioration in the patient's quality of life, especially if the patient becomes pruritic. Patients who have undergone previous interventions, such as surgery with bilioenteric bypass, sphincterotomy, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, may present with cholangitis. Moreover, obstructive jaundice can preclude the use of certain chemotherapeutic agents either due to increased toxicity or because they require hepatic metabolism or excretion. This article discusses the indications for drainage in this patient population, technical considerations that may be unique to this patient population, and technical suggestions for performing drainage that may be helpful.

### Asymptomatic common bile duct stones [^11493rSV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2000). Low credibility.

Patients with asymptomatic bile duct stones exhibit typical signs, such as elevated liver function tests, dilated bile ducts on ultrasound, and a history of jaundice or pancreatitis. The incidence of asymptomatic bile duct stones is about 10%, but up to 2% of patients show no signs of the disease. Bile duct stones can be diagnosed using clinical judgment, scoring systems, or discriminant function tests. Which diagnostic modality is most reliable, cost-effective, and safe varies with different hospitals. Similarly, the most effective, safe, and economical therapy also varies among different departments. However, in the future, an increasing number of departments will likely adopt the one-stage laparoscopic approach.

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^116XPLCC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical signs and symptoms of BDI are diverse. The most frequent complaints of patients with bile duct injury (BDI) include persistent abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and/or vomiting, fever, and jaundice. The clinical presentations of BDI are related to the type of injury. The two most common clinical scenarios are bile leakage and bile duct obstruction.

- **Visible signs**: In patients with a bile leak, an early visible sign is the presence of bile from the drain or surgical incision. If the subhepatic region is not drained, a perihepatic bile collection (biloma), abscess, or biliary peritonitis may develop with corresponding clinical signs. Generally, jaundice is not observed or is mild in these cases because cholestasis does not occur.

- **Symptoms of biliary strictures**: Symptoms are often delayed, including cholestatic jaundice with choluria, fecal acholia, and pruritus. If cholangitis develops, fever with chills is typically associated with jaundice. Cholangitis is considered the main consequence of bile duct stricture, which can lead to hepatic injury and dysfunction due to complete bile duct occlusion. Sepsis and multiorgan failure may develop in both clinical settings.

When BDI is not identified intraoperatively or during the first postoperative week, patients may experience an insidious evolution with recurrent abdominal pain, cholangitis, and bile collections. A late diagnosis, sometimes made years after surgery following multiple ineffective repairs or inappropriate management, can result in increased complexity of bile duct repair.

### Rare case of Mirizzi syndrome associated with cholecystogastric fistula [^111iPDH4]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A woman in her mid-30s presented with upper right quadrant abdominal pain. On examination, there was mild upper right quadrant tenderness and negative Murphy's sign. Basic laboratory investigations revealed normal results except for elevated alkaline phosphatase. Subsequent imaging revealed chronic calculous cholecystitis and the dilated common bile duct harboring stones, with pneumobilia. The patient underwent open cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration. Intraoperatively, the gallbladder was found contracted and densely adherent to, and fistulizing with, the common bile duct and stomach.

### Challenging biliary strictures: Pathophysiological features, differential diagnosis, diagnostic algorithms, and new clinically relevant biomarkers - part 1 [^112Ms3GZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In Western countries, iatrogenic strictures account for up to 80% of all benign strictures.

- **Post-cholecystectomy**: Although the incidence of biliary injuries at laparoscopy has recently decreased to figures similar to those reported with open cholecystectomy (0.08–0.3%), cholecystectomy remains a frequent cause of biliary stricture. These most often involve the CBD, the hilum, or the right hepatic duct (Figure 9). Patients typically present with jaundice or pain, sometimes associated with cholangitis. Various classifications of post-surgical biliary strictures have been proposed. MRCP can be used to identify not only the level of the stricture but may also reveal a bile leak, an obstructed segment lacking continuity with the biliary tree, or focal liver atrophy.

- **Post-liver transplantation**: Biliary strictures may be anastomotic or non-anastomotic. Anastomotic strictures complicate approximately 6–12% and 34% of deceased and living donor LT procedures, respectively. Non-anastomotic strictures are located more than 5 mm proximal to the anastomosis and account for 10–25% of all strictures complicating LT; they may result from ischaemia (e.g. hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis, prolonged cold or warm ischaemia) or from receiver disease (e.g. PSC). They are usually multiple and longer than anastomotic strictures (Figure 10), and may progress to the intrahepatic ducts. Endoscopy has become the first-line treatment; it is technically more difficult for non-anastomotic strictures than for anastomotic strictures, and in the case of hepatic artery thrombosis.

### Genetics and treatment of bile duct stones: new approaches [^114ieuVm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The global burden of gallstones is increasing. Although the gallbladder is the most common site for gallstone formation, 10–25% of patients display concurrent gallbladder and bile duct stones. Secondary stones are differentiated from primary stones that develop de novo in the biliary tree. Overall, the natural history of bile duct stones is less well defined, and their diagnosis and treatment are more complex compared to gallbladder stones.

- **Recent findings**: Elevated liver function tests are not always reflective of bile duct stones, and noninvasive diagnosis by endoscopic ultrasound or MRI should be pursued in ambiguous cases. For treatment, recent studies report endoscopic dilation results in similar clearance but lower complication and recurrence rates compared to sphincterotomy. Pharmacological adjuvants such as ursodeoxycholic acid with sphincterotomy and stenting have been suggested for elderly patients. Indication and timing of cholecystectomy after endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones are critical, and early cholecystectomy within 3–7 days prevents recurrent biliary events.

- **Summary**: In this review, we address the pathophysiology of bile duct stones and present the latest developments in the diagnosis and treatment of this challenging condition, with a consideration of stone recurrence.

### Conjugated bile acids accelerate progression of pancreatic cancer metastasis via S1PR2 signaling in cholestasis [^116kM8di]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) has an extremely high mortality rate, with obstructive jaundice due to cholestasis being a classic symptom. Conjugated bile acids (CBAs) such as taurocholic acid (TCA) have been reported to activate both the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways via S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2), promoting the growth of cholangiocarcinoma. Thus, we hypothesize that CBAs, which accumulate in cholestasis, accelerate PC progression via S1PR2.

- **Methods**: Murine Panc02-luc and human AsPC-1, MIA PaCa2, and BxPC-3 cells were treated with TCA, S1PR2 agonist CYM5520, S1PR2 antagonist JTE-013, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and functional S1P receptor antagonist (except S1PR2) FTY720. Bile duct ligation (BDL) was performed on liver implantation or intraperitoneal injection of Panc02-luc cells.

- **Results**: Panc02-luc and AsPC-1 cells predominantly expressed S1PR2, and their growth and migration were stimulated by TCA or CYM5520 in a dose-dependent manner, blocked by JTE-013. This finding was not seen in PC cell lines expressing S1P receptors other than S1PR2. Panc02-luc growth stimulation by S1P was not blocked by FTY720. BDL significantly increased PC liver metastasis compared with sham. PC peritoneal carcinomatosis was significantly worsened by BDL, confirmed by the number of nodules, tumor weight, bioluminescence, Ki-67 stain, ascites, and worse survival compared with sham. CYM5520 significantly worsened PC carcinomatosis, whereas treatment with anti-S1P antibody or FTY720 also worsened progression.

- **Conclusions**: CBAs accelerated the growth of S1PR2 predominant PC both in vitro and…

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of gallstones [^113aDCni]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gallstone disease, specifically in the management of postoperative bile duct injury, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend considering primary surgical repair of intraoperatively identified bile duct lesions A, B, or C if surgical expertise is available. For type D lesions, it is advisable to obtain an intraoperative consultation with an expert center. Subhepatic drainage should be performed, followed by referring the patient to an expert center. Late reconstruction, often with hepaticojejunostomy, is recommended after 6–8 weeks.

### Sonographic images of hepato-pancreatico-biliary and intestinal ascariasis: A pictorial review [^116f7pZw]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatobiliary ascariasis is far less common compared to intestinal ascariasis alone, although no reliable data exists to quantify this difference. Patients with hepatobiliary ascariasis may present with biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, acute pancreatitis, or hepatic abscess. In some cases, they may develop intrahepatic duct calculi later due to biliary invasion. Ascariasis in the biliary tract can have various imaging features on sonography:

- **Inner-tube sign**: The roundworm may appear as a thick echoic stripe with a central, longitudinal anechoic tube (representing the gastrointestinal tract of the worm) in the gall bladder or common bile duct (CBD).

- **Coil of worm**: This may be observed in the gall bladder.

- **Strip sign**: A thin non-shadowing strip without an inner tube may be seen in the CBD or gall bladder.

- **Spaghetti sign**: Overlapping longitudinal interfaces can be identified in the main bile duct.

In our observations, we have identified several linear calcified structures within the bile ducts that might be calcified dead worms, possibly representing past hepatobiliary infestation.

### Timing of endoscopic therapy for acute bilio-pancreatic diseases: a practical overview [^113TC6nq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Acute cholangitis is the first clinical context where urgent ERCP is required. Bile is a sterile liquid with bacteriostatic properties. The pressure of Oddi's sphincter physiologically acts as a barrier, preventing bacterial migration in the biliary tree. When there is a biliary tract obstruction, bile flow is impaired, resulting in the retrograde migration of pathogens and bacterial proliferation in the biliary tree, which leads to acute cholangitis. The Tokyo Guidelines on the management of acute cholangitis and cholecystitis, published by the Japanese Society of Hepatobiliary Surgery in 2018, serve as the reference for the recognition, diagnosis, and staging of acute cholangitis severity.

The diagnosis of acute cholangitis is based on:

- **Clinical criteria**: Symptoms include jaundice, pain, and fever (Charcot triad).
- **Serological criteria**: Indications of cholestasis (bilirubin) with or without elevation of transaminases.
- **Radiological criteria**: Recognition of common bile duct dilation (CBD > 6 mm with gallbladder in place, > 10 mm in case of previous surgical cholecystectomy) and identification of the obstruction's cause (e.g. stenosis, lithiasis, neoplasia).

Once the diagnosis of acute cholangitis has been established, stratifying patients according to the severity of the clinical scenario is mandatory. Severe (or grade III) acute cholangitis is characterized by its association with signs of organ failure.

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^112281z9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

When bile duct injuries (BDIs) are recognized during the early postoperative period (within 2 weeks), persistent tissue injury from ongoing inflammation and the absence of bile duct dilatation appear to negatively influence the results and often lead to late strictures. When the diagnosis is not immediate or logistic constraints limit referral to a tertiary care center, the "drain now, fix later" algorithm — with percutaneous drainage of the biloma, targeted antibiotic therapy, and nutritional support — seems to be the best approach. After clinical stabilization, delayed surgical treatment can be safely performed.

When a major leak results in progressive biliary peritonitis, urgent surgical intervention is required, involving laparoscopic lavage of the abdominal cavity and drain placement. Once the patient has been successfully stabilized, several weeks (2–3 weeks) are usually required for the resolution of the acute inflammatory phase. This period allows for lowering the risks associated with extensive reconstructive surgery by reducing inflammation and ensuring the assessment of the extent of ischemic injury resulting from associated vascular injuries (right hepatic artery lesions have been recognized in 25% of BDIs).

Similarly, a 1-week delay in the diagnosis of major BDIs suggests the need for a "timeout" of 2–3 months before intervention. Combined BDI and hepatic artery injuries further increase the morbidity and mortality of BDIs and may necessitate an early referral to a specialized hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) center. Combined repair may avoid ischemic damage to the liver parenchyma and reduce the risk of further complications.

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^116aSEYd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). High credibility.

The role of imaging in postoperative diagnosis of BDI is crucial as it helps to establish the BDI diagnosis, delineate the type and extent of the injury, and plan the appropriate intervention. Ultrasonography (US) serves as the primary noninvasive and readily available diagnostic tool, enabling the detection of intra-abdominal fluid collections, dilation of the biliary ducts, and potentially associated vascular lesions through Doppler evaluation.

Abdominal triphasic CT scanning is instrumental in identifying the possible presence of focal intra- or perihepatic fluid collections, ascites, biliary obstruction with upstream dilation, and long-term sequelae of a persistent bile stricture, such as lobar hepatic atrophy or signs of secondary biliary cirrhosis. Additionally, CT can detect associated vascular lesions, like injury to the right hepatic artery. The sensitivity of CT surpasses that of US, particularly for detecting small fluid collections and associated vascular complications. While US offers good anatomic and contrast resolution, CT provides higher spatial resolution and superior identification of fluid collection morphology and site. Moreover, CT is essential for defining collections that require percutaneous or surgical drainage.

However, neither US nor CT examinations can reliably distinguish bile leaks from other postoperative fluid collections, such as blood, pus, or serous fluid, due to their similar densities. They also cannot establish the precise location or the active state of a bile leak, as the collection site may not be separate from the leak site and occasionally overlaps.

### Double-duct SIGN in the clinical context [^111ibRA2]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Double-duct sign, which is the combined dilatation of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct, is an infrequently encountered finding in cross-sectional radiological imaging of the pancreatobiliary system. This sign is commonly deemed to signify ominous pathology and suggests the presence of pancreatic or biliary malignancy.

- **Objectives**: We aim to correlate the double-duct sign discovered on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) in the clinical context. We retrospectively analyzed the MRCP database over a period of 4 years, from January 2010 to December 2013. Follow-up information was available for a median of 27 months (range, 12–42 months).

- **Methods**: The study sought to correlate instances of the double-duct sign with clinical outcomes based on MRCP findings over a 4-year period.

- **Results**: The most common cause of the double-duct sign was choledocholithiasis, followed closely by pancreatobiliary malignancy. Patients with jaundice in the context of the double-duct sign had a higher incidence of malignancy (48%). None of the anicteric patients were found to have malignancy (P = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: In patients with MRCP evidence of a double-duct sign, the absence of jaundice makes a malignant etiology unlikely. Conversely, in jaundiced patients, a malignant cause is much more probable. Figures from larger series are needed to support this conclusion.
