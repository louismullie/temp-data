## Question

Newborn bumps under chin line that were white and 4 months later are now brown and raised

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most likely diagnosis is for a newborn with white bumps under the chin that became brown and raised over four months. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and morphology to build a differential. Then, I should verify which entities best match the evolution from white to brown and from flat to raised. Next, I will consider key mimics that must be excluded. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline prudent next steps, including when to observe versus when to refer or biopsy [^116WGLAN] [^116mb6uv].

> Let me first confirm the core clinical features: neonatal onset of white bumps under the chin that evolved into brown, raised lesions over approximately four months, with no mention of ulceration, rapid growth, bleeding, or systemic symptoms, which pushes me toward benign neonatal dermatoses rather than vascular tumors or infections [^116WGLAN] [^116mb6uv].

> I will now examine the differential that fits a color change from white to brown and a change in contour from flat to raised in early infancy; transient neonatal pustular melanosis (TNPM) is high on the list because it classically presents with fragile pustules that rupture and leave hyperpigmented macules, and although the macules are typically flat, they can appear slightly raised early or with edema, and the timing of pigment persistence fits a several-month course [^114qWUh3].

> Wait, let me verify the timeline and morphology match for TNPM: TNPM lesions are often present within the first days of life, the pustules are superficial and easily ruptured, and the resulting brown macules can persist for weeks to a few months, which aligns with a 4‑month evolution from white to brown; the under‑chin location is plausible for a flexural or truncal distribution, and the benign course without scarring is consistent with this entity [^114qWUh3] [^116mb6uv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider other neonatal pustular eruptions that can leave pigment, but most either do not fit the color evolution or the chronicity: miliaria crystallina or pustulosa are transient sweat‑duct obstruction eruptions that resolve quickly and do not characteristically leave persistent brown macules, and neonatal acne tends to be papulopustular without the classic pustule‑to‑macule sequence of TNPM, so these are less likely here [^113v2XHN] [^1125yh1x] [^111WmRGx].

> Let me consider vascular lesions next; infantile hemangiomas typically start as faint vascular stains or telangiectatic macules and then proliferate into firm, raised, compressible red or violaceous nodules, which does not match a white‑to‑brown pigmentary transformation, so IH is unlikely in this scenario unless the initial description was misleading, and guidelines emphasize early recognition of IH for risk stratification rather than late pigment change as a feature [^115Ay8aY] [^114d8Ssx].

> I should double-check pigmentary birthmarks: café‑au‑lait macules are brown from onset and would not explain an initial white phase, and epidermal nevi are usually verrucous or slightly raised and hyperpigmented from the start rather than starting white and becoming raised later, making them poor fits for this evolution [^notfound].

> But wait, what if this is a histiocytic disorder like juvenile xanthogranuloma; JXG can present in infancy with yellow‑brown papules or nodules and occasionally atypical colors, yet the described initial white, pustule‑like appearance is not typical for JXG, and the absence of classic yellow‑orange hue or xanthomatization early makes JXG less likely here, though I should keep it in mind if the lesions are firm nodules or if ocular involvement is suspected in multiple lesions [^111GCqVJ] [^115VcQuv].

> Let me reconsider the original premise; I initially thought "white bumps" might imply milia, but milia are pearly, keratinous cysts that do not typically darken to brown macules, and milia en plaque is rare in neonates and presents as an erythematous plaque studded with milia rather than isolated white‑to‑brown evolution, so this does not fit the described course either [^11689adJ] [^116aJbvK].

> Next, I should review supportive diagnostic steps; for TNPM, diagnosis is clinical and smear of pustular contents, if available, shows neutrophils and occasional eosinophils, cultures are negative, and histology of the hyperpigmented macules shows increased basal pigmentation without pigment incontinence; given the benign nature and self‑limited course, reassurance and observation are appropriate unless atypical features emerge or lesions persist beyond the expected window [^114qWUh3] [^116mb6uv].

> I need to ensure red flags are absent that would prompt urgent work‑up: rapid enlargement, ulceration, bleeding, systemic symptoms, or failure to follow the expected benign trajectory would warrant reconsideration of infection, vascular anomalies, or neoplasia and possible dermatology referral or biopsy; in this case, the described evolution and lack of concerning features support continued observation with anticipatory guidance [^116WGLAN] [^116neaa3].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is transient neonatal pustular melanosis with evolution from fragile white pustules to persistent brown macules or slightly raised plaques under the chin over four months, consistent with its natural history and clinical spectrum; I should confirm the absence of atypical features, document progression with photos, and counsel caregivers on the expected resolution, arranging referral if lesions persist beyond approximately 3–6 months or if new atypical changes occur [^114qWUh3] [^116mb6uv].

The most likely diagnosis is **transient neonatal pustular melanosis** (TNPM) [^notfound], which presents as white vesiculopustules that rupture and leave brown macules or slightly raised papules; these lesions are benign, require no treatment, and typically resolve within weeks to months [^114qWUh3]. Other considerations include **milia** (tiny white keratin cysts that may persist and rarely pigment), **sebaceous hyperplasia** (yellow-white papules that can appear raised), and **juvenile xanthogranuloma** (yellow-brown papules that may develop over months) [^111GCqVJ]. If the lesions persist, change rapidly, or cause concern, refer to **pediatric dermatology** for evaluation and possible biopsy [^116WGLAN].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Course and prognosis** | **Treatment** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Transient neonatal pustular melanosis (TNPM) | - White vesiculopustules at birth or shortly after <br/> - Rupture easily, leaving brown macules or slightly raised papules <br/> - Common on chin, forehead, neck, back, and extremities | - Benign <br/> - Self-limited <br/> - Resolves in weeks to months without scarring | No treatment required; parental reassurance [^114qWUh3] |
| Milia | - Tiny white keratin-filled cysts <br/> - Common on face, including chin <br/> - May persist for months | - Benign <br/> - Self-limited <br/> - Usually resolve spontaneously | No treatment required; parental reassurance [^116aJbvK] |
| Sebaceous hyperplasia | - Yellow-white papules <br/> - Often on the nose, forehead, and chin <br/> - May appear slightly raised | - Benign <br/> - Self-limited <br/> - Resolves spontaneously | No treatment required; parental reassurance [^notfound] |
| Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) | - Yellow-brown papules or nodules <br/> - Often on the head, neck, and upper trunk <br/> - May develop over months | - Benign <br/> - Self-limited <br/> - Usually resolve spontaneously within 1–2 years | No treatment required; parental reassurance [^115VcQuv] |

## Recommended evaluation and management

- **Clinical observation**: Most neonatal skin lesions are benign and self-limited. Careful clinical observation and documentation of lesion characteristics, progression, and resolution are essential [^111WmRGx].

- **Parental education**: Provide reassurance and educate parents about the benign nature of these lesions, expected course, and absence of need for intervention [^116mb6uv].

- **Referral to pediatric dermatology**: If lesions persist beyond several months, change rapidly, ulcerate, bleed, or cause significant cosmetic concern, refer to pediatric dermatology for further evaluation and possible biopsy [^115fYHQb].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis for newborn bumps under the chin that were white and became brown and raised over four months is **transient neonatal pustular melanosis** (TNPM) [^114qWUh3]. This is a benign, self-limited condition that requires no treatment other than parental reassurance and clinical observation [^114qWUh3]. If lesions persist or change rapidly, refer to pediatric dermatology for further evaluation [^116WGLAN].

There are many developmental abnormalities that may appear in the neonate and in infants when critical steps in embryogenesis fail. These steps are often not fatal but can lead to significant morbidity for those patients affected. A logical approach is needed in addressing both the diagnostic and therapeutic issues that arise when caring for these patients, as various lesions will warrant an observational approach, and others may require imaging studies or definitive surgical intervention. Additionally, there are other "lumps and bumps" that are seen in the neonatal and infantile age groups that include malignancies and cutaneous neoplasms with associated systemic sequelae.

Birthmarks are commonplace and most pose no significant detriment to health. It is usual for some 'birthmarks' to manifest within the first weeks to months of life and are not necessarily seen at birth. This is attributed in large part to the maturation of neonatal skin and the deepening of skin color over time. With time, increased pigment production in the skin by melanocytes eventually highlight the differences between normal and abnormal hypopigmented and hyperpigmented anomalies of the skin. Birthmarks can be seen as an isolated skin condition or serve as an important diagnostic aid for other more significant disorders. This review details four of the most common birthmarks regularly encountered in the neonatal period by perinatologists, obstetricians and pediatricians. This review emphasizes their medical significance and highlights any associated underlying systemic disease or genetic syndrome.

A meticulous examination of the oral cavity is an essential part of the initial newborn assessment. The differential diagnosis can involve benign and self-limiting lesions to those lesions compromising quality of life. We present a clinical case of a newborn born with a purple, hard tumour on the hard palate that spontaneously regressed, being thus compatible with the case of a sucking blister. Neonatal sucking blisters typically result from vigorous sucking in utero, most commonly of the hand or forearm; however, more atypical locations may be involved. These benign blisters should be differentiated from other newborn conditions by their presentation, characteristic morphology and self-limiting course. A high index of clinical suspicion is necessary to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatments.

Sweat chloride testing and presumptive diagnosis — procedural guidance specifies that for all populations, sweat chloride testing should be performed according to approved procedural guidelines published in established, international protocols such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2009 Guidelines. For newborns with a positive CF newborn screen, to increase the likelihood of collecting an adequate sweat specimen, testing should be performed bilaterally and when the infant weighs > 2 kg and is at least 36 weeks' corrected gestational age; sweat samples collected bilaterally must not be combined and should be analyzed separately. For newborns greater than 36 weeks' gestation and ≥ 2 kg body weight with a positive CF newborn screen, or positive prenatal genetic test, sweat chloride testing should be performed as soon as possible after 10 days of age, ideally by the end of the neonatal period (4 weeks of age). Sweat chloride testing should occur as soon as possible when positive screening results are reported and can be as early as 48 hours after birth, and the committee recommends that sweat chloride testing proceed as soon as possible after results are available; generally, this is no later than 10 days of age.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^115Ay8aY]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) — early growth and referral timing: Most superficial IHs have accelerated growth between 5 and 7 weeks of age, and 4 weeks of age may be the ideal time for referral if high-risk features are present. After the first-week visit, an infant may not be seen again until 2 months of age, so prompt evaluation, either in-person or via photographs, is warranted for a changing birthmark during the first 2 months of life. In-person visits or a review of parental photos may be needed, especially in infants younger than 3 to 4 months. Because IHs are heterogeneous in size, location, distribution, and depth, if uncertainty exists, consultation with a hemangioma specialist (including photographic triage) can be helpful, and possible solutions could include establishing resources for photographic triage when risk stratification is uncertain or to hasten referral.

Airway infantile hemangiomas — presentation and risk factors: Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is about 4 months, symptoms usually present much earlier; most children who are affected develop biphasic stridor and barky cough as the IH enlarges. Approximately half of infants in whom an airway IH is diagnosed also will have a cutaneous IH. Segmental IH of the lower face ("beard distribution") or anterior neck and oral and/or pharyngeal mucosal IHs are the greatest risk factors for an airway IH.

### Congenital self-healing Langerhans cell histiocytosis vs benign cephalic histiocytosis: a comprehensive literature review of pediatric cutaneous histiocytoses [^1171GuJf]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Histiocytosis Working Group created a system to categorize histiocytic disorders into 3 main groups: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (non-LCH), and malignant histiocytosis. This classification is based on identifying Langerhans cell antigens and the distinct clinical characteristics of each category. LCH features specialized dendritic cells called Langerhans cells. Non-LCH encompasses various disorders lacking specific antigens, while malignant histiocytosis involves aggressive, often cancerous, histiocytic cell proliferation.

LCH is a rare disorder marked by the abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells. The condition is characterized by the accumulation of these cells in various tissues and organs, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations. Despite extensive research, the exact cause and pathogenesis of LCH remain poorly understood, making it a challenging disease to diagnose and treat.

Congenital self-healing Langerhans cell histiocytosis (CSHLCH), also referred to as congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis or Hashimoto-Pritzker disease, is a rare neonatal condition marked by the presence of skin lesions at birth or shortly thereafter. This condition is notable for its lack of systemic involvement, distinguishing it from other forms of LCH. The cutaneous lesions associated with this disease are typically self-limiting, resolving spontaneously within a period of weeks to months without requiring medical intervention. Despite its rarity, early recognition of this benign condition is important to avoid unnecessary treatment or invasive diagnostic procedures.

Benign cephalic histiocytosis (BCH) is a rare, self-limiting non-LCH disorder that primarily presents in infancy, typically within the first year of life. Clinically, BCH is characterized by the appearance of small erythematous to yellow-brown maculopapular lesions. These lesions are often grouped and may be slightly raised, predominantly affecting the head and neck regions of affected infants and young children. The etiology of BCH remains unclear, and it is considered a benign condition with no systemic involvement. Histopathological examination reveals dermal infiltration by histiocytes without Birbeck granules, distinguishing it from LCH. Importantly, BCH follows a self-resolving course, with spontaneous regression of skin lesions typically occurring within months to a few years after onset. No treatment is generally required, and the prognosis is excellent, with no long-term sequelae reported.

### A systematic review of newborn and childhood hearing screening around the world: comparison and quality assessment of guidelines [^112L42kQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Screening principles and time

Given the varying recommendations of the six childhood hearing screening guidelines, only the newborn hearing screening principles are discussed here. Eight guidelines from America, Europe, ICON, Italy, New Zealand, Canada, CODEPEH, and WHO recommend the 1–3–6 principles, indicating international acceptance of this screening principle. Most guidelines recommend completing initial screening before discharge, with the exact timing varying based on the length of hospital stay in each country and region. Most guidelines recommend prompt rescreening of newborns who are not screened before discharge. Three guidelines cited different rescreening times, with the same diagnosis (within 3 months) and intervention times (within 6 months). Among them, the Chinese guidelines recommend that newborns who do not undergo initial screening should complete rescreening within 42 days after birth. Since the growth and developmental health check-up is performed at the age of 42 days, hearing rescreening at 42 days could facilitate rescreening rates. The Indian guidelines recommend complete rescreening within 4 weeks after the first screening or at 6 weeks during the first immunization visit, which could improve compliance with rescreening among newborns who fail the initial screening.

South African guideline recommends screening before 1 month after birth and within 6 weeks after birth; diagnosing within 1 month after discharge; and accepting interventions before and within 6 and 8 months after birth, respectively. Moreover, the recommended screening and intervention times were slightly later than those in the 1–3–6 principles. However, the diagnosis and intervention times recommended by guidelines from England and Australia were earlier than those in the 1–3–6 principle. Guidelines from England recommend diagnosis within 4 weeks of screen completion and accepting intervention within 4 weeks of screen completion or the gestational age of 44 weeks. Australian guidelines recommend diagnosis at 2 weeks after the first screening and within a corrected age of 3 months, as well as accepting interventions within 3 months and no later than 6 months of age.

Generally, the screening principle and time of newborn hearing screening recommended by Chinese guideline are consistent with international recommendations. Guidelines from several developed countries recommend diagnosis and intervention within 3 and 6 months, respectively. Contrastingly, guidelines from several developing countries recommend diagnosis and intervention within 1 and 6 months, respectively. This suggests that hearing screening principles should be developed according to the national context in terms of scientific validity and feasibility.

### Skin lesions in the neonate [^115vojKF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal skin provides physical protection and assists in fluid balance, immunosurveillance, and thermoregulation; thus, playing a vital role in the newborn's transition from an aqueous to an air-dominant environment. Worried parents often seek medical attention from their child's physician regarding skin lesions. Thus, a working knowledge of both normal and abnormal cutaneous lesions of the neonate is required to properly address these issues. In this article, the authors briefly discuss transient benign lesions, pustular and vesicular infections, "birthmarks" (vascular and pigmentary lesions), common congenital abnormalities, select blistering disorders, and various other skin conditions.

### Congenital miliaria crystallina [^11436sd9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Miliaria crystallina is a transient, superficial obstruction of eccrine sweat ducts resulting in rapidly evolving noninflammatory vesicles. The disease is observed frequently in hot, humid, tropical climates and in the neonatal period, but congenital occurrence is very rare. Miliaria crystallina must be considered in the differential diagnosis of bullous diseases in newborns.

### An infant who has dome-shaped papules [^111GCqVJ]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

JXG is a benign disorder of early childhood and primarily occurs in infants and children < 2 years of age. It is characterized by solitary or multiple yellow-red nodules on the skin and, rarely, in other organs. The clinical diagnosis of solitary cutaneous JXG usually requires confirmation by biopsy. Referral to a dermatologist should be obtained to exclude other disorders if multiple lesions are present. Clinicians should rule out ocular lesions with referral to an ophthalmologist if the patient is < 2 years of age and has multiple lesions of JXG. If ophthalmologic consultation reveals no ocular lesions, screening every 6 months for the first 2 years of life is advised.

### Life-threatening cutaneous conditions in neonates [^115BER5h]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

One of the major medical concerns in neonates is their vulnerability to life-threatening complications. Early diagnosis of potentially serious medical conditions is essential in prevention of such complication by prompt administration of appropriate treatments. Recognition of cutaneous manifestations of potentially fatal diseases may assist a clinician in management of newborns. To overview the full spectrum of this category of conditions, Medline search was performed for cases of cutaneous manifestations associated with mortality during the first month of live that were published in the English language literature since 1977. This is a concise review of the clinical aspects of most of the potentially life-threatening disorders in neonates divided by basic morphology of their cutaneous manifestations.

### Pediatric oral medicine [^113KVsmM]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

A thorough examination of the oral mucosa can provide helpful clues toward making a diagnosis in a number of developmental, neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious conditions. A number of oral lesions seen in infants and children are benign and of no medical significance. In these instances, the ability of the physician to confidently identify the diagnosis, and reassure parents that a lesion is not worrisome, carries significant value. Likewise, the ability to recognize an underlying systemic illness or genetic disease based on an oral examination can also be of tremendous value, particularly when oral involvement is the presenting feature.

### Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117HEF3y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) diagnostic clinical features and testing indications are outlined as follows: Recently, investigators identified four key clinical features characteristic of PCD (7). These include 1) Year-round, daily, productive ("wet") cough and 2) year-round, daily, nonseasonal rhinosinusitis beginning in early childhood, often shortly after birth, and are almost universally present by 6 months of age. Additionally, Approximately 80% of children with PCD have a history of 3) neonatal respiratory distress syndrome as term newborns, defined as the need for supplemental oxygen or positive pressure ventilation support for more than 24 hours without clear explanation (6–9). Roughly 40–55% of patients with PCD have 4) laterality defects (e.g., situs inversus totalis), whereas other situs anomalies (e.g., situs ambiguous), with or without congenital heart defects, are found in roughly 12% of affected individuals (4, 10). Diagnostic performance linked to these features shows If two of these distinguishing features are present, the sensitivity and specificity for PCD are 80% and 99%, respectively; if only one is present, the sensitivity and specificity are 21% and 99%, respectively (7). Ear disease is common but non-specific, as Chronic otitis media with effusion is also common in children with PCD, and many require tympanostomy tube placement before 5 years of age (8), but this feature does not distinguish children with PCD from those who do not have PCD. Regarding when to test, Without at least two of these key features, patients are unlikely to have PCD, and further testing is usually unwarranted. Thus, clinicians should consider diagnostic testing for PCD only in those patients who truly fit the clinical phenotype.

### Reactive and nonreactive white lesions of the oral mucosa [^112E9Cd5]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

White lesions in the oral cavity may be diverse in etiology and may present with significant clinical and sometimes histologic overlap between categories, making accurate diagnosis difficult at times. Although white lesions of immune and infectious etiology are covered in another article, this article discusses the differential diagnosis between developmental, reactive, idiopathic, premalignant, and malignant white lesions focusing on clinical features of each category.

### Multiple white papules on the retroauricular fold [^112VHhnW]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 46-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of multiple white papules and a plaque affecting the right retroauricular fold. The papules gradually increased and were asymptomatic. There were no prior skin lesions or injury. There was no significant medical or family history. Physical examination found numerous, whitish-yellow papules 1 to 3 mm in diameter on a well-defined, oval, erythematous-edematous plaque on the right retroauricular fold (Fig 1). Dermoscopy manifestations of the lesions are shown in Fig 2. Results of a biopsy are shown in Fig 3.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Nevus comedonicus
B. Milia en plaque (MEP)
C. Syringoma
D. Sebaceous hyperplasia
E. Follicular mucinosis

Answers:

A. Nevus comedonicus – Incorrect. Nevus comedonicus usually develops from birth to age 15 with comedo-like lesions. However, the age of onset in our patient is too old.
B. MEP – Correct. MEP is a rare primary milia characterized by an erythematous plaque containing numerous milia. The region commonly involved is the retroauricular area. Biopsy of this patient shows a keratin-filled cyst in the dermis (Fig 3).
C. Syringoma – Incorrect. Syringomas are a neoplasms demonstrating sweat duct differentiation. Histologically, syringomas are characterized by dilated cystic spaces lined by 2 layers of cuboidal cells and epithelial strands of similar cells. Some of the cysts have small comma-like tails, which produce a distinctive picture, resembling tadpoles or the pattern of a paisley tie.
D. Sebaceous hyperplasia – Incorrect. The lesions of sebaceous hyperplasia are small, cream colored or yellowish, umbilicated papules, 2 to 6 mm in diameter. Dermoscopy can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and identifies the central crater, the yellow lobules, and the associated telangiectasia. Histologically, sebaceous hyperplasia demonstrates hyperplasia of 1 sebaceous gland, with the surrounding glands being of normal size.
E. Follicular mucinosis – Incorrect. Follicular mucinosis can present as an acneiform eruption. Histologically, follicular mucinosis demonstrates large collections of mucin within the sebaceous gland and outer root sheath.

### Newborn skin: part II. birthmarks [^115WvevK]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Birthmarks in newborns are common sources of parental concern. Although most treatment recommendations are based on expert opinion, limited evidence exists to guide management of these conditions. Large congenital melanocytic nevi require evaluation for removal, whereas smaller nevi may be observed for malignant changes. With few exceptions, benign birthmarks (e.g., dermal melanosis, hemangioma of infancy, port-wine stain, nevus simplex) do not require treatment; however, effective cosmetic laser treatments exist. Supernumerary nipples are common and benign; they are occasionally mistaken for congenital melanocytic nevi. High- and intermediate-risk skin markers of spinal dysraphism (e.g., dermal sinuses, tails, atypical dimples, multiple lesions of any type) require evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography. Family physicians should be familiar with various birthmarks and comfortable discussing disease prevention and cosmetic strategies.

### Miliaria crystallina [^113v2XHN]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Miliaria crystallina (MC) is an uncommon form of a sweat retention syndrome that chiefly affects neonates. It is more common in hot and humid conditions, such as in tropical regions. It commonly presents as clusters of dewdrop-like vesicles on a nonerythematous base that heals with furfuraceous scaling. A clinical diagnosis is often sufficient. The differential diagnosis is wide and varying. One of the hallmarks of MC is its self-limiting nature. The purpose of this review is to increase awareness of this condition among physicians and dermatologists.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to discuss imaging techniques and provide a pictorial review of pediatric tongue lesions. CONCLUSION. Pediatric tongue lesions represent an often-overlooked collection of abnormalities with a variety of clinical and radiologic features. The location of these lesions places the patient at risk for airway compromise. Systematic imaging evaluation of pediatric tongue lesions can help the radiologist arrive at a correct and timely diagnosis, thus improving and expediting patient care.

### Management of stroke in neonates and children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115ADE4J]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) screening — Epidemiology and imaging guidance for pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are described as follows: Up to 35% of multiple intracranial AVMs associated with HHT were in children, although the mean age at presentation for HHT is 35 years. HHT guidelines recommend AVM screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in the first 6 months of life or at the time of diagnosis, and for individuals > 2 years of age, contrast MRI is recommended. It may be reasonable to wait > 5 years after initial screening imaging studies to rescreen, and in children with a known brain AVM, the presence of frequent nosebleeds, small telangiectasias visible on skin examination, or family history of AVMs should prompt consideration of HHT.

### A comprehensive newborn exam: part I. general, head and neck, cardiopulmonary [^116w3nKv]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

A comprehensive newborn examination involves a systematic inspection. A Ballard score uses physical and neurologic characteristics to assess gestational age. Craniosynostosis is caused by premature fusion of the sutures, and 20% of children with this condition have a genetic mutation or syndrome. The red reflex assessment is normal if there is symmetry in both eyes, without opacities, white spots, or dark spots. If the red reflex findings are abnormal or the patient has a family history of pertinent eye disorders, consultation with an ophthalmologist is warranted. Newborns with low-set ears should be evaluated for a genetic condition. Renal ultrasonography should be performed only in patients with isolated ear anomalies, such as preauricular pits or cup ears, if they are accompanied by other malformations or significant family history. If ankyloglossia is detected, a frenotomy may be considered if it impacts breastfeeding. The neck should be examined for full range of motion because uncorrected torticollis can lead to plagiocephaly and ear misalignment. Proper auscultation is crucial for evaluation of the bronchopulmonary circulation with close observation for signs of respiratory distress, including tachypnea, nasal flaring, grunting, retractions, and cyanosis. Benign murmurs are often present in the first hours of life. Pulse oximetry should be performed in a systematic fashion before discharge.

### Neonatal miliaria pustulosa – A case series [^1125yh1x]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Miliaria is a skin disorder caused by a blockage of eccrine glands that leads to retention of sweat in the dermis and epidermis resulting in a papular, vesicular, or pustular eruption.

Miliaria has been categorized into subtypes termed miliaria crystallina, miliaria rubra, miliaria profunda, and miliaria pustulosa. The depth of the eccrine duct obstruction and resultant clinical presentation determines the classification. Miliaria occurs frequently in neonates likely due to the relative immaturity of the eccrine structures allowing for obstruction to occur more readily. Preterm infants may be at an increased risk for miliaria pustulosa due to their sweat glands being even more underdeveloped than that of a full‐term neonate. Although eccrine sweat glands develop during week 16 of gestation, development of these structures continues after birth, and preterm neonates will take longer to develop full eccrine sweat gland function. A 1982 study of sweating in neonates found that infants with a gestation period longer than 36 weeks were able to sweat on the first day of life, whereas infants born before 36 weeks of gestation were not able to sweat until an average of 13 days post‐birth. Additionally, contributors such as a hot humid environment, including possibly the use of warmers in hospital nurseries, and excessive clothing or swaddling put the infant population at further risk of this eruption. The incidence of miliaria has been observed to be equal in male and female neonates.

The presence of eruptive pustules in a neonate has a wide differential diagnosis including both benign and infectious conditions. Infections may include bacterial, yeast, or viral organisms, some of which can be life threatening in young babies, thus recognizing the various presentations of these entities is critical for healthcare providers. By describing the diagnosis and clinical course of nine neonates with miliaria pustulosa, we aim to help differentiate these serious neonatal pustular eruptions from the benign eruption of miliaria pustulosa, which is essential for limiting testing and unnecessary treatment. Here we present a series of nine neonates presenting with miliaria pustulosa and review the clinical features of this exuberant and often alarming appearing, yet benign eruption.

### Newborn skin: part I. common rashes [^111WmRGx]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Rashes are extremely common in newborns and can be a significant source of parental concern. Although most rashes are transient and benign, some require additional work-up. Erythema toxicum neonatorum, acne neonatorum, and transient neonatal pustular melanosis are transient vesiculopustular rashes that can be diagnosed clinically based on their distinctive appearances. Infants with unusual presentations or signs of systemic illness should be evaluated for Candida, viral, and bacterial infections. Milia and miliaria result from immaturity of skin structures. Miliaria rubra (also known as heat rash) usually improves after cooling measures are taken. Seborrheic dermatitis is extremely common and should be distinguished from atopic dermatitis. Parental reassurance and observation is usually sufficient, but tar-containing shampoo, topical ketoconazole, or mild topical steroids may be needed to treat severe or persistent cases.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^111qVXix]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) — early growth and monitoring emphasize that early and frequent monitoring in the first few weeks and months of life is crucial in identifying those IHs that require intervention because IHs may change rapidly during this time period, and that most rapid IH growth occurs between 1 and 3 months of age. There is a window of opportunity to treat problematic IHs; consult early (by 1 month of age) for lesions that are potentially high risk because of associations including potential for disfigurement (the most common reason treatment is needed), life-threatening complications, functional impairment, ulceration, and underlying abnormalities. Although IHs involute, this process may be incomplete, leaving permanent skin changes that may be life altering, and this is especially true for IHs that are thick.

Test results at time of diagnosis

On day-of-life (DOL) 4, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) of cells from peripheral blood obtained on DOL1 demonstrated 3 copies of RUNX1, raising suspicion of trisomy 21. On DOL6, a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel revealed a GATA1 frameshift mutation and confirmed a gain of chromosome 21 (Table 1). This constellation of findings was diagnostic of TAM. With improvement in WBC, cytarabine was discontinued on DOL6. The patient developed chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia and was treated with supportive care. Peripheral myeloid blasts were detected through 2 months of age and then resolved (Figure 1C). A metaphase karyotyping of peripheral blood at the time of diagnosis showed trisomy 21, whereas phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts had a normal male karyotype (Table 1). GATA1 mutation testing was not performed at the time of remission. Given the risk of developing AML after TAM, the patient has been observed closely by an oncologist and remains healthy at 14 months of age.

The spectrum of clinical presentations in pediatric skin and soft-tissue lesions often makes diagnosis challenging. Delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can be life threatening, and they can subject patients to more complicated reconstruction. This retrospective case series reviews the presentation, management, and current literature on eight pediatric skin and soft-tissue lesions. For rare lesions and those with unclear pathology, a multidisciplinary approach is strongly advocated for optimal management.

### A 3-day-old girl referred from her pediatrician for oral ulcerations [^112u8hVh]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A 3-day-old girl was referred from her pediatrician for oral ulcerations. The patient was otherwise well appearing and afebrile. Her prenatal and antenatal courses were unremarkable, except for a failed routine hearing screen. The patient's examination was notable for several yellowish ulcers on erythematous bases located on her anterior tonsillar pillars. The patient also had a right coloboma and a II/VI systolic ejection murmur. Laboratory analyses revealed a traumatic lumbar puncture with 182000 red blood cells and 808 white blood cells, as well as a complete blood count that showed thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. During the patient's hospitalization, she developed a new facial rash. Her physical examination findings, along with her diagnostic evaluation and hospital course, ultimately led to 2 surprising diagnoses elaborated on in this case discussion.

### Multiple milia in a newborn with congenital malformations: oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 [^115ytuGN]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 (OMIM #311200) is an X-linked dominant, developmental disorder. Among the 13 described clinical variants of oral-facial-digital syndrome, oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 is of significance to dermatologists due to presence of congenital milia and hypotrichosis, not described in other variants. Since oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 is genetically a distinct entity, awareness of these features help to clinically delineate this from other variants.

### Circumcision bleeding rates in patients diagnosed with delta-storage pool deficiency later in life [^1137y5xF]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Male circumcision is a common procedure, generally performed during the newborn period. Bleeding is an uncommon but feared complication of circumcision. Few reports have evaluated circumcision bleeding rates in patients with bleeding disorders.

Objectives

To study circumcision bleeding rates in male subjects who were diagnosed later in life with delta-storage pool deficiency (δ-SPD).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of male subjects (≤ 18 years of age) who were circumcised without hemostatic prophylaxis prior to δ-SPD diagnosis from 2000 to 2020. Bleeding rates and severity were the main outcomes evaluated. We collected demographic data, bleeding scores using a validated assessment tool, laboratory data, and platelet electron microscopy results. A descriptive analysis was performed.

Results

Twenty-five male subjects were included. The median bleeding score at presentation was 3.5 (range: 2–9). The diagnosis was confirmed using platelet electron microscopy. A value of < 2 dense granules/platelet was considered abnormal. Circumcision was performed at a median age of 2 days (range: 1 day to 4 months). None of the subjects had intraoperative or postoperative bleeding. With a bleeding rate of zero, we suggest that newborn males with a family history of δ-SPD may be safely circumcised without hemostatic prophylaxis.

### Newborn skin: part I. common rashes and skin changes [^116mb6uv]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Rashes in the newborn period are common and most are benign. Infections should be suspected in newborns with pustules or vesicles, especially in those who are not well-appearing or have risk factors for congenital infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can cause sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay. Skin manifestations of cytomegalovirus may include petechiae due to thrombocytopenia. The most common skin manifestations of early congenital syphilis are small, copper-red, maculopapular lesions located primarily on the hands and feet that peel and crust over three weeks. Erythema toxicum neonatorum and neonatal pustular melanosis are transient pustular rashes with characteristic appearance and distribution. Neonatal acne is self-limited, whereas infantile acne may benefit from treatment. Milia can be differentiated from neonatal acne by their presence at birth. Cutis marmorata and harlequin color change are transient vascular phenomena resulting from inappropriate or exaggerated dilation of capillaries and venules in response to stimuli.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Childhood-onset maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM) — variants, distribution, and course are described as follows: Onset is usually within the first 6 months of life, and in some patients cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is already present at birth. Among patients with MPCM, at least 2 variants should be differentiated. The lesional margins can be sharp or indistinct and lesions can be elevated or flat. In the polymorphic variant in children, distribution is usually asymmetric and generalized at diagnosis, typically involving the head, neck, and extremities, with brown lesions on the lateral parts of the forehead. Nodules present during infancy may transform into plaques at the age of around 5 to 10 years and into macules after the age of 10 years, with many patients showing regression around puberty. The polymorphic skin lesions can undergo blistering upon irritation until the patient is 2 to 3 years of age and lesions on the head are particularly prone to blistering. Serum tryptase levels are usually within the normal range; in children with pronounced cutaneous lesions, levels can be increased at diagnosis but usually decrease within 1 to 2 years. Overall prognosis is favorable, with most patients showing spontaneous regression by adolescence. A small percentage of pediatric patients exhibit small monomorphic round lesions like adults, and these often can be present with increased serum tryptase levels that do not decrease over time.

3.2 Adverse outcome of the first symptomatic phase

An AO of the first symptomatic phase was recorded in 36/76 (47%) of all patients and in 30/64 (47%) of the clinically diagnosed patients (Figure 1). Movement disorders were recorded in 24/36 patients. Basal ganglia hyperintensities were observed in 18, white matter abnormalities in 14, and both in 6 patients. In 19/26 patients in whom white matter abnormalities and/or basal ganglia hyperintensities were observed, brain imaging was performed within 3 days to 6 months after the first symptomatic phase and in 7/26 patients later in life (range: 9 months to 23 years). In three of these patients also a movement disorder was recorded, and in all seven patients the observed abnormalities were considered to be long‐existent based on unchanged clinical symptoms and imaging characteristics.

### Spontaneous neonatal scrotal haematoma: an early manifestation of severe haemophilia [^111u4orU]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a term newborn who presented on day 3 of life with unilateral, tender scrotal swelling with skin discolouration, which was subsequently diagnosed as haemophilia A at about 6 months of age. He received intramuscular vitamin K and hepatitis B vaccine at birth uneventfully. The scrotal swelling was treated as an infected hydrocoele, considering the absence of a family history of bleeding disorder and other risks of bleeding tendency, as well as the ultrasonographic features. He also had congenital pneumonia requiring venepuncture, non-invasive oxygen supplementation and intravenous antibiotics, without any complication. The swelling slowly improved over 2 months. He later developed post-trial vaccine injection haematoma at 4 months of age, and multiple non-traumatic bruises when he was 6 months old, leading to the diagnosis. This case demonstrates an uncommon, but a possible, early manifestation of haemophilia A at birth with a unilateral scrotal haematoma.

### Harlequin color change in two preterm newborns [^1165Ao6Z]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Harlequin color change is a benign transient skin change usually seen in the neonatal period with unknown etiology. It has been rarely reported in preterm infants. Herein, we report two cases of harlequin color change developed in premature infants without any adverse consequences. During the event, one infant was receiving antibiotic treatment for an Escherichia coli bacteremia in addition to routine supportive care and the other one was in a very stable condition. Both preterm infants were also diagnosed to have a patent ductus arteriosus. As a benign transient skin change, harlequin color change should be recognized properly to avoid unnecessary treatment.

### The various clinical spectra of juvenile xanthogranuloma: imaging for two case reports and review of the literature [^115VcQuv]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

General

Cutaneous juvenile xanthogranuloma is a common 'histiocytic' disorder, but a detailed review of the literature reveals only a small number of cases of systemic juvenile xanthogranulomatosis in the neonatal period and less than 15 cases of spinal JXG. Although cutaneous JXG is generally regarded as a self-limited condition, systemic JXG may be associated with significant morbidity and occasional deaths so that aggressive medical care is necessary. To illustrate this point, we report on two affected children, both born within 1 year in Austria, who were confirmed to have JXG.

The originality of our observation is the clinically atypical and completely different presentation of this rare disease by the multi-lesional and multisystemic nature of its pathology. Moreover, it illustrates the difficulty of classifying this disorder, because the clinical and radiological presentation is nonspecific. Therefore, correlation with histopathology is mandatory and the gold standard for diagnosis of JXG.

Clinical spectrum

In the first patient we describe cutaneous JXG, which follows a benign course and gradual regression of the lesion without treatment. The diagnosis was established quickly, although the skin lesions were not typical of JXG. The typical presentation is a solitary erythematous or yellowish, well-circumscribed skin papule on the head, neck or trunk. Our patient presented with blueberry-muffin spots. Excision biopsy of the lesions was performed and established the JXG diagnosis. The absence of the typical yellowish colour was due to the lack of xanthomatization because of lesion immaturity. Thus, this case together with four more case reports in the literature indicates that the diagnosis of JXG should be included in the differential diagnosis of clinical presentation of a blueberry muffin baby.

With the second patient we report on one of the few documented cases (fewer than 45) of congenital systemic JXG, presenting with a reduced general condition, a mass on the temple, fever, weight loss, and discrete skin involvement. Because of typical lesions in MRI (lesion in the skull and vertebra plana) and difficulties obtaining a usable biopsy for adequate histopathological analysis, the diagnosis of systemic JXG was delayed for several weeks. Despite the fact that fatal cases of systemic JXG - particularly central nervous system and hepatic involvement - have been reported only rarely, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential.

During the past decade, infants born as early as 22–24 weeks' gestation have been admitted to neonatal intensive care units in increasing numbers. This has facilitated a need for greater understanding of skin physiology and structure, as well as of influences of the surrounding environment on maturation. This article aims to elaborate the physiology of skin for infants born ≤ 24 weeks' gestation and the effects of common clinical practices to prevent and treat iatrogenic wounds. We summarize the evidence, where available, and describe clinical experience.

### A 3-week-old with an isolated "Blueberry muffin" rash [^116ahLda]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 3-week-old boy, former 39-week term infant, presented to the emergency department with a rash. One week before presentation, he developed dark, purple papules on his forehead, which then spread to the abdomen and inguinal regions. Throughout this time, he was eating well, gaining weight, developing appropriately, and was afebrile without cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. On presentation, the patient was well appearing with normal vital signs. His weight was 4.83 kg (86th percentile for age), his length was 56 cm (47th percentile for age), and his head circumference was 37 cm (62nd percentile for age). On skin examination, there were scattered purpuric papules and macules on the scalp, forehead, trunk, abdomen, and inguinal region. Initial laboratory studies were remarkable only for mild anemia. Our expert panel examines the case, offers a differential for a child with a "blueberry muffin" rash, and makes diagnostic considerations.

Case 3

A 4-month-old healthy boy, following a normal pregnancy and delivery, presented 1 month after birth with asymptomatic perianal lesions. The skin lesions were composed of yellowish, follicular, spiked protruding firm papules on an erythematous background, undetachable upon rubbing (Fig 3, A). Dermoscopy revealed white-yellowish follicular keratotic papules (Fig 3, B). The skin lesions resolved after 1 month, at 5 months of age, without any treatment.

### Care of congenital melanocytic nevi in newborns and infants: review and management recommendations [^113MwkKa]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A pediatric dermatology expert working group performed a narrative review to describe care related to congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) in neonates and infants. There are no published guidelines for most aspects of care, including routine skin care and visit intervals. Few guidelines exist for surgical management; newer recommendations favor conservative practice. Emerging evidence contributes to recommendations for screening MRI to evaluate for neural melanosis and related central nervous system complications, however, more research is needed. Risk for melanoma is generally low, but those with large, giant, or multiple CMN have a higher risk. Multidisciplinary care, with a focus on family and patient preferences, is of paramount importance. Without standardized screening and management guidelines, questions abound regarding appropriate physical examination intervals, potential treatment including full or partial excision, timing and frequency of imaging, melanoma risk, and assessment for neural melanosis. This review highlights the current state of knowledge concerning care of patients with CMN, reveals gaps in the literature surrounding skin care, and provides management recommendations. We additionally discuss cutaneous complications of CMN, such as pruritus, hypertrichosis, and wound healing. Resources and references for families and providers can help patients navigate this sometimes challenging diagnosis. Finally, we contribute expert care recommendations to the current body of literature as a foundation for the development of future, more comprehensive care guidelines.

### A case report of a blueberry muffin baby caused by congenital self-healing indeterminate cell histiocytosis [^116UFHix]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In our patient, the purpuric eruptions dissolved spontaneously after 2 weeks. There was no systemic involvement. This disease course is similar to that of Congenital Self - Healing Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis or Hashimoto-Pritzker disease, a rare benign variant of LCH which typically appears at birth or in the neonatal period. It is characterized by multiple asymptomatic papulonodular lesions which resolve spontaneously within weeks to months. However, the presence of Langerin in the accumulating cells, distinguishes this LCH variant from ICH. Due to the rarity of ICH, little is known about the chances of remission and disease-free survival after spontaneous resolution of the lesions.

ICH is an exceptionally rare cause of blueberry muffin rash in neonates which can be diagnosed by skin biopsy. ICH is limited to the skin in most cases, but systemic development is possible. Therefore, it is essential to monitor these patients closely and perform routine follow-up. To this date, pathologic parameters to predict disease course have not been established.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^114d8Ssx]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) states that IHs occur in as many as 5% of infants and most IHs are small, innocuous, self-resolving, and require no treatment, but because of size or location a significant minority are potentially problematic, including IHs that may cause permanent scarring and disfigurement, hepatic or airway IHs, IHs with potential for functional impairment, ulceration, and associated underlying abnormalities. It notes that the most rapid and significant growth occurs between 1 and 3 months of age and that growth is completed by 5 months of age in most cases; early intervention and/or referral (ideally by 1 month of age) is recommended for infants who have potentially problematic IHs. When systemic treatment is indicated, propranolol is the drug of choice at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day, with treatment typically continued for at least 6 months and often maintained until 12 months of age (occasionally longer). Topical timolol may be used to treat select small, thin, superficial IHs, and surgery and/or laser treatment are most useful for residual skin changes after involution and, less commonly, may be considered earlier to treat some IHs.

Achondroplasia — ear, nose and throat (ENT) care and hearing: Children "should have a comprehensive audiological assessment at birth, as indicated by signs and symptoms or in any case no later than 5 years of age", and those with "speech delay, hearing difficulties, and/or signs and symptoms of middle ear effusion should be referred to an ENT specialist". Adults and children "frequently have hearing loss and middle ear disease", so clinicians "should evaluate eardrums and ask about hearing difficulties as part of regular health maintenance to guide appropriate referrals". For chronic eustachian tube dysfunction with middle ear effusions and conductive hearing loss, tympanostomy tube placement "can be recommended when middle ear effusions are present for 3 or more months and hearing loss is documented". "Amplification with hearing aids can be offered" for hearing loss, including conductive loss from middle ear disease. Because high jugular bulb in the middle ear is more common, clinicians should check for otoscopic signs of high jugular bulb before myringotomy or other otological procedures are performed.

### A case of neonatal lupus erythematosus presenting with extensive erosions at birth, healing with extensive scarring [^113mpShS]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of widespread erosive lesions at birth includes infections, eg, congenital HSV infection, varicella-zoster infection, staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome, neonatal candidiasis; genodermatoses, eg, epidermolysis bullosa, incontinentia pigmenti, and others, eg, focal dermal hypoplasia, aplasia cutis congenita, and autoimmune bullous diseases. Detailed maternal and family history with thorough examination of the skin, mucosal surfaces, hair, and nails should be performed. Skin biopsies may be considered to provide additional information with regards to an underlying etiology.

The prognosis is generally good for babies with NLE, especially the cutaneous manifestations. In classical NLE, lesions typically heal without scarring. However, sequelae such as scarring, dyspigmentation, and telangiectasias can occur, especially in congenital lesions and with extensive involvement. Treatment is usually not required, though topical corticosteroids may hasten the resolution of lesions. Sun protection is advised. Extensive scarring may result in psychological impairment to patient and parents, and this should be monitored for, and support provided accordingly.

### Hemangiomas of infancy [^111iQPTp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hemangiomas of infancy are unique, benign, pediatric tumors of endothelial cells characterized by an initial phase of rapid proliferation, followed by slow involution, often leading to complete regression. Although most of these tumors are small and innocuous, some may be may be life- or function-threatening, or have associated structural congenital anomalies. Uncertainties regarding their diagnosis or management often prompt referral to a dermatologist. The pathogenesis of hemangiomas of infancy is not well understood, but recent findings suggest a unique vascular phenotype with dysregulated vascular homeostasis. This article reviews new information regarding the pathogenesis of these tumors and highlights the more worrisome presentations, including syndromic hemangiomas, that are likely to be problematic. In addition, management strategies and treatment options are discussed. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2003;48:477–93.)

Learning Objective

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be able to describe the clinical features of hemangiomas of infancy and potential complications as well as to understand the strengths and limitations of various treatment options.

The phenomenon was not visible until 6 months and 7 months, respectively. The "setting sun" phenomenon usually indicates underlying severe brain damage and can also be seen, although rarely, in healthy full-term infants until 1 to 5 months. However, the benign "setting sun" phenomenon might exist until 6 or 7 months of age in normal infants.

### Neonatal miliaria pustulosa – A case series [^115j89Zc]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background/Objectives

Miliaria pustulosa is a noninfectious, transient skin eruption of pustules overlying erythematous plaques secondary to obstruction of eccrine glands. There are very few case reports in the literature detailing miliaria pustulosa in neonates. When presenting in neonates, its similarity to life‐threatening infections may cause diagnostic confusion. By differentiating this condition from similar presentations, unnecessary treatments and tests in this population may be avoided.

Methods

Retrospective review of the medical records of nine neonates presenting with a pustular eruption diagnosed as miliaria pustulosa. Patients were seen at a children's hospital in Chicago, IL, USA; cases were selected by investigator recall.

Results

In this case series, miliaria pustulosa presents in nine neonates as clusters of eruptive pustules with resolution or significant improvement noted after an average of 2.6 days (range 1–5 days). The average age was 4.6 days (range 1–10 days old) and the average gestational age was 34.7 weeks (range 26.3–40.1 weeks). All patients had pustular outbreaks in areas occluded by swaddling, clothes, or adhesive. Seven patients had geometric lesions that were underlying sites of intravenous (IV) site adhesive or electrocardiogram (EKG) leads.

Conclusions

The consistent morphological features of this pustular eruption at sites of skin occlusion and the transient course in the setting of an otherwise well‐appearing infant are strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of miliaria pustulosa. It is important for clinicians to be familiar with this benign presentation and to differentiate it from other neonatal pustular eruptions to minimize invasive tests and treatments in this vulnerable population.

### Neonatal systemic juvenile xanthogranuloma with hydrops diagnosed by purpura skin biopsy: a case report and literature review [^115KQzTQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Making an immediate diagnosis of JXG was difficult because of the atypical appearance of the purple skin rash. At first, her purpuric skin lesions made believe that these were caused by coagulopathy. However, the lesion's color gradually turned dark blue-purple, almost black, and the shape changed to a firm and solid enlarged nodule, these findings led to the suspicion of a tumor. A skin biopsy was performed, and the patient's disease was finally diagnosed as JXG.

Neonatal systemic JXG is a rare disease, with only reported 32 cases in the literature (Table 1). All cases listed in Table presented systemic symptoms or had at least one affected visceral organ within the neonatal period. JXG typically presents yellow to pink-brown papules and nodules; 16 of the 32 cases presented a typical color (such as yellow and erythematous), with three of the 16 cases subsequently changing to a typical color. Eight cases had atypical skin lesions; one case had purpura (as in our case), and the others had bluish nodules, ecchymoses, petechiae, blueberry muffin rash, and a mass. Six cases had unclear in the details. There were nine cases in which the color and/or shape changed (excluding flattening, regression and disappearance) or new skin findings appeared over time, although there is a possibility that the change was not recognized because the patient was treated before the diagnosis. Change over time has been reported as a feature of congenital JXG. Therefore, diagnosis by visual inspection is difficult because it involves various phenotypes such as color, shape, and changes over time. It is unclear why the emergence of congenital JXG differs from that of a typical JXG, but it has been speculated that neonatal skin has less subcutaneous fat and appears purple due to subcutaneous bleeding.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^115fYHQb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Risk stratification, triage, and referral — Key Action Statement 1A states: Clinicians should classify an IH as high risk if there is evidence of or potential for the following: (1) life-threatening complications, (2) functional impairment or ulceration, (3) structural anomalies (eg, in PHACE syndrome or LUMBAR syndrome), or (4) permanent disfigurement (grade X, strong recommendation). The purpose of this statement is to ensure timely identification of IHs that may require early intervention. Because IHs involute spontaneously, many that are small, are superficial, occur in areas covered by clothing, and/or are unlikely to cause disfigurement do not require hemangioma specialist evaluation or treatment; however, some IHs may be considered high risk and, depending on clinician's comfort level and local access to specialty care, require a higher level of experience and expertise to determine if additional intervention is indicated. Segmental hemangiomas that cover an anatomic territory arising from 1 or more developmental units confer a higher risk of morbidity and life-threatening complications than those that are localized.

### Warning signs… [^116yuCnr]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Cradle cap is crusty or oily scaly patches on a baby's scalp. The condition is not painful or itchy, but it can cause thick white or yellow scales that are not easy to remove. Cradle cap most commonly begins sometime in the first three months but can occur in later years. Similar symptoms in older children are more likely to be dandruff than cradle cap. The rash is often prominent around the ear, the eyebrows or the eyelids. It may appear in other locations as well, where it is called infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis. Cradle cap is just a special — and more benign — case of this condition. The exact cause of cradle cap is not known. Cradle cap is not spread from person to person. It is also not caused by poor hygiene. It is not an allergy, and it is not dangerous. Cradle cap often lasts a few months. In some children, the condition can last until age 2 or 3. Signs and symptoms Cradle cap is seborrheic dermatitis that affects infants.

It presents on the scalp as greasy patches of scaling, which appear thick, crusty, yellow, white or brown. The affected regions are not usually itchy and do not bother the child. Other affected areas can include the eyelids, ear, around the nose, and in the groin. Hair loss can also occur. Causes Cradle cap is not caused by bacterial infection, allergy or poor hygiene. Cradle cap is also not contagious. Doctors do not agree on what causes cradle cap, but the two most common hypotheses are fungal infection and overactive sebaceous glands. Cradle cap is an inflammatory condition. Possibly it has to do with overactive sebaceous glands in the skin of newborn babies, due to the mother's hormones still in the baby's circulation. The glands release a greasy substance that makes old skin cells attach to the scalp instead of falling off as they dry. There is a relationship with skin yeasts.

Warning signs If the condition thickens, turns red and irritated, starts spreading, appears on other body parts, or if the baby develops thrush, fungal ear infection or a persistent diaper rash, medical intervention is recommended. Severe cases of cradle cap, especially with cracked or bleeding skin, can provide a place for bacteria to grow. If the cradle cap is caused by a fungal infection which has worsened significantly over days or weeks to allow bacterial growth, a combination treatment of antibiotics and antifungals may be necessary. Since it is difficult for a layperson to distinguish the difference between sebaceous gland cradle cap, fungal cradle cap, or either of these combined with a bacterial infection, medical advice should be sought if the condition appears to worsen. Cradle cap is occasionally linked to immune disorders.

If the baby is not thriving and has other problems, a doctor should be consulted. Treatment To help with cradle cap, parents can gently massage their baby's scalp with their fingers or a soft brush to loosen the scales. They may want to shampoo the baby's hair more frequently, and after shampooing gently brush the baby's scalp with a soft brush or a terrycloth towel. Oil remedies can be used by rubbing a small amount of pure, plant-derived oil on the baby's scalp and leaving it on for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, gently comb out the flakes with a fine tooth comb or brush. Be sure to wash out all of the oil to avoid making the cradle cap worse. In cases that are related to fungal infection, such as tinea capitis, doctors may recommend a treatment application of clotrimazole or miconazole.

### Transient neonatal pustular melanosis… [^114qWUh3]. Wikipedia (2009). Low credibility.

Transient neonatal pustular melanosis, also known as pustular melanosis, is a type of neonatal pustular eruption that is a transient rash common in newborns. It is vesiculopustular rash made up of 1–3 mm fluid-filled lesions that rupture, leaving behind a collarette of scale and a brown macule. The lesions are fragile and with no surrounding erythema. This rash occurs only in the newborn stage, usually appearing a few days after birth, but pigmented macules are sometimes already present at birth. The rash usually fades over three to four weeks but may linger for up to three months after birth. It can occur anywhere on the body, including the palms and soles. The cause of TNPM is unknown. It has been suggested that TNPM is merely a variant of erythema toxicum neonatorum or a "precocious" form of erythema toxicum neonatorum. No treatment is needed except for parental reassurance.

History Transient neonatal pustular melanosis was initially described in 1961 as lentigines neonatorum and as such was not fully distinguished from other similar rashes. Transient neonatal pustular melanosis was clearly identified in 1976 by Ramamurthy et al. Causes The cause of TNPM is unknown. It has been suggested that TNPM is merely a precocious form of erythema toxicum neonatorum based on the similar histopathology. Diagnosis Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is diagnosed clinically, based on appearance alone, with no need for special testing. Proper identification is important to distinguish it from other serious, infectious neonatal diseases and to help avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatments. A smear of the pustular contents will show polymorphic neutrophils and occasional eosinophils on Wright's stain. On histopathology, the pigmented macules will show basal and supra-basal increase in pigmentation without any pigmentary incontinence.

Bacterial culture will be negative. Increased frequency of placental squamous metaplasia has been reported in the mothers of some of these infants. Treatment No treatment is needed except for parental reassurance. The rash spontaneously resolves, usually in three to four weeks, but the pigmented macules may linger for up to three months after birth. Epidemiology The incidence of TNPM is 0. 6% in white infants and
4. 4% in African-American infants in the United States. This rash also generally has a higher incidence in non-African-American infants with skin of color. There is significant regional variation and the incidence can vary widely in other nations. For example, in Brazil, transient neonatal pustular melanosis occurs in 9. 6% of all newborns. TNPM occurs equally in both sexes. Genetic influence is unlikely as it has been reported in only one of pairs of identical twins. See also

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP… [^112hWkJg]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. In skinfolds, such as the axilla, antecubital fossa, and buttock creases, an erythematous, nonblanching linear eruption may develop. Petechiae on the palate may occur, as well as erythematous, swollen papillae with a white coating on the tongue. Red strawberry tongue occurs after desquamation of the white coating. After several weeks, the rash fades and is followed by desquamation of the skin, especially on the face, in skin-folds, and on the hands and feet, potentially lasting four to six weeks.

9 With a sensitivity of 90% to 95%, throat culture is the first-choice method for diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection, but this is not always practical. Impetigo Impetigo is a primary or secondary bacterial infection of the epidermis of the skin. Primary infections occur when bacteria enter breaks in the skin, whereas secondary infections develop at the site of an existing dermatosis. There are bullous and nonbullous forms of the infection, with the bullous form typically occurring in neonates and the nonbullous form most common in preschool- and school-aged children. 12 Although Streptococcus pyogenes was once the most common cause of nonbullous impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus has surpassed it in more recent years. However, S. pyogenes may still be the predominant cause in warm and humid climates. S. aureus is the main source of bullous impetigo. Initially, children may develop vesicles or pustules that form a thick, yellow crust.

With autoinoculation, the lesions may quickly spread. The face and extremities are most commonly affected. Although impetigo is usually a self-limited disease, antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications and spread of the infection.
12. Erythema Infectiosum Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is caused by parvovirus B19. It is a common childhood infection characterized by a prodrome of low-grade fever, malaise, sore throat, headache, and nausea followed several days later by an erythematous "slapped cheek" facial rash. After two to four days, the facial rash fades. In the second stage of the disease process, pink patches and macules may develop in a lacy, reticular pattern, most often on the extremities. After one to six weeks, the rash resolves but may reappear with sun exposure, heat, or stress. Molluscum Contagiosum Molluscum contagiosum is a skin infection caused by a poxvirus.

This highly contagious viral infection most commonly affects children two to 11 years of age. 14 It also occurs in sexually active adolescents. The lesions are flesh-colored or pearly white, small papules with central umbilication. The oral mucosa is rarely affected, but lesions may appear on the genital region and conjunctiva. Typically, children have 10 to 20 lesions, but occasionally there may be up to hundreds. 14 Molluscum may also occur in conjunction with dermatitis.
