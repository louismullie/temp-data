## Question

anti hbc reactive means

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "anti-HBc reactive" means and how to interpret this result in various clinical situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what anti-HBc actually measures and its typical serologic course. Then, I should verify the common clinical scenarios that produce an isolated anti-HBc pattern. Next, I will review how to distinguish true infection from false positives and occult infection. After that, I need to consider special populations and immunosuppression-related reactivation risk. Finally, I will synthesize practical management steps, including when to order HBV DNA and how to counsel patients and vaccinate appropriately.

> Let me first confirm the basics: anti-HBc stands for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and a "reactive" result means the assay detected total anti-HBc, which includes both IgM and IgG, indicating current or past HBV exposure. Importantly, anti-HBc is not produced after vaccination, so its presence implies natural infection at some point, not vaccine-induced immunity [^113Vf5hB] [^115C2U9u] [^113sMSrA].

> Wait, let me verify the serologic dynamics so I don't jump to conclusions: in acute infection, total anti-HBc appears around symptom onset and typically persists for life, whereas IgM anti-HBc predominates early and fades within months. In chronic infection, total anti-HBc remains detectable alongside HBsAg. In resolved infection, total anti-HBc persists and anti-HBs is usually present, though anti-HBs can wane over time, which sets the stage for isolated anti-HBc patterns [^111QCSP3] [^113Vf5hB].

> Hold on, I should clarify what "anti-HBc reactive" implies in different panels: if HBsAg is positive with anti-HBc, that supports current infection. If HBsAg is negative with anti-HBc and anti-HBs, that fits resolved infection. If HBsAg and anti-HBs are both negative with anti-HBc positive, that is the "isolated anti-HBc" pattern, which is the most ambiguous and requires careful interpretation and, in many cases, HBV DNA testing to exclude occult infection or a false positive [^111CBdhz] [^111ZRcv2] [^113TUWr4].

> I will now examine the isolated anti-HBc scenario more closely, because that's where misinterpretation often occurs: isolated anti-HBc can reflect past infection with waning anti-HBs, occult HBV infection with low-level HBV DNA despite negative HBsAg, the serologic window period early in acute infection, HBsAg escape mutants, or, less commonly, a false-positive test. The prevalence of occult HBV among anti-HBc–positive, HBsAg-negative individuals varies by risk group, ranging from roughly 1–10% in general populations to higher in high-risk groups, and anti-HBc alone is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to screen for occult infection, so HBV DNA is the decisive test when suspicion is high [^1124hsJS] [^115Yequt] [^1171GKJg] [^113TUWr4].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or starting immunosuppression? I need to ensure I don't miss reactivation risk: in people with HIV, cancer, or those initiating cytotoxic or B-cell–depleting therapies, isolated anti-HBc carries a nontrivial risk of HBV reactivation, and guidelines recommend universal triple-panel screening (HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs) before immunosuppression, with HBV DNA testing if HBsAg and/or anti-HBc are positive. In many such settings, preemptive antiviral prophylaxis is favored over monitoring alone due to the severity of reactivation events [^112pm5MH] [^112Udc6V] [^115vFsic] [^111a7Xkq].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize: in pregnancy, isolated anti-HBc is uncommon but, when present, may warrant HBV DNA assessment because perinatal transmission risk, though low, is not zero. In infants, a positive anti-HBc can reflect passive maternal transfer and should not be interpreted as infection before 24 months. In dialysis, anti-HBc alone should not be taken as proof of prior immunity, and vaccination decisions should be individualized with virology input. In blood donors, anti-HBc reactivity leads to deferral because of transfusion-transmitted HBV risk from occult infection, underscoring the public health implications of this pattern [^114u4ARf] [^115hQjTM] [^114dUgrt] [^116KZsF9].

> I should double-check how to distinguish a false-positive anti-HBc from true infection: in low-prevalence settings or in patients without risk factors, repeating the anti-HBc assay or using an alternative platform can help. Discordant results, especially when HBsAg and anti-HBs are negative and HBV DNA is undetectable, support a false-positive call. However, if risk factors or immunosuppression are present, proceeding directly to sensitive HBV DNA testing is prudent rather than relying on repeat serology alone [^113TUWr4] [^1151o2e3].

> Next, I should review practical management steps so the interpretation translates into action: for any isolated anti-HBc, I need to check liver enzymes and, if the patient will receive immunosuppression or is in a high-risk group, obtain HBV DNA with a sensitive assay. If HBV DNA is positive, manage as occult HBV and consider antiviral therapy, particularly before immunosuppression. If HBV DNA is negative and there is no immunosuppression planned, vaccination is reasonable to clarify immune status and provide protection, with anti-HBs checked 1–2 months after a single dose to gauge anamnestic response and decide whether a full series is needed [^1151o2e3] [^112pm5MH].

> Hold on, I should verify the vaccination strategy details so I don't misstate thresholds: in adults with isolated anti-HBc, giving one standard dose and checking anti-HBs in 1–2 months is endorsed. If anti-HBs is at least 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed. If less than 100 mIU/mL, complete the full series and recheck anti-HBs. In settings of anticipated high immunosuppression, some experts favor proceeding directly to prophylactic antivirals rather than relying on vaccination alone, but this should be individualized by risk and guideline context [^1151o2e3].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency: anti-HBc reactive means prior natural HBV exposure, but its clinical meaning depends entirely on HBsAg and anti-HBs. Isolated anti-HBc is a red flag for possible occult infection or false positivity and merits HBV DNA testing before immunosuppression, while in immunocompetent, low-risk individuals with negative DNA, vaccination can both clarify status and provide protection. Across oncology, HIV, and other immunosuppressed settings, universal triple-panel screening and risk-stratified prophylaxis reduce reactivation harm and should be the default approach [^113Vf5hB] [^112pm5MH] [^115vFsic].

---

Anti-HBc reactive means the patient has **past or current HBV infection** [^113Vf5hB], as anti-HBc appears during acute infection and persists for life [^111QCSP3]. It is **not due to vaccination** [^113Vf5hB] and does not indicate immunity [^113Vf5hB]. Interpretation depends on HBsAg and anti-HBs: with HBsAg positive, it indicates current infection; with anti-HBs positive, it indicates resolved infection; with neither, it is "isolated anti-HBc", which may reflect occult infection, false positivity, or waning immunity [^1151o2e3] [^113TUWr4]. In immunosuppressed patients, **HBV DNA testing is recommended** [^113TUWr4] to exclude occult infection and guide prophylaxis [^1151o2e3].

---

## Clinical significance of anti-HBc

Anti-HBc is a **marker of HBV exposure** — present in acute, chronic, and resolved infection — and persists for life [^113Vf5hB]. It is **not produced after vaccination** [^113sMSrA], so its presence indicates natural infection, not vaccine-induced immunity [^117VTzCt].

---

## Interpretation of anti-HBc results

Interpretation depends on **coexisting serologic markers**:

| **HBsAg** | **Anti-HBs** | **Interpretation** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Positive | Negative | Current HBV infection | Acute or chronic infection |
| Negative | Positive | Resolved HBV infection | Immune after natural infection |
| Negative | Negative | Isolated anti-HBc | - Past infection with waning anti-HBs <br/> - False positive <br/> - Occult HBV infection <br/> - Window period |

---

## Isolated anti-HBc

Isolated anti-HBc (anti-HBc positive, HBsAg and anti-HBs negative) is common and has **multiple explanations**:

- **Past infection with waning anti-HBs**: Anti-HBs declines over time after resolved infection [^113TUWr4].
- **False-positive result**: Rare, especially in low-prevalence settings [^114XN4gN] [^113jMngm].
- **Occult HBV infection**: HBsAg-negative infection with low-level HBV DNA [^115Yequt].
- **Window period**: Early acute infection before anti-HBs appears [^111QCSP3].

Occult HBV infection is **more common in immunocompromised patients**, including those with HIV or HCV coinfection, and in those on immunosuppressive therapy [^11442Uqt] [^113jMngm]. In these patients, **HBV DNA testing is recommended** to exclude occult infection [^113TUWr4].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Immunosuppressed patients**: Anti-HBc positive patients are at risk of HBV reactivation; HBV DNA testing is recommended, and antiviral prophylaxis may be indicated [^112pm5MH] [^112Udc6V].
- **Blood donation**: Anti-HBc positive donors are deferred to reduce transfusion-transmitted HBV risk [^116KZsF9].
- **Vaccination**: Anti-HBc positive patients without anti-HBs may benefit from vaccination to boost immunity [^114EB7Wg].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: False positives can occur; confirmatory testing may be needed [^113TUWr4].
- **Low-level viremia**: HBV DNA may be intermittently detectable in occult infection, requiring sensitive assays [^114d2ngE].
- **Clinical context**: Interpretation must consider patient risk factors, immune status, and clinical presentation [^113TUWr4].

---

Anti-HBc reactive indicates **past or current HBV infection** and is not due to vaccination [^113Vf5hB]. Interpretation depends on HBsAg and anti-HBs, and isolated anti-HBc may reflect occult infection, false positivity, or waning immunity [^1151o2e3]. In immunosuppressed patients, **HBV DNA testing is recommended** to exclude occult infection and guide prophylaxis [^112pm5MH].

### What is the role of serology for the study of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the age of molecular biology? [^11622V1t]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

To assess quantitative serology in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, testing by novel immunoassays has been carried out on 202 specimens from untreated patients and in 83 samples from 10 patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with lamivudine. Serum samples were assayed for quantitative HBsAg, in comparison with quantitative HBV-DNA, and for anti-HBc IgM and the avidity index (AI) of total anti-HBc antibodies. The AI was high (mean: 0.93 ± 0.19) in all groups, confirming the consistency of this procedure in chronic HBV infections. A low-level positivity (2–28 Paul-Ehrlich units/ml) for IgM anti-HBc was detectable both in HBeAg-positive and in HBeAg-negative untreated chronic hepatitis cases (mean S/CO values by the Abbott Architect assay: 0.51 ± 0.12 and 0.48 ± 0.10, respectively; correlation between assays: r = 0.685), while treated patients (mean: 0.20 ± 0.15) and inactive carriers (mean: 0.17 ± 0.21), were generally negative for IgM. The levels of HBsAg (IU/ml) showed a weak correlation with HBV-DNA (IU/ml). A difference in HBsAg levels was found between inactive carriers (1,935 ± 2,887 IU/ml) and chronic hepatitis B cases, either treated (5,199 ± 9,259 IU/ml) or untreated (14,596 ± 15,227 IU/ml). Pre-treatment levels of HBsAg in patients undergoing lamivudine treatment were correlated with a sustained response to therapy over 13–33 months (mean: 27.3) of follow-up: mean HBsAg values were 1,576 + 1,487 IU/ml in five responders and 6,063 + 5,142 in five nonresponders or breakthrough responders (P < 0.05). The availability of standardized quantitative immunoassays for HBsAg and anti-HBc IgM may be considered in addition to quantitative HBV-DNA in the staging and monitoring of chronic HBV infection.

### Serological pattern "anti-HBc alone": report on a workshop [^11442Uqt]. Journal of Medical Virology (2000). Low credibility.

In areas with low hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemicity such as most parts of Europe and the United States "anti-HBc alone" is found in 10–20% of all individuals with HBV markers, i.e., 1–4% of the population. In about 10% of these individuals HBV DNA is detected by PCR, the proportions varying greatly depending on the population studied, being highest in individuals coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (above 35%) and HIV (above 85%). A small proportion of individuals with "anti-HBc alone" are in the window phase of an HBV infection or in a stage of late HBV immunity. For the large proportion of these individuals this is not the case and they are thought to have an unresolved HBV-infection or a chronic infection in a late or "low grade" productive state. Currently, limited studies have been performed concerning the clinical aspects of individuals with "anti-HBc alone" and suspected chronic HBV infection. The majority of these individuals seem to be healthy. Some chronic carriers with "anti-HBc alone", however, do present signs of chronic hepatitis. Individuals with "anti-HBc alone" are potentially infectious. This is exemplified by a few case reports of HBV transmission to sexual contacts, perinatal transmission between mother and newborns and in blood recipients. Recommendations are given in relation to both the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the individuals with "anti-HBc alone" and in the blood banking and transplantation services.

ASCO provisional clinical opinion — HBV screening before systemic anticancer therapy states that all patients with cancer anticipating systemic anticancer therapy should be tested for hepatitis B virus by 3 tests — hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) — prior to, or at the beginning of, systemic anticancer therapy; anticancer therapy should not be delayed for the results of these screening tests, and findings of chronic HBV (HBsAg-positive) or past HBV (HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive with either negative or positive anti-HBs) infection require further action (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Guideline 5.3 – BBV infection: identification of patients for whom immunisation against HBV is not indicated

Hepatitis B vaccine is not indicated in patients who have current (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HBV DNA positive) or confirmed past HBV infection. Presence of the anti HBc antibody in isolation should not be taken as confirmation of previous HBV infection. Patients identified to be core antibody positive who are at risk of reactivation of HBV (particularly immunosuppression) may need to be vaccinated and the case should be discussed with a local virologist. (2B).

Rationale

Although there is no documented harm associated with the administration of the HBV vaccine to patients with natural immunity, it is recommended that anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies should be checked prior to immunisation. Patients who have a positive anti HBs antibody and who have a detectable anti HBc usually have natural immunity to HBV and therefore may not need vaccination. However, detection of Hepatitis B core antibody should not be used in isolation to determine immunity or previous infection and these patients may still require vaccination.

The need for pre-immunisation screening for anti HBc to avoid unnecessary immunisation should be guided by the likelihood that an individual has been exposed to HBV or previous vaccine as a study in the USA suggests that pre-immunisation screening is cost-effective only in populations in which the prevalence of HBV infection exceeds 30%.

Hepatitis B core antibody detected reports can arise from many scenarios. (Table 5 - interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination).
Recent receipt of blood products (core antibody is passively acquired and is a frequent finding in patients who have received blood, plasma, IVIg or similar in the last few weeks, testing a serum sample predating the blood products is required to determine patient status), (HBV vaccination will be required)
Occult infection: HBV DNA will be detected and Anti HBs antibody levels are usually low (HBV vaccination not required)
False positive: discussion with local virology team to determine if referral to reference lab can be helpful (HBV vaccination required)

Table 5
Interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination (1B)

Although patients are routinely considered as having HBV transmission in the past and not infectious to others, there is an increasing evidence that these persons may replicate or may start to replicate under special circumstances (immunosuppression, cachexia). Any patient with confirmed past HBV infection who is going to be significantly immunosuppressed is at risk of reactivation and a pre-emptive management plan should be made with a Hepatitis B specialist.

Hepatitis B serology-driven vaccination steps in HIV — For isolated core antibody and chronic HBV exclusion: One dose of vaccine should be administered to patients who have a positive anti-HBc with a negative HBsAg and HBsAb, and if the HBsAb titer is not > 100 mIU/mL, a full series should be administered; prior to any HBV vaccination, confirm the patient does not have chronic HBV.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1112Bw2z]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1171GKJg]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Limited access to HBV DNA NAT represents a serious obstacle for the identification of occult HBV infection cases in highly endemic countries with limited resources. In this context, the use of a low-cost serological test alternative to HBV DNA NAT could provide a solution if such a test proves to be accurate. Therefore, we assessed the performance of anti-HBc to identify occult HBV infection. In our subgroup analysis, occult HBV infection prevalence was less than 0.1% (95% CI 0.0–0.0) in studies targeting HBsAg-negative people irrespective of anti-HBc serostatus, and 9.9% (7.9–12.2) in studies exclusively including HBsAg-negative people positive for anti-HBc, confirming that positive anti-HBc is an important risk factor for occult HBV infection. However, its capacity to discriminate people with occult HBV infection from people without any type of HBV infection was not sufficiently high for it to be used as a diagnostic test alternative to HBV DNA NAT: the pooled sensitivity was 77% and specificity was 76%. It would not be advisable to use anti-HBc as a sole biomarker to screen donated blood for occult HBV infection, even in a resource-limited context.

Our systematic review suggests that occult HBV infection should not be neglected as a global health issue. Corroboration of our results with the growing literature on occult HBV infection, its transmissibility, and its association with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma implies that the proportion of new cases of chronic HBV infection attributable to occult HBV infection, as well as the fraction of advanced chronic liver disease attributable to transmission from people with occult HBV infection, is unlikely to be negligible. Nevertheless, occult HBV infection has been a missing parameter from current global guidance on viral hepatitis testing, blood product safety, and HBV elimination. Apart from a single study, the population-attributable fraction for the effect of occult HBV infection has been poorly estimated. The impact of occult HBV infection on the 2030 viral hepatitis elimination targets, defined by a 90% reduction in new HBV cases and a 65% reduction in HBV-related mortality compared with the 2015 baseline, should be urgently examined.

### Hepatitis B serological markers and plasma DNA concentrations [^111PpoZr]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

A total of 543 participants, 30.0% of those with evidence of HBV exposure, had isolated anti-HBc. Similar rates (32–42%) have been found in previous studies in Uganda and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. This pattern may be due to false-positive anti-HBc test results, rare in a high prevalence population such as this, or be transient and occur during the resolution phase of acute HBV. Persistent isolated anti-HBc may also be due to occult HBV infection (with low-level detectable HBV DNA viral load) or loss of anti-HBs with time or immunosuppression in patients who have resolved infection. Repeat serology and HBV DNA viral load testing would help to determine more accurately the status of the 543 patients with isolated anti-HBc, but was not available in this study.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111a7Xkq]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isolated anti-HBc management in HIV — People with isolated anti-HBc should be vaccinated with one standard dose of HepB vaccine and anti-HBs titers should be checked 1 to 2 months after vaccination (BII). If the anti-HBs titer is ≥ 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed; if < 100 mIU/mL, a complete series of the same HepB vaccine should be completed and followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). The cutoff of 100 mIU/mL is used because 100% with a titer of 100 mIU/mL after a booster maintained response for > 18 months compared with only 23% with a titer of 10 to 100 mIU/mL; if quantitative titers are not available, complete the series followed by qualitative anti-HBs testing (BII).

### Hepatitis B [^116LK5KX]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

HBV diagnostic criteria — per Table 4 — are specified for three states. For chronic hepatitis B, criteria include HBsAg-positive > 6 months, serum HBV DNA > 20,000 IU/mL (10⁵ copies/mL), persistent or intermittent increase in ALT/AST levels, and liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis with moderate or severe necroinflammation. For inactive HBsAg carrier state, criteria include HBsAg-positive > 6 months, HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe+, serum HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL, persistently normal ALT/AST levels, and liver biopsy confirms absence of significant hepatitis. For resolved hepatitis B, criteria include previous known history of acute or chronic hepatitis B or the presence of anti-HBc ± anti-HBs, HBsAg-, undetectable serum HBV DNA*, and normal ALT levels; very low levels may be detectable using sensitive PCR assays.

### Nucleic acid testing to detect HBV infection in blood donors [^114T7ZZ1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in blood donors is achieved by screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and for antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). However, donors who are positive for HBV DNA are currently not identified during the window period before seroconversion. The current use of nucleic acid testing for detection of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and HBV DNA in a single triplex assay may provide additional safety.

Methods

We performed nucleic acid testing on 3.7 million blood donations and further evaluated those that were HBV DNA-positive but negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc. We determined the serologic, biochemical, and molecular features of samples that were found to contain only HBV DNA and performed similar analyses of follow-up samples and samples from sexual partners of infected donors. Seronegative HIV and HCV-positive donors were also studied.

Results

We identified 9 donors who were positive for HBV DNA (1 in 410,540 donations), including 6 samples from donors who had received the HBV vaccine, in whom subclinical infection had developed and resolved. Of the HBV DNA-positive donors, 4 probably acquired HBV infection from a chronically infected sexual partner. Clinically significant liver injury developed in 2 unvaccinated donors. In 5 of the 6 vaccinated donors, a non-A genotype was identified as the dominant strain, whereas subgenotype A2 (represented in the HBV vaccine) was the dominant strain in unvaccinated donors. Of 75 reactive nucleic acid test results identified in seronegative blood donations, 26 (9 HBV, 15 HCV, and 2 HIV) were confirmed as positive.

Conclusions

Triplex nucleic acid testing detected potentially infectious HBV, along with HIV and HCV, during the window period before seroconversion. HBV vaccination appeared to be protective, with a breakthrough subclinical infection occurring with non-A2 HBV subgenotypes and causing clinically inconsequential outcomes.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Management of isolated anti-HBc in HIV — routinely checking HBV DNA is not recommended; instead, vaccinate with one standard dose of HBV vaccine and check anti-HBs titers 1 to 2 months after vaccination. If the anti-HBs titer is > 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if the titer is < 100 mIU/mL, a complete series of HBV vaccine should be completed followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). The cut-off of 100 mIU/mL is supported by a study in which 100% of patients with isolated anti-HBc who achieved a titer of 100 mIU/mL after a booster dose maintained an anti-HBs response for > 18 months compared to 23% among those with a titer of 1 to 100 mIU/mL.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^116Swc6P]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — uniform definitions and HBV DNA threshold: Absent evidence from RCTs on the comparative utility of risk-based versus universal HBV screening or on predictors of HBV reactivation, the Panel highlights the need for consistent definitions and supports the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases definition of HBV reactivation and adverse clinical liver-associated outcomes as outlined in the 2018 HBV Guidance. To guide oncology practice for patients with past HBV infection, the PCO uses a simplified cut-off threshold of HBV DNA > 1,000 IU/mL to determine when further management is warranted, and notes that asymptomatic rises in HBV DNA are very different from clinical hepatitis flares and should be interpreted with caution. Case definitions include that chronic HBV infection refers to patients who are HBsAg-positive regardless of anti-HBc status, although most will be anti-HBc–positive, and past HBV infection refers to patients who have a negative HBsAg with positive anti-HBc, regardless of anti-HBs status.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HDV co-infection, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining reflex testing for anti-HDV antibody testing following a positive HBsAg test result and also for HDV RNA testing (where available) following a positive anti-HDV antibody test result as an additional strategy to promote diagnosis.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^114u4ARf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isolated anti-HBc in people with HIV during pregnancy — interpretation and vaccination steps are outlined: testing of anti-HBc alone can be a false positive, and the incidence of HBV viremia with the isolated anti-HBc pattern ranges from 1% to 36% in patients with HIV. Most people with HIV with isolated anti-HBc are HBV DNA–negative and not immune to HBV infection; therefore, they would benefit from HBV vaccination. While routinely checking HBV DNA is currently not recommended in other adults with HIV and isolated anti-HBc, it may be considered in pregnancy, and if HBV viremia is identified during pregnancy with isolated anti-HBc, ART should be adjusted to assure control of both HBV and HIV. People with isolated anti-HBc and negative or unknown HBV DNA should be vaccinated with one standard dose of HBV vaccine, anti-HBs titers should be checked 1 to 2 months after vaccination, if the anti-HBs titer is > 100 IU/mL no further vaccination is needed, and if the titer is < 100 IU/mL a complete HBV vaccine series should be given followed by anti-HBs testing. Isolated anti-HBc and occult HBV infection are typically associated with very low levels of HBV DNA and therefore extremely low risk of transmitting HBV perinatally.

### Anti-HBc-nonreactive occult hepatitis B infections with HBV genotypes B and C in vaccinated immunocompetent adults [^117RigRu]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) has been identified as a particular feature of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection natural history. OBI is characterized by the presence of generally low levels of replication‐competent HBV DNA in the liver and/or in the blood without detectable HBsAg.OBI is mostly associated with anti‐HBc that is usually detectable 6–12 weeks after infection and remains detectable lifelong in immunocompetent individuals when anti‐HBs level declines to undetectable levels and HBV DNA is often intermittently detectable. Unusual combinations of anti‐HBc and anti‐HBs profiles were observed in OBI carriers that may lead to uncertainty in the interpretation of results or suspicion of testing errors. A multiregional study reported anti‐HBc‐negative OBI in 0.6% of asymptomatic blood donors, 83% of whom carried anti‐HBs as the only serological marker. Significantly lower frequencies were observed in OBI blood donors from Europe (2.4%), the Mediterranean region (4.3%) and South Africa (6.2%). This difference in isolated anti‐HBs prevalence remains unclear but may be related to regional differences in HBV endemicity, prophylaxis programs, natural history of HBV infection and circulating HBV genotypes.

Rare cases of anti‐HBc‐negative overt chronic HBV infection have been documented, mainly in immunocompromised patients experiencing HBV reactivation or subjects co‐infected with HIV, patients infected with HBV variants carrying mutations that might impair HBcAg expression or detection, and infants born to HBsAg‐positive mothers. In China and South East Asia, isolated anti‐HBs were reported in 6.3%–20.3% of immunocompetent blood donors with OBI. Isolated anti‐HBs OBI has been also reported in immunized neonates born to HBsAg‐positive mothers and children with HBsAg‐positive parents. When available, follow‐up of vaccinated children in these studies was relatively limited in time and often showed low and transient HBV DNA levels. In contrast, a Taiwanese cross‐sectional study reported HBV viraemia in fully immunized individuals aged > 18 years who were negative for anti‐HBc. Further, vaccinated blood donors sexually exposed to partners with chronic HBV developed anti‐HBc‐negative OBI reflecting an aborted form of infection.

### Occult hepatitis B virus infection: a covert operation [^113okwYr]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Detection of occult hepatitis B requires assays of the highest sensitivity and specificity with a lower limit of detection of less than 10 IU/mL for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and < 0.1 ng/mL for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). This covert condition is relatively common in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) that seems to exert some influence on the replicative capacity and latency of HBV. Detection of virus-specific nucleic acid does not always translate into infectivity, and the occurrence of primer-generated HBV DNA that is of partial genomic length in immunocompetent individuals who have significant levels of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) may not be biologically relevant. Acute flares of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that occur during the early phase of therapy for HCV or ALT levels that remain elevated at the end of therapy in biochemical nonresponders should prompt an assessment for occult hepatitis B. Similarly, the plasma from patients with chronic hepatitis C that is hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive (± anti-HBs at levels of < 100 mIU/mL) should be examined for HBV DNA with the most sensitive assay available. If a liver biopsy is available, immunostaining for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) should be contemplated and a portion of the sample tested for HBV DNA. This is another reason for optimal collection of a specimen (e.g. two passes with a 16-guage needle under ultrasound guidance). Transmission of HBV to immunosuppressed orthotopic liver transplant recipients by donors with occult hepatitis B (OHB) will continue to occupy the interests of the transplant hepatologist. As patients with OHB may have detectable HBV DNA in serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or liver that can be reactivated following immunosuppression or intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the patient needs to be either monitored or treated depending on the pretreatment serological results such as an isolated anti-HBc reaction or a detectable HBV DNA.

### Clinical course and core variability in HBV infected patients without detectable anti-HBc antibodies [^113esaAo]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of anti-HBc antibodies indicates direct encounter of the immune system with hepatitis B virus (HBV).

Objectives

Aim of our study was to seek for anti-HBc negative but HBV replicating patients and analyze their clinical course and preconditions.

Study Design

From 1568 HBV-DNA positive patients, 29 patients (1.85%) tested negative for anti-HBc. The absence of anti-HBc could be confirmed in 19 patients using an alternative assay. In 16 of 19 cases, a partial or full HBV genome analysis was performed with NGS sequencing to evaluate if specific mutations were associated with anti-HBc absence. As a control group samples from 32 matched HBV infected patients with detectable anti-HBc were sequenced.

Results

Patients with detectable HBV-DNA and sequenced HBV core region in the confirmed absence of anti-HBc were diagnosed with acute HBV infection (n = 3), HBV reactivation (n = 9) and chronic hepatitis B (n = 4). Most patients (12/16) were immunosuppressed: 3/16 patients had an HIV coinfection, 7/16 patients suffered from a malignant disease and 4/16 patients underwent solid organ transplantation (from which 2/4 had a malignant disease). Compared to the control cohort, HBV variants from anti-HBc negative patients showed less variability in the core region.

Conclusions

In the absence of anti-HBc, HBV-DNA was most often found in immunocompromised hosts. Distinct mutations or deletions in the core region did not explain anti-HBc negativity. It would be advisable not to rely only on a single result of anti-HBc negativity to exclude HBV infection in immunocompromised hosts, but to measure anti-HBc repeatedly or with different methods.

### The significance of' anti-HBc only' in the clinical virology laboratory [^113WY1i6]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated detection of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibody (anti-HBs) has been reported, particularly among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The significance of this phenomenon is unknown and it is unclear whether all individuals with such serological pattern need further molecular investigations.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of 'anti-HBc only' in samples referred to a clinical virology laboratory and to evaluate its significance and possible mechanisms.

Study Design

Samples identified as anti-HBc positive (389/4359, 8.9%) during an 11-month period were investigated for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HCV and anti-HIV. 'Anti-HBc only' samples were tested for HBV DNA using a nested qualitative PCR. Viral loads were measured in samples with detectable HBV DNA and the DNA sequences were analysed.

Results

Of 379 samples with detectable anti-HBc, 155 (40.9%) were 'anti-HBc only'. HBV DNA was detected in 6/151 (4%), all of which had a viral load < 400 copies per ml. Anti-HIV was found in 50/151 (33.1%) and anti-HCV in 14/151 (9.3%). Of these, only one of the HIV infected patients had detectable HBV DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the HBV surface gene from three patients showed a variety of genotypes (A, E and G). One sequence had a mutation in codon 144, which has previously been reported to give false negative HBsAg results.

Conclusions

'Anti-HBc only' is a common phenomenon in the clinical virology laboratory but only a small proportion of samples had detectable HBV DNA. The presence of HBsAg mutants with possible false negative HBsAg test result is of concern. Samples with 'anti-HBc only' could be used to monitor the emergence of these mutants.

### Hepatitis B [^115JAMSn]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem, with an estimated 296 million people chronically infected and 820000 deaths worldwide in 2019. Diagnosis of HBV infection requires serological testing for HBsAg and for acute infection additional testing for IgM hepatitis B core antibody (IgM anti-HBc, for the window period when neither HBsAg nor anti-HBs is detected). Assessment of HBV replication status to guide treatment decisions involves testing for HBV DNA, whereas assessment of liver disease activity and staging is mainly based on aminotransferases, platelet count, and elastography. Universal infant immunisation, including birth dose vaccination is the most effective means to prevent chronic HBV infection. Two vaccines with improved immunogenicity have recently been approved for adults in the USA and EU, with availability expected to expand. Current therapies, pegylated interferon, and nucleos(t)ide analogues can prevent development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but do not eradicate the virus and rarely clear HBsAg. Treatment is recommended for patients with cirrhosis or with high HBV DNA levels and active or advanced liver disease. New antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies aiming to achieve functional cure (ie, clearance of HBsAg) are in clinical development. Improved vaccination coverage, increased screening, diagnosis and linkage to care, development of curative therapies, and removal of stigma are important in achieving WHO's goal of eliminating HBV infection by 2030.

Hepatitis B virus infection — diagnosis and screening in adults and adolescents with HIV: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing all people over the age of 18, including those with HIV, for chronic HBV infection. Initial testing should include a triple screening panel for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and anti-HBs. In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure, and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM) is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. See CDC's Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Hepatitis B for information on how to interpret laboratory results.

Discussion

There is currently no professional consensus on the need to follow up with OBI donors. From the point of view of the donors' blood services and GPs, this action provides the optimal reassurance to the donor. However, from a hepatology view, the clinical relevance of OBI and the need for follow-up is questioned since overdiagnosis consumes health resources and may lead to anxiety. An HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patient would not routinely undergo HBV DNA testing nor be referred to hepatology. It can be considered illogical to do so solely due to the test occurring in the blood donation setting, as current evidence does not suggest this to be a proportionate response. Indeed, given the general good health of blood donors, such a response is even less likely to meet an acceptable threshold for benefit and may lead to unwarranted impacts on patients, including psychological and financial (direct and indirect, depending on the healthcare system). From a public health perspective, there is a need for clear messaging for these donors so that the notifications and any required actions are clear for the donor. Further, the importance of offering equal opportunities and the sensible use of limited resources based on risk are stressed.

It is agreed that there should be clear and consistent messaging provided for blood donors with OBI during diagnosis and follow-up, and education for the staff involved in follow-up is needed to ensure the reasons behind the referral are well understood, combined with clear guidelines and structure for healthcare providers regarding follow-up and referral. However, there may currently be a mixed message between the blood service and the hepatologist; donors cannot donate due to their infectious risk, but the infection risk is not a concern for hepatologists and the risk to individuals' health is also considered minimal. Since OBI is not without its consequences, OBI carriers who have other risk factors that increase their risk of developing liver damage should at least be given some advice. The potentially sinister connotations of 'occult' also present a problem, where the terminology for the condition in patient-facing resources may require review.

Thus, FDA has concluded that testing Whole Blood and components intended for transfusion for anti-HBc contributes to the safety of the blood supply by reducing the incidence of transfusion associated hepatitis B infection. Therefore, FDA now recommends that all donations of blood and blood components intended for transfusion be screened by an FDA licensed test to detect products that are repeatedly reactive for anti-HBc and prevent their distribution for use in transfusion.

### High levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients with' anti-HBc alone': role of HBsAg mutants [^114jMfWn]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

It remains unclear how the detection of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs) should be interpreted and whether all patients with this pattern need to be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA. This study aimed at reassessing the significance of 'anti-HBc alone' in unselected sera referred to the clinical laboratory and determining whether significant HBV viraemia can be found in this setting. Of the 6431 patients tested for HBsAg, total anti-HBc and anti-HBs in a Paris hospital over a 1-year period, 362 (5.6%) had 'anti-HBc alone' (24.8% of anti-HBc-positive patients). Only 11 of the 362 sera (3.0%) were found to be false positive. One patient was in the resolving phase of acute hepatitis B. HBV-DNA was detected in 10 of 362 (2.8%) patients, using a commercial standardized assay (threshold: 350 IU/mL). Viral loads exceeded 10⁴ copies/mL in 6 of 10 patients. Mutations in the HBsAg immunodominant region were identified in seven of the viraemic patients. HBsAg was detected in only two cases when retested by one of the latest, multivalent assays. Neither human immunodeficiency virus nor hepatitis C virus serostatus distinguished between patients with and without HBV-DNA. In conclusion, 'anti-HBc alone' should be considered a risk marker for a so-called 'false occult' HBV infection with significant viraemia. Indeed, results in this hospital population indicate that a small proportion of patients with 'anti-HBc alone' have high viral loads, revealing the occurrence of infection with HBV mutants that escape detection even by multivalent HBsAg assays.

Persons with Isolated Core Antibody

Persons with isolated anti-HBc should have their immune status and risk history considered before deciding next steps. Links to performance characteristics on all FDA-approved total anti-HBc assays are available (Supplementary Table 21). The specificity of total anti-HBc tests is 99.8%. However, if a person does not have risk factors, the result might be a false positive; repeat testing with the same assay is warranted to confirm the results. A false-positive isolated core antibody result means the person is susceptible and should be offered HepB vaccine per current ACIP recommendations.

A 2001–2018 national survey found the prevalence of isolated positive anti-HBc to be 0.8% (approximately 2.1 million persons). Among patients exposed to HBV, an isolated positive anti-HBc result might be the result of loss of anti-HBs after past resolved infection, occult infection (i.e. HBsAg is negative, but HBV DNA is positive), being in the window period before appearance of anti-HBs, or an HBsAg mutant infection (i.e. an infection that is not picked up by an HBsAg test unable to detect mutants). Patients who are immunosuppressed should be considered at risk for HBV reactivation, and HBV DNA testing is recommended to assess for occult infection. Among infants, an isolated anti-HBc result might be a consequence of passive placental transfer from an HBsAg-positive mother, which is why testing for anti-HBc is not indicated before age 24 months.

Patient Education

Patient education should be conducted in a culturally sensitive, nonstigmatizing manner in the patient's primary language (both written and oral whenever possible). Bilingual, bicultural, and medically trained interpreters should be used when indicated.

Reporting

Acute and chronic cases of HBV infection should be reported to the appropriate state or local health jurisdiction in accordance with requirements. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists publishes case definitions for the classification of reportable cases of HBV infection. CDC has updated guidance for health departments on viral hepatitis surveillance and case management.

### Occult hepatitis B virus infection: risk for a blood supply, but how about individuals' health? [^1147NonB]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Occult HBV infection

OBI is a challenging clinical entity to diagnose. No established markers predict the presence of cccDNA in the liver independently of the detection of circulating HBV DNA in plasma; potential biomarkers of cccDNA replicative status, such as circulating HBV RNA, have been suggested. Laboratory diagnosis of OBI based on plasma samples alone is thus somewhat dependent on the (in)sensitivity of the serological assay used for HBsAg detection and, in the absence of a liver biopsy sample, the sensitivity of the assays used to detect HBV DNA in plasma. In addition, the tendency of some OBI carriers to have HBV DNA levels that fluctuate above and below the lower limit of laboratory detection introduces both frequency of testing and an element of chance into the likelihood of identifying OBI. Assay-dependence of OBI diagnosis was indeed illustrated by our application of an ultrasensitive PCR method to screen anti-HBc positive donors, which achieved a four-fold increase in HBV DNA detection rate compared to the HBV NAT assay used for blood donation screening. Differences in the sensitivities of HBV DNA tests used for blood donation screening and standard clinical diagnoses could lead to misunderstanding of HBV infection status and create additional confusion and worry for individuals with OBI.

OBI may result from various phases of the natural history of HBV infection. Firstly, a prolonged resolution stage of acute HBV infections will mimic the plasma markers of OBI. Alternatively, false-negative HBsAg results that may incorrectly identify OBI may arise from carriers of HBV strains with mutations in the antigenic 'a' determinant of the HBsAg gene that escapes detection by many currently available HBsAg assays or with mutations that prevent HBsAg secretion. Cases of seronegative OBI have also been described globally, where individuals may have lost hepatitis B antibodies or may not have produced antibodies throughout their HBV infection. Further, studies have shown that in Chinese blood donors, around 9.5% of OBI carriers were anti-HBc negative but anti-HBs positive with a high 72% vaccination rate; this serological profile could lead to further diagnostic difficulties. However, no anti-HBc negative OBI cases have been documented in the United Kingdom. The typical serological profile of OBI is where HBsAg becomes undetectable following decades of HBsAg-positive HBV infection corresponding to the last phase in the natural history of HBV infection.

### Anti-HBc-nonreactive occult hepatitis B infections with HBV genotypes B and C in vaccinated immunocompetent adults [^11437t6J]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Absence or delayed anti‐HBc reactivity in patients with overt HBV infection has been associated with immunosuppression, HIV co‐infection, insufficient sensitivity of anti‐HBc assays and rare HBcAg variants. None of these conditions applied to the present OBI cases. All isolated anti‐HBs OBI donors were apparently immunocompetent with no evidence of liver disease, medical treatment or known viral co‐infection. Anti‐HBc false negative result was excluded by using three distinct assays, one of which included antigen–antibody complex dissociation pre‐treatment. No specific mutations in BCP/PC, Core and HBx that could alter HBcAg production or anti‐HBc detection were identified, consistent with studies of overt anti‐HBc‐negative HBV infection.

The minority OBI group with isolated anti‐HBs differed from the other two OBI groups by a significantly larger percentage of females, younger age, higher (although still relatively low) levels of viral DNA and anti‐HBs, and higher frequency of HBV vaccination (Table 1). The 72% vaccination rate observed in isolated anti‐HBs OBIs was consistent with the age distribution (median: 24 years [range: 18–54 years]) and the initiation of the Chinese universal HBV vaccination program in 1992. Isolated anti‐HBs OBIs were therefore stratified between 31 vaccinated and 11 unvaccinated with 87% of the former younger than 30 years and 73% of the latter group older than 30 (Tables S1 and Table 2). In addition to age, the 31 vaccinated isolated anti‐HBs OBIs differed in several other aspects: mostly males (68%), higher level of anti‐HBs at index, and more frequent, albeit not significantly, HBV genotype C (Table 2). However, both groups had in common an absence of DNA or anti‐HBc in lookback samples, persistence of isolated anti‐HBs status in follow‐up, and absence or paucity of amino acid substitutions in the Core and S MHR, respectively (Table S1, Figures S2 and S4, and Table 3). Due to the vaccination history of the majority of individuals with isolated anti‐HBs OBI, three main hypotheses were examined to explain the mechanisms underlying this condition: (i) long‐term persistence of OBI status acquired in infancy naturally or from infectious mother or relatives concomitantly or soon after vaccination, (ii) subclinical vaccine breakthrough infection with an HBV escape variant and (iii) unconventional infection acquired post‐vaccination.

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig).

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2022 [^117VTzCt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Guidance

ACIP recommends that adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥ 60 years with risk factors for hepatitis B should receive HepB vaccines, and that adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors for hepatitis B may receive HepB vaccines. In previous HepB vaccine recommendations, providers were advised to administer HepB vaccine to all patients who requested it. The new language for adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors is intended to prompt all providers to offer HepB vaccination to patients in that cohort, rather than wait for a patient to request vaccination, thus shifting the responsibility of initiating the consideration of HepB vaccination from the patient to the provider.

Persons who have completed a HepB vaccination series at any point or who have a history of HBV infection should not receive additional HepB vaccination, although there is no evidence that receiving additional vaccine doses is harmful. However, there are cases where revaccination might be indicated as specified in the 2018 ACIP recommendation (e.g. nonresponder infants born to persons testing positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], health care providers, and persons on hemodialysis). Providers should only accept dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination. Vaccination of persons immune to HBV infection because of current or previous infection or HepB vaccination does not increase the risk for adverse events. However, in settings in which the patient population has a high rate of previous HBV infection, prevaccination testing, which may be performed concomitantly with administration of the first dose of vaccine, might reduce costs by avoiding complete vaccination of persons who are already immune. Prevaccination testing consists of testing for HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). The presence of HBsAg indicates current HBV infection. The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating immunity, either from HepB vaccination after a complete series or after recovery from HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV. Detailed interpretations of serologic markers for HBV infection are available (2). Lack of access to serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible persons, especially in populations that are difficult to reach. Testing is not a requirement for vaccination, and in settings where testing is not feasible, vaccination of persons recommended to receive the vaccine should continue.

### Anti-HBc: a significant host predictor of spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance in chronic hepatitis B patients-a retrospective longitudinal study [^111JYchE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the classic traits specific to persistent HBV infection is that the hosts tend to have late, weak, narrowly focused cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses that quickly show attenuation, in contrast to the vigorous, polyclonal, and multi-specific CTL responses in acutely infected patients who are able to achieve rapid viral control with rapid clearance of HBsAg from the blood, i.e. acute self-limiting HBV infection. This suggests the key to viral clearance is generating immune responses that simultaneously target multiple viral antigens. Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is one of the HBV viral antigens recognized by the host immune system. Hosts seroconvert to anti-HBc as early as 3 weeks upon exposure. HBcAg can trigger innate, humoral and cellular immune responses. In particular, the T cell response to various epitopes of HBV including HBcAg is strong in acute self-limiting HBV infection, but is weak and quickly exhausted in chronic HBV infection. CTLs specific to all viral antigens do exist in the liver of CHB patients, but in very low levels. On the other hand, the antibody response to HBcAg comes off strong in chronically infected patients but have no direct antiviral effects. It is generally reckoned that anti-HBc antibodies do not neutralize HBV and have little to no effect on viral clearance since they are present in high titers during the HBeAg-positive chronic infection phase, in which the host experiences a high degree of viremia and the immune system "tolerates" the virus. In addition, antiviral treatment and normalization of liver enzymes led to functional reduction in HBcAg-specific B cells and anti-HBc levels. The role of the antibody response to HBcAg in the immunopathogenesis of HBV remains unclear.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^1129B2UR]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

In their best practice advice, ACP and CDC recommend testing persons at increased risk for HBV infection with tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, and anti-HBs. The ACP best practice risk groups align with current testing recommendations except that ACP omits persons with a history of STIs or multiple sex partners (Box 4).

CDC screening guidelines were developed independently from the ACIP recommendations for HepB vaccination. The 2018 ACIP recommendations also include recommendations for serologic testing. CDC's screening and testing guidelines cover all persons recommended for serologic testing per ACIP and expand beyond that list (Box 1). When considering prevaccination testing or testing for HBV infection, CDC recommends testing that follows a universal testing approach (Figure 2).

The work group did not evaluate clinical guidance for patients after screening. The most recent expert guidance to reduce the risk for liver damage is that patients with HBV infection should be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (if not already immune); screened for HIV, HCV, and hepatitis D virus (HDV); and assessed for alcohol risk factors, such as with the alcohol screening and brief intervention. Depending on the likely route of transmission, the patient might benefit from STI screening, drug treatment, or harm-reduction counseling. A full list of recommended steps for examination, education, laboratory, serology, and imaging is provided (Table 2).

Additional screening might be recommended for blood donors, newly arrived refugees, and persons initiating cytotoxic or immunosuppressive and additional testing might be recommended for patients on hemodialysis, health care personnel, perinatally exposed infants, and persons involved in exposure events who might warrant postexposure prophylaxis and postvaccination serologic testing. These recommendations are described elsewhere (,–). Providers should follow the most conservative approach when recommendations differ.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115u6r1w]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection — diagnosis and screening in patients with HIV includes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommend screening patients with HIV infection for chronic HBV, and initial testing should include serologic testing for surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) (AII). In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on 2 occasions at least 6 months apart, and patients with chronic HBV infection should be further tested for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA; active disease, which can be HBeAg-negative or HBeAg-positive, can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations. Patients whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg-negative with positive anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc, although covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) may remain in hepatocyte nuclei, and with severe immune suppression a patient may become serum HBsAg-positive again with HBV viremia. The presence of an isolated anti-HBc test result usually signifies infection with HBV in the past with subsequent loss of anti-HBs and occurs in 7% to 19% of patients with HIV infection, and incidence of HBV viremia in patients with HIV infection and isolated anti-HBc ranges from 1% to 36%.

### Isolated anti-HBc: the relevance of hepatitis B core antibody – A review of new issues [^113wAAku]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is considered the most sensitive serological marker for history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In a subset of anti-HBc carriers, anti-HBc is present in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody-a serological pattern known as "isolated anti-HBc" (IAHBc). IAHBc has been of clinical interest over the past several years, with growing data to suggest its role as a serological marker for occult HBV infection (OBI). This article reviews the clinical significance and association of IAHBc with hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, risk of HBV reactivation during direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV as well as immune suppression, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B core-related antigen is also highlighted as an emerging laboratory assay that may identify OBI and predict HCC development in non-cirrhotic patients receiving nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapy.

### Presence of anti-HBc is associated to high rates of HBV resolved infection and low threshold for occult HBV infection in HIV patients with negative HBsAg in Chile [^112RjzBJ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

HBV-HIV coinfection is prevalent. Frequently, anti-HBc is the only serological marker of HBV, which can be indicative of HBV resolved infection, when found together with anti-HBs reactivity; or present as "isolated anti-HBc", related to HBV occult infection with presence of detectable DNA HBV, more prevalent in HIV-positive individuals. Regional data about this condition are scarce. Anti-HBc rapid test has been used as screening, but its performance has not been described in HIV-positive patients. The aim of this study was determine prevalence of anti-HBc in HIV-positive patients, serological pattern of HBV resolved infection and isolated anti-HBc, evaluating presence of HBV occult infection. Assess anti-HBc rapid test compared to ECLIA. Methods included measurement of anti-HBc and anti-HBs in HIV-positive patients with negative HBsAg. Serum HBV DNA quantification and HBV booster vaccination to "isolated anti-HBc" individuals. Detection of anti-HBc by rapid test and ECLIA. In 192 patients, prevalence of anti-HBc was 42.7% (82/192); associated to male gender, drug use, men-sex-men, positive-VDRL, and longer time HIV diagnosis. 34.4% (66/192) had presence of anti-HBs, mean titers of 637ui/ml. Isolated anti-HBc in 8.3% (16/192), associated to detectable HIV viral load and no-use of HAART; in them, HBV DNA was undetectable, and 60% responded to HBV vaccination booster. Anti-HBc rapid test showed low sensibility (32.9%) compared to ECLIA. These results show that prevalence of anti-HBc in HIV-positive individuals is high, in most cases accompanied with anti-HBs as HBV resolved infection. Low prevalence of "isolated anti-HBc", with undetectable HBV DNA, and most had anamnestic response to HBV vaccination; suggest low possibility of occult HBV infection. Anti-HBc rapid test cannot be recommended as screening method for anti-HBc.

In certain persons, anti-HBc is the only serologic marker detected. Isolated anti-HBc-positivity can be detected following HBV infection in persons who have recovered but whose anti-HBs levels have waned; in populations with a high prevalence of HBV infection, isolated anti-HBc likely indicates previous infection with loss of anti-HBs. Some chronically infected persons with isolated anti-HBc-positivity have circulating HBsAg that is not detectable by a laboratory assay. HBV DNA has been detected in < 10% of persons with isolated anti-HBc, although the presence of detectable HBV DNA might fluctuate. These persons are unlikely to transmit infection except under circumstances in which they are the source of a large exposure, such as a blood transfusion. Persons who are HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive can experience reactivation of infection during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, with reappearance of HBsAg. Infection with a mutant HBV strain can result in positive laboratory tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA, with a negative IgM anti-HBc.

Perinatal HBV infection in a child aged ≤ 24 months is typically asymptomatic although fulminant hepatitis can occur; a positive HBsAg test, positive HBeAg test, or detectable HBV DNA may be considered laboratory evidence of perinatal HBV in an infant born to an HBV-infected mother if timing criteria are met. Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who do not become infected might have detectable anti-HBc for up to 24 months after birth from passively acquired maternal antibody.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers

Serologic markers for HBV infection include HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) anti-HBc (IgG anti-HBc). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of infection. HBV DNA is a measure of viral load and reflects viral replication (Table 1). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be detected in persons with acute or chronic HBV infection; the presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) correlates with the loss of replicating virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity can occur.

### Occult hepatitis B virus infection: risk for a blood supply, but how about individuals' health? [^117UXoh4]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The practical and ethical implications of informing individuals that they have a potentially increased risk of cancer but with no actionable recommendations is a challenging conversation where clinicians and patients may have differing views on the matter. Whilst transparency is important for individuals' autonomy, the ethical implications may be affected by differing healthcare systems. Individuals in low-to-middle-income countries lacking universal healthcare could be psychosocially affected by the information provided but are restricted by access and affordability to follow-up care, which may include costly diagnostic tests and monitoring strategies. Being asymptomatic, individuals may not perceive the need for follow-up care. Additionally, high-endemic countries may prioritise limited resources on public health interventions rather than individual risk communication and follow-up. In certain societies, the disclosure of an increased risk of cancer due to HBV may also be heavily stigmatising and worsen the psychosocial impact on the individual.

Further, the use of sensitive HBV DNA assays in blood donor screening to identify HBV-infected donors with very low viral loads highlights the existence of a potentially neglected reservoir of HBV infection in the general population, particularly when anti-HBc positive individuals may harbour replication-competent HBV DNA in their livers despite the absence of circulating HBV DNA. Additionally, patients achieving a 'functional cure' following currently available antiviral treatment (defined as sustained undetectability of HBsAg (< 0.05 IU/mL) and an undetectable or extremely low level of HBV DNA (< 10 IU/mL)) may still have very low viral loads and potentially contribute to the growing pool of OBI carriers; limited evidence also suggests that many patients who achieve 'functional cure' also have low and persisting levels of replication-competent DNA in their livers. This combined pool of OBI carriers and the ambiguity of 'functional cure' may affect the World Health Organization (WHO)'s goals to eliminate hepatitis B by 2030. Future therapies targeting the intrahepatic HBV DNA would be extremely beneficial in achieving a full HBV cure.

Serology-based counseling prior to anticancer therapy — patient messages should reflect specific HBV test patterns: Patients who have isolated anti-HBc may need further work-up because the HBV management for these patients depends on the type of anticancer therapy administered, and these patients are not at risk for transmission through sexual or close personal contact. Patients with a detectable anti-HBs but who are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc can be counseled that they have protective levels of antibody from previous vaccination. Patients who are positive for anti-HBc and anti-HBs have resolved hepatitis B infection and should be counseled that they are at risk, albeit lower than if they had a negative anti-HBs, of HBV reactivation. Patients who are negative for all HBV screening tests (negative HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs) are considered not to be immune to HBV, have never been exposed to HBV, and may benefit from HBV vaccination, taking into consideration a patient's clinical situation and timing of anticancer therapy.

Persons with HCV Infection or a Past HCV Infection

The systematic review found 8,295 articles for review; after title review, 1,233 potentially relevant articles remained. After review of articles meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles were included (Supplementary Table 12). In 10 U.S. studies, the prevalence of current HBV infection (on the basis of HBsAg positivity, HBV DNA positivity, or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes) among persons with HCV infection ranged from 0.2% to 5.8% (median = 1.2%). Among persons with HCV infection, the prevalence of ever being exposed to HBV ranged from 24.7% to 62.6% (median = 43.0%); this finding was based on anti-HBc positivity, regardless of other HBV test results. Isolated anti-HBc positivity ranged from 36.9% to 53.8% (median = 39.5%) among patients with HCV infection.

HBV Reactivation During Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy for HCV

FDA requires a boxed warning about the risk for HBV reactivation to be added to drug labels of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medication for HCV infection. The boxed warning directs health care professionals to screen and monitor for HBV infection in all patients receiving DAA treatment.

In a published systematic review of HBV reactivation during DAA therapy among patients with HCV infection, the overall risk for HBV reactivation was 24% (95% CI = 19%–30%) in patients with untreated chronic HBV infection and 1.4% (95% CI = 0.8%–2.4%) in patients with resolved HBV infection. The risk for HBV reactivation–related hepatitis (i.e. symptomatic) was 9% (95% CI = 5%–16%) in patients with chronic HBV infection; HBV reactivation–related hepatitis did not occur in patients with resolved infection. Three of 1,621 patients with chronic HBV infection had a major clinical event related to the reactivation (liver decompensation or failure), but there were no deaths.

Four studies were published after the 2018 systematic review. In two national cohort studies of U.S. veterans with chronic HCV infection prescribed DAA therapy, HBV reactivation was rare (< 0.1%) and more frequent among patients who were HBsAg positive. Similarly, two other U.S.-based cohort studies of patients with HCV coinfected with HBV did not detect any cases of DAA-associated HBV reactivation.

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

### Anti-HBc-nonreactive occult hepatitis B infections with HBV genotypes B and C in vaccinated immunocompetent adults [^114yKvCC]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Follow‐up showed that seven of 15 (47%) vaccinated individuals remained HBV DNA low but detectable two to 65 months post index sample, while 8/15 (53%) became HBV DNA negative (Figure 2). All five unvaccinated individuals follow up had undetectable DNA 8 months post index sample at the latest. Overall, nine of 10 individuals with follow‐up samples keeping stable anti‐HBs levels remained HBV DNA positive two to 65 months post index sample while 6/7 donors with anti‐HBs response became HBV DNA negative, suggesting efficacy of the boosted anti‐HBs response. The transient viraemia observed in 65% (13/20) of isolated anti‐HBs OBI carriers suggests 'aborted' infection that is reminiscent of acute HBV infection previously reported in six vaccinated blood donors who carried isolated anti‐HBs OBI; four of them infected by high viral load HBV sexual partners. Differing from the cases described here, three of four cases with detailed follow‐up developed delayed low‐level anti‐HBc 1–4.5 months post index, while one who was infected with HBV genotype B showed no anti‐HBc reactivity over 9 months follow‐up. In addition, none of these individuals showed persistent viraemia after 135 days of follow‐up. These differences between the two studies may be due to the infected individuals in the Stramer study having been vaccinated as adults and had been exposed to different HBV genotypes and high viral loads. HBV infection in vaccinated individuals could induce faster innate and adaptive immune responses that may limit and possibly suppress viral replication in the presence of pre‐existing low level of anti‐HBs. A rapid suppression of low viraemia may limit the production of HBcAg and prevent the development of a specific immune response. It is possible that the paucity and often long delays of follow‐up sample collection in the present study missed low‐level anti‐HBc and transient viraemia. Hepadnaviral persistence in the absence of detectable serum surface antigen and antibodies to Core has been described in animals inoculated with low dose of woodchuck hepatitis virus and offspring of woodchuck dam convalescent from acute infection. Similarly, exposure of vaccinated subjects to a small amount of virus in the presence of non‐sterilizing anti‐HBs might result in isolated anti‐HBs OBI. The persistence of the isolated anti‐HBs OBI profile observed in 11 unvaccinated donors in the present study and in 9 Southeast Asian donors in a previous study remains puzzling. It is possible that some of these donors, particularly the two younger than 30, might have been vaccinated without recollection or evidence provided. Further studies are needed to determine whether this inability to produce anti‐HBc might be related to a selective defect in the host immune system. Overall, the prevalence of isolated anti‐HBs OBI carriage may be underestimated in vaccinated populations, especially in areas of high HBV endemicity, and these individuals may be at risk for HBV reactivation if immunosuppressed. In addition, HBsAg‐negative/anti‐HBc‐negative blood donors with barely detectable HBV DNA may participate to the residual risk of HBV transfusion‐transmission, although this risk is likely mitigated by the presence of anti‐HBs.

HBV Screening and Testing Recommendations

In these guidelines, "screening" refers to conducting serologic testing of asymptomatic persons not known to be at increased risk for exposure to HBV. "Testing" refers to conducting serologic testing of persons with symptoms or who are identified to be at increased risk for exposure to HBV. The following evidence-based recommendations for HBV screening update and expand those issued by CDC in 2008.

Screening is recommended for the following persons (Box 1):

All adults aged ≥ 18 years at least once during a lifetime (new recommendation).
All pregnant persons * during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing (see Clinical Considerations).

Testing is recommended for the following persons (Box 1):

Everyone with a history of risk for HBV infection, regardless of age, if they might have been susceptible during the period of risk (Box 4) (Figure 2). Susceptible persons include those who have never been infected with HBV (i.e. total anti-HBc negative) and either did not complete a HepB vaccine series per ACIP recommendations or who are known vaccine nonresponders. BOX 4 Persons and activities, exposures, or conditions associated with an increased risk for hepatitis B virus infection — CDC testing recommendations, 2013 Infants born to pregnant persons who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive Persons born in regions with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalence of ≥ 2% U.S.-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in regions with HBV infection prevalence of ≥ 8% Injection drug use Incarceration in a jail, prison, or other detention setting (new recommendation) HIV infection Hepatitis C virus infection (new recommendation) Men who have sex with men Sexually transmitted infections or multiple sex partners (new recommendation) Household contacts of persons with known HBV infection Needle-sharing or sexual contacts of persons with known HBV infection Maintenance dialysis, including in-center or home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis Elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels of unknown origin Persons who request HBV testing (new recommendation)

### ARCHITECT HBsAg next assay is positioned better to resolve and refine challenging weak reactive clinical samples [^113AsU6F]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasensitive HBsAg assays are replacing the previous versions. Unlike the sensitivity, the specificity, and its positioning to resolve weak-reactives (WR) are not studied. We investigated the ability of ARCHITECT HBsAg-Next (HBsAg-Nx) assay to resolve WR and sought its clinical validation and correlation with confirmatory/reflex testing.

Methods

Among 99,761 samples between Jan 2022–2023, 248 reactive samples in HBsAg-Qual-II were compared with HBsAg-Nx assay. Sufficient samples were further subjected to neutralization (n = 108) and reflex (anti-HBc total/anti-HBs antibody) testing.

Results

Out of 248 initial reactive samples in HBsAg-Qual-II, 180 (72.58%) were repeat reactive, and 68 (27.42%) were negative, whereas in HBsAg-Nx, 89 (35.89%) were reactive and 159 (64.11%) were negative (p < 0.0001). Comparing the results of two assays (Qual-II/Next), 57.67% (n = 143) were concordant (+ ±) and 105 (42.33%) were discordant (p = 0.0025). Testing of HBsAg-Qual-II + & HBsAg-Nx - samples revealed that 85.71% (n = 90) were anti-HBc total negative and 98.08% (n = 51) were not neutralized as well as significant proportion (89%) had no clinical correlation. The proportion of samples neutralized was significantly different between ≤ 5 S/Co (26.59%) and > 5 S/Co (71.42%) (p = 0.0002). All samples (n = 26) with enhanced reactivity in HBsAg-Nx were effectively neutralized, while samples with no increase in reactivity, 89% (n = 72) failed neutralization (p = < 0.001).

Conclusions

HBsAg-Nx assay is positioned better to resolve and refine challenging WR samples than Qual-II which correlated well with confirmatory/reflex tests and clinical disease. This superior internal benchmarking significantly reduced the cost and quantum of retesting, confirmatory/reflex testing in the diagnosis of HBV infection.

### Hepatitis B virus markers in anti-HBc only positive individuals [^114jwoT8]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Isolated reactivity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen (anti-HBc) is observed relatively frequently in immunocompromised individuals, intravenous drug abusers (IVDA), and in the presence of HCV infection. The reason for the lack of HBsAg is not clear. The aim of the present study was to investigate which factors (genetic variability of S gene, low-level HBsAg, and immune complexes may be responsible for the failure of HBsAg detection with commercial HBsAg screening assays. Dilution series of two recombinant HBsAg escape mutants and dilutions of serum samples from chronic HBV carriers with multiple insertions in the a determinant and different HBsAg subtypes were tested with a highly sensitive assay that detects wild-type HBsAg (Elecsys HBsAg, Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) and two assays that detect HBV wild-type and escape mutants (Murex HBsAg Version 3, Murex and Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). Elecsys HBsAg showed in comparison to Murex HBsAg Version 3 and Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0 a reduced sensitivity for escape mutant detection. On the other hand, the best performance for HBsAg subtype detection was obtained with Elecsys HBsAg. In the second part of the study, a selected panel of isolated anti-HBc reactive (n = 104) serum samples (AxSYM Core) was submitted to testing by Elecsys HBsAg, Murex HBsAg Version 3, Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0, and HBsAg detection after immune complex dissociation (ICD) and anti-HBs determination with two different assays (AxSYM Ausab and Elecsys Anti-HBs). To assess the specificity of anti-HBc test results, all the samples were tested by a second anti-HBc assay (Elecsys Anti-HBc). Quantitative HBV DNA detection was undertaken with a commercially available HBV PCR assay (Amplicor HBV Monitor). HCV infection was present in 65.4% of anti-HBc only reactive individuals. Five AxSYM Core positive samples were negative by Elecsys Anti-HBc. Overall, 15 (14.4%) AxSYM Ausab negative samples gave positive results with Elecsys Anti-HBs (median value: 21 IU/ml). No low-level HBsAg carrier was detected among the isolated anti-HBc reactive individuals with Elecsys HBsAg. There was no evidence for the presence of immune complexes. Only one sample was repeatedly reactive by the Murex HBsAg, suggesting that the a mutant form of HBsAg was responsible for the isolated anti-HBc reactivity, however neutralisation assay was not interpretable and HBV DNA PCR was negative. Fifteen (14.4%) anti-HBc only positive individuals were HBV DNA carriers with concentrations ranging from 800 to more than > 4,000,000 copies of viral DNA/ml. In conclusion, the most probable explanations for isolated anti-HBc reactivity in our study group are a possible interference of HBsAg synthesis by HCV infection (65.4%) and divergence of results of anti-HBs assays (14.4%). There is no evidence for the presence of low-level HBsAg carriers and immune complexes. HBsAg mutants cannot be excluded definitively by the test strategy used in the present evaluation.

Children and adolescents with HIV — post-HepB vaccination serologic testing and initial screening states that due to the high prevalence of HBV infection, all infants, children, and adolescents with HIV should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis (strong, high). If there is no documentation of routine infant/child vaccination for hepatitis B, initial screening with the triple panel consisting of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) will determine infection and immune status and guide clinical management. Anti-HBs titers should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the vaccination series (strong, moderate), and individuals with the isolated anti-HBc serologic profile should also be vaccinated for hepatitis B.

Upon clearance of the HBV infection by the immune response, the HBsAg disappears from the blood of individuals. while detectable anti-HBc and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen usually persist indefinitely. However, there is evidence that anti-HBc can decrease and even disappear over a period of decades in resolved infections. Nonetheless, in chronically infected individuals, tests for HBsAg and anti-HBc usually remain positive. determining whether a donor, who has been deferred because of anti-HBc reactivity, is truly infected by HBV.

Prevaccination Serologic Testing

Conducting prevaccination serologic testing for susceptibility just before the initial vaccine dose is administered can be considered for identifying persons with chronic HBV infection and, potentially, reducing the cost of completing the vaccination series for adult populations that have an expected high prevalence (20%–30%) of HBV infection (e.g. injecting drug users and MSM, especially those among older age groups, or persons born where HBV endemicity is moderate to high). In addition, prevaccination testing for susceptibility is recommended for unvaccinated household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts of HBsAg-positive persons. Serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination. The first vaccine dose should be administered immediately after collection of the blood sample for serologic testing. Vaccination of persons who are immune to HBV infection because of current or previous infection or vaccination is not harmful and does not increase the risk for adverse events.

Prevaccination testing should be performed with HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc to define patients' HBV clinical status and deliver recommended care. Persons who test HBsAg positive should receive prevention counseling and evaluation for antiviral treatment (see Management of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive). Persons who test total anti-HBc positive and anti-HBs positive should be counseled that they have had previous HBV infection and are immune. Those persons with isolated anti-HBc (i.e. negative HBsAg and anti-HBs) need further assessment to rule out occult HBV infection, and they are at higher risk for reactivation if exposed to immunosuppressants. Persons who test negative to all three HBV seromarkers should receive the complete vaccination series, with the first vaccine dose administered immediately.

### Anti-HBc-nonreactive occult hepatitis B infections with HBV genotypes B and C in vaccinated immunocompetent adults [^111TfxSS]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Absence of anti-HBc reactivity with detectable anti-HBs was observed in blood donors with occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI). The prevalence and mechanisms underlying this uncommon condition were investigated over time in Chinese blood donors with OBI. Isolated anti-HBs OBI status was identified from 466,911 donors from Dalian, China, and monitored in follow-up (range: 2.6–84.3 months). HBV vaccination status was documented, and infecting viral strains were characterized. Of 451 confirmed OBIs (1:1035), 43 (9.5%; 1:10,858) had isolated anti-HBs as only serological marker. Isolated anti-HBs OBIs differed from anti-HBc-reactive OBIs by significantly younger age (median 24years), higher HBV DNA (median: 20IU/ml) and anti-HBs (median 60.5 IU/L) levels, paucity of mutations in HBV Core and S proteins, and high vaccination rate (72%). Vaccinated isolated anti-HBs OBIs (n = 31) differed from unvaccinated (n = 11) by significantly younger age (22 vs 38years), higher anti-HBs level at index (48% vs 9% with anti-HBs > 100IU/L) and higher frequency of anti-HBs immune response (44% vs 20%). Of 15 vaccinated and 5 unvaccinated OBIs follow-up, 65% (8 vaccinated and 5 unvaccinated) became HBV DNA negative suggesting aborted recent infection, while 35% (7 vaccinated) had low persistent viraemia 2 to 65months post index. In conclusion, isolated anti-HBs OBI in Chinese blood donors appears associated with young, vaccinated, adults exposed to HBV who predominantly develop low level aborted infection revealed by transient HBV DNA and immune anti-HBs response. However, a subset of individuals still experienced low but persistent viral replication whose clinical outcome remains uncertain.

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Vd13E]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Despite an increasing number of occult HBV infection studies, the worldwide prevalence patterns of occult HBV infection remain unknown and its clinical relevance has been controversial. However, emerging evidence is shifting scientific opinion. There is increasing evidence that occult HBV infection is associated with advanced chronic liver disease, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, and that people with occult HBV infection can transmit HBV infection. In addition, an estimated 8–29% of recipients from blood donors with occult HBV infection are infected with HBV. These findings suggest that the role of occult HBV infection on global elimination targets might be highly underestimated, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where HBV DNA measurement remains largely inaccessible, leading to undiagnosed occult HBV infection cases.

By contrast, antibody to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), a marker of current or past HBV infection, is easier to detect using immunoassays and more accessible at a low cost in LMICs. Anti-HBc is often used as a surrogate marker to detect seropositive occult HBV infection (ie, occult HBV infection cases positive for anti-HBc), especially in blood banks in LMICs. However, the overall performance of anti-HBc to identify occult HBV infection cases has not been well investigated, and it is uncertain whether anti-HBc is a reliable alternative to HBV NAT to identify occult HBV infection.

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to evaluate: (1) the global and regional prevalence of occult HBV infection on the basis of studies of the general population; (2) the occult HBV infection prevalence in subgroups defined by the type of study participants and by the HBV endemicity in each country; (3) whether the estimates vary with methodological differences, including the analytical sensitivity of HBsAg or HBV DNA assays used; and (4) the sensitivity and specificity of anti-HBc to detect occult HBV infection.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination — titer testing and isolated anti-HBc management: Anti-HBs should be obtained 4 weeks after completion of the vaccine series to document response to HepB vaccination, defined as anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL (AIII). Vaccinate individuals with isolated anti-HBc with one standard dose of HepB (BIII) and check anti-HBs titers 1–2 months afterward. If anti-HBs ≥ 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if the titer is < 100 mIU/mL, then vaccinate with a complete series of HepB (double dose) followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). If titers are not available, then give a complete vaccine series followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). If a significant delay occurs between doses, there is no need to restart the series.

Viral hepatitis and hepatitis A virus screening in HIV — Persons with HIV should be screened for evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection upon initiation of care by detection of HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), and antibody to hepatitis B total core antigen (anti-HBc or HBcAb), and if HBsAg is positive, HBV viral load should be ordered; persons with HIV should be screened for evidence of immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) with HAV immunoglobulin (IgG). Persons with HIV should be screened for HCV antibody upon initiation of care and, if positive, HCV RNA should be ordered to assess for active HCV infection; curative therapy should be offered to all who are diagnosed with active HCV. HCV RNA testing is indicated ≥ 12 weeks post- completion of anti-HCV treatment, HCV RNA should be used for screening if HCV infection within the last 6 months is suspected or there is a history of prior HCV infection that has cleared, and HCV RNA testing should be considered in persons with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count < 200 cells/µL). Infants born to persons with HBV and/or HCV should be tested for HBV and HCV transmission, and persons who are not immune to HAV and HBV should be immunized according to current national guidelines.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113jMngm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in people with HIV — definition, activity criteria, HDV testing, and isolated anti-HBc — should be approached as follows: Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on two occasions at least 6 months apart, and people with chronic HBV infection should be tested further for HBV e antigen (HBeAg), antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe), and HBV DNA; "Active" disease can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of both serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations, defined as ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (≥ 70 U/L for males and ≥ 50 U/L for females). Because people with chronic HBV infection are at risk for coinfection with HDV, anti-HDV should be checked once chronic HBV infection is diagnosed, and if positive, then HDV RNA should be obtained to look for chronic infection. In low-prevalence settings, isolated anti-HBc may represent a false-positive, but its presence can signify past HBV infection with subsequent loss of anti-HBs; isolated anti-HBc occurs in 7% to 19% of people with HIV, and among people with HIV and isolated anti-HBc the frequency of HBV viremia typically ranges from 1% to 10%, so routinely checking HBV DNA is not recommended. People with HIV — particularly with hepatitis C virus coinfection — have a higher frequency of isolated anti-HBc, and people whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg negative with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc.

### Anti-HCV reactive blood donors: clinical and epidemiological factors associated with false-reactive results [^116HMEe2]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In certain clinical settings, false-reactive anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) results are rare because the majority of persons being tested have evidence of liver disease and the specificity of the screening assays is high. However, among healthy populations, such as blood donors, mainly in regions with a low prevalence of HCV infection, this situation does occur. In this study, we sought to assess clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory characteristics of blood donors with false-reactive anti-HCV screening tests.

Methods

This retrospective cross-sectional study included 537 anti-HCV reactive blood donors referred to a tertiary care centre for liver diseases.

Results

The mean age was 36.5 ± 11.2 years and 71.8% were men. Blood donors of older age (P = 0.010), history of alcohol abuse (P = 0.039), past transfusion (P < 0.001), intravenous drug use (P < 0.001), and with antibody against core antigen of hepatitis B virus reactivity (P = 0.003) were less likely to have a false-reactive anti-HCV result. By multivariate analysis, only the absence of parenteral risk factors (prior transfusion and intravenous drug use) was independently associated with false-reactive anti-HCV tests.

Conclusion

Blood donors with reactive anti-HCV screening tests with no risk factors for parenterally acquired HCV infection are more likely to present with false-reactive results.

### Hepatitis B core-related antigen to indicate high viral load: systematic review and meta-analysis of 10, 397 individual participants [^111qcRvb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, scale-up of testing and treatment in resource-limited countries is crucial. However, access to nucleic acid testing to quantify HBV DNA, an essential test to examine treatment eligibility, remains severely limited. We assessed the performance of a novel immunoassay, HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), as a low-cost (less than US $15/assay) alternative to nucleic acid testing to indicate clinically important high viremia in chronic HBV patients infected with different genotypes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through June 27, 2018. Three reviewers independently selected studies measuring HBV DNA and HBcrAg in the same blood samples. We contacted authors to provide individual participant data (IPD). We randomly allocated each IPD to a derivation or validation cohort. We applied optimal HBcrAg cut-off values derived from the derivation set to the validation set to estimate sensitivity/specificity.

Results

Of 74 eligible studies, IPD were obtained successfully for 60 studies (81%). Meta-analysis included 5591 IPD without antiviral therapy and 4806 treated with antivirals. In untreated patients, the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and optimal cut-off values were as follows: 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94) and 3.6 log U/mL to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater; and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98) and 5.3 log U/mL for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. In the validation set, the sensitivity and specificity were 85.2% and 84.7% to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater, and 91.8% and 90.5% for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. The performance did not vary by HBV genotypes. In patients treated with anti-HBV therapy the correlation between HBcrAg and HBV DNA was poor.

Conclusions

HBcrAg might be a useful serologic marker to indicate clinically important high viremia in treatment-naïve, HBV-infected patients.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^115jRuda]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

CDC will review these recommendations as new treatments, tests, epidemiology, HepB vaccination rates, and experience gained from implementation of these recommendations become available; recommendations will be revised as needed. The work group did not conduct a systematic review to reassess any of the groups at increased risk for HBV infection from the 2008 guidelines; future recommendations might modify the groups recommended for periodic testing. Additional data on the ideal frequency of periodic testing is needed. Continued collaboration with laboratories to bundle the three HBV tests (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc) would facilitate ordering the tests together as a triple panel. In addition, reporting a triple panel summary result will aid providers in correctly interpreting results. Finally, a better understanding of the prevalence of HDV in the United States is needed to inform recommendations for HDV screening among persons with HBV infection.

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Yequt]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Despite growing concerns about transmissibility and clinical impact, occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has received little attention in the hepatitis elimination agenda. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of occult HBV infection at a global and regional scale and in specific populations.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science databases for articles published in any language between Jan 1, 2010, and Aug 14, 2019. We included original articles and conference abstracts of any study design that reported the proportion of HBsAg-negative adults (aged ≥ 18 years) who are positive for HBV DNA (ie, people with occult HBV infection). The prevalence of occult HBV infection was pooled, using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model, in the general population and specific groups defined by the type of study participants (blood donors; other low-risk populations; high-risk populations; and people with advanced chronic liver disease), and stratified by HBV endemicity in each country. We also assessed the performance of anti-HBc as an alternative biomarker to detect occult HBV infection. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019115490.

Findings

305 of 3962 articles were eligible, allowing a meta-analysis of 140521993 individuals tested for HBV DNA. Overall, only two studies evaluated occult HBV infection in the general population, precluding unbiased global and regional estimates of occult HBV infection prevalence. In blood donors, occult HBV infection prevalence mirrored HBV endemicity: 0.06% (95% CI 0.00–0.26) in low-endemicity countries, 0.12% (0.04–0.23) in intermediate-endemicity countries, and 0.98% (0.44–1.72), in high-endemicity countries (p = 0.0012). In high-risk groups, occult HBV infection prevalence was substantial, irrespective of endemicity: 5.5% (95% CI 2.9–8.7) in low-endemicity countries, 5.2% (2.5–8.6) in intermediate-endemicity countries, and 12.0% (3.4–24.7) in high-endemicity countries. The pooled sensitivity of anti-HBc to identify occult HBV infection was 77% (95% CI 62–88) and its specificity was 76% (68–83).

Interpretation

A substantial proportion of people carry occult HBV infection, especially among high-risk groups across the globe and people living in highly endemic countries. Occult HBV infection should be part of the global viral hepatitis elimination strategy.

### The prevalence of "anti-HBc alone" and HBV DNA detection among anti-HBc alone in Korea [^114r9MTw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

The "anti-HBc alone" is a frequent serological finding in clinical laboratories, making it difficult to determine whether the HBV infection has resolved. The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of anti-HBc alone and HBV DNA detection (occult HBV infection) among anti-HBc alone, and to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of anti-HBc alone. A total of 17,677 sera referred from the Health Promotion Center (HPC group, 4,014 sera) as well as all the hospital clinical departments (Patient group, 13,663 sera) were tested for HBs Ag, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs. HBV DNA test using real-time PCR was performed on 230 anti-HBc alone. The prevalence of anti-HBc alone was 8.9%, significantly higher in the Patient group than in the HPC group. The prevalence of anti-HBc was higher in men than women and was increased with age. Very low levels of HBV DNA were found in only 4 (1.7%) out of 230 subjects with anti-HBc alone. They were patients with conditions unrelated to chronic liver disease. Considering the high prevalence of anti-HBc alone, the frequency of occult HBV infection among anti-HBc alone was unexpectedly low. In addition, HBV viral load was low in these patients. Further studies are required to determine the clinical significance and infectivity of anti-HBc alone, in conjunction with very low levels of HBV DNA and to standardize the detection methodology for both anti-HBc alone and HBV DNA.

### Significance of anti-HBc alone serological status in clinical practice [^1151o2e3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Serum samples identified as positive for total anti-HBc, but negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, are referred to as anti-HBc alone. This serological response is compatible with acute, resolved, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection but might also signify occult HBV infection. Once the anti-HBc alone pattern is detected, false-positive reactivity should be ruled out and further analyses can resolve the clinical status of the donor. The identification of anti-HBc positivity in the absence of HBsAg in organ transplant donors and in candidate patients for chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation because of the risk of HBV reactivation. False-positive detection, acute infection during the window phase, and resolved or chronic HBV infection are all possible and only distinguishable if the additional assays are done and measures of liver damage are taken into account. Measurement of serum anti-HBs responses after the administration of HBV vaccination can be useful to distinguish this serological profile. In view of the low risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc alone patients who are candidates for immunosuppressive treatment, such patients might not require pre-emptive antiviral therapy, but should be followed up on a monthly basis for alanine aminotransferase followed by quantitative HBV DNA testing in those with alanine aminotransferase increase. According to specific guidelines, nucleoside analogue prophylaxis is recommended in anti-HBc-positive liver allograft recipients and anti-HBc alone individuals who receive chemotherapy or biological therapy and should be continued for 6–12 months after discontinuation of such immunosuppressive therapies to protect against HBV reactivation.

Serologic markers for HBV — HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-HBc immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) — are interpreted as follows: Self-limited infections are usually eliminated in 1 to 2 months, whereas chronic infections are persistently positive beyond 6 months with no detectable anti-HBs in individuals who have never been vaccinated; anti-HBc IgM appears 1 to 2 weeks after HBsAg; anti-HBc IgG persists for life and passively transferred maternal anti-HBc IgG is detectable in infants up to 24 months after birth; anti-HBs develops during convalescence in self-limited infections, indicates immunity from HBV infection, and after post–recovery from natural infection both anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG are present, whereas after postvaccination without prior infection detectable anti-HBs but no anti-HBc or HBsAg are present, and inadvertent vaccination after recovery from HBV infection yields detectable anti-HBs and anti-HBc upon postvaccination testing.

### Immune suppression as the etiology of failure to detect anti-HBc antibodies in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^111fdU8f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

A lack of anti-HBc antibodies during chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a serological pattern that is rarely observed. In our series of 39 patients with such a confirmed profile, mutations within the precore/core gene were rarely found and the lack of antibody detection was mostly explained by concurrent immunosuppression and the low sensitivities of the serological assays.

### Low rate of occult hepatitis B virus infection among anti-HBc positive blood donors living in a low prevalence region in Brazil [^116vniVt]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the rate of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among blood donors living in a geographic region of low (5.6%) anti-HBc prevalence.

Subjects and Methods

Sera from 150 candidate blood donors whose blood was rejected due to total anti-HBc reactivity (despite absence of HBsAg) were tested for anti-HBs and IgM anti-HBc antibodies, as well as for HBeAg/anti-HBe. Serum HBV DNA was sought by using a PCR assay able to amplify part of the surface gene. Viral load was measured in the PCR positive samples.

Results

The pattern 'anti-HBc alone' (without HBsAg and anti-HBs antibodies) was found in 64 (42.7%) subjects. IgM anti-HBc and anti-HBe antibodies were detected in 2 (1.3%) and 80 (53.3%) samples, respectively. No sample was HBeAg-reactive. HBV DNA was repeatedly found in five (3.3%) samples, three of which were anti-HBs positive and two anti-HBs negative. All five HBV DNA positive samples showed a low viral load (< 1000copies/ml).

Conclusions

The data indicated a low rate of occult infection among anti-HBc positive, HBsAg negative blood donors living in a region of low prevalence of infection. Viral load was very low in all HBV infected subjects.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

Blood donation screening for HBV in the UK

Anti-HBc was introduced into the blood donation screening programme in the UK in 2022 to defer anti-HBc positive donors and eliminate the risk of transfusion-transmitted HBV infection associated with donors with OBI. OBI donors have undetectable levels of HBsAg in their blood but are anti-HBc positive; active infection is revealed through often transient, low-level detection of HBV DNA in their plasma. The minimum infectious dose of OBI donor plasma by transfusion has been shown to be 3 IU. Seven cases of HBV transmission from six donors with OBI were described in the UK between 2012 and 2022, some with severe medical consequences. Further modelling predicted that at least 13 potentially infectious donations from donors with OBI would be missed by the relatively insensitive pooled nucleic acid testing (NAT) currently used by UK blood services. This exceeded the risk of non-detection due to acute HBV infection by eight-fold. These predictions were borne out during the first year of partial anti-HBc screening, where from the 3359 anti-HBc positive blood donors identified, eight donors had low levels of HBV DNA detected in their plasma by individual NAT. An international study found that HBV DNA detectability was 0.7% in over 10 million anti-HBc positive blood donors from low-endemic countries. It is noted that whilst health economic evaluations found that anti-HBc screening was more economical than individual NAT screening for the UK, anti-HBc screening would be unfeasible in high-endemic countries due to the large number of individuals exposed to HBV infection.

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11773vfj]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science databases for articles evaluating occult HBV infection prevalence published between Jan 1, 2010, and Aug 14, 2019, using the following search terms: "hepatitis B" AND "occult" AND "prevalence" (see the appendix [pp 2–3] for the full search strategy). We chose this search period due to the introduction of more sensitive assays for HBsAg and HBV DNA. Following duplicate removal, DL and KY screened each entry to identify articles meeting inclusion criteria.

We included original articles and conference abstracts of any study design from which we could calculate the occult HBV infection prevalence, without any language restriction. We defined occult HBV infection prevalence as the proportion of HBsAg-negative adults (age ≥ 18 years) who had a positive result at any level for HBV DNA by NAT on blood samples or liver tissue, regardless of anti-HBc status. A viral load threshold of less than 200 IU/mLwas not considered to define occult HBV infection, as most studies did not apply this cutoff. When acute window period infections (defined by detectable HBV DNA but undetectable HBsAg, which becomes detectable in later samples of the individual) were confirmed with subsequent samples from the same individual showing positivity for HBsAg, we excluded the individual or cohort. We included studies that systematically tested HBV DNA in people identified to be negative for HBsAg, irrespective of whether they had anti-HBc or antibodies against the HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs), and studies that tested HBV DNA in HBsAg-negative participants who were selected on the basis of anti-HBc or anti-HBs serostatus, or both. We excluded studies that only tested HBV DNA in less than 80% of HBsAg-negative individuals eligible for the occult HBV infection assessment without a clear explanation. We also excluded studies that included children or adolescents (aged < 18 years) or individuals receiving nucleoside or nucleotide analogues or interferon therapy. For any such studies, we included them only if the authors provided individual data. If occult HBV infection prevalence was reported in more than one cohort, either due to different assays used on the same study populations or when the study included distinct population types (eg, HIV-positive and HIV-negative people), separate data were extracted for distinct cohorts (referred to as separate studies hereafter). By applying these eligibility criteria, we included different types of studies that answer different questions: (1) studies evaluating HBV DNA in HBsAg-negative people to estimate the occult HBV infection prevalence, and (2) studies evaluating both HBV DNA and anti-HBc in HBsAg-negative people to compute the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of anti-HBc to indicate occult HBV infection.

† Susceptible persons include those who have never been infected with HBV (i.e. total anti-HBc negative) and either did not complete a HepB vaccine series per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations or who are known to be vaccine nonresponders.

Interpretation of Screening Tests

The three main serologic markers used to determine HBV infection status are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) (Table 1). Serologic markers change over typical courses of resolved acute infection and progression to chronic infection (Figure 1).

Providers should follow these recommendations when offering screening and testing:

During the initial screening, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc (new recommendation). Screening with the three tests (triple panel) can help identify persons who have an active HBV infection and could be linked to care, have resolved infection and might be susceptible to reactivation (e.g. immunosuppressed persons), are susceptible and need vaccination, or are vaccinated (Table 1). Anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL is a known correlate of protection only when testing follows a complete HepB vaccine series.
After the collection of blood for serologic testing, persons who have not completed a vaccine series should be offered vaccination per ACIP recommendations at the same visit or at an associated provider visit. Blood collection before vaccination is recommended because transient HBsAg positivity has been reported for up to 18 days after vaccination. Providers do not need to wait for the serologic testing results to administer the first or next dose of vaccine. Although screening can identify persons who are unvaccinated and susceptible to HBV infection, screening should not be a barrier to HepB vaccination, especially in populations that have decreased engagement with or access to health care. In settings where testing is not feasible or is refused by the patient, vaccination of persons should continue according to ACIP recommendations. Serologic testing should continue to be offered at future visits.

Additional screening might be recommended for certain populations, including blood donors, newly arrived refugees, and persons initiating cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy, and additional testing might be recommended for patients on hemodialysis, health care personnel, perinatally exposed infants, and persons involved in exposure events that might warrant postexposure prophylaxis and postvaccination serologic testing. Recommendations for these groups are described elsewhere (, –). The new recommendation described in this report to include a total anti-HBc test during universal adult screening will support identification of persons with past HBV infection who should be aware of their risk for reactivation in the context of immunosuppression.

Management of hepatitis B virus reactivation

Screening

Ideal management and prevention of HBV reactivation includes both stringent identification of at risk patients prior to initiation of any immunosuppressive therapy, and appropriate consideration of prophylactic antiviral treat ment. As the majority of people with chronic or past HBV are not aware of their infection, it has been strongly recommended by several international societies and guidelines that all patients should be screened for HBV prior to commencing any immunosuppressive therapy. Given the significant risk of reactivation associated with resolved HBV infection and certain regimens, this should include testing for both HBsAg and anti-HBc antibody. Testing for anti-HBs antibodies may also be beneficial, as those without anti-HBs are considered to be at even higher risk. However, at the moment, no recommendations have been made concerning stratifying management according to anti-HBs presence or titer.

If during screening a new HBsAg-positive patient is identified, he or she should be referred to an appropriate specialist hepatitis service to undergo full assessment, regardless of the plans for immunosuppression. Assessment will focus on defining the phase of HBV infection (Table 1), differentiating between chronic HBV infection and chronic hepatitis, and staging the liver disease with a combination of imaging, liver biopsy, and/or noninvasive methods such as transient elastography (FibroScan). Patients positive for anti-HBc antibody may also require assessment, as they may still present with advanced liver disease, even in the absence of active HBV viremia. In rare cases, anti-HBc positivity may also represent true occult HBV infection, where the patient is HBsAg-negative but has positive serum HBV DNA. This can be due to virus mutations in surface antigen rendering it undetectable with standard HBsAg assays or, more commonly, strongly suppressed but active viral replication. Such patients are managed the same as those who are HBsAg-positive.
