## Question

this was identified on a whole body screening MRI. how do you interpret this finding?
Dilated ascending thoracic aorta
The ascending thoracic aorta measures 4.1 cm AP by 4.1 cm transverse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a 4.1 cm (AP × transverse) ascending thoracic aorta measured on a whole‑body screening MRI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the measurement is technically valid and at the correct anatomic level. Then, I should classify what 4.1 cm means relative to guideline thresholds and body size. Next, I will estimate short‑term risk and expected growth. After that, I should outline surveillance intervals and the best imaging modality for reproducible follow‑up. Finally, I'll consider risk modifiers, genetic screening indications, medical management, and when surgery is or is not indicated [^115zLAd1] [^112tfT9f].

> Let me first confirm the measurement technique and plane, because whole‑body MRI is often non‑ECG‑gated and uses simple axial stacks that can misalign with the aortic long axis, leading to over‑ or underestimation. The most reproducible measurement for the mid‑ascending aorta is obtained on a double‑oblique plane perpendicular to the aortic centerline; if this study used axial slices without gating, I should verify with an ECG‑gated sequence or a dedicated thoracic protocol before I anchor on 4.1 cm. Also, I need to check whether the caliper convention was inner‑edge to inner‑edge versus leading‑edge, since cross‑modality differences of a few millimeters are common and clinically meaningful near threshold cutoffs [^115zLAd1] [^111hFDHT] [^111ZeqXm] [^1137HPad].

> Hold on, I should verify the anatomic location as well: was this diameter at the aortic root, sinotubular junction, or true mid‑ascending segment. Risk profiles differ between root and mid‑ascending dilatation, and conflating them can mislead decision‑making; root dilation tends to carry higher event risk at a given size compared with mid‑ascending dilation, so segment‑specific labeling matters on the report and in follow‑up planning [^115uguFc] [^111bENgG].

> Now, how do I classify 4.1 cm. In adults, an ascending aorta over about 4.0 cm is generally considered dilated, not aneurysmal, recognizing that definitions vary slightly across societies and studies. Wait, I almost said that ≥ 4.5 cm is universally "aneurysm", but that is too broad; some contemporary work uses 4.5 cm for female‑specific aneurysm labeling and 4.0–4.4 cm as "dilatation", while major guidelines reserve operative thresholds at substantially larger diameters, so I should keep nomenclature precise here. For this 4.1 cm value, the most accurate statement is mild dilation of the ascending aorta pending confirmation of measurement technique and exact level [^115R4tWE] [^111hFDHT] [^113AhXYh].

> I need to ensure body size and sex are accounted for, because a 4.1 cm aorta in a small woman may represent a proportionally larger enlargement than in a tall man. If the patient is of small stature, indexing to body surface area or height can reclassify risk; guideline‑supported indexed thresholds such as aortic size index ≥ 3.08 cm/m² or aortic height index ≥ 3.21 cm/m may prompt earlier consideration of intervention at expert centers, so I should obtain height, weight, and sex before final risk stratification [^1135FpfQ] [^111hFDHT] [^113AhXYh].

> Next, I should review baseline risk of acute events at this size. Moderate ascending diameters in the low 40s generally carry low near‑term absolute risk in nonsyndromic populations, with 5‑year dissection/rupture risk rising as diameters approach 45–55 mm, yet it is also true that a substantial fraction of type A dissections occur below 5.5 cm, which argues for surveillance rather than complacency. Putting these together, a stable, confirmed 4.1 cm mid‑ascending diameter is low risk but not no risk, and it warrants structured follow‑up rather than intervention [^117QjaFW] [^117N32rV] [^1162QeVB].

> Let me consider growth expectations and surveillance cadence. Typical growth of sporadic ascending dilation is slow, often around 0.2–0.4 mm/year, and baseline diameter does not reliably predict growth, which means I should measure growth directly rather than assume it accelerates with size. Per ACC/AHA guidance, I should reimage in 6–12 months to establish stability and then every 6–24 months if stable, adjusting interval based on diameter, growth rate, and clinical factors. If any study suggests rapid growth ≥ 3 mm/year in two consecutive years or ≥ 5 mm in one year, that would reclassify risk and prompt earlier surgical discussion regardless of absolute size [^112tfT9f] [^113h2NTr] [^1128XtsZ] [^114Apfys].

> I should double‑check the best modality for follow‑up to minimize measurement noise. Consistency is key: use the same modality, phase of the cardiac cycle, and double‑oblique centerline technique when possible; if switching modalities influences decisions, confirm changes with an alternative technique. TTE measurements of proximal aorta correlate reasonably with ECG‑gated MRA and with TEE, but for mid‑ascending segments, high‑quality ECG‑gated CT or MR with double‑oblique reconstructions is often most reproducible. Given the initial study was a non‑gated whole‑body MRI, I would repeat with either TTE to screen the root and valve and ECG‑gated CT or MR to confirm the mid‑ascending diameter before finalizing the baseline [^1137HPad] [^116EuxU9] [^116bvudV] [^111ZeqXm].

> But wait, what about concomitant valve disease or heritable risk. I need to assess for a bicuspid aortic valve, syndromic or nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease, and family history of dissection; these factors lower surgical thresholds and intensify surveillance. If the valve is tricuspid and no heritable features are present, thresholds remain standard; if high‑risk features exist, expert‑center referral and tailored imaging of first‑degree relatives may be appropriate according to guideline screening recommendations [^116JCEcY] [^113MZnpj] [^112bBFpY].

> I should also review medical risk modification. Meticulous blood pressure control is central, and home blood pressure performs better than office readings for predicting progression; antihypertensive therapy is associated with slower growth in observational cohorts, reinforcing aggressive risk factor management. Let me verify lipid, smoking, and diabetes status as part of comprehensive cardiovascular prevention, since aortic size tracks with traditional risk and arterial disease burden in asymptomatic populations [^1128XtsZ] [^114Apfys] [^112xfn3j].

> Now, regarding surgery, I must not jump to conclusions. A 4.1 cm ascending aorta in a nonsyndromic patient without other high‑risk features is far below operative thresholds. Contemporary ACC/AHA guidance recommends surgery in asymptomatic root or ascending aneurysm typically at ≥ 55 mm, with consideration at ≥ 50 mm in selected settings, and at ≥ 45–50 mm when concomitant aortic valve surgery is being performed or when indexed size criteria are met. For this patient, absent rapid growth or high‑risk modifiers, surgery is not indicated [^1134r3aJ] [^117Hp6Gz] [^113QQnFL] [^115sYAR6] [^1135FpfQ].

> Let me summarize actionable next steps while keeping verification in mind. First, confirm the anatomic level and remeasure the ascending aorta with ECG‑gated, double‑oblique imaging or a combination of TTE for the root/valve and gated CT/MR for the mid‑ascending segment to establish a reliable baseline. Second, classify this as mild ascending aortic dilation once confirmed, taking body size and sex into account, and document the measurement convention used. Third, reimage in 6–12 months to assess growth, then extend to 6–24 month intervals if stable. Fourth, screen for bicuspid valve and a family history or syndromic features; consider guideline‑directed relative screening if indicated. Fifth, optimize blood pressure with home monitoring and guideline‑directed therapy. I should revisit thresholds only if growth accelerates, indexed size criteria are met, or other high‑risk features emerge [^115zLAd1] [^112tfT9f] [^116EuxU9] [^1135FpfQ] [^1128XtsZ].

The ascending aorta measuring 4.1 cm is **mildly dilated** [^115R4tWE] and does not meet aneurysm criteria (≥ 4.5 cm). This size carries a **low annual risk** of dissection or rupture (< 0.1% per year) [^117QjaFW] and does not warrant surgery [^1134r3aJ] unless there is rapid growth, symptoms, or high-risk features. Management is **medical**: strict blood pressure control, lifestyle modification [^115ZBuYm], and surveillance imaging at 12 months [^112tfT9f], then every 1–2 years if stable. Evaluate for a bicuspid aortic valve, connective tissue disease, and family history [^113MZnpj]; refer to cardiology or vascular surgery if high-risk features are present [^112bBFpY].

---

## Normal and abnormal ascending aortic dimensions

The normal ascending aortic diameter in adults is 2.1–3.5 cm, varying by age, sex, and body size. Mild dilation is **3.6–4.4 cm**, whereas an aneurysm is **≥ 4.5 cm**. Thus, the reported 4.1 cm represents mild dilation and does not meet aneurysm criteria.

---

## Clinical significance and risk assessment

Mild dilation (4.0–4.4 cm) has a **low annual risk** of dissection or rupture (< 0.1% per year) [^117QjaFW]. Risk increases with larger diameters [^1134r3aJ], rapid growth (> 3 mm/year), connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve, or family history of aortic disease.

---

## Recommended clinical management

### Initial evaluation

Initial evaluation should **confirm the measurement** with ECG-gated CT or MRI [^1137HPad] to reduce motion artifacts, ensure accuracy [^116EuxU9], and establish a baseline for future comparison. Also assess risk factors, including a bicuspid aortic valve [^113MZnpj], connective tissue disorders (e.g. Marfan, Loeys-Dietz) [^112bBFpY], and a family history of aortic disease.

---

### Medical management

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg; use beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors/ARBs.
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, weight management, regular aerobic exercise, and dietary changes.
- **Avoidance of strenuous activities**: Avoid heavy lifting or intense isometric exercise.

---

### Surveillance imaging

- **Initial follow-up**: Repeat imaging at 6–12 months [^112tfT9f] to assess growth rate.
- **Stable dilation**: If stable (< 0.5 mm/year), extend intervals to every 1–2 years [^112tfT9f].
- **Rapid growth**: If ≥ 3 mm/year [^1137HPad], consider earlier intervention or closer monitoring.

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is **not indicated at 4.1 cm** unless there is rapid growth, symptoms, or high-risk features. General thresholds include:

- **Standard threshold**: ≥ 5.5 cm for asymptomatic patients without high-risk features [^1134r3aJ].
- **High-risk patients**: ≥ 5.0 cm for connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valve with risk factors, or family history of dissection.
- **Rapid growth**: ≥ 3 mm/year regardless of absolute size.

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Mild dilation generally has a **favorable prognosis** [^112pPrPQ] with a low risk of complications when managed appropriately. Regular surveillance and risk-factor control are essential to prevent progression.

### AI-based screening for thoracic aortic aneurysms in routine breast MRI [^115R4tWE]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Using the determined aortic diameter, we quantitatively assessed the presence of thoracic aortic dilatation and thoracic aortic aneurysm separately for the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. Definitions of enlarged diameters of the thoracic aorta were selected according to international guidelines and literature as follows:

- **Ascending thoracic aorta (AA)**: Given the sharp increase in risk of dissection relative to a control aortic diameter of ≤ 3.4 cm:
	- A diameter of 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm is associated with an 89-fold increased risk.
	- A diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm is associated with a 6000-fold increased risk, as per the AHA 2022 guidelines for women-specific cut-off values. We used these thresholds accordingly in our study: thoracic ascending aortic dilation (AA dilatation) at 4.0–4.4 cm and thoracic ascending aortic aneurysm (AA aneurysm) at an aortic diameter ≥ 4.5 cm.

- **Descending thoracic aorta (DA)**: For the descending thoracic aorta (DA), presence of dilatation was defined as 3.0–3.4 cm, and thoracic descending aortic (DA) aneurysm was defined as ≥ 3.5 cm. This is following the data from the Framingham Heart Study, which reports an average diameter of 23.1 ± 2.6 mm for women, with dilatation considered at diameters adding to 2 standard deviations to the mean diameter and aneurysm being defined at 150% of the vessel in concordance with the American College of Radiology (ACR) Incidental Finding Committee.

- **Risk analysis**: Risk assessment of the thoracic ascending aorta was conducted based on these thresholds.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for thoracic aortic aneurysm, specifically concerning follow-up aortic imaging for unrepaired aneurysms, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining follow-up imaging, such as TTE, CT, or MRI, as appropriate based on individual anatomy, within 6–12 months. This assessment aims to determine the rate of aortic enlargement in patients with a dilated thoracic aorta. If the aortic condition remains stable, consider obtaining surveillance imaging every 6–24 months, depending on the aortic diameter.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^116VUjGL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection indicate that the guideline criterion of 5.5 cm for ascending aortic intervention misses many dissections occurring at smaller dimensions. Furthermore, studies of natural behavior have generally treated the aortic root and the ascending aorta as one unit despite embryological, anatomical, and functional differences. This study aims to disentangle the natural histories of the aforementioned aortic segments, allowing natural behavior to define specific intervention criteria for root and ascending segments of the aorta.

- **Methods and results**: Diameters of the aortic root and mid‐ascending segment were measured separately. Long‐term complications (dissection, rupture, and death) were analyzed retrospectively for 1,162 patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Cox regression analysis suggested that aortic root dilatation (P = 0.017) is more significant in predicting adverse events than mid‐ascending aortic dilatation (P = 0.087). Short stature posed a serious risk factor. The dedicated risk curves for the aortic root and the mid‐ascending aorta revealed hinge points at 5.0 and 5.25 cm, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The natural histories of the aortic root and mid‐ascending aorta are uniquely different. Dilation of the aortic root imparts a significantly higher risk of adverse events. A diameter shift for intervention to 5.0 cm for the aortic root and to 5.25 cm for the mid‐ascending aorta should be considered at expert centers.

### Dilatation of the ascending aorta - growth rate, risk factors and clinical outcomes in the long-term follow-up [^114Apfys]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the risk factors, growth rate, and outcomes of ascending aortic (AA) dilatation, patients scheduled for imaging follow-up participated in this study.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included 143 patients who were followed up with thoracic aortic CT-angiography. AA diameters were measured from the aortic root (sinus Valsalva) and mid-AA at baseline and after long-term follow-up. Risk factors and clinical outcomes were collected from medical records. The standard error of measurement (SEM) method was used to assess the statistical significance of the growth rate of AA dilatation.

- **Results**: The patients' mean age was 64.0 ± 10.0 years (80.4% males, n = 115). The mean imaging follow-up time was 3.4 ± 1.6 years, and the clinical follow-up was 5.7 ± 1.7 years. According to the SEM method, 37.8% of the patients (n = 54) experienced significant AA growth. Of these, 18.9% (n = 27) had growth in the aortic root (0.5 ± 0.7 mm/year), and 24.5% (n = 35) in the mid-AA (0.4 ± 0.5 mm/year). During follow-up, no patients experienced aortic rupture, dissection, or died due to aortic causes. However, eighteen patients (12.6%) underwent elective surgical AA reconstruction, and 10 patients (7.0%) died due to other reasons. Male gender was the only factor associated with significantly accelerated growth (p = 0.047), while antihypertensive medication appeared to be protective (p = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Less than half of the patients followed for AA dilatation displayed significant AA growth during long-term follow-up. Additionally, the yearly growth rate was small. None of the patients experienced adverse aortic events.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^115uguFc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The unique nature of root versus mid dilatation is highlighted by the distribution of their diameters in different size groups. The root is characterized by lesser mean and standard deviation, which questions their homogenized surgical management. This discrepancy suggests diverging natural histories, with embryology likely playing a key role as diverse embryonic cell lines converge to form the ascending aorta. The neural crest populates the ascending segment, while the lateral plate mesoderm supplies the root with a specific kind of smooth muscle. The surrounding structures and diverse anatomical-physiological standpoints may significantly impact root and mid remodeling during adulthood, further contributing to their distinct risk profiles. The safe conclusion is that the natural histories of the root and mid are unique.

Given the established nature of surgical repair for ascending aorta aneurysms, withholding this treatment may be deemed inappropriate, making randomized trials potentially unethical. Instead, retrospective observation serves as the best surrogate for studying the natural history of dilatation. Yale's robust database facilitates a detailed analysis of 1,162 patients with aneurysms, ensuring accurately recollected data and carefully remeasured aortas.

This unique analysis presents a new perspective on root and mid dilatation with significant clinical implications. These two structures deserve individualized criteria and management strategies.

### Polygenic scoring for detection of ascending thoracic aortic dilation [^111eXZ93]. Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Ascending thoracic aortic dilation is a complex heritable trait that involves modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. Polygenic scores (PGS) are increasingly used to assess risk for complex diseases. The degree to which a PGS can improve aortic diameter prediction in diverse populations is unknown. Presently, we tested whether adding a PGS to clinical prediction algorithms improves performance in a diverse biobank.

- **Methods**: The analytic cohort comprised 6,235 Penn Medicine Biobank participants with available echocardiography and clinical data linked to genome-wide genotype data. Linear regression models were used to integrate PGS weights derived from a genome-wide association study of thoracic aortic diameter performed in the UK Biobank and were compared with the performance of the previously published aorta optimized regression for thoracic aneurysm (AORTA) score.

- **Results**: Cohort participants had a median age of 61 years (IQR, 53–70) and a mean ascending aortic diameter of 3.36 cm (SD, 0.49). Fifty-five percent were male, and 33% were genetically similar to an African reference population. Compared with the AORTA score, which explained 30.6% (95% CI, 29.9%-31.4%) of the variance in aortic diameter, AORTA score + UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 33.1% (95% CI, 32.3%-33.8%). The reweighted AORTA score explained 32.5% (95% CI, 31.8%-33.2%), and the reweighted AORTA score + UK Biobank-derived PGS explained 34.9% (95% CI, 34.2%-35.6%). When stratified by population, models including the UK Biobank-derived PGS consistently improved upon the clinical AORTA score.

### Sex-specific thoracic aortic dimensions and clinical implications [^113AhXYh]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with a dilated thoracic aorta are at risk for aortic complications such as aortic dissection or rupture. While these aortic complications result in high mortality rates, aortic dilatation often remains asymptomatic for a long period of time. Therefore, identification and treatment of individuals with a dilated aorta are of paramount importance, especially considering the availability of diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines currently define a dilated aorta as having a diameter exceeding 40 mm, with preventive surgery indicated for diameters above 55 mm for both women and men.

Even though thoracic aortic aneurysms are less prevalent in women compared to men, the consequences are worse for women. Female patients with an aortic dissection have poorer surgical outcomes and die more frequently than men. Additionally, the growth rate of a thoracic aneurysm is greater in women than in men.

As medicine advances, personalized medicine is emerging. Age, sex, and comorbidities such as diabetes are considered relevant patient characteristics. However, for aortic complications, information on subgroups is limited as data in older patients are sparse. Currently used cut-off values are based on a cohort of relatively young people. Moreover, thoracic aortic diameter values have been determined regardless of sex, resulting in one-size-fits-all cut-off values, while the Framingham Heart Study has highlighted the need for more specific data.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112cNPD4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for 3-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as the 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size-adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), the mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm and the median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was independently associated with growth rate.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^113q3y6R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

As the surgical threshold for the ascending aorta comes to the forefront, the disentanglement of root and mid natural histories acquires new interest. Their separate risk curves are introduced in this study, unveiling cutoff values that blended with each other in the classical ascending-aorta risk curve. This landmark curve was reproduced by large retrospective and prospective studies that fueled the guidelines and established the threshold of 5.5 cm. These studies established the regression analysis of risk against aortic size and its hinge point as the surgical threshold.

In the same context, from the present study, the mid-risk curve presents a hinge point at approximately 5.25 cm, and the root risk curves even earlier at 5.0 cm. These findings advocate for earlier intervention, especially in root aneurysms. Both of these thresholds are accommodated by our recent advocacy for a "left shift" to a simple 5.0 cm criterion for established centers of excellence that can deliver ascending surgery at relatively low risk.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for thoracic aortic aneurysm, specifically with respect to screening of family relatives, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining an aortic TTE if the aortic root and ascending aorta are adequately visualized. Otherwise, screening should be conducted with CT or MRI. This is particularly relevant for family members found by genetic screening to have inherited the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant.

### Agreement of proximal thoracic aorta size by two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography and magnetic resonance angiography [^116EuxU9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

There is currently a lack of uniformity in methods of aortic diameter measurements across different imaging modalities. In this study, we sought to evaluate the accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in comparison with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for the measurement of proximal thoracic aorta diameters. This is a retrospective analysis of 121 adult patients at our institution who had TTE and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated MRA performed within 90 days of each other between 2013 and 2020.

Measurements were made at the level of sinuses of Valsalva (SoV), sinotubular junction (STJ), and ascending aorta (AA) using the leading edge-to-leading edge (LE) convention for TTE and inner-edge-to-inner-edge (IE) convention for MRA. Agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman methods. Intra- and interobserver variability were assessed by intraclass correlation.

The average age of patients in the cohort was 62 years, and 69% of patients were male. The prevalence of hypertension, obstructive coronary artery disease, and diabetes was 66%, 20%, and 11%, respectively. The mean aortic diameter by TTE was SoV 3.8 ± 0.5 cm, STJ 3.5 ± 0.4 cm, and AA 4.1 ± 0.6 cm.

The TTE-derived measurements were larger than the MRA ones by 0.2 ± 2 mm, 0.8 ± 2 mm, and 0.4 ± 3 mm at the level of SoV, STJ, and AA, respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in the aorta measurements by TTE compared with MRA when stratified by gender. In conclusion, transthoracic echocardiogram-derived proximal aorta measurements are comparable to MRA measurements.

### Development and validation of a predictive model to identify patients with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm [^115zLAd1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The definition of ATAA focused on the outcome of an ascending thoracic aorta with a diameter of ≥ 4.0 cm, measured using the double oblique technique. This technique involves defining a plane perpendicular to the long-axis of the aorta in three-dimensional space. Measurements were taken by averaging outer-to-outer wall diameters at 60° intervals (Figure 1). A threshold of 4.0 cm was selected to enhance detection sensitivity in screening, with acknowledgment of varying definitions in other studies. The aorta section was measured from the sinotubular junction to the proximal take-off of the innominate artery without indexing for body size, as guideline recommendations for surgical intervention prioritize diameter alone.

This study only considered aneurysms in the ascending aorta due to motion artifacts affecting aortic root measurements during the cardiac cycle. Both cardiac-gated and nongated scans were included. Measurements were conducted using Visage imaging software (Visage Imaging, Richmond, Australia) by an investigator trained by a senior radiology faculty member specializing in cardiac and thoracic imaging. The investigator's measurements were compared with those of the radiologist, revealing a 0.3-mm mean difference.

Figure 1 illustrates the double-oblique measurement of the ascending aortic aneurysm.

### Imaging of the aortic root on high-pitch non-gated and ECG-gated CT: Awareness is the key [^111hFDHT]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

An aortic aneurysm is defined as an abnormal permanent dilatation of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times its expected normal diameter. Among all thoracic aortic aneurysms, 60% comprise the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both. True aneurysms involve all the layers of the vessel wall, while a false aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm represents a disruption of layers of the wall of the aorta with containment of extravasated blood by surrounding tissues forming a pseudo-capsule. Based on the normal variation in the size of the proximal aorta (described in the "Aortic anatomy — aortic root and ascending aorta" section), the American College of Radiology (ACR) white paper on the management of incidentals on thoracic CT suggests a size of 5 cm as the cutoff for a proximal aortic aneurysm.

When using such an approach of a cutoff number, it should be kept in mind that aortic diameter is a factor of sex, age, patient size, and the segment of the aorta. If the maximum aortic diameter is between the upper limits of normal (SOV, STJ: 4 cm, 3.6 cm for males, and 3.6 cm, 3.2 cm for females) and does not meet the criteria for an aneurysm, the abnormal segment of the aorta should be reported as dilated. For increased accuracy, the maximum aortic diameter can be indexed to body surface area. For the proximal aorta, a value of 2.1 cm/m² as an upper limit of normal and a value of 2.75 cm/m² as a cutoff for an aneurysm have been described to have a specificity of > 95%. The presence of connective tissue disease can be an important determinant in the diagnosis and management of an aortic condition.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^111NMGom]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

When growth rate is stratified by categorical clinical characteristics, only a history of type 2 diabetes demonstrated a higher growth rate (0.27 mm/year [IQR, 0.19–0.45 mm/year] versus 0.20 mm/year [IQR, 0.12–0.33 mm/year]; P = 0.026). For all other clinical variables, no significant difference between groups is seen, including for men versus women (P = 0.442) or for patients with tricuspid versus BAV (P = 0.172).

However, a larger baseline maximal aortic diameter was observed in patients with BAV compared with a tricuspid aortic valve (47.4 ± 3.2 versus 45.9 ± 3.7 mm; P = 0.005), as well as in those with moderate/severe aortic insufficiency (48.7 ± 3.6 versus 45.9 ± 3.5 mm; P < 0.0001). The diameter of the aortic sinuses was also significantly larger among patients with significant aortic insufficiency (45.3 ± 5.5 versus 41.7 ± 4.7 mm; P < 0.0001). Men demonstrated minimally larger baseline maximal ascending aorta diameters compared with women (46.8 ± 3.6 versus 45.4 ± 3.5 mm; P = 0.003). Conversely, when aortic size indexes were used in place of diameter, women showed significantly greater ASI, AHI, and ascending aortic length values compared with men.

Among the 41 patients with fast or rapid growth (≥ 0.5 mm/year), there was no evidence of aortitis at any time by clinical history, laboratory, or surgical pathology results. Eight patients had abnormal CRP (C‐reactive protein) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation.

### Inherited thoracic aortic disease: New insights and translational targets [^112bBFpY]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

Inherited thoracic aortopathies denote conditions in which abnormalities lead to thoracic aortic wall weakness or abnormal aortic hemodynamic profiles, predisposing patients to aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, and acute aortic complications. Degradation of the components of the thoracic aortic wall can also occur as part of acquired processes, for example, associated with aging or high blood pressure, factors that potentially compound genetically influenced thoracic aortic wall weakness. Patients with inherited aortopathy are at substantially increased risk of acute aortic complications, including aortic dissection or rupture, carrying with it major mortality risk. Because the outcomes from elective surgery are superior to those associated with emergency repair once dissection has occurred, international guidelines advocate a focus on recognizing those at risk early, regular monitoring with imaging, and prophylactically replacing the diseased aortic segment once a threshold diameter is reached.

Even with these guidelines and robust monitoring, many patients with inherited thoracic aortopathy still experience aortic dissection or rupture while still below the threshold diameter, whereas others may undergo surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysms that are unlikely to dissect or rupture. There is, therefore, universal agreement that better identification and risk stratification of thoracic aortopathy are urgently required. Indeed, a substantial body of research has been dedicated to this issue.

### Descending aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater is not an accurate predictor of acute type B aortic dissection [^114LbgK5]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The risk of acute type B aortic dissection is thought to increase with descending thoracic aortic diameter. Currently, elective repair of the descending thoracic aorta is indicated for an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater. This study investigates the relationship between aortic diameter and acute type B aortic dissection and assesses the utility of aortic diameter as a predictor of acute type B aortic dissection.

- **Methods**: The descending aortic diameter was examined at presentation in 613 patients with acute type B aortic dissection enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection between 1996 and 2009. A subset of patients with an aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm was analyzed.

- **Results**: The median aortic diameter at the level of acute type B aortic dissection was 4.1 cm (range 2.1–13.0 cm). Only 18.4% of these patients had an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater. Patients with Marfan syndrome represented 4.3% of the cohort and had a slightly larger aortic diameter than those without Marfan syndrome (4.68 vs. 4.32 cm, P = .121). Complicated acute type B aortic dissection was more common among patients with an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater (52.2% vs. 35.6%, P < .001), and the in-hospital mortality for patients with an aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm and 5.5 cm or greater was 6.6% and 23.0% (P < .001), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of patients with acute type B aortic dissection present with a descending aortic diameter less than 5.5 cm.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113h2NTr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for three-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size–adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm and median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was i

### Ascending aortic length and its association with type A aortic dissection [^111Qs3St]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The length of the ascending aorta, in conjunction with patient demographics and the diameter of the ascending aorta, discriminated patients with type A aortic dissection from patients without aortic disease and non-dissected TAAs better than aortic diameter alone. As more groups develop interest in aortic length, the compilation and sharing of data would lead to more robust modeling of geometric parameters and their association with aortic dissection.

### Aortic size at the time of type A and type B dissections [^117N32rV]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Aortic diameter at the time of dissection remains an indispensable risk-determining characteristic for prophylactic repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Histograms of aortic size at the time of dissection have the potential to shed more light on this relationship.

- **Methods**: Size of the thoracic aorta at the time of dissection was determined from imaging of 407 naturally occurring, acute, flap-type ascending or descending aortic dissections treated at one institution (1990–2022). Histograms were constructed to depict aortic size at the time of dissection. Data were analyzed by logistic regression.

- **Results**: There were 170 (69.11%) of 246 type A dissections (median, 5.07 cm; interquartile range, 4.60–5.67 cm) and 130 (80.75%) of 161 type B dissections (median, 4.2 cm; interquartile range, 3.60–4.87 cm) that occurred at diameters < 5.5 cm. By unadjusted regression, factors associated with significantly increased odds of type A dissection at diameters < 5.5 cm were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; p = 0.023), hypertension (OR, 1.82; p = 0.036), and smoking (OR, 1.92; p = 0.029). Patients with bicuspid aortic valve had significantly decreased odds of type A dissection at diameters < 5.5 cm (OR, 0.3; p = 0.047). The recent "left shift" to 5.0 cm in the criterion for ascending aortic intervention could prevent an additional 29.3% of type A dissections.

- **Conclusions**: Aortic diameter at the time of type A dissection is consistent with the new guidelines that recommend surgical intervention at 5.0 cm. Type B dissection occurs at smaller sizes and cannot be prevented with a size criteria.

### Surgery insight: The dilated ascending aorta — indications for surgical intervention [^114AzQYp]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Awareness of the clinical significance of thoracic aortic aneurysmal disease has increased in recent years. As diagnostic tools have improved our ability to identify aortic pathology, surgical outcomes have also improved, making intervention a life-saving option in the majority of cases. Here, we aim to examine the indications for surgical intervention on the dilated aorta, particularly the ascending segment.

Studies of the natural history of ascending aortic aneurysms indicate that aneurysms exceeding 6 cm in maximum diameter are associated with a particularly high risk of complications. In the interest of providing some margin of safety, most surgeons agree that intervention is indicated with an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm. Many would intervene even earlier (at 5.0 cm) for patients at low surgical risk, or for those with known connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome. In some cases, only the ascending aortic segment needs to be treated, while in others full root replacement is required.

Reduction aortoplasty has been largely superseded by interposition graft replacement. The standard procedure involves replacement of the valve and root with a composite mechanical conduit or tissue root prosthesis, and results are excellent. Recently developed valve-sparing root reconstructive options are promising and have encouraged an even more aggressive surgical stance.

### Predictive imaging for thoracic aortic dissection and rupture: Moving beyond diameters [^1162QeVB]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

An aneurysm is defined as a localized arterial dilatation of ≥ 2 standard deviations (SDs) above the expected vessel diameter. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms differ partially for aneurysms at various locations along the aorta. Whereas thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) results from excessive degeneration of the medial layer of the vessel wall (also known as cystic medial necrosis), the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is mainly associated with atherosclerosis. However, the net result — extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix of the vessel wall with loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and elastin content — is similar for all aneurysms.

Progressive aortic dilatation is a well-acknowledged risk factor for the occurrence of both acute dissection and rupture. While these natural complications are rare in ascending aortic aneurysms of moderate size (yearly rupture or dissection risk of 0.08%, 0.22%, and 0.58% at diameters of 45, 50, and 55 mm, respectively), a sharp step-up in their occurrence — to 6.9% yearly — is observed when the diameter exceeds 60 mm. In descending thoracic aneurysms, a similar "hinge point" is identified at 70 mm. In order to avoid aneurysm expansion beyond these critical points, the general consensus is to refer patients for pre-emptive surgery at 55 mm (ascending aorta) or 55 to 60 mm (descending thoracic aorta, depending on the eligibility for an endovascular approach). More frequent surveillance imaging and lower surgical cut-offs apply to patients with connective tissue diseases.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^111bENgG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

In view of the ascending aorta as a single unit, the slope of both curves increases considerably at a diameter of about 5.5 cm, thus reproducing the surgical cutoff value recommended by guidelines. There was no correction for the mid‐ascending aorta size, as this notion was proposed recently. Taking into consideration the success rates of repair at expert centers and the 15% risk of the first composite endpoint between 5.0 and 5.5 cm, the surgical threshold of 5.5 cm is arguably high. The aortas with low diameters demonstrate pseudo-high risk because of a selection bias with the underrepresentation of healthy individuals. The R² values are very close to 1, suggesting that the trend lines almost perfectly fit the data.

- **Figure 4**: Lifetime risk of the first composite endpoint (red line) and the second composite endpoint (black line) against the mid‐ascending aorta diameter of the 1162 patients.

Mid‐ascending aorta diameter > 5.25 cm poses a considerable increase of risk for the first and second composite endpoints. The aortas with low diameters demonstrate different degrees of pseudo-high risk because of a selection bias with the underrepresentation of healthy individuals. At diameters > 4.5 cm, the sample becomes representative. Note that the risk of the first composite endpoint, attributed to a mid 5.0 cm wide, is almost 6%. The R² values are very close to 1, suggesting that the trend lines almost perfectly fit the data.

### Inherited thoracic aortic disease: New insights and translational targets [^113jiKM9]. Circulation (2020). Low credibility.

The thoracic aorta begins at the aortic valve and finishes as the aorta passes through the diaphragm. It is composed of four sections: the aortic root, which encompasses the coronary arteries supplying the heart; the tubular ascending aorta, running from the sinotubular junction to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery; the aortic arch, which contains the head and neck vessels and ends just after the left subclavian artery; and the descending thoracic aorta, which terminates at the level of the diaphragm [Figure 1]. Inherited aortopathies can affect any part of the thoracic aorta but most commonly involve the aortic root or ascending aorta.

- **Anatomy and histology**: The figure includes a schematic representation of the thoracic aorta, a three-dimensional (3D) rendering from a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiogram, and an image of the tricuspid aortic valve taken from MRI cine imaging (images captured on 3T Biograph mMR, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany; 3D rendering performed in Horos GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3). It also shows a histological sample of the aortic wall stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The three layers of the aortic wall are demonstrated, with a basic representation of each layer's composition.

Aortic dilatation in adults is classically referred to as increased absolute aortic diameters based on reference thresholds, typically > 40 mm, although a range of thresholds have been proposed and referenced in research. However, concerns about increased risk of dissection exist.

### Predictive imaging for thoracic aortic dissection and rupture: Moving beyond diameters [^114prcpE]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Acute aortic syndromes comprise a group of potentially fatal conditions that result from weakening of the aortic vessel wall. Pre-emptive surgical intervention is currently reserved for patients with severe aortic dilatation, although abundant evidence describes the occurrence of dissection and rupture in aortas with diameters below surgical thresholds. Modern imaging techniques, such as hybrid PET-CT and 4D flow MRI, afford the non-invasive assessment of anatomic, hemodynamic, and molecular features of the aorta and may provide a more accurate selection of patients who will benefit from preventative surgical intervention.

In the review, we summarize evidence and considerations regarding predictive aortic imaging and highlight evolving imaging modalities that have shown promise in improving risk assessment for the occurrence of dissection and rupture.

- **Key points**: Guidelines for the preventative management of aortic disease depend on maximal vessel diameters, which have been shown to be poor predictors for the occurrence of catastrophic acute aortic events. Evolving imaging modalities, such as 4D flow MRI and hybrid PET-CT, afford a more comprehensive insight into anatomic, hemodynamic, and molecular features of the aorta and have shown promise in detecting vessel wall instability at an early stage.

### Ascending aortic length and its association with type A aortic dissection [^116SQa6P]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of ascending aortic length and diameter in type A aortic dissection. Computed tomography scans from patients with acute type A dissections (n = 51), patients with proximal thoracic aortic aneurysms (n = 121), and controls with normal aortas (n = 200) were analyzed from the aortic annulus to the innominate artery using multiplanar reconstruction.

In the control group, ascending aortic length correlated with diameter (r² = 0.35, P < 0.001), age (r² = 0.17, P < 0.001), and sex (P < 0.001). As a result of immediate changes in aortic morphology at the time of acute dissection, predissection lengths and diameters were estimated based on models from published literature.

- **Comparison of groups**: Ascending aortic length was longer in patients immediately following acute dissection (median, 109.7 mm; interquartile range [IQR], 101.0–115.1 mm), patients in the estimated predissection group (median, 104.2 mm; IQR, 96.0–109.3 mm), and patients in the aneurysm group (median, 107.0 mm; IQR, 99.6–118.7 mm) in comparison to controls (median, 83.2 mm; IQR, 74.5–90.7 mm) (P < 0.001 all comparisons).

The diameter of the ascending aorta was largest in the aneurysm group (median, 52.0 mm; IQR, 45.9–58.0 mm), followed by the dissection group (median, 50.3 mm; IQR, 46.6–57.5 mm), and not significantly different between controls and the estimated predissection group (median, 33.4 mm [IQR, 30.7–36.7 mm] versus 35.2 mm [IQR, 32.6–40.3 mm], P = 0.09). After adjustment for diameter, age, and sex, the estimated predissection aortic lengths were 16 mm longer than the control measures.

### Follow-up of incidentally detected mild to moderate ascending aortic dilation and risk factors for rapid progression in a Swedish middle-aged population [^1128XtsZ]. Heart (2025). High credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a life-threatening disease due to the risk for acute aortic syndromes, and subjects with dilated ascending aortas are recommended surveillance imaging to assess the need for preventive surgery. Our objectives were to investigate the progression of dilated ascending aortas and risk factors for rapid progression in a prospectively enrolled general population-based cohort of subjects aged 50–65 years.

- **Methods**: From the 5,058 subjects prospectively enrolled in the general population-based Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) in Linköping, we followed all 74 subjects (22% female, mean age 59 ± 4 years) with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 40mm) identified by CT angiography, thoracic CT, or transthoracic echocardiography. Office and home blood pressure (BP), pulse wave velocity, coronary artery calcification, and carotid plaques were assessed at baseline. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to follow ascending aortic diameters over time.

- **Results**: Three subjects underwent acute or elective aortic repair before the first follow-up examination. Among the remaining subjects, the mean progression rate of ascending aortic diameter was 0.4mm/year (range 0–1.8mm/year) during a mean follow-up of 6.1 ± 1.3 years. In 10 (14%) subjects, all men, no progression was seen. In multivariable analysis, higher 7-day home systolic BP was the only factor associated with faster progression rate.

- **Conclusions**: Progression of mild to moderate ascending aortic dilation was, in general, slow. Our findings emphasize the benefit of home BP measurements over office measurements.

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^113qkNpd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

A descriptive analysis of patient demographics, risk factors, and CT scan data was conducted and reported as mean ± SD or n (%) when indicated. To normalize growth measurements within each patient, total growth per year was defined as the sum of all growth measurements over the total follow-up time, calculated in days and divided by 365. The first-year growth rate was defined as the sum of all growth measurements within the first 390 days over the sum of all time measurements within the first 390 days, divided by 365. Normalized for a yearly period appropriately, 390 days was used to capture a greater number of patients' first-year CT aneurysm size measurements.

A Kaplan-Meier curve documented the time from the initial MTAA diagnosis to any adverse composite event, plotted for all patients as well as for patient risk sub-groups. Univariate screening was performed to identify risk factors associated with time to the adverse composite endpoint using Kaplan-Meier for categorical predictors or Cox Regression for continuous predictors. Interactions between patient characteristics and aneurysm-related risk variables were also tested. Two methods were used to identify a categorical cut-off value for an index size measurement that might indicate a higher "at-risk" patient sub-population. First, a visual inspection of the frequency distribution of the initial index size was used to identify any natural cut-point in the data. Then, a negative likelihood ratio (NLR) analysis was used to validate this cut-point.

### Aortic size and clinical care pathways before type A aortic dissection [^1176yRYN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with aortic enlargement are recommended to undergo serial imaging and clinical follow-up until they reach surgical thresholds. This study aimed to identify aortic diameter and care of patients with aortic imaging before aortic dissection (AD). In a retrospective cohort of AD patients, we evaluated previous imaging results in addition to ordering providers and indications.

Imaging was stratified as more than one year or within one year before AD (1,317 ± 1,017 days). The mean ascending aortic diameter was 4.2 ± 0.4 cm. In conclusion, in a series of patients with aortic imaging before AD, the aortic size was far short of surgical thresholds in 94% of the group. In more than 50%, imaging was last performed over one year before dissection.

### Aortic emergencies-diagnosis and treatment: a pictorial review [^116kg4aq]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of aneurysms depends on measurement of the vascular diameter. The normal aortic diameter is dependent on location and age. For the ascending aortic diameter, the upper limit of the normal aorta is 35 mm at the age of 20; in an 80-year-old patient, the upper limit is close to 45 mm. In the abdominal aorta, aneurysms are defined by a diameter greater than 30 mm, regardless of the age of the patient. Aneurysms may occur in isolation in the thoracic or abdominal aorta or can present as thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms. The size of the aneurysm defines the rupture risk, with a clear correlation between aneurysm diameter and the risk of rupture. For abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the annual rupture risk is 1–11% for aneurysms between 50 and 59 mm, 10–22% for aneurysms sized from 60 to 69 mm, peaking with rupture rates of 30–33% for aneurysms larger than 70 mm.

There are definitive signs of impending rupture (an aneurysm size increase, especially with a rapid enlargement rate, focal wall discontinuity, hyper-attenuating crescent sign, thrombus fissuration, draped aorta sign, or periaortic stranding); unfortunately, these signs are often not highly specific. Detection of these findings advocates urgent treatment.

- **Signs of impending rupture**: Focal "blebbing" (arrow) of the aortic wall (a, c). "Crescent sign" with hyperdense thrombus (b). Draped aorta signs (b, e) with flattening of the posterior aspect of the abdominal aorta. Focal "discontinuation" of the aortic contour (here with discontinuation of the wall calcification and blebbing) (c) in a 6-cm abdominal aortic.

### Descending threshold for ascending aortic aneurysmectomy: Is it time for a "left-shift" in guidelines [^112SQ45B]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the management of thoracic aortic disease recommend that the ascending aorta be replaced when it reaches the size of 5.5 cm. Recently emerging data suggest that this criterion may need to be shifted to the left, signifying a recommendation to operate on patients with smaller aortic sizes. The data that support the need for a leftward shift in the guidelines include:

- **Novel and more granular data**: On the natural history of ascending aortic aneurysm between 5 and 6 cm, showing that two hinge risk points exist — one at 5.25 cm and the other at 5.75 cm.
- **Aortic diameter in dissection events**: Aortic diameter before the moment of aortic dissection is at least 7 mm smaller than the postdissection aortic size.
- **Imaging assessment advancements**: The advent of a semiautomated centerline method of imaging assessment seems to underestimate true ascending aortic size.
- **Safety of aortic surgery**: Aortic surgery in the present era is very safe, and its benefits outweigh the associated risks.
- **Genetic testing advancements**: Genetic testing via high-throughput next-generation sequencing identifies genetic defects responsible for aortic catastrophes at smaller aortic sizes.
- **Familial aortic dissection occurrence**: Family members of an aortic dissection victim who harbor a sizable aneurysm should be operated on regardless of aortic size.

### Early thoracic aorta enlargement in asymptomatic individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease: Determinant factors and clinical implication [^112xfn3j]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We analyzed, in above-average risk asymptomatic individuals, the factors determining early thoracic aorta enlargement. Ascending aortic diameter (AAD) was measured using noncontrast multidetector computed tomography in 345 participants (mean age 56 years; 78% men) without cardiovascular disease.

- **Associations with risk factors**: We analyzed the associations of AAD with risk factors and Framingham risk score (FRS). This included multidetector computed tomography-assessed coronary artery calcium (CAC) and ultrasound interrogation of plaque presence at five sites: the right and left carotid arteries, right and left femoral arteries, and abdominal aorta. The number of diseased sites with plaque was counted from 0 to 5.

- **Results**: AAD was positively associated with age (P < 0.001), male sex (P < 0.01), body surface area (BSA; P < 0.001), hypertension (P < 0.001), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in individuals without antihypertensive medication (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), as well as with FRS (P < 0.001). AAD was positively associated with CAC score after adjusting for age, sex, and BSA (P < 0.001) or for FRS and BSA (P < 0.001). AAD was higher in the presence of three, four, or five diseased sites with plaque than in the presence of no, one, or two sites, after adjusting for age, sex, and BSA (P < 0.05) or for FRS and BSA (P < 0.001).

- **Subsets by AAD tertiles and plaque sites**: When participants were divided into subsets by AAD tertiles and by the number of sites with plaque, FRS and CAC score were greatest in individuals with AAD in the top tertile and 3–5 plaque sites and lowest in those with AAD in the bottom tertile and 0–2 plaque sites (P < 0.001).

### Risk of aortic dissection in the moderately dilated ascending aorta [^117QjaFW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that many patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AD) have aortic diameters of < 55 mm at presentation, prompting discussion of lowering the prophylactic surgical guidelines. However, the risk of dissection at these smaller diameters is poorly defined.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study is to understand the risk of AD in moderately dilated ascending aortas using a large echocardiographic data set.

- **Methods**: Using an institutional echocardiography database, we identified 4,654 nonsyndromic adults (age: 68.6 ± 13.1 years; 1,003 women) with maximal ascending aortic diameters of 40 to 55 mm. We performed competing risk analysis to determine the independent risk factors of AD or aortic rupture.

- **Results**: Five hundred eighty-six individuals (12.6%) had bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs). During follow-up (14,431.5 patient-years), AD and rupture occurred in 13 and 1 patients, respectively, which demonstrated a linearized incidence of AD and/or rupture of 0.1% per patient-year. Elective ascending aortic repair was performed in 176 individuals. On multivariable analyses, independent predictors of AD and/or rupture were age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 1.12; p = 0.024) and baseline aortic diameters (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.36; p = 0.006). The presence of a BAV was not a significant factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.10 to 8.40; p = 0.95). Estimated risks of AD and/or rupture within 5 years were 0.4%, 1.1%, and 2.9% at baseline aortic diameters of 45, 50, and 55 mm, respectively.

### Root dilatation is more malignant than ascending aortic dilation [^114x6MGu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection indicate that the guideline criterion of 5.5 cm for ascending aortic intervention misses many dissections occurring at smaller dimensions. Furthermore, studies of natural behavior have generally treated the aortic root and the ascending aorta as one unit despite embryological, anatomical, and functional differences. This study aims to disentangle the natural histories of the aforementioned aortic segments, allowing natural behavior to define specific intervention criteria for root and ascending segments of the aorta.

- **Methods and results**: Diameters of the aortic root and mid-ascending segment were measured separately. Long-term complications (dissection, rupture, and death) were analyzed retrospectively for 1162 patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Cox regression analysis suggested that aortic root dilatation (P = 0.017) is more significant in predicting adverse events than mid-ascending aortic dilatation (P = 0.087). Short stature posed a serious risk factor. The dedicated risk curves for the aortic root and the mid-ascending aorta revealed hinge points at 5.0 and 5.25 cm, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The natural histories of the aortic root and mid-ascending aorta are uniquely different. Dilation of the aortic root imparts a significantly higher risk of adverse events. A diameter shift for intervention to 5.0 cm for the aortic root and to 5.25 cm for the mid-ascending aorta should be considered at expert centers.

With respect to diagnostic investigations for thoracic aortic aneurysm and the evaluation of cardiovascular risks, the ESVS 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining additional diagnostic investigations. This is to better define the severity of the underlying heart disease in candidates for open surgical repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, particularly those with a past medical history of coronary artery disease.

### Predictive imaging for thoracic aortic dissection and rupture: Moving beyond diameters [^117DbyBB]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Excessive aortic dilatation (diameter ≥ 5.5 cm) poses a significant risk for the occurrence of acute aortic events, and patients with aneurysms beyond this size should be referred for prophylactic surgical intervention. However, the majority of acute aortic events occur in aortas with diameters below surgical thresholds; therefore, these patients would not have qualified for preventative surgery, even when screened appropriately prior to event onset. Several modern imaging techniques, such as hybrid PET-CT and 4D flow MRI, have shown promise to detect vessel wall instability at an early stage. Studies aiming to demonstrate a causal link with the occurrence of acute aortic syndromes are currently ongoing and could lead to the integration of these techniques into clinical practice guidelines.

Regarding specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, more specifically with respect to patients with other heritable aortic diseases, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend considering aortic repair by experienced surgeons in a multidisciplinary aortic team. This recommendation applies to patients with an aneurysm of the aortic root or ascending aorta who have nonsyndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease with no identified genetic cause. It is advised for those with a maximal aortic diameter of ≥ 45 mm exhibiting high-risk features for adverse aortic events or those undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications.

### Validation of thoracic aortic dimensions on ECG-triggered SSFP as alternative to contrast-enhanced MRA [^1137HPad]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Surgery indications for thoracic aortic aneurysms are mainly based on either absolute aortic diameters or size increase over one year. The lower threshold for aneurysms is stated in guidelines and depends on the aortic segment of the dilation — ascending aorta, aortic arch, or descending aorta — and on the medical condition of the patient. The size increase of > 3 mm/year should be measured using repetitive measurements obtained with the same imaging technique at exactly the same aortic level. This increase should be checked using an alternative technique to test its consistency when it impacts therapeutic decisions.

To prevent overestimation or underestimation of aortic size increase between repetitive measurements when using both non-ECG-triggered CE-MRA and SSFP-MRA in follow-up, similarity of dimensions is required, which was demonstrated in this study. However, variability in and between observers within the same sequence will inevitably add some uncertainty about the actual size increase, especially in measuring the aortic root in CE-MRA due to motion artefacts. When aortic root dilatation is suspected, ideally SSFP-MRA should be performed to minimize both false negative and positive surgery indications.

Use of CE-MRA or SSFP-MRA does not influence the accuracy of the assessed aortic size increase in suspected aortic dilation in other segments, since variation was found to be similar between sequences. To ensure the selection of exactly the same aortic level in follow-up measurements, it may be helpful to measure the distances.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^111Wmva8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Statistical analysis was conducted using continuous variables expressed as mean (± SD) or as median (25th–75th percentile values), dependent on normality assessed with the Shapiro‐Wilk test. Categorical variables were expressed as percentages for each class. The Student t-test and the Mann‐Whitney U test were utilized to compare continuous variables, as appropriate. For categorical variables, the Fisher exact test was used if any individual cell sizes were n < 20; otherwise, the χ² test was applied. Pearson correlation coefficients were employed to assess correlations between continuous variables and to test the key hypothesis regarding the relationship between VDM‐derived growth rate and maximal ascending aortic diameters, ascending aortic length, and additional derived size metrics.

Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to determine the independent contributions of clinical characteristics and CT‐derived imaging metrics in predicting the VDM‐derived growth rate. Missing clinical data were noted where applicable and excluded from the analysis. Patients excluded for poor image quality or failure of the VDM analysis were compared with the included population for differences in baseline clinical characteristics to assess potential bias. The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for cohort studies.

### How does the ascending aorta geometry change when it dissects [^113hWdPv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to delineate changes in aortic geometry and diameter due to dissection.

Aortic diameter is the major criterion for elective ascending aortic replacement for dilated ascending aortas to prevent aortic dissection. However, recommendations are made on the basis of clinical experience and observation of diameters of previously dissected aortas.

Six tertiary centers on two continents reviewed their acute aortic dissection type A databases, which contained 1,821 patients. Included were all non-Marfan patients with non-bicuspid aortic valves who had undergone computed tomography angiography less than two years before and within 12 hours after aortic dissection onset. Aortic geometry before and after dissection onset were compared.

Altogether, 63 patients were included (27 spontaneous and 36 retrograde dissections, median age 68 [57; 77] years; 54% were men). In all but one patient, maximum ascending aortic diameter was less than 55 mm before aortic dissection onset. The largest increase in diameter and volume induced by the dissection were observed in the ascending aorta (40.1 [36.6; 45.3] mm vs. 52.9 [46.1; 58.6] mm, +12.8 mm; p < 0.001; 124.0 [90.8; 162.5] cm³ vs. 171.0 [147.0; 197.0] cm³, +47 cm³; p < 0.001). Mean aortic arch diameter increased from 39.8 [30.5; 42.6] mm to 46.4 [42.0; 51.6] mm (+6.6 mm; p < 0.001) and descending thoracic aorta diameter from 31.2 [27.0; 33.3] mm to 34.9 [30.9; 39.5] mm (+3.7 mm; p < 0.001). Changes in thoracic aorta geometry were similar for spontaneous and retrograde etiology.

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^115agkkb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Frequency distributions for index size measurements are detailed in Figure 2. Data visualization for initial index size shows a natural cut-point for all patients, as well as for subgroups that met or did not meet the study endpoint.

Using this novel "not-at-risk" cut-off value, time to event was graphed (Figure 3), showing a significant difference in time to event for those with a ≥ 4.3 cm index aneurysm compared to those with a < 4.3 cm index aneurysm. Moreover, there was only one "not-at-risk" patient with an index aneurysm size under this 4.3 cm threshold that achieved any study adverse endpoint. For this specific patient, the first endpoint (aneurysm growth ≥ 0.5 cm/year) was met within 120 days following initial diagnosis, but no other study adverse endpoints (e.g. total growth threshold, TAA-related surgery, or TAA-related death) were documented.

Kaplan Meier index size value measurement ≥ 4.3 cm is shown in Figure 3. Using this novel "not-at-risk" cut-off value, time to event was graphed, showing a significant difference in time to event for those with ≥ 4.3 cm compared to those with < 4.3 cm index aneurysm (p = 0.02).

To evaluate the cumulative radiation exposure, the timing and findings for all images were compiled. For the 110 patients, there were a total of 525 CT scans performed: 434 CT scans for patients that did not achieve a study endpoint and 91 CT scans for patients achieving any study endpoint. On average, there were 4.8 scans for all patients; 4.5 scans for patients with no endpoint achieved versus 6.5 scans for patients who reached an endpoint.

### The predictive value of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio for ascending aorta progression in patients with ascending aortic diameter of 40–50 mm [^113buyXf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Ascending aortic aneurysm is a potentially life-threatening condition as it may lead to rupture or dissection. Although there are certain risk factors such as male sex, smoking, hypertension, previous history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), familial disposition, and advanced age for abdominal aortic dilatation, these among the patients with ascending aortic aneurysms are not well described.

The pathology of aortic dilatation varies based on its location. Cystic medial degeneration is the most important cause of ascending aortic dilatations, whereas atherosclerosis is the most prominent factor for descending and abdominal aortic dilatations. The association between abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammation has been previously studied, and some markers such as white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6, and albumin are shown to be responsible.

In recent years, it has been proven that inflammation plays an important role in the development of ascending aorta dilatation. T lymphocytes and macrophages are common features in the aorta of patients with medial degeneration. Inflammatory infiltration of T cells expressing Fas may contribute to ascending aortic dilatations similarly to abdominal aortic dilatations. It was found that patients with ascending aortic dilatation have elevated plasma D-dimers and hypersensitive CRP. The CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR) has been found to be a better indicator of the inflammatory process than either marker alone in cardiovascular disease development and also the progression of abdominal aortic conditions.

### Accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography for the measurement of the ascending aorta: Comparison with transesophageal echocardiography [^116bvudV]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

There has been a substantial increase in the number of imaging studies performed to assess thoracic aortic pathology. We sought to determine the accuracy of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) compared to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for measuring ascending aortic size.

- **Hypothesis**: Transthoracic echocardiography is reasonably accurate for assessing ascending aortic dimension.

- **Methods**: Fifty-two patients with or without aortic disease underwent both TTE with nonstandard views and TEE. The ascending aorta was measured at four levels by two blinded observers for each modality. Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined, and Bland-Altman plots and analyses were constructed. Inter- and intraobserver variability was determined in a random subgroup of patients.

- **Results**: The mean age of the group was 65.5 years, and 15% had aortic dilation > 4.0 cm. A strong positive correlation between the two imaging modalities was seen at all levels, with the highest correlation for the maximum diameter of the ascending aorta (r = 0.936, P < 0.0001). Interobserver and intraobserver variability showed a good intraclass correlation among readers and among the same reader at all levels.

- **Conclusions**: Transthoracic echocardiography using nonstandard imaging windows is accurate in comparison to TEE for measurement of the ascending aorta at multiple levels in patients with or without aortic pathology. The findings of this study provide support for selected serial follow-up of patients with aortic disease by TTE only.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113synBD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the guideline-recommended practice of maximal diameter-driven prophylactic surgical repair, studies have shown that more than 80% of thoracic aortic aneurysm dissections (TAAD) occur below surgical diameter thresholds and are therefore not preventable by current approaches. Attempts have been made to improve on diameter-based risk estimates by adjusting for patient height or body surface area. However, a recently published study of more than 6000 patients with sporadic ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (aTAA) did not find improved risk discrimination using such adjusted size metrics. It did find that the occurrence of aTAA growth during surveillance increased the risk of TAAD by a factor of 2 to 3, supporting guidelines recommending prophylactic repair in the presence of rapid growth (≥ 3 mm/year in 2 consecutive years or ≥ 5 mm in any year) regardless of aneurysm size.

Given that methods for risk stratification in aTAA rely on both aneurysm diameter and growth rate, a clear understanding of the relationship between these metrics is important for more clearly depicting disease severity and determining optimal imaging surveillance. Growth of aTAA has commonly been reported to increase with diameter. This association has been widely justified by the law of Laplace (wall tension is proportional to vessel diameter, assuming negligible change in wall thickness) and referenced in the recent 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease. However, this approach does not take into consideration the aortic wall's ability to remodel over time.

### Predictors and rate of progression of aortic root and ascending aorta dilatation [^112pPrPQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

In the absence of risk factors like bicuspid aortic valve, connective tissue disorder, or family history of aortic dissections, degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm appears to be an indolent disease. Most American and European societies recommend yearly or biannual imaging of the thoracic aorta with computed tomographic (CT) imaging, magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging, and transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination. We aimed to identify the rate of progression and predictors of early degenerative aortic root dilatation (ARD) and ascending aortic dilatation (AAD) over a period of 10 years based on echocardiographic measurements.

A retrospective chart analysis was performed on 340 patients (mean age 67.4 ± 11.6 years; 85.6% men; 83.8% White) with known ARD and AAD. Aortic root and ascending aorta measurements were followed by serial echocardiograms from the time of the first diagnosis for a total of 10 years. During this time, the mean change in ARD was 0.28 ± 0.71 mm and AAD was 0.15 ± 0.18 mm. On multivariate regression after adjusting for baseline demographics, risk factors, and medication use, there was no statistically significant increase in their unit change in mean ARD or AAD. In conclusion, mild to moderate degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm has a minimal change in dimensions over time, and guidelines recommending yearly surveillance imaging of ARD and AAD need to be revisited to allow a more liberal follow-up interval.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^116gpirY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

We conducted a single‐center retrospective cohort study on patients with CTA imaging of the thorax, obtained between January 2006 and April 2023. This retrospective analysis was performed as part of an Institutional Review Board–approved study (HUM00133798), and informed consent has been waived. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Patients were identified using an electronic medical record search tool.

We included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with a medical record diagnosis and imaging confirmation of ascending aortic dilation or aneurysm, defined as a maximal ascending aortic diameter of ≥ 40 mm or an aortic size index of ≥ 2.1 cm/m² body surface area to ensure capture of patients with smaller body size and aortic dilation. Patients were also only included if they had availability of ≥ 2 ECG‐gated CTAs before an end point (i.e. ascending aorta repair, TAAD, or death) and a minimum imaging interval of ≥ 2 years to allow for the detection of slow growth.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) known HTAD (syndromic or nonsyndromic with identified pathogenic mutation); (2) thick CT slices (> 2 mm); (3) significant motion artifact in the ascending aorta preventing clear delineation of the aortic wall; (4) insufficient aortic luminal enhancement (< 200 Hounsfield units); (5) known infectious or inflammatory conditions of the thoracic aorta (e.g. aortitis); and (6) prior surgical intervention on the thoracic aorta (open or endovascular).

### Isolated ascending aorta dilatation is associated with increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113cuh8K]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a progressive condition with an increased risk of aortic dissection and mortality. In this study, our results indicate that 2D-TTE imaging is comparable to CT methodology for measuring and estimating ascending aorta diameters during routine echocardiographic examination. Routine 2D-TTE procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and supplemental tests, evaluation of end organ damage (e.g. hypertension, diabetes mellitus), evaluation of cardiac and aortic structure and function (e.g. left atrial appendage, left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, prosthetic heart valves, paravalvular abscesses, patients on ventilators, or with chest wall injuries), intraoperative TTE, guidance of transcatheter procedures (e.g. septal defect closure, or atrial appendage obliteration, transcatheter valve procedures), and critically ill patients. In addition, we show that patients aged over 75, primarily non-smokers, without known valvular diseases or hemodynamic compromise, but with increased proximal (tubular) ascending aorta (D diameter) during routine echocardiographic measurements, may present with silent AAA.

In fact, an increased proximal (tubular) ascending aorta (D diameter) represents an independent predictor of a silent AAA with a threshold of ≥ 33 mm or ≥ 19 mm/m². We hypothesized that in larger prospective studies, the B diameter can also become significantly dilated. Conversely, the fibrous portion of the A and C diameters can mask progression of the dilatation in those areas.

### Discrepancies in measurement of the thoracic aorta: JACC review topic of the week [^111ZeqXm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Clinicians often encounter discrepant measurements of the ascending aorta that impede, complicate, and impair appropriate clinical assessment, including key issues of presence or absence of aortic growth, rate of growth, and need for surgical intervention. These discrepancies may arise within a single modality (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or echocardiography) or between modalities. The authors explore the origins and significance of these discrepancies, revealing that some "truth" usually underlies all the discrepant measurements, which individually look at the ascending aorta with different perspectives and dimensional definitions. The authors conclude with a practical "question and answer" section that addresses common specific issues in interpretation and management of patients in the real-world setting.

### Sex-related differences in the clinical course of aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysms: The DisSEXion Study [^115ZsR31]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Overall survival from diagnosis was compared with the matched general population for males and females with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm, and for non-elderly and elderly with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. Relative survival is presented at 15 years, constituting the survival of the patients as a proportion of that expected in an age-, sex-, and origin-matched general population.

Model coefficients of the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model for all-cause mortality and surgical intervention after diagnosis were evaluated.

- **Aneurysm growth and aortic syndromes**: During a median imaging follow-up of 2.6 years (IQR: 0.5–6.3) before intervention, 7816 studies with measurements of the sinus of Valsalva (SoV) and/or tubular ascending aorta were conducted (TTE: 3918, CT: 2678, and MRI: 1220). The mean number of measurements per patient was 4.2 (median: 3.0, range: 1.0–31.0), with cumulative imaging follow-up of 6470 patient-years. The imaging modality used (CT, TTE, and MRI) did not explain additional variation.

- **Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm growth**: Absolute SoV growth was 0.08 mm/year (-0.07 to 0.24) for females and 0.22 mm/year (0.17–0.27) for males. Females exhibited slower SoV growth during the first time period after diagnosis compared with males while correcting for covariates (P = .005). After indexing for patient height, SoV growth for females was comparable to males (P = .559). The effect plot of SoV growth at ages 50 and 70 years in females and males is represented in Figure 2.

### Symptoms plus family history trump size in thoracic aortic aneurysm [^113mHQrs]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old woman presented with chest pain of unclear cause. The patient's mother and brother had suffered aortic dissection. Echocardiography had shown mild dilatation of the ascending aorta at 4.0 cm. Echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging were negative for dissection. The patient was taken to the operating room due to her painful symptoms and her family history. Unexpectedly, a localized dissection was found in the ascending aorta, which was too small for imaging detection. Without preemptive surgery, a full-fledged dissection would have likely occurred, with attendant short- and long-term consequences. This case emphasizes that size criteria pertain to asymptomatic patients, and symptomatic patients with aneurysm require resection regardless of size.

### Aortopathies: Etiologies, genetics, differential diagnosis, prognosis and management [^115ZBuYm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aortic root and ascending aortic dilatation are indicators associated with the risk of aortic dissection, which varies according to underlying etiologic associations, indexed aortic root size, and rate of progression. Typical aortic involvement is most commonly seen in syndromic cases, for which there is increasing evidence that aortic aneurysm represents a spectrum of familial inheritance associated with variable genetic penetrance and phenotypic expression. Aortic root and ascending aortic dimensions should be measured routinely with echocardiography. Pharmacologic therapy may reduce the rate of progression. The timing of surgical intervention is guided by indexed aortic size and the rate of change of aortic root and ascending aorta dimensions. Lifelong surveillance is recommended.
