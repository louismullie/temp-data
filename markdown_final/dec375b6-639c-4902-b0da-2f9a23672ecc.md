## Question

Is clopidogrel appropriate for secondary prevention following a hemorrhagic stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clopidogrel is appropriate for secondary prevention after a hemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral hemorrhage, ICH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the population and the specific question (post-ICH survivors considering antiplatelet therapy). Then, I should verify the direct randomized evidence (RESTART) and what it truly tells us. Next, I will review guideline positions and their nuances. After that, I need to check clopidogrel-specific considerations, timing, and risk stratification by ICH characteristics. I will then consider indirect evidence from ischemic stroke trials (for context but not overgeneralize), and finally synthesize a careful, risk-stratified recommendation with safety and monitoring in mind.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. We are dealing with secondary prevention after spontaneous ICH, where the competing risks are recurrent hemorrhage versus future ischemic events such as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death; survivors of ICH face meaningful rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, so the balance is delicate and must be individualized [^112nD1yt] [^111QAfiz].

> I will now examine the randomized evidence specific to this question. The RESTART trial randomized 537 ICH survivors who had been on antithrombotics pre-ICH to either restart antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel, chosen by the physician) or avoid it, at a median of 76 days post-ICH; importantly, the primary outcome of recurrent symptomatic ICH was not increased and numerically favored restarting (4% vs 9%; HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03), though the trial was underpowered and the result did not reach conventional statistical significance; extended follow-up continued to show no excess in recurrent ICH with antiplatelet resumption [^114XAokc] [^112aW6MH].

> Hold on, let me verify the scope of RESTART with respect to clopidogrel specifically. The intervention was "antiplatelet therapy" as a class with physician's choice of agent, and the trial did not have statistical power to isolate clopidogrel's effect versus other antiplatelets; this means any inference about clopidogrel is indirect, though the class signal for safety regarding ICH recurrence appears reassuring under the trial conditions and timing of restart [^114XAokc] [^117Ce6sf].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Wait, I recall that contemporary guidelines generally allow consideration of antiplatelet resumption after ICH when the ischemic indication is compelling and hemorrhagic risk is acceptable, but the provided snippet emphasizes blood pressure control for recurrence prevention and does not specify antiplatelet recommendations; given the limited excerpt, I should not overstate guideline endorsement and will emphasize shared decision-making and strict BP control as foundational [^111QAfiz].

> Let me consider indirect evidence and avoid over-generalization. Trials in minor ischemic stroke/TIA (CHANCE, POINT) show that adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduces early ischemic events but increases major bleeding risk in broader settings; however, these populations differ from post-ICH survivors, so their bleeding estimates cannot be directly transplanted to ICH, reinforcing that if used post-ICH, antiplatelet therapy should be monotherapy and timed carefully rather than dual therapy by default [^112b9eR4] [^115izYWJ] [^111zEk61].

> Now, I need to ensure timing and anatomical risk are addressed. RESTART's median restart time was about 11 weeks post-ICH, suggesting that waiting at least 4–8 weeks (often closer to 6–12 weeks) is prudent, especially to allow hematoma stabilization; recurrent risk considerations should account for ICH location (lobar vs deep), suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy markers, and meticulous long-term blood pressure control, all of which can shift the risk-benefit calculus for restarting any antiplatelet agent [^114XAokc] [^111QAfiz].

> I should confirm clopidogrel-specific practical considerations. If antiplatelet therapy is indicated after ICH and aspirin is contraindicated or not tolerated, clopidogrel 75 mg daily is a standard monotherapy dose for secondary prevention in atherosclerotic disease; pharmacologically, clopidogrel offers P2Y12 inhibition and may have lower gastrointestinal bleeding than aspirin, but interindividual variability and irreversibility must be weighed, and there is no head-to-head post-ICH evidence favoring clopidogrel over aspirin for hemorrhagic safety or ischemic efficacy [^115Txbw1] [^114XAokc].

> But wait, I should double-check the stance on dual antiplatelet therapy after ICH. RESTART primarily involved monotherapy and explicitly leaves dual antiplatelet effects uncertain; independent chronic stroke data such as SPS3 showed no ischemic benefit and more major hemorrhage with aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone, so after ICH, dual therapy should generally be avoided unless a compelling short-term cardiac indication exists and a multidisciplinary team agrees on the shortest feasible duration [^117Ce6sf] [^115Pac7T].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified answer. Clopidogrel is not routinely appropriate for all ICH survivors; however, in selected patients with a clear, compelling ischemic indication (e.g., symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, prior ischemic events, or required antiplatelet monotherapy after a coronary intervention once any necessary dual therapy has ended), clopidogrel monotherapy started at least 1–2 months after ICH, with strict blood pressure control and careful assessment of hemorrhagic phenotype (preferably nonlobar, no strong CAA markers), is a reasonable option, acknowledging that the supporting randomized evidence is class-based and underpowered for agent-specific conclusions [^114XAokc] [^112aW6MH] [^111QAfiz].

> I should confirm the overall strength of evidence and communicate uncertainty. The net take-away from RESTART and systematic reviews is that restarting an antiplatelet agent after ICH did not increase recurrent ICH and may reduce it, but confidence intervals are wide and the trial was underpowered; thus, the certainty is moderate for safety at best and low for agent-specific comparative effects, warranting shared decision-making that weighs individual ischemic threats against hemorrhagic risk [^114XAokc] [^112aW6MH] [^112nD1yt].

> Finally, I need to outline practical safeguards. If proceeding with clopidogrel monotherapy post-ICH, I would reassess hemorrhagic risk factors (ICH location, microbleed burden if available), ensure durable BP control, time initiation no earlier than several weeks post-ICH consistent with RESTART's practice, avoid concurrent dual antiplatelet therapy unless absolutely necessary, and monitor closely for bleeding or neurological change; this cautious, stepwise approach aligns with the available randomized data and guideline emphasis on risk modification and individualized care [^114XAokc] [^111QAfiz].

Clopidogrel is **not routinely recommended after hemorrhagic stroke** due to the risk of recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The RESTART trial [^114XAokc] showed that restarting antiplatelet therapy (including clopidogrel) did not significantly increase recurrent ICH, but the trial was underpowered and not specific to clopidogrel [^117Ce6sf]. Current guidelines prioritize blood pressure control and risk factor management; **antiplatelets are only considered if there is a compelling ischemic indication** (e.g. coronary stent) and after careful risk–benefit assessment [^111QAfiz]. If antiplatelets are used, monotherapy is preferred, and dual therapy should be avoided due to higher bleeding risk [^115Pac7T].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

Evidence from clinical trials includes the **RESTART trial** [^114XAokc], a randomized study of 537 survivors of spontaneous ICH previously on antithrombotic therapy that compared restarting antiplatelets (aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel) with avoidance; at a median 2-year follow-up, recurrent ICH occurred in 4% with antiplatelets vs 9% without (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25–1.03), although the trial was underpowered and not specific to clopidogrel [^112aW6MH]. The **SPS3 trial** [^115Pac7T], in patients with recent lacunar infarcts, found that dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) nearly doubled the risk of major hemorrhage (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.41–2.71) without significantly reducing recurrent stroke, highlighting bleeding risk with clopidogrel-containing regimens.

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guideline recommendations emphasize strict blood pressure control for secondary prevention after spontaneous ICH; antiplatelet therapy is not routinely recommended and should be individualized based on ischemic and bleeding risk per the **AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines** [^111QAfiz]. The **RESTART trial** [^114XAokc] suggests antiplatelets may not markedly increase recurrent ICH; however, the evidence is limited and not specific to clopidogrel, so decisions should be individualized.

---

## Risks and benefits of clopidogrel therapy

Balancing the **benefits** — reduced ischemic events in high-risk cardiovascular patients — against the **risks** — increased bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in those with prior hemorrhagic stroke — is essential in ICH survivors.

---

## Patient populations where clopidogrel may be considered

Clopidogrel may be considered for patients with **compelling ischemic indications** — such as coronary stents — after careful risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^111QAfiz]. It may also be reasonable as monotherapy in selected patients with **high ischemic risk and low bleeding risk**, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^112zLouk].

---

## Alternative antiplatelet therapies

Alternative antiplatelet options include **aspirin**, commonly used for secondary prevention after ischemic stroke but not routinely recommended after hemorrhagic stroke because of bleeding risk [^111QAfiz], and **cilostazol**, which may reduce ischemic events with lower bleeding risk than aspirin or clopidogrel [^113KKVrF]; however, evidence is limited and use is region-specific [^111EeV9s].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Blood pressure control**: Strict blood pressure control is essential to reduce recurrent hemorrhagic stroke risk [^111QAfiz].

- **Regular monitoring**: Patients on clopidogrel require regular monitoring for bleeding complications and adherence to therapy.

- **Individualized decision-making**: Decisions should consider patient-specific factors, including ischemic and bleeding risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^112zLouk].

---

Clopidogrel is **not routinely recommended** for secondary prevention after hemorrhagic stroke due to bleeding risk [^111QAfiz]. It may be considered in selected patients with compelling ischemic indications, but decisions should be individualized and based on careful risk–benefit assessment [^112nD1yt].

### Net clinical benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K antagonists are unsuitable [^113xke3X]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy reduces stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increases the risk of hemorrhage. The objective of this study is to quantify the net benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy, considering the differences in clinical significance between ischemic and hemorrhagic events.

- **Design**: An observational cohort study assigns relative weighting of events and includes a post hoc analysis of randomized trial data to assess the net benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) clinical trials.

- **Setting**: Global randomized clinical trial.

- **Patients**: A total of 10,041 patients with AF were involved, 7,554 of whom were not candidates for warfarin therapy.

- **Measurements**: Ischemic events (ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction) and hemorrhagic events (hemorrhagic stroke or subdural or extracranial bleeding) were weighted by the hazard ratio for death (or death or disability) after an event relative to death (or death or disability) after ischemic stroke. The net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE A trial participants was defined as the sum of weighted event incidence with dual antiplatelet therapy subtracted from the sum of weighted event incidence on control treatment, expressed as ischemic stroke equivalents prevented per 100 patient-years.

- **Results**: Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy prevented 0.57 ischemic stroke equivalent (95% CI, -0.12 to 1.24) per 100 patient-years of treatment when weighted by the hazard for death after ischemia or hemorrhage and 0.67 ischemic stroke equivalent.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^117Ce6sf]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

RESTART has some limitations. We intended to recruit 720 participants and follow them up for 2 years, but we recruited only 537 people (75% of our target). Investigators managed to recruit only one in 12 eligible patients; the remainder were not randomised because 28% of patients were too unwell when approached, 26% of patients' physicians were certain about whether or not to use antiplatelet therapy, 9% of patients declined, 7% of patients were started on oral anticoagulation, and 30% were not recruited for other reasons. Because of slow recruitment, we did a stepped wedge cluster randomised study within this trial at 72 of the sites to investigate whether stroke audit data extracts could boost recruitment; however, this strategy was not successful.

As in many other randomised trials of intracerebral haemorrhage, most participants were male, which might be because of their propensity to be invited or consent rather than differences in incidence or outcome of intracerebral haemorrhage compared with women. Although we did not mask the assigned treatment to participants and physicians, the outcomes were objective and adjudicated masked to treatment allocation, which minimises bias. Antiplatelet regimens used were mostly monotherapy, so the effects of dual antiplatelet therapy remain uncertain. Adherence to the allocated treatment declined over time but was more than 80% even after 4 years of follow-up. Although the sample size was smaller than intended and multiple statistical comparisons were done, we prespecified our primary outcome and main hypothesis, and regarded analyses.

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^113rUccr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, when added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke. A Markov model decision tree was employed to examine lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients treated with either aspirin or clopidogrel, or with additional cilostazol at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. The cohorts were followed until all patients died from competing risks or ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

- **Methods and results**: Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was used to model 10,000 cohorts of 10,000 patients. The addition of cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel was found to be strongly cost-saving. In all 10,000 simulations, the cilostazol strategy resulted in lower healthcare costs compared with aspirin or clopidogrel alone (mean $13,488 cost savings per patient; SD, $8,087) and resulted in higher QALYs (mean, 0.585 more QALYs per patient lifetime; SD, 0.290). This result remained robust across a variety of sensitivity analyses, varying cost inputs, and treatment effects.

- **Conclusions**: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the average net monetary benefit from the addition of cilostazol was $42,743 per patient over their lifetime. Based on the best available data, the addition of cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention following noncardioembolic stroke results in significantly reduced healthcare costs and a gain in lifetime QALYs.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke and high-risk TIA [^115izYWJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Combination antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may reduce the rate of recurrent stroke during the first three months following a minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). A trial of combination antiplatelet therapy in a Chinese population has shown a reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke. We tested this combination in an international population.

- **Methods**: In a randomized trial, we assigned patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to receive either clopidogrel at a loading dose of 600 mg on day one, followed by 75 mg per day, plus aspirin (at a dose of 50 to 325 mg per day) or the same range of doses of aspirin alone. The dose of aspirin in each group was selected by the site investigator. The primary efficacy outcome in a time-to-event analysis was the risk of a composite of major ischemic events, which was defined as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from an ischemic vascular event, at 90 days.

- **Results**: A total of 4,881 patients were enrolled at 269 international sites. The trial was halted after 84% of the anticipated number of patients had been enrolled because the data and safety monitoring board determined that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was associated with both a lower risk of major ischemic events and a higher risk of major hemorrhage than aspirin alone at 90 days. Major ischemic events occurred in 121 of 2,432 patients (5.0%) receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin and in 160 of 2,449 patients (6.5%) receiving aspirin plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to…).

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke caused by intracerebral hemorrhage: Extended follow-up of the RESTART randomized clinical trial [^112aW6MH]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

We recorded serious adverse events (that were neither an outcome event nor an expected complication of stroke) via investigators if they occurred before hospital discharge or via primary care practitioners' annual reports of hospital admissions. Investigators reported protocol deviations and violations to the trial coordinating center and the sponsor.

Monitoring included central statistical monitoring of trial conduct, data quality, and participant safety, supplemented by triggered onsite monitoring visits if required, and detailed source data verification at the trial coordinating center. We conducted completeness, range, consistency, validation, and logic checks on all baseline and outcome data from the web-based case report forms.

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was fatal or nonfatal, radiologically or pathologically proven, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), assessed in all participants (except 1 participant who withdrew before the first follow-up). The secondary outcomes of major hemorrhagic events and major occlusive vascular events were prespecified. In the protocol, we had specified a composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events defined by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke [ischemic, hemorrhagic, or uncertain cause], or death from a vascular cause). The process of outcome adjudication was described in the main report.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in minor stroke or transient ischemic attack with intracranial artery stenosis: A post hoc analysis of CHANCE-2 [^1127pixL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The outcome measure focused on the efficacy primary outcome, which was a new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 90 days. Secondary efficacy outcomes included: a new ischemic stroke within 90 days; a new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within 30 days; a vascular event (comprising stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, and vascular death); a disabling stroke (with modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≥ 2) within 90 days; and ordinal severity of stroke or TIA within 90 days. The severity was measured by a 6-level scale, including subsequent stroke or TIA events and the mRS score at 3 months as follows: fatal stroke (stroke with subsequent score on the mRS of 6), severe stroke (with mRS score 4 or 5), moderate stroke (with mRS score 2 or 3), mild stroke (with mRS score 0 or 1), TIA, and no stroke or TIA.

The primary safety outcome was severe or moderate bleeding, defined according to the GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) criteria at 90 days. Secondary safety outcomes included any bleeding, mild bleeding, and death through 90 days of follow-up. An independent clinical-event adjudication committee, blind to trial group assignments, confirmed all reported efficacy and safety outcomes based on available medical records, including imaging.

### Antithrombotics for secondary prevention of noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke [^111wb8pa]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is more effective than anticoagulation for the prevention of noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke. The choice of antiplatelet regimen, however, remains contentious. Recent controversies regarding aspirin resistance and the optimal dosing of aspirin, as well as the recognition of the variable bioactivation of clopidogrel, have added further confusion to the debate.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) recently released their third joint guideline in the past five years on secondary stroke prevention. The European Stroke Organisation has published three guidelines on this issue since 2000. These frequent updates have been necessary because of rapidly accumulating data from clinical trials.

Careful consideration of the sometimes confusing trial results reveals that the 2011 AHA-ASA guidelines are correct in no longer specifying a "preferred" antiplatelet regimen from among the choices recently studied. This recommendation does not, however, mean that all antiplatelet regimens should be considered equal. This review discusses the various antiplatelet regimens and the trials that led to the rapid evolution of the guidelines for secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138itBT]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Minor ischaemic strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) put patients at risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including devastating major strokes. Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that patients who experience minor ischaemic strokes or TIAs benefit from antiplatelet therapy. Consequently, guidelines for the management of acute ischaemic stroke and TIA recommend antiplatelet therapy — typically providing strong recommendations for the use of a single agent, most commonly aspirin. One guideline provides a weak recommendation for clopidogrel and aspirin therapy, initiated within 24 hours of a patient presenting with a minor stroke or TIA, and continuing for 21 days.

Several trials have tested the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone to prevent recurrent events in patients experiencing non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA in both the acute phase and the chronic phase. The Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial reported that adding clopidogrel to aspirin, starting within 24 hours of a minor stroke or TIA and continuing for 21 days, reduced stroke risk without increasing the risk of moderate or severe haemorrhage at three and 12 months.

Despite findings from the CHANCE trial, many guideline recommendations persisted in recommending single rather than dual agent therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin for the initial treatment of minor ischaemic stroke or TIA. Rationales provided by guideline authors for not recommending routine dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with this condition were not fully addressed.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^111osetq]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Investigators supplied complete information about participants' demographics, comorbidities, functional status, previous antithrombotic therapy, intracerebral haemorrhage, and their preferred antiplatelet therapy into a database via a secure web interface with in-built validation to ensure complete baseline data before randomisation. A central computerised randomisation system incorporating a minimisation algorithm randomly assigned participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy. The algorithm randomly allocated the first participant with a probability of 0.5 to one group of the trial. Thereafter, adaptive stratification (i.e. minimisation) allocated each subsequent participant with a probability of 0.8 to the group that minimised differences between the two groups of the trial with respect to five baseline variables: qualifying intracerebral haemorrhage location (lobar vs non-lobar); time since symptom onset (1–6 days, 7–30 days, > 30 days); antiplatelet therapy preferred by the patient's physician if allocated to start (aspirin alone vs. other antiplatelet therapy); participant age at randomisation (< 70 years vs. ≥ 70 years); and predicted probability of being alive and independent at 6 months (< 0.15 vs. ≥ 0.15). The five variables were weighted equally, and the weights were constant over the duration of recruitment. The web interface displayed each participant's unique study identification number and their allocation to either starting or avoiding antiplatelet therapy, which was also sent in an email to all investigators at the hospital site.

### Clopidogrel with aspirin in acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHANCE) trial: One-year outcomes [^113F5Uq6]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

The Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial indicated that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin reduces the 90-day risk of stroke without increasing hemorrhage compared to aspirin alone. However, it provided insufficient data to determine if the benefit persists beyond the trial period. This report presents the one-year follow-up outcomes of the trial.

- **Methods and results**: The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted across 114 centers in China. A total of 5,170 patients were randomized within 24 hours after the onset of minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack to receive clopidogrel-aspirin therapy (a loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel on day 1, followed by 75 mg of clopidogrel daily for 90 days, plus 75 mg of aspirin daily for the first 21 days) or aspirin alone (75 mg/d for 90 days). The primary outcome was any stroke event (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during the one-year follow-up. Outcome differences between groups were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Stroke occurred in 275 (10.6%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, compared to 362 (14.0%) patients in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.93; P = 0.006). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in 7 (0.3%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in 9 (0.4%) patients in the aspirin group (P = 0.44).

The early benefit of clopidogrel-aspirin treatment in reducing the risk of subsequent stroke persisted.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^113wnj3Z]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, indicated for the prevention of ischemic stroke and in-stent thrombosis. However, it has several drawbacks including an increased risk of hemorrhage, a clinical effect that is slow in onset and irreversible, genetically determined variability in its clinical potency, and interactions with other commonly administered drugs.

### Comparison between aspirin and clopidogrel in secondary stroke prevention based on real-world data [^117EfEWD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapies on all‐cause death:

Before the propensity score matching (PSM), 1416 patients died during the 12‐month follow‐up period, with 967 deaths in the aspirin group and 449 in the clopidogrel group (Table 2). The difference in hazard ratio (HR) of death was significant in favor of aspirin (clopidogrel to aspirin HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.91–2.39, P < 0.001). This difference remained significant after PSM adjustments using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The 12‐month mortality in the clopidogrel group (5.62%) was 1.3-fold higher than in the aspirin group (4.69%), even after adjusting for potential biases associated with 17 common confounding factors (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.07–1.58, P = 0.008, Table 2 and Figure 2B).

Mortality rates during the first 90 days did not differ between the groups. However, significantly higher mortality was observed in the clopidogrel group compared to the aspirin group during months 4 to 12 (adjusted clopidogrel to aspirin HR = 1.36, P = 0.026) (Table 2). The higher mortality rate in the clopidogrel group could not be attributed to a higher re-stroke rate, as no difference was observed between the groups.

### Integrated care for optimizing the management of stroke and associated heart disease: A position paper of the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke [^117CAohK]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is a standard and guideline-recommended approach for the use of antiplatelet drugs in secondary stroke prevention for non-cardioembolic stroke, typically involving aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor. The combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was recommended previously but has fallen out of favor after the prevention regimen for the effectively avoiding second strokes trial demonstrated no difference compared to clopidogrel for ischemic stroke outcomes and a significantly higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage and discontinuation due to headaches. Aspirin doses recommended range from 50 to 325 mg daily, but most practitioners prefer a lower dose since there is no significant efficacy difference between lower and higher doses, and higher doses are associated with more gastrointestinal side effects.

The combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticagrelor versus aspirin alone was evaluated in three large, relatively recent randomized clinical trials. The first was the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial, which assessed the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin for 21 days following a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel, followed by clopidogrel monotherapy up to day 90 versus aspirin alone. This trial involved a Chinese population with mild stroke [National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) < 3] or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) with an ABCD2 score ≥ 4. The early combination therapy group experienced significantly fewer primary outcome events without an increased risk of major or severe bleeding.

### Is the benefit of antithrombotics and statins worth the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage? It depends [^115GPQAA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Antithrombotics, such as antiplatelets and anticoagulants, and statins are often prescribed for primary or secondary vascular prevention. From a clinical perspective, practitioners often weigh the risk of bleeding, which is traditionally associated with antithrombotics, against their potential benefit. Such benefit/risk considerations have driven randomized clinical trials investigating the role of aspirin in primary or secondary vascular prevention among specific populations at risk.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is perhaps one of the most feared side effects of antithrombotic use because of its high risk of mortality and morbidity. Although the initial publication of results from the SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels) trial suggested that the risk of ICH associated with statins among patients with noncardioembolic stroke was a concern, subsequent analyses from the SPARCL trial and other population-based and hospital studies reassuringly showed that statins do not increase the risk of ICH.

### Trends in dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients noneligible for POINT/CHANCE trial treatment [^1176HMk8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Recent clinical trials have established the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (DAPT-AC) in early-presenting patients with minor ischemic stroke. However, the impact of these trials over time on the use and outcomes of DAPT-AC among patients with nonminor or late-presenting stroke who do not meet the eligibility criteria of these trials has not been delineated.

- **Methods and results**: In a multicenter stroke registry, this study examined yearly changes from April 2008 to August 2022 in DAPT-AC use for stroke patients ineligible for CHANCE/POINT (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events/Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) clinical trials due to a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale > 4 or late arrival beyond 24 hours of onset. A total of 32,118 patients (age, 68.1 ± 13.1 years; male, 58.5%) with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 4 (interquartile range, 1–7) were analyzed. In 2008, DAPT-AC was used in 33.0%, other antiplatelets in 62.7%, and no antiplatelet in 4.3%. The frequency of DAPT-AC remained relatively unchanged through 2013, when the CHANCE trial was published, and then increased steadily, reaching 78% in 2022. Meanwhile, other antiplatelet use decreased to 17.8% in 2022 (P trend < 0.001). From 2011 to 2022, clinical outcomes nonsignificantly improved, with an average relative risk reduction of 2% per year for the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality, both among patients treated with DAPT-AC and those treated with other antiplatelets.

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^113n7eL4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention. In both our base‐case model and across most sensitivity analyses, the addition of cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel was both cost-saving and led to a gain in QALYs. In the base model, cilostazol resulted in an average cost saving of $12,848 and a gain of 0.6 QALYs per patient. The pronounced cost-saving of cilostazol results from its relatively low annual cost ($109 per patient per year) compared with the cost of hospitalization for recurrent stroke and the long‐term health care costs associated with neurological disability from recurrent stroke.

Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that cilostazol would have remained cost-effective even if the assumptions of our input parameters were incorrect. For example, cilostazol remained cost-effective in a model where all patients were disabled at baseline (30% of patients with an mRS score of 1–2 and 70% with an mRS score of 3–5). In reality, the proportion of disabled patients is much lower; 40% of participants in the POINT study and 75% of stroke survivors in an international prospective cohort study had an mRS score > 0. This indicates that cilostazol would be cost-effective when used in almost all secondary prevention situations because cost savings of cilostazol are smallest among patients with disability. Our results are also robust against a wide range of effects on hemorrhage. In our base model, we assumed similar bleeding risks with and without cilostazol, consistent with previous studies.

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^113vjRBu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

A Markov model decision tree was used to compare the estimated lifetime costs and QALYs of patients with noncardioembolic stroke treated with monotherapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) to those treated with dual therapy (cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel). The monotherapy strategy comprised a mixture of patients treated with aspirin or clopidogrel, with the base case set at 41% aspirin as in the CSPS.com (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study for Antiplatelet Combination) study, with other proportions examined in a sensitivity analysis. Half-cycle corrections were applied for all analyses. A cycle length of one year, a US payer/Medicare perspective, and a discount rate of 3% (as per convention for cost-effectiveness analysis in the United States) applied to both costs and benefits. Analyses were conducted using Amua (Amua_0.3.0, Boston, MA). The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. As all data used for modeling were obtained from the literature, no institutional review board approval was sought for this project.

We used a Monte Carlo simulation to model cohorts of 10,000 patients. Cohorts were followed until all patients died, either from competing risks or ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Four health states were defined for patients in the cohorts: (1) neurologically intact, defined as a score of 0 on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS); (2) mild disability (score of 1–2 on the mRS); (3) moderate to severe disability (score of 3–5 on the mRS); and (4) deceased.

### Novel antiplatelet therapies for atherothrombotic diseases [^114kpAxX]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Low credibility.

The role of clopidogrel in the treatment of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) has been recently investigated. The CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned patients with small ischemic strokes or high-risk TIA to a combination of clopidogrel and aspirin or aspirin alone for 90 days. The study, conducted in a Chinese population, demonstrated a reduction in stroke with combination therapy (8.2% versus 11.7%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.81; p < 0.001) without an increased risk of moderate or severe hemorrhage. Recently, the POINT trial (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) tested this hypothesis in an international population and confirmed a reduction in major ischemic strokes (5.0% versus 6.5%; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.95; p = 0.02) but demonstrated an increase in major hemorrhage with combination therapy (0.9% versus 0.4%; HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.10–4.87; p = 0.02).

### Dual antiplatelet therapy using cilostazol for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk ischaemic stroke in Japan: a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113KKVrF]. The Lancet Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Although dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel reduces early recurrence of ischaemic stroke, long-term use of this therapy is no longer effective, and the risk of bleeding increases. Given that cilostazol prevents stroke recurrence without increasing the incidence of serious bleeding compared to aspirin, this study aimed to establish whether dual antiplatelet therapy involving cilostazol is safe and appropriate for long-term use.

- **Methods**: In a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial across 292 hospitals in Japan, patients with high-risk non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke identified on MRI were randomly assigned to two groups in a 1:1 ratio. They received either monotherapy with oral aspirin (81 or 100 mg, once per day) or clopidogrel (50 or 75 mg, once per day) alone, or a combination of cilostazol (100 mg, twice per day) with aspirin or clopidogrel. Randomisation was done centrally using block randomisation with a block size of six per each participating hospital through a web-based registration system by EPS Corporation. Patients required at least 50% stenosis of a major intracranial or extracranial artery or two or more vascular risk factors. Trial medication was continued for a minimum of half a year, up to a maximum of 3.5 years. The primary efficacy outcome was the rate of first recurrence of symptomatic ischaemic stroke. Safety outcomes included severe or life-threatening bleeding; any adverse events; serious adverse events; and any bleeding events. Efficacy analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

### Antithrombotic treatment after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage [^112nD1yt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

This is an update of the Cochrane Review last published in 2017. Survivors of stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) are at risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) treatments may lower the risk of ischaemic MACE after ICH, but they may increase the risk of bleeding.

- **Objectives**: To determine the overall effectiveness and safety of antithrombotic drugs on MACE and its components for people with ICH.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (5 October 2021). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL: the Cochrane Library 2021, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1948 to October 2021), and Embase Ovid (from 1980 to October 2021). The online registries of clinical trials searched were the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (5 October 2021). We screened the reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for additional, potentially relevant RCTs.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected RCTs in which participants with ICH of any age were allocated to a class of antithrombotic treatment as intervention or comparator.

- **Data collection and analysis**: In accordance with standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane, two review authors assessed each selected RCT for its risk of bias and extracted data independently. The primary outcome was a composite of MACE.

### Infarct on brain imaging, subsequent ischemic stroke, and clopidogrel-aspirin efficacy: A post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114oNc5Z]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

In the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial, acute treatment with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrent stroke. There may be specific patient groups who are more likely to benefit from this treatment.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether the association of clopidogrel-aspirin with stroke recurrence in patients with minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) is modified by the presence of infarct on imaging attributed to the index event (index imaging) among patients enrolled in the POINT Trial.

- **Design, Setting, and Participants**: In the POINT randomized clinical trial, patients with high-risk TIA and minor ischemic stroke were enrolled at 269 sites in 10 countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand from May 28, 2010, to December 19, 2017. In this post hoc analysis, patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had an acute infarct on index imaging. All POINT trial participants with information available on the presence or absence of acute infarct on index imaging were eligible for this study. Univariable Cox regression models evaluated associations between the presence of an infarct on index imaging and subsequent ischemic stroke, and assessed whether the presence of infarct on index imaging modified the association of clopidogrel-aspirin with subsequent ischemic stroke risk. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to May 2021.

- **Exposures**: Presence or absence of acute infarct on index imaging.

- **Main Outcomes and Measures**: The primary outcome…

### ASA failure: does the combination ASA/clopidogrel confer better long-term vascular protection [^115iZrKV]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

To assess whether adding clopidogrel to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has a long-term protective vascular effect in patients with lacunar stroke while taking ASA, a post hoc analysis of 838 patients with ASA failure and recent lacunar stroke from the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes Trial (SPS3) cohort was conducted. Patients were randomly allocated to aspirin (325 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke recurrence, including ischemic and intracranial hemorrhage, while the main safety outcome was major extracranial hemorrhage. Patients were followed for a mean period of 3.5 years.

The ASA failure group had a significantly higher risk of vascular events, including ischemic stroke, when compared with the non-ASA failure group (n = 2,151) in SPS3 (p = 0.03). The mean age was 65.6 years, and 65% were men. The risk of recurrent stroke was not reduced in the dual antiplatelet group, 3.1% per year, compared to the aspirin-only group, 3.3% per year (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61–1.37). There was also no difference between groups for ischemic stroke (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.59–1.38). The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher in the dual antiplatelet group (HR 2.7; 95% CI 1.1–6.9); however, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage was not different.

In conclusion, in patients with a recent lacunar stroke while taking ASA, the addition of clopidogrel did not result in the reduction of vascular events compared to continuing ASA only.

This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with recent lacunar stroke.

### Efficacy of clopidogrel for prevention of stroke based on allele status in the POINT trial [^113q21ER]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug that is metabolized to its active form by the CYP2C19 enzyme. The CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) found a significant interaction between loss-of-function allele status for the CYP2C19 gene and the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel on the rate of early restroke following acute transient ischemic attack/minor stroke. The POINT (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) trial, similar in design to CHANCE but conducted largely in North America and Europe, demonstrated a reduction in early restroke with dual antiplatelet therapy compared with aspirin alone. This substudy was conducted to evaluate a potential interaction between loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles and outcomes by treatment group in POINT.

- **Methods**: Of the 269 sites in 10 countries that enrolled patients in POINT, 134 sites participated in this substudy. DNA samples were genotyped for CYP2C19 ✱2, ✱3, and ✱17 alleles and classified as being carriers or noncarriers of loss-of-function alleles. Major ischemia was defined as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischemic vascular death.

- **Results**: Nine hundred thirty-two patients provided analyzable DNA. The rates of major ischemia were 6.7% for the aspirin group versus 2.3% for the dual antiplatelet therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.09–1.21]; P = 0.09) among carriers of loss-of-function alleles. The rates of major ischemia were 5.6% for the aspirin group versus 3.7% for the dual therapy group among noncarriers.

### Cilostazol for secondary prevention of stroke and cognitive decline: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111EeV9s]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Cilostazol's apparent greater benefit late after stroke could reflect several possible mechanisms. Weaker antiplatelet effects and hence inferior stroke prevention compared with aspirin or clopidogrel early after transient ischemic attack/stroke (when stronger antiplatelet activity may be more beneficial) is suggested by the neutral effect of cilostazol on ischemic stroke recurrence compared with aspirin or clopidogrel.

Increasing benefit of cilostazol late after stroke was also demonstrated in CASISP. The study found no difference in recurrent stroke between cilostazol and aspirin within six months of stroke but observed increasing benefit of cilostazol versus aspirin thereafter. The increased benefit of cilostazol later after stroke may indicate that its mechanisms of action are more relevant to lacunar stroke, where recurrence occurs late. This is supported by increased benefit in trials including more patients with lacunar stroke. Potential benefits for lacunar stroke include endothelial stabilization, improved myelin repair, and better astrocyte-to-neuronal energy supply, all of which may take some time to accrue.

The lower cerebral and systemic hemorrhage risks with cilostazol would also confer a benefit over other antiplatelet drugs, which typically have higher bleeding risk the longer they are given. This was a reason for the early stopping of the SPS3 Trial (dual versus single antiplatelet drugs) for lacunar stroke, as seen in the present meta-analysis even in the presence of other antiplatelet drugs.

### Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary prevention after noncardioembolic stroke [^114F8YVj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The mainstay of long-term medical management for patients with noncardioembolic stroke is antiplatelet therapy along with vascular risk factor reduction. In North America, aspirin and clopidogrel are the most commonly prescribed antiplatelets for long-term secondary stroke prevention. Cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, is used in combination with aspirin or clopidogrel in some Asian countries for stroke prevention but is rarely used for this purpose outside of Asia. A recent meta‐analysis found that cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for long-term secondary prevention was associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke without increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Cilostazol is believed to act through pleiotropic effects, including decreased cyclic AMP activation, which reduces platelet aggregation.

While multiple trials have studied the clinical effectiveness of cilostazol, research into the cost-effectiveness of cilostazol has been limited. Given its low cost, cilostazol has the potential to be a cost-effective treatment for secondary stroke prevention. A Japanese study from 2006 showed that cilostazol was cost-effective when used instead of aspirin for secondary stroke prevention at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥1.8 million per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY), which equals approximately $16,000 per QALY. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of cilostazol added to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke from a US payer/Medicare perspective.

### Comparison of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in addition to aspirin in patients with minor ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack: A network meta-analysis [^113TKGf4]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel and aspirin is effective in preventing re-strokes after minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). However, there is emerging evidence for the use of ticagrelor and aspirin, and the two DAPT regimens have not been compared directly.

The study's objective is to compare ticagrelor and aspirin with clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with acute minor ischemic stroke or TIA in the prevention of re-strokes or death.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane from database inception until February 2021.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials that enrolled adults with acute minor ischemic stroke or TIA and provided the mentioned interventions within 72 hours of symptom onset, with a minimum follow-up of 30 days.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: PRISMA guidelines for network meta-analyses were followed. Two reviewers independently extracted data and appraised risk of bias. Fixed-effects models were fit using a Bayesian approach to network meta-analysis. Between-group comparisons were estimated using hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs). Surface under the cumulative rank curve plots were produced.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was a composite of re-stroke or death up to 90 days. Secondary outcomes include major bleeding, mortality, adverse events, and functional disability. A sensitivity analysis was performed at 30 days for the primary outcome.

Results show that a total of 4014 citations were screened, and 5 randomized clinical trials were included. Data from 22,009 participants were examined to determine the effectiveness of the interventions.

### Long-term antiplatelet mono- and dual therapies after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: Network meta-analysis [^112KY8gr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The latest guidelines do not make clear recommendations on the selection of antiplatelet therapies for long-term secondary prevention of stroke. We aimed to integrate the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative efficacy and safety of long-term antiplatelet therapies after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare 11 antiplatelet therapies in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. In December 2014, we searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library database for trials. The search identified 24 randomized controlled trials including a total of 85,667 patients with antiplatelet treatments for at least 1 year. Cilostazol significantly reduced stroke recurrence in comparison with aspirin (odds ratio 0.66, 95% credible interval 0.44 to 0.92) and dipyridamole (odds ratio 0.57, 95% credible interval 0.34 to 0.95). Cilostazol also significantly reduced intracranial hemorrhage compared with aspirin, clopidogrel, terutroban, ticlopidine, aspirin plus clopidogrel, and aspirin plus dipyridamole. Aspirin plus clopidogrel could not significantly reduce stroke recurrence compared with monotherapies but caused significantly more major bleeding than all monotherapies except terutroban. The pooled estimates did not change materially in the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy outcome.

- **Conclusions**: Long-term monotherapy was a better choice than long-term dual therapy, and cilostazol had the best risk-benefit profile.

### Beyond RCTs: Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack [^116RkCmG]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in the secondary prevention of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of short-term DAPT in real-world settings, where treatment use is broader than in RCTs.

- **Methods**: READAPT (REAl-life study on short-term Dual Antiplatelet treatment in Patients with ischemic stroke or Transient ischemic attack) (NCT05476081) was an observational multicenter real-world study with a 90-day follow-up. We included patients aged 18 and older receiving short-term DAPT soon after ischemic stroke or TIA. While no stringent NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and ABCD2 score cut-offs were applied, adherence to guidelines was recommended. The primary effectiveness outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or death due to vascular causes, and the primary safety outcome was moderate-to-severe bleeding. Secondary outcomes included the type of ischemic and hemorrhagic events, disability, cause of death, and compliance with treatment.

- **Results**: We included 1920 patients, 69.9% of whom started DAPT after an ischemic stroke. Only 8.9% strictly followed the entry criteria or procedures of RCTs. The primary effectiveness outcome occurred in 3.9% of cases, and the primary safety outcome in 0.6%. In total, 3.3% of cerebrovascular ischemic recurrences occurred, 0.2% experienced intracerebral hemorrhages, and 2.7% had bleedings. Additionally, 0.2% of patients died due to vascular causes. Patients with an NIHSS score of ≤ 5 and those without acute lesions at neuroimaging had significantly higher primary effectiveness outcomes than their counterparts.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^114hMiPE]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

In summary, RESTART excluded all but a very modest increase in the risk of re-intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy, which seemed too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of major vascular events. Antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the recurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage. These findings provide reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy for similar patients in clinical practice. Ongoing randomised trials, their meta-analysis with RESTART, and an adequately powered definitive randomised trial should be done to strengthen the evidence.

### Rationale and design of a randomized, double-blind trial comparing the effects of a 3-month clopidogrel-aspirin regimen versus aspirin alone for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling cerebrovascular event [^1156Kg4C]. American Heart Journal (2010). High credibility.

Acute nondisabling cerebrovascular events are common and often portend a disabling stroke. Aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent to have been studied in patients presenting acutely with a cerebrovascular event, but the effect is modest and is reduced by a small increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Treatment with the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin might be beneficial when taken soon following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. The CHANCE trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to test an aggressive antiplatelet regimen in acute minor stroke or TIA.

- **Design**: The study will randomize 5,100 Chinese patients with acute TIA or minor stroke to receive a 3-month regimen of clopidogrel initiated with a loading dose of 300 mg followed by 75 mg/d, combined with aspirin 75 mg/d during the first 21 days, or a 3-month regimen of aspirin 75 mg/d alone. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients with any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage) at 3 months. Study visits will be performed on the day of randomization, at day 21, and at day 90.

- **Summary**: CHANCE will determine whether clopidogrel combined with aspirin can prevent more strokes after acute minor stroke or TIA compared with aspirin alone, with an acceptable risk profile.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hHnUc]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Two reviewers independently screened the title and abstract and full text levels of potentially eligible studies. A third team member reviewed all final decisions, and the team resolved disagreements through discussion. This process also applied to risk of bias ratings and extraction of key variables (e.g. numbers of events). When reports omitted data that we considered important, we contacted authors for clarification and additional information.

Two reviewers independently extracted several data using a predesigned data extraction form: characteristics of enrolled patient population, description of intervention and control, and description and event rate of patient-important outcomes. To determine the timeframe of any apparent benefit, we reviewed incidence curves presented in the primary studies.

To address risk of bias, we used a modified version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. We assessed the generation for random sequence; concealment for allocation sequence; blinding of participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, and outcome assessors or adjudicators, or both; and incomplete outcome data (missing or lost to follow-up). We judged low risk of bias if the rate of missing data was lower than 10% and considered other potential sources of bias (i.e. early trial discontinuation).

We rated the overall risk of bias for each study as the highest risk of bias for any criterion. We evaluated risk of bias on an outcome-by-outcome basis and noted any differences across outcomes.

### Antiplatelet therapy in ischemic stroke: variability in clinical trials and its impact on choosing the appropriate therapy [^116fJhvB]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is an integral component of effective secondary prevention after non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Numerous clinical trials have tested the efficacy and safety of different antiplatelet regimens, including aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel monotherapy, the combination of aspirin plus clopidogrel, and the combination of aspirin plus dipyridamole, in patients with a history of arterial ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Although competing head-to-head comparisons between aspirin plus dipyridamole and clopidogrel were not previously available, various professional societies have outlined evidence-based recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA. Based on these guidelines, many experts in the field implicitly assumed that aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole was the most effective antiplatelet treatment for stroke patients. However, these assumptions were called into question upon publication of the results from the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PRoFESS) trial. The results of PRoFESS thus highlight the pitfalls of making conclusions of relative therapy efficacy in the absence of head-to-head comparisons.

This article presents an overview of the factors that differ between clinical trials and "real-world" patient populations, as well as factors that differ among clinical trials themselves. The article also addresses the potential impact these differences may have on clinical trial results and subsequent clinical decision-making.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158CrVH]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Our primary analyses were based on the numbers of events in each intervention and control group. We used DerSimonian and Laird random effects models in RevMan 5.3 to conduct the meta-analyses. Study weights were generated using the inverse of the variance.

We present results as relative risks and associated 95% confidence intervals. The χ² test for heterogeneity and the I² statistic were used to assess heterogeneity between studies.

As the POINT study enrolled a diverse, multinational population who underwent contemporary stroke management, we applied the relative risks to the baseline risks from this trial to calculate absolute effects, such as a 6.4% risk for recurrent stroke.

- **Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage**: Authors used different terms to categorize symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage, symptomatic subdural haemorrhage, and symptomatic subarachnoid haemorrhage; we consider the functional consequences of these events sufficiently similar to include in a composite variable.

Considering that death from intracranial or extracranial bleeding, or from ischaemic stroke, are equally important, and that non-fatal haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke have a similar distribution of functional outcomes, we considered our key outcomes to be all-cause mortality, non-fatal stroke, and non-fatal serious bleeding.

Studies did not report outcomes exactly as we defined them. For instance, studies reported all-cause mortality and all ischaemic stroke (including fatal and non-fatal), so in effect double-counting ischaemic stroke mortality that contributes to both.

### Risk for major hemorrhages in patients receiving clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin alone after transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke: A secondary analysis of the POINT randomized clinical trial [^111zEk61]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Results show the short-term risk of hemorrhage when treating patients with acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone.

- **Objective**: To characterize the frequency and kinds of major hemorrhages in the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This secondary analysis of the POINT randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 10 countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia. It included patients with high-risk TIA or minor AIS who were randomized within 12 hours of symptom onset and followed up for 90 days. Total enrollment from May 28, 2010, through December 17, 2017, was 4881, constituting the intention-to-treat group. Of these, 4819 (98.7%) were included in the as-treated analysis. Primary safety analyses were as-treated, classifying patients based on the study drug actually received. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed as secondary analyses. Data were analyzed in April 2018.

- **Interventions**: Patients were assigned to receive clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 75 mg daily for days 2–90) or placebo. All patients also received open-label aspirin, 50 to 325 mg/d.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary safety outcome was all major hemorrhages. Other safety outcomes included minor hemorrhages.

A total of 269 sites worldwide randomized 4881 patients (median age, 65.0 years [interquartile range, 55–74 years]; 2195 women [45.0%]). The primary results have been analyzed to assess the comparative risk of hemorrhages associated with the treatment regimens.

### Antithrombotic dilemmas in stroke medicine: New data, unsolved challenges [^112zLouk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy is a key element of secondary prevention in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. However, its use in clinical practice is not always straightforward. This review provides an update on certain difficult scenarios in antithrombotic management, with a focus on recent clinical trials and large observational studies.

- **Indication considerations**: We discuss the approach to patients with an indication for antithrombotic treatment who also have clinical or radiological evidence of previous intracranial bleeding, patients with indications for both anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment, and patients in whom antithrombotic treatment fails to prevent stroke.

- **Timing and usage**: We also review the timing of anticoagulation initiation after cardioembolic stroke, and the use of antithrombotics in patients with asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease.

Despite a wealth of new evidence, numerous uncertainties remain, and we highlight ongoing trials addressing these issues.

### Comparison between aspirin and clopidogrel in secondary stroke prevention based on real-world data [^111Zy73y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In the TSR, 34,679 stroke patients on aspirin and 7,611 stroke patients on clopidogrel were identified. Before the PSM, the baseline characteristics, including confounding factors between groups, were not comparable. Compared with the aspirin group, the clopidogrel group had a higher proportion of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, certain stroke risk factors (except dyslipidemia, smoking, and alcohol use), and a modified Rankin Scale in the range of 3 to 5, but a lower proportion of patients with small vessel disease and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score < 5 upon discharge. To reduce biases caused by the uneven distribution of baseline features between groups, PSM was applied for further analysis. No significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups were noted after PSM. The total number of patients in each study group was 6,443.

- **Antiplatelet therapies on restroke**: There were 1,421 patients with restroke within 12 months of the previous stroke in the study population of 42,290 patients; 1,141 (3.29%) and 280 (3.68%) patients developed restroke during a 12-month follow-up period in the aspirin and clopidogrel groups, respectively, with no significant difference between groups (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.98–1.27, P = 0.094). In the propensity-score-matched pairs (N = 6,443, in each group), 223 patients (3.46%) in the aspirin group and 244 patients (3.79%) in the clopidogrel group developed restroke. The adjusted HR did not differ between the groups.

### Antiplatelet agents in secondary prevention of stroke: A perspective [^114RymWE]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are widely used in the secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular events. The purpose of this review is to provide a perspective on the factors involved in clinical practice for selecting antiplatelet drugs appropriate to the patient population.

- **Summary of review**: Aspirin remains the most popular drug because it is modestly effective, with approximately a 25% risk reduction. However, it has undesirable side effects that are sometimes serious. Nonaspirin compounds are marginally more effective but are significantly more expensive and subject to commercial pressures from the industry. A completely new look at these compounds is necessary, rather than spending more precious resources on "drug wars" that are expensive in terms of time and money.

- **Conclusions**: A "polypill" has been previously proposed, with the possibility of a combination of drugs targeted at the major vascular risk factors. This combination, administered to patients within 24 hours of the initial stroke symptoms and to clearly defined patient populations, may prove to be a viable solution.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112SKW6S]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

When studies reported missing data (loss to follow-up), we conducted a complete case analysis as our primary analysis. We also investigated the robustness of any outcome in which the confidence interval excluded no effect by conducting a plausible worst-case sensitivity analysis. This analysis attributed events in control patients lost to follow-up in the same ratio as those followed. For example, if there was a 5% event rate in control patients followed, we imputed a 5% event rate in control patients lost. For the intervention group, we imputed three times the rate of events in those lost to follow-up as those followed. For instance, if there was a 5% event rate in intervention patients followed, we imputed a 15% event rate in intervention patients lost. For each study, we then combined patients who were followed and those who were lost and pooled the new results across studies to determine the extent to which results are robust to these assumptions. Because most strokes occurred in the first seven days after randomization, we used the seven-day loss to follow-up reported in POINT rather than the 90-day loss to follow-up.

If at least three studies were available for each subgroup, we planned a subgroup analysis of studies judged at high risk of bias versus low risk of bias.

We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology to assess quality of evidence and presented the data using MAGICapp. We rated the quality of evidence as very low, low, moderate, or high by assessing imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178FGGA]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

- **Strengths of this study**: This review conducted a comprehensive search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials and set explicit eligibility criteria focusing on populations likely to benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy. It assessed the risk of bias and provided important data that were not included in the published reports, as provided by the authors of the two large studies. The study employed the GRADE approach to determine certainty in the evidence and used an innovative approach to create a single incidence curve that informs the optimal duration for continuing clopidogrel based on data from the two major studies. The consistent results across these studies, along with the clear benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy on reStroke without evidence of significant adverse effects, likely offer clear guidance for patients with high-risk TIA and minor ischaemic stroke, as well as for clinicians responsible for their care.

- **Limitations of this study**: The loading dose and treatment onset time varied among the three studies: CHANCE and FASTER used a smaller loading dose of clopidogrel compared to POINT (300 mg vs. 600 mg). This variation may leave clinicians uncertain about which loading dose to choose. The review does not address other populations of interest, such as those who have experienced low-risk TIA or those with moderate to severe ischaemic stroke. No trial compared clopidogrel with dual antiplatelet therapy and the addition of aspirin. It remains possible that different categories of ischaemic stroke subtypes — such as small vessel disease and large vessel stenosis — were not fully explored.

### Optimal duration of aspirin plus clopidogrel after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1167MoYJ]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

The role of aspirin plus clopidogrel (A+C) therapy compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack remains uncertain. This study was conducted to determine the optimal period of efficacy and safety of A+C compared with aspirin monotherapy.

Methods - Ten randomized controlled trials (15,434 patients) were selected using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to June 2018; these compared A+C with aspirin monotherapy in patients with transient ischemic attack or IS. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent IS (reIS), and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality. Analyses were stratified based on short- (≤ 1 month), intermediate- (≤ 3 months), and long-term (> 3 months) A+C therapy effects, which were estimated as relative risk (RR) with 95% CI.

Results - A+C significantly reduced the risk of reIS in the short-term (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37–0.78) and intermediate-term (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58–0.90) durations. Similarly, major adverse cardiovascular events were significantly reduced by short-term (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.60–0.78) and intermediate-term (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.94) A+C therapy. However, long-term A+C did not yield a beneficial effect in terms of reIS (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63–1.04) and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71–1.07).

### Clopidogrel with aspirin in acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack [^112b9eR4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Stroke is common during the first few weeks following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke. Combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin may provide greater protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China, we randomly assigned 5,170 patients within 24 hours after the onset of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA to combination therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel at an initial dose of 300 mg, followed by 75 mg per day for 90 days, plus aspirin at a dose of 75 mg per day for the first 21 days) or to placebo plus aspirin (75 mg per day for 90 days). All participants received open-label aspirin at a clinician-determined dose of 75 to 300 mg on day 1. The primary outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 90 days of follow-up in an intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment differences were assessed using a Cox proportional-hazards model, with study center as a random effect.

- **Results**: Stroke occurred in 8.2% of patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, compared to 11.7% in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.81; P < 0.001). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients (0.3%) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight (0.3%) in the aspirin group (P = 0.73). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3% in each group.

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with TIA or minor stroke who can be treated within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin provides significant protective effects against subsequent strokes compared to aspirin alone.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy using cilostazol with aspirin or clopidogrel: Subanalysis of the CSPS.com trial [^116dVLPv]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the most basic treatment for the prevention of a secondary stroke in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The combination of antiplatelets with different mechanisms is expected to prevent the recurrence of ischemic stroke events more effectively than monotherapy. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel inhibits platelet function more than either of these agents alone, and several clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that aspirin and clopidogrel combination reduces the recurrence of ischemic stroke slightly, while significantly increasing the frequency of bleeding events compared with aspirin or clopidogrel alone. The relevant guidelines, therefore, recommend avoiding the use of dual antiplatelet therapies (e.g. aspirin and clopidogrel) for preventing secondary stroke events in patients who are in the chronic phase of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.

Cilostazol selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 3, and the results of the CSPS2 (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study 2) demonstrated that cilostazol treatment significantly reduces stroke recurrence with fewer bleeding events than aspirin. In light of the lower rate of bleeding events in patients treated with cilostazol, the addition of cilostazol to a regimen with another antiplatelet therapy has been expected to decrease the recurrence of stroke without increasing the bleeding risk. The trial (Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study combination) showed that, compared with aspirin or clopidogrel alone, combination treatment with cilostazol reduced the recurrence of ischemic stroke.

### Recent clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy in secondary stroke prevention: Expectations and results for application in primary care settings [^113XVHTi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009).

Antiplatelet therapies significantly reduce the risk of secondary noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. First-line treatment for secondary stroke prevention involves the use of antiplatelet drugs over oral anticoagulation therapies. Antiplatelet treatment options include aspirin, aspirin in combination with extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP), or clopidogrel. Aspirin plus ER-DP has been shown to be effective for secondary stroke prevention, whereas aspirin plus clopidogrel offers no additive benefits and is associated with safety issues.

During the past several years, significant progress has been made in secondary stroke prevention, which continues to be an active area of interest. Today's primary care physicians are challenged with keeping abreast of new findings and ensuring that guideline-recommended therapies are initiated and maintained as indicated. It is important that primary care physicians be knowledgeable of the evidence by which clinical practice guidelines have been developed and on which their treatment decisions are based.

In the future, antiplatelet treatment may be tailored based on patient risk. Forthcoming trial data may offer additional insight into the roles of antiplatelet agents and appropriate identification and treatment of different patient types. This review provides primary care physicians with timely evidence- and guideline-based recommendations on prevention of secondary stroke.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^111jdBCq]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

In this randomised trial of 537 survivors of an intracerebral haemorrhage while on antithrombotic therapy, starting antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. The results exclude all but a very modest increase in the risk of re-intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy, which seems too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention. Therefore, starting antiplatelet therapy seems to be safe and might be beneficial in patients who survived a median of 76 days after intracerebral haemorrhage, most of whom had good functional ability at baseline and a higher probability of a good functional outcome at a 6-month follow-up. Our findings, alongside published observational studies, provide reassurance about the use of long-term antiplatelet therapy in a range of patients after intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic therapy.

RESTART is the first randomised trial comparing starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage and provides more reliable estimates of the effects of antiplatelet therapy than previous observational studies. We minimised selection bias by using central, computerised random sequence generation and concealing allocation on the web application until all baseline data were entered. The recruited participants were comparable to European hospital-based and population-based cohorts of survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage who had previously taken antithrombotic therapy.

### Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack: Is more platelet inhibition the answer [^115CSEkX]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular events constitute an estimated 200,000 of the 700,000 strokes reported annually in the United States, making secondary stroke prevention an important goal in managing patients who have experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack.

- **Methods and results**: Various pharmacological approaches have been advocated, but the relative efficacy and safety of these regimens remain the subject of much debate. The results of recent clinical trials on the use of antiplatelet therapy suggest that patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack may constitute a population distinct from those with coronary or peripheral vascular disease. This distinction may be due, in part, to the differing etiologies of stroke and the increased vulnerability of cerebral vessels to bleeding. Indeed, dual antiplatelet therapy, which has been found beneficial for treating acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions, does not confer secondary stroke protection. The emerging paradigm indicates that some level of platelet inhibition is required for secondary stroke protection; however, there is a level beyond which an increased risk of bleeding arises.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of patients with ischemic stroke have recurring strokes or transient ischemic attacks, rather than myocardial infarctions, as their next event. Therefore, antiplatelet therapies for these patients should be administered according to what has been shown to be efficacious for secondary stroke protection rather than for myocardial protection.

### Cilostazol for secondary prevention of stroke and cognitive decline: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mPWLZ]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, is used in Asia-Pacific countries for stroke prevention but is rarely used elsewhere. In addition to its weak antiplatelet effects, it stabilizes the endothelium and aids in myelin repair and astrocyte-neuron energy transfer in laboratory models. These effects may be beneficial in preventing the progression of small vessel disease.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of unconfounded randomized controlled trials of cilostazol was conducted to examine its efficacy in preventing stroke, cognitive decline, or radiological small vessel disease lesion progression. Two reviewers identified and extracted data from papers published between January 1, 2019, and July 16, 2019. Peto odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for re-ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, death, and adverse symptoms, with sensitivity analyses. The review is registered under CRD42018084742.

The review included 20 randomized controlled trials (n = 10,505), with 18 focusing on ischemic stroke (total n = 10,449) and 2 on cognitive impairment (n = 56); most trials were conducted in Asia-Pacific countries. Cilostazol was found to decrease re-ischemic stroke (17 trials, n = 10,225, OR = 0.68 [95% CI, 0.57–0.81], P < 0.05 over six months) versus short-term use without increasing hemorrhage. Trials with larger proportions of…

### Antiplatelet treatment for prevention of cerebrovascular events in patients with vascular diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ptg4j]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of different antiplatelet regimes for prevention of stroke in patients at high risk were investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Twenty-two studies comprising 173,371 patients were included.

- **Results**: In the overall population, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel, in comparison to aspirin monotherapy, reduced the relative risk of total stroke by 20% (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.88; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 28%) and of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack by 23% (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69–0.85; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 18%) without increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In the secondary prevention cohort, DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel also reduced the relative risk of total stroke by 24% as compared with aspirin alone (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.86; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 0%). DAPT with prasugrel or ticagrelor and aspirin versus DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin was not associated with a risk reduction of stroke.

- **Conclusions**: DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of total and ischemic stroke in the overall cohort consisting of patients with cardiovascular disease without an increase in intracranial hemorrhage. It also decreases the risk of a recurrent stroke in patients with a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Our meta-analysis suggests that DAPT including low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) is effective in these contexts.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy after stroke due to intracerebral haemorrhage (RESTART): a randomised, open-label trial [^117LYxvA]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was fatal or non-fatal radiographically or pathologically proven symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage assessed in all participants, except one participant who withdrew before the first follow-up. The secondary outcomes were a composite of all major haemorrhagic events and a composite of all major occlusive vascular events.

- **Major haemorrhagic events**: Resymptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (primary outcome), other forms of symptomatic spontaneous or traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, and symptomatic major extracranial haemorrhage at any site (requiring transfusion, endoscopic treatment, surgery, or resulting in death within 30 days).

- **Major occlusive vascular events**: Ischaemic stroke; myocardial infarction; mesenteric ischaemia; peripheral arterial occlusion; deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; and carotid, coronary, or peripheral arterial revascularisation procedures.

The composite secondary outcome of all major haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events combined these two composite outcomes. In the protocol, a composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events was defined by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke [ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or uncertain cause], or death from a vascular cause).

Two consultant neurologists (WNW and MRM) at the trial coordinating centre were internal assessors of reports of every outcome event, masked to treatment allocation and use of antithrombotic therapy, using all available source documentation.

### Recurrent ischemic lesions after acute atherothrombotic stroke: Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone [^112qsTvT]. Stroke (2016). High credibility.

In patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large artery atherosclerosis, clopidogrel plus aspirin might be more effective than aspirin alone in preventing cerebral ischemia; however, there is no clear evidence.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomized 358 patients with acute ischemic stroke of presumed large artery atherosclerosis origin within 48 hours of onset. Patients were assigned to clopidogrel (75 mg/d without loading dose) plus aspirin (300-mg loading followed by 100 mg/d) or to aspirin alone (300-mg loading followed by 100 mg/d) for 30 days. The primary outcome was new symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were 30-day functional disability, clinical stroke recurrence, and a composite of major vascular events. Safety outcome was any bleeding.

- **Results**: Of 358 patients enrolled, 334 (167 in each group) completed follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. The 30-day new ischemic lesion recurrence rate was comparable between the clopidogrel plus aspirin and aspirin monotherapy groups (36.5% versus 35.9%; relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–1.35; P = 0.91). Of the ischemic lesions, 94.2% were clinically asymptomatic. There were no differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups. Any bleeding was more frequent in the combination group than in the aspirin monotherapy group, but the difference was not significant (16.7% versus 10.7%; P = 0.11). One hemorrhagic stroke occurred in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group.

### Effects of clopidogrel added to aspirin in patients with recent lacunar stroke [^115Pac7T]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lacunar infarcts are a frequent type of stroke caused mainly by cerebral small-vessel disease. The effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention has not been defined.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, multicenter trial involving 3,020 patients with recent symptomatic lacunar infarcts identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 75 mg of clopidogrel or placebo daily; patients in both groups received 325 mg of aspirin daily. The primary outcome was any restroke, including ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage.

- **Results**: The participants had a mean age of 63 years, and 63% were men. After a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, the risk of restroke was not significantly reduced with aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therapy) (125 strokes; rate, 2.5% per year) compared with aspirin alone (138 strokes, 2.7% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.16), nor was the risk of re-ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09) or disabling or fatal stroke (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.64). The risk of major hemorrhage was almost doubled with dual antiplatelet therapy (105 hemorrhages, 2.1% per year) compared with aspirin alone (56, 1.1% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.71; P < 0.001). Among classifiable re-ischemic strokes, 71% (133 of 187) were lacunar strokes. All-cause mortality was increased among patients assigned to receive dual antiplatelet therapy (77 deaths in the group receiving aspirin alone).
