## Question

BPPV treatmeny

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about BPPV treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical question and PICO framing. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and appraise key studies by design and quality. Next, I will synthesize treatment effectiveness, including canalith repositioning maneuvers, vestibular suppressants, and observation. After that, I should address special populations and implementation barriers. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and PICO. The population is adults with suspected or confirmed BPPV, the intervention is canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley, Semont, Gufoni, barbecue roll), the comparator includes vestibular suppressants, observation, or sham/no treatment, and the outcomes are symptom resolution, conversion to negative positional testing, recurrence, safety, and patient-centered measures like satisfaction and falls, which align with guideline-defined primary and secondary endpoints [^ab81d69a] [^e621b523].

> I need to check the evidence hierarchy and appraisal approach. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials sit at the top, followed by RCTs, then cohort and case-control studies, and finally case series and expert opinion; I will grade each study for risk of bias and assign a GRADE-like quality rating, noting that the AAO-HNSF update incorporated 20 systematic reviews and 27 RCTs, which strengthens the base of evidence for recommendations [^dbf3cd66] [^d34f51f4].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for canalith repositioning maneuvers. The 2014 Cochrane review of 11 RCTs showed that the Epley maneuver significantly increased complete vertigo resolution versus sham or control (OR 4.42, 95% CI 2.62–7.44) and improved conversion to negative Dix-Hallpike (OR 9.62, 95% CI 6.0–15.42), with no serious adverse events reported; this supports a strong recommendation for CRP as first-line therapy for posterior canal BPPV [^acca4de7]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and context: the number-needed-to-treat for symptom resolution is about 3, and benefits persist at 1 month in pooled analyses, reinforcing clinical utility across settings [^b0e02e79].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all maneuvers being equal. I should confirm comparative effectiveness. The Cochrane review found no superiority of Epley over Semont or Gans maneuvers for vertigo resolution, though Epley outperformed Brandt-Daroff exercises; similarly, a meta-analysis of CRP versus control showed robust benefit, with effect sizes diminishing over longer follow-up, which is expected given recurrence and spontaneous resolution dynamics [^acca4de7] [^c43841f6]. Let me reconsider whether modified Epley with postural restrictions helps; a Cochrane review of modifications found a small but statistically significant improvement in Dix-Hallpike conversion with post-maneuver restrictions, yet the AAO-HNSF issued a strong recommendation against routine restrictions due to minimal clinical benefit and patient burden, so I should align with the guideline stance despite the statistical signal [^bee43a26] [^93d9b1e5].

> I will now examine the evidence for vestibular suppressants. Multiple guidelines converge on a strong recommendation against routine use of antihistamines or benzodiazepines for BPPV, citing lack of efficacy and potential harms; a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 RCTs found no benefit of vestibular suppressants on symptom resolution at 14–31 days and suggested superiority of CRMs over medications for durable outcomes, which supports deprescribing and prioritizing maneuvers [^f133c6f1] [^e7cdb4bf]. But wait, what if symptoms are severe acutely? The guideline allows short-term suppressants only for immediate distress or as prophylaxis for severe nausea during CRP, not as definitive therapy, so I should frame them as rescue-only in select cases [^f3c96ecc].

> Next, I should review observation as an initial strategy. The AAO-HNSF update lists observation with follow-up as an option, noting spontaneous resolution in roughly 15–85% by 1 month; however, the panel favors treatment over observation due to faster relief, reduced fall risk, and lower indirect costs, so observation should be reserved for patients declining maneuvers or with contraindications after counseling on trade-offs [^f617bbb5] [^01d9681d]. I should double-check that this aligns with patient-centered outcomes: yes, the balance of benefits and harms favors CRP in most adults, especially older adults at fall risk [^f617bbb5].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with older adults. Prevalence rises with age, and presentations are often atypical, with unsteadiness or falls rather than classic vertigo; therefore, I should screen for BPPV in older adults with balance problems or falls even without reported dizziness, and adapt maneuvers for mobility or cervical limitations, using modified techniques or assistive setups to ensure safety and efficacy [^e736efdf] [^d06ce123]. Hold on, I should verify recurrence and vestibular agnosia: recurrence is higher in older adults, and persistent dysequilibrium after successful CRP is common, so education and follow-up are essential to close the loop on symptoms and function [^b3146800].

> I need to ensure I address post-traumatic BPPV, particularly after TBI. Prospective randomized data show that therapist-led repositioning maneuvers are safe and feasible in acute TBI, with higher resolution rates than advice alone, though recurrence is common; this supports incorporating BPPV assessment and treatment into TBI pathways despite historical neglect in guidelines [^76bb1665] [^91ddba35]. Wait, let me verify feasibility signals: the trials met progression criteria and reported improved gait speed with resolution, suggesting potential fall-risk modification, which is clinically meaningful in this population [^76bb1665].

> Next, I should review implementation barriers and real-world adherence. Despite strong evidence, only 10–20% of patients receive CRP in many settings, with high rates of unnecessary imaging and vestibular suppressants; ED and primary care studies show that education-only interventions improve testing but not CRP delivery, indicating a need for workflow integration, hands-on training, and system-level supports to close the gap [^7cbfe659] [^108fc0a9] [^b9b89c80]. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline calls for training and access expansion; yes, the AAO-HNSF update emphasizes clinician training and multidisciplinary involvement to improve access to CRP [^be39c575].

> I will now translate this into a practical clinical algorithm. First, confirm the diagnosis with Dix-Hallpike for posterior canal BPPV and supine roll testing for horizontal canal involvement, while avoiding routine imaging or vestibular testing unless red flags emerge; then, offer CRP as first-line therapy, tailoring the maneuver to canal and patient factors; counsel against routine post-maneuver restrictions; reassess within about 1 month; and if symptoms persist, re-evaluate the diagnosis, consider multicanal disease, or explore alternative vestibular or central etiologies, escalating to vestibular rehabilitation or specialty referral as needed [^6910e47a] [^90b8bf4b] [^9f25ee06] [^c89e6ab6]. Hold on, I should verify that this matches the visual algorithm and action statements; yes, the AAO-HNSF update provides a clear diagnostic and treatment pathway that I have mirrored here [^10697c0f].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research needs. Optimal dosing and intervals for repeated CRPs, the role of adjunctive vestibular rehabilitation for residual dysequilibrium, cost-effectiveness of early CRP, and standardized nomenclature for lateral canal maneuvers remain active questions; longer-term functional outcomes, including falls and quality of life, also need better characterization to refine care pathways and payer policies [^a2757978]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the recurrence rate after Epley was uniformly 36%, but I should correct that: the 36% figure comes from longer-term observational data, whereas RCTs often show lower short-term recurrence, underscoring the importance of follow-up and patient education about recurrence risk and when to reseek care [^0cba2cb7] [^acca4de7].

---

The most effective treatment for BPPV is **canalith repositioning maneuvers** (Epley, Semont, or Gufoni) [^90b8bf4b], with success rates of 80–90% after 1–3 sessions [^e8734f5a] and minimal risk [^acca4de7]. Vestibular suppressants (meclizine, benzodiazepines) are **not recommended** [^f133c6f1] because they do not treat the cause and may delay recovery [^e7cdb4bf]; reserve them only for severe nausea or vomiting. Post-maneuver restrictions are **unnecessary** [^93d9b1e5] and do not improve outcomes [^9d2a1a57]. For persistent symptoms or multicanal disease, repeat maneuvers or vestibular rehabilitation may be needed [^cbeb4885] [^61cf4c7d]. Recurrence is common (15–50%) [^0cba2cb7], so counsel patients and arrange follow-up [^94d5225d].

---

## Canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs)

CRMs are the **first-line therapy** for BPPV, with high success and low risk [^90b8bf4b].

- **Epley maneuver**: For posterior canal BPPV; 80–90% success after 1–3 sessions [^e8734f5a] [^acca4de7].
- **Semont maneuver**: Alternative for posterior canal BPPV; comparable efficacy to Epley [^acca4de7].
- **Gufoni maneuver**: For horizontal canal BPPV; effective for geotropic and apogeotropic nystagmus [^816d51f3].
- **Barbecue roll maneuver**: For horizontal canal BPPV; effective alternative [^816d51f3].

---

## Vestibular suppressant medications

Vestibular suppressants are **not recommended** for routine BPPV treatment [^f133c6f1] because they mask symptoms without addressing the cause and may delay recovery [^e7cdb4bf]. They may be used short term only for severe nausea or vomiting, or when CRMs are contraindicated or refused [^f3c96ecc].

---

## Post-maneuver restrictions

Post-maneuver restrictions (e.g. upright sleep, cervical collar) are **not recommended** [^93d9b1e5] because they do not improve outcomes and may cause inconvenience or anxiety [^9d2a1a57].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Vestibular rehabilitation exercises (e.g. Brandt-Daroff) may be used as adjuncts, particularly for residual dizziness or when CRMs are contraindicated [^c27f0967] [^61cf4c7d]. They are **less effective than CRMs** but can reduce recurrence and improve balance [^10b9d3aa].

---

## Management of persistent or recurrent BPPV

Persistent or recurrent BPPV may require **repeat CRMs**, alternative maneuvers, or vestibular rehabilitation [^cbeb4885] [^61cf4c7d]. Multicanal involvement or central vestibular disorders should be considered if symptoms persist after multiple treatments [^f336a879].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patients should be educated about BPPV, its recurrence risk, and fall-prevention strategies [^94d5225d]. Follow-up within 1 month is recommended to assess response and address recurrence [^9f25ee06].

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Epley maneuver | Posterior canal BPPV | 80–90% success | First-line |
| Semont maneuver | Posterior canal BPPV | Comparable to Epley | Alternative |
| Gufoni maneuver | Horizontal canal BPPV | Effective | First-line |
| Barbecue roll | Horizontal canal BPPV | Effective | Alternative |
| Vestibular suppressants | Severe nausea/vomiting | Symptom relief only | Short-term use only |
| Post-maneuver restrictions | Not indicated | No benefit | Not recommended |
| Vestibular rehabilitation | Persistent symptoms | Adjunctive | Recommended |

---

Canalith repositioning maneuvers are the **most effective treatment** for BPPV, with high success and low risk [^90b8bf4b]. Vestibular suppressants are not recommended for routine use, and post-maneuver restrictions are unnecessary [^f133c6f1] [^93d9b1e5]. Persistent or recurrent cases may require repeat maneuvers or vestibular rehabilitation, and patient education with follow-up is essential [^cbeb4885] [^94d5225d].

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^f10f2058]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^86a0846d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

### Best practice assessment and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in older adults [^e736efdf]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common and disabling condition, with prevalence increasing with advancing age. It typically causes positional dizziness but is also common in those with balance abnormalities and falls without the typical dizziness. It is an underdiagnosed problem, which can lead to reduced quality of life, depression and increased falls risk. Whilst the diagnosis and treatment of the commonest form of BPPV (posterior canal) is straightforward in robust and younger populations, this is frequently not the case in people with multiple long-term conditions or frailty. Barriers to diagnosis and treatment of BPPV in each of the three canals can be overcome with simple practical measures, which are presented here. Given the lack of good quality evidence in this area, this best practise article presents evidence, where it exists, alongside expert clinical experience.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^10697c0f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) treatment and follow-up pathway — management actions include perform CRP based on type of BPPV, do not prescribe post-CRP postural restrictions, and educate patient regarding safety, disease recurrence and follow-up. When there is contraindication to CRP or patient refusal, the pathway offers observation or vestibular rehabilitation. Follow-up includes reassess for treatment response at one (1) month and, if symptoms still present at one (1) month, re-evaluate or refer for unresolved BPPV or other causes, and the pathway also includes assess for modifying factors.

### Physical therapy for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo… [^8e8d6a78]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We treated 67 patients with the symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo by challenging them with the precipitating head positions on a repeated and serial basis. Sixty-six of the patients experienced complete relief of the vertigo within three to 14 days; in two patients, the vertigo recurred but responded to a second course of therapy. The one patient whose condition did not respond was found to have a perilymphatic fistula that mimicked BPPV. The presumed mechanism for this therapy is the loosening and ultimate dispersion of degenerated otolithic particles from the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal. Brandt T, Daroff RB.

Methods — guideline development and literature search for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) followed established processes: In developing this update, the methods outlined in the third edition of the AAO-HNSF's guideline development manual were followed explicitly, and an executive summary of the original guideline was sent to a panel of expert reviewers from general otolaryngology, otology, neurotology, neurology, family practice, nursing, physical therapy, emergency medicine, radiology, audiology, and complementary medicine to assess key action statements. An information specialist conducted 2 systematic literature searches using a validated filter strategy to identify clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since the prior guideline (2008), with search terms as specified. The search was updated from January 2008 to September 2015 and included databases such as MEDLINE, National Guidelines Clearinghouse, Canadian Medical Association Database, NHS Evidence ENT and Audiology, National Institutes for Health and Care Excellence UK, Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, Guideline Internal Network, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, Web of Science, and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database. The initial search for clinical practice guidelines identified 2 guidelines, applying quality criteria for inclusion, and the final data set retained 2 guidelines; the initial search for systematic reviews identified 44 systematic reviews or meta-analyses.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) follow-up and treatment metrics — The most effective treatment for BPPV is CRP, and recent studies show the majority of patients are adequately treated with 1 or 2 CRPs (79.4%-92.7%), while 12.8% to 15.3% require a second CRP and 5.1% are treatment failures after 2 CRPs. If initial therapy fails, the patient should be reassessed for BPPV diagnosis accuracy, with cohort studies reporting false-positive BPPV subsequently found to be CNS lesions after failed CRP ranging from 1.1% to 3%. In clinical trials, successful outcomes are traditionally defined as subjective symptom resolution and/or conversion to a negative Dix-Hallpike test. There is no widely accepted time interval to assess treatment failure; therapeutic trials report follow-up assessments at 40 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month, and up to 6 months.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) observation as initial therapy is presented as an option: "Clinicians may offer observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV. Option based on data from cohort and observational studies with heterogeneity and a relative balance of benefits and harms". The profile rates "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B" with "Level of confidence in evidence: High", and notes "Benefits: Symptom resolution in 15% to 85% at 1 month without intervention", balanced against "Risks, harms, costs: Prolonged symptoms compared with other interventions that may expose patients to increased risks for falls or lost days of work; indirect costs of delayed resolution compared with other measures". The panel's "Benefits-harms assessment" is a "Relative balance of benefits and harms", with "Policy level: Option" and "Role of patient preferences: Large". Regarding "Value judgments", "The panel felt strongly in favor of treatment with CRP rather than observation… The panel felt that observation may not be suitable for older patients, patients with preexisting balance disorders, or individuals at high risks for falls". Additional qualifiers are "Intentional vagueness: Definition of follow-up is not explicitly specified", "Exceptions: None", and "Differences of opinion: Some panel members thought that this option was not the optimal choice for management, given the data for other interventions".

### Plain language summary: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^a1781e46]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This plain language summary serves as an overview in explaining benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, abbreviated BPPV. This summary applies to patients ≥ 18 years old with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV and is based on the 2017 "Clinical Practice Guideline: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (Update)". The evidence-based guideline includes research to support more effective diagnosis and treatment of BPPV. The guideline was developed as a quality improvement opportunity for managing BPPV by creating clear recommendations to use in medical practice.

### We should be screening for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in all older adults at risk of falling: a commentary on the World Falls Guidelines [^0eb0867a]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is amongst the commonest causes of dizziness and falls in older adults. Diagnosing and treating BPPV can reduce falls, and thereby reduce fall-related morbidity and mortality. Recent World Falls Guidelines recommend formal assessment for BPPV in older adults at risk of falling, but only if they report vertigo. However, this recommendation ignores the data that (i) many older adults with BPPV experience dizziness as vague unsteadiness (rather than vertigo), and (ii) others may experience no symptoms of dizziness at all. BPPV without vertigo is due to an impaired vestibular perception of self-motion, termed 'vestibular agnosia'. Vestibular agnosia is found in ageing, neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury, and results in dramatically increased missed BPPV diagnoses. Patients with BPPV without vertigo are typically the most vulnerable for negative outcomes associated with this disorder. We thus recommend simplifying the World Falls Guidelines: all older adults (> 60 years) with objective or subjective balance problems, irrespective of symptomatic complaint, should have positional testing to examine for BPPV.

### Management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a randomized controlled trial [^7d58cfeb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common presenting problem.

Objective

Our aim was to compare the efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation (maneuver) vs. conventional therapy (medications) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with BPPV.

Methods

This was a prospective, single-blinded physician, randomized pilot study comparing two groups of patients who presented to the ED with a diagnosis of BPPV at a Level 1 trauma center with an annual census of approximately 75,000. The first group received standard medications and the second group received a canalith repositioning maneuver. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory was used to measure symptom resolution.

Results

Twenty-six patients were randomized; 11 to the standard treatment arm and 15 to the interventional arm. Mean age ± standard deviation of subjects randomized to receive maneuver and medication were 59 ± 12.6 years and 64 ± 11.2 years, respectively. There was no significant difference in mean ages between the two treatment arms (p = 0.310). Two hours after treatment, the symptoms between the groups showed no difference in measures of nausea (p = 0.548) or dizziness (p = 0.659). Both groups reported a high level of satisfaction, measured on a 0–10 scale. Satisfaction in subjects randomized to receive maneuver and medication was 9 ± 1.5 and 9 ± 1.0, respectively; there was no significant difference in satisfaction between the two arms (p = 0.889). Length of stay during the ED visit did not differ between the treatment groups (p = 0.873). None of the patients returned to an ED for similar symptoms.

Conclusions

This pilot study shows promise, and would suggest that there is no difference in symptomatic resolution, ED length of stay, or patient satisfaction between standard medical care and canalith repositioning maneuver. Physicians should consider the canalith repositioning maneuver as a treatment option.

Key points

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is common in older adults and in people who fall, but barriers to the diagnosis and treatment are more common with advancing age, frailty and multiple long-term conditions.
Particle repositioning manoeuvres are the treatment of choice but require adequate mobility to achieve correct positioning
Simple solutions exist to overcome diagnostic and treatment barriers, improving the diagnosis and treatment success in older populations.
In recent years, several new and modified manoeuvres have been created which allow for greater personalisation of care.

Introduction

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a condition of the inner ear, where otoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) from the utricle are displaced into the semi-circular canals, whose function is to detect direction and velocity of rotational head movement. This displacement affects the afferent signals from the semi-circular canal to the balance areas of the central nervous system giving false sense of motion, which disturbs the perception of balance. BPPV often occurs after trauma to head such as from a fall but can also occur spontaneously.

As is often the case, although diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines exist, they are based on evidence derived from younger and more robust populations. The treatment of BPPV is through particle repositioning manoeuvres, such as the Epley manoeuvre. Most manoeuvres are well tolerated, even in the oldest old, however older and frailer populations carry an increased burden of challenges, creating barriers and challenges to diagnosis and treatment. Orthopnoea, musculoskeletal issues of the neck and back, reduced mobility, muscle weakness and cognitive impairments all create barriers to the assessment and treatment of BPPV. However, there is a growing number of manoeuvres that provide solutions to overcome these barriers.

In this best practise article, common barriers are presented with simple solutions to improve diagnosis and treatment in older populations. Additional figures can be found in the supplementary material.

Barrier 1: atypical presentation

The prevalence of BPPV is very common in older adults. In a population-based study of 75-year-olds the prevalence was 10%. In a general geriatrics clinic the prevalence was found to be 9% [, increasing to 39% in those referred to falls clinics, with a quarter of these not reporting dizziness in history taking. Older adults' symptoms of BPPV are less specific than younger populations, with unsteadiness or falls rather than classic vertigo. Due to the variation in subjective symptoms, expert recommendation is BPPV assessment should occur for all older adults with history of falls. However, it is worth noting that there is no current evidence that the treatment of nonvertiginous BPPV reduces falls.

Solution: Consider testing for BPPV in patients presenting with unsteadiness, balance dysfunction or falls for BPPV regardless of presence of dizziness or vertigo.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — comorbidities relevant to management notes that BPPV occurs most commonly in the second half of the life span and its prevalence increases with age, and that patients with BPPV often have medical comorbidities that may alter management. Case-control data report higher relative rates of coexisting disease 34% in BPPV patients vs 10% in nondizziness control group, stroke 10% for BPPV patients vs 1% for controls, diabetes 14% vs 5%, and hypertension 52% vs 22%. The guideline states that clinicians should assess patients with BPPV for these comorbidities because their presence may modify management and influence treatment outcomes in BPPV.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Persistent symptoms after initial therapy and reevaluation — Patients with persistent symptoms of vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness after initial therapy for BPPV are classified as treatment failures, which require reevaluation because (1) persistent BPPV may be present and responsive to additional maneuvers, (2) coexisting vestibular conditions may be present that can be identified and treated, and (3) serious central nervous system (CNS) disorders may simulate BPPV and need to be identified; reevaluation is advisable and should include history and determining if vertigo is positional, the Dix-Hallpike test should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis, and if still positive, repeat canalith repositioning maneuvers can then be performed as a preferred treatment; failure rates of VR or a single-session CRP range from 8% to 50%, successful treatment with additional maneuvers reaches 90% to 98%, and for refractory failures surgical plugging or singular neurectomy has a > 96% success rate although data quality precludes definitive recommendations.

Guideline purpose and scope for BPPV — The stated aims are "to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers". The guidance is "intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed". The target population is "aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV", and "The pediatric population was not included in the target population, in part due to a substantially smaller body of evidence on pediatric BPPV". "No specific recommendations are made concerning surgical therapy for BPPV". Scope exclusions include that the guideline "does not discuss BPPV affecting the anterior semicircular canal, as this diagnosis is quite rare and its pathophysiology is poorly understood", and it "does not discuss benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood, disabling positional vertigo due to vascular loop compression in the brainstem, or vertigo that arises from changes in head position not related to gravity (ie, vertigo of cervical origin or vertigo of vascular origin). These conditions are physiologically distinct from BPPV".

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient counseling and follow-up — expected course, activity guidance, recurrence risk, and actions for persistent symptoms are outlined as follows: Mild sensitivity to movement and unsteadiness can persist, and these mild symptoms can take a few days to a few weeks to resolve; follow up if dizziness or instability do not improve in a few days to a couple of weeks. Balance may be "off", so take precautions to avoid falls, return to normal activities that you can do safely, and note that exposure to motion and movement will help to speed healing. BPPV can sometimes return, with risk shifting from low risk (few experiences in your lifetime) to higher risk from factors such as trauma, other inner ear or medical conditions, or aging; medical research has not found any way to stop recurrence, but it can be treated with a high rate of success. If symptoms persist after initial treatments, it is not uncommon to need more than 1 repositioning session, BPPV can sometimes be in more than 1 canal and/or side requiring multiple treatments, seek a health professional who specializes in BPPV, and recognize that leftover dizziness may require more time (few days to couple of weeks); follow-up is important and further testing may confirm the diagnosis and/or guide future treatment options.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) research needs include conducting diagnostic and cost-effectiveness studies to identify which patient subsets warrant additional vestibular testing and/or radiographic imaging, alongside evaluating the utility and costs of audiometry in the diagnostic evaluation of BPPV. Priorities also include determining whether education and application of clinical diagnostic criteria change physician ordering of diagnostic tests and defining the optimal number of CRPs and the time interval between CRPs for posterior canal BPPV. Additional needs are cost-effectiveness analyses of earlier intervention with expedient CRPs, extended cohort studies testing self-performance of CRP or longitudinal VR for reducing recurrence or complications such as falls, and evaluating whether vestibular therapy after CRP offers added benefit. Studies are needed on functional impacts (home safety, work safety and absences, and driving risks) and epidemiologic rates of falls with BPPV, as well as assessing quality of life, developing and validating a disease-specific quality-of-life measure, and comparing structured versus "as needed" follow-up regimens. Further needs include clarifying and standardizing terminology for lateral canal repositioning maneuvers, evaluating mastoid vibration in treatment, characterizing risk factors for development of BPPV (including osteoporosis, dental procedures, and cranial vibration devices), and identifying patient- and treatment-related risk factors for recurrent BPPV. Finally, needs include evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of examination maneuvers for anterior semicircular canal BPPV laterality and characterizing the accuracy of diagnostic maneuvers for posterior and lateral canal BPPV and treatment outcomes in nonspecialty settings.

### Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a practical approach for emergency physicians [^10d60616]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a very common condition in the population and an important cause of acute vertigo or dizziness in patients presenting to an emergency department (ED). Despite this, abundant evidence shows that current ED management of patients with BPPV is suboptimal. Common ED management processes include brain imaging and treatment with vestibular suppressant medications such as meclizine, neither of which is recommended by current guidelines. The most efficient management of BPPV is to perform a bedside test (Dix-Hallpike test) and then to treat the patients with a bedside positional (the Epley) maneuver. In this practical review we emphasize the efficient management for the most common form of BPPV-posterior canal BPPV. Using this management will reduce resource utilization (laboratory testing, brain imaging, specialist consultation), reduce ED length of stay, and reduce use of ineffective mediations that have side effects but little therapeutic effect. Application of these practices would improve important patient-centered outcomes such as symptom reduction, radiation exposure, side effects from medications, and less need for urgent follow-up with another health care provider. The article also discusses the approach to patients in whom the Dix-Hallpike and/or Epley maneuvers do not seem to work. This includes a discussion the second most common variant of BPPV (horizontal canal BPPV) and criteria for safe discharge of patients. Another important advantage of learning BPPV best practices is that it is enormously satisfying for the clinician, not unlike treating a child with a nursemaid's elbow.

Clinicians may offer observation with follow up as initial management for patients with BPPV (Option). The clinician may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV (Option). Clinicians should not routinely treat BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines (Recommendation (against)).

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient counseling — clinicians should be aware of the recurrence risk of BPPV and should counsel patients accordingly, and patients with BPPV should be counseled that BPPV places them at greater risk for falls. Clinicians should counsel patients and their families regarding the risk of falls associated with BPPV, this is particularly important in the elderly and frail, and such counseling could include assessment of home safety, activity restrictions, and the need for home supervision until BPPV is resolved. Patients may be particularly vulnerable between initial diagnosis and definitive treatment when referred for canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) or vestibular rehabilitation (VR), so counseling should therefore occur at the time of initial diagnosis. Patients should be counseled regarding the importance of follow-up after the diagnosis of BPPV, and patients initially treated with observation should be counseled that if BPPV fails to resolve spontaneously, effective therapies such as the CRP may then be undertaken. Also, patients should be educated about atypical symptoms whose occurrence or persistence after resolution of the primary symptoms of BPPV warrants further clinical evaluation.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — burden, prevalence, and care patterns include high direct and indirect costs and substantial functional impact: It is estimated that it costs approximately $2000 to arrive at the diagnosis of BPPV and that > 65% of patients will undergo potentially unnecessary testing or interventions, with health care costs associated with the diagnosis alone approaching $2 billion per year. The natural history includes a spontaneous resolution rate ranging from 27% to 50%, yet almost 86% of patients have interrupted daily activities and lost work days; 68% reduce workload, 4% change jobs, and 8% quit jobs. In older adults, 9% of elderly patients undergoing comprehensive geriatric assessment for nonbalance-related complaints have unrecognized BPPV, and BPPV is present in 40% of geriatric patients seen for dizziness, with an overall general prevalence of 3.4% in individuals aged ≤ 60. Among an estimated 7.0 million elderly individuals reporting dizziness in the prior 12 months, 2.0 million (30.1%) reported vertigo, with 230,000 office visits among the elderly with a diagnosis of BPPV. Care is often delayed and inefficient: patients experience delays on the order of months, only 10% to 20% presenting to a physician receive appropriate repositioning maneuvers, and many undergo testing or medications, including 70% magnetic resonance imaging, 45% computed tomography, 41% electrocardiogram, and 53% medication treatment.

### Role of vestibular testing in diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^9172d7be]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a mixture of empiricism of particle repositioning with the rationally-based knowledge obtained from clinical observations, histopathology, and neurophysiological experiments. The recently published clinical practice guideline on BPPV makes recommendations on the management of BPPV. One of the statements discourages the use of radiographic or vestibular testing, unless the diagnosis was uncertain or there were additional signs or symptoms unrelated to BPPV. The role of video-oculography in diagnosis and treatment of BPPV is argued, since vestibular testing has provided key relevant information to understand positional nystagmus in patients with BPPV.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) recurrence and fall data — most trials of BPPV maintain limited follow-up, rarely beyond 3 months. In longer-term follow-up trials, recurrent BPPV is reported to be 5% to 13.5% at 6-month follow-up, and at 1 year after treatment recurrence has been reported at 10% to 18%, with the recurrence rate continuing to increase over time and may be as high as 36%. Patients with BPPV after trauma are likely to demonstrate an even higher recurrence rate. In elderly patients with chronic vestibular disorders, in a study of 120 patients, 36.7% carried the diagnosis of BPPV; Fifty-three percent had fallen at least once in the past year, and 29.2% had recurrent falls.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) management — repositioning maneuvers are emphasized with defined effectiveness and precautions: "medications are not used other than for relief of immediate distress", and most cases "can be corrected with bedside repositioning exercises that take only a few minutes to complete" with "high success rates (around 80%) with only 1–3 treatments". Maneuvers can be performed at the time of diagnostic testing or by health professionals, and patients can be taught supervised "self-repositioning". Brief distress during treatment can include vertigo, nausea, and disorientation, and "These symptoms can take a few hours or a few days to go away".

### The necessity for post-maneuver restrictions in the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: an updated meta-analysis of the literature [^9d2a1a57]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Many studies have published conflicting results regarding the necessity of post-maneuver postural restrictions following treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The purpose of this meta-analysis is to complete an updated, comprehensive review to determine best practice following a repositioning maneuver (RM).

Data Sources

PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched through July 2016. The reference lists of the selected studies were searched for studies that were not identified in the electronic database searches.

Study Selection

Studies investigating the effect of post-maneuver postural restrictions on RM treatment efficacy were included.

Data Extraction

The methodology, number of participants, type of RM administered, post-maneuver restrictions implemented, outcome measures, and results for each study were recorded.

Data Synthesis

Following data extraction, heterogeneity and homogeneity values of included studies were determined. Risk ratios and random effects values were obtained to determine effect size.

Results

Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of 739 total subjects were analyzed, 362 of which received post-maneuver postural restrictions and 377 of which did not. Meta-analysis revealed that there was not a statistically significant difference in treatment success rates between patients who received post-maneuver postural restrictions (90.3%) and those who did not (81.7%) (p = 0.095).

Conclusions

There was no statistically significant difference found in treatment efficacy between subjects who received post-maneuver postural restrictions and those who did not. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, if there is any benefit from prescribing the postural restrictions, it is likely to be a small marginal improvement in outcomes.

### The epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^2e0f9a6d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres including the Epley manoeuvre.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre compared to other treatments available for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or no treatment.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2001), MEDLINE (1966 onwards), EMBASE (1974 onwards), and reference lists of identified publications. Date of the most recent search was June 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). Comparisons sought: - Epley manoeuvre versus placebo. - Epley manoeuvre versus untreated controls. Epley manoeuvre versus other active treatment. Outcome measures that were considered include: frequency and severity of attacks of vertigo; proportion of patients improved by each intervention; and conversion of a "positive" Dix-Hallpike test to a "negative" Dix-Hallpike test

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trials for quality.

Main Results

Eleven trials were identified but nine studies were excluded because of a high risk of bias, leaving two trials in the review. Trials were mainly excluded because of inadequate concealment during randomisation, or failure to blind outcome assessors. Both studies included in the review (Lynn 1995, Froehling 2000) addressed the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre by comparing the proportion of subjects in each group who had complete resolution of their symptoms, and who converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of the Epley manoeuvre over controls. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

~bullet~There is some evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, although this is based on the results of only two small randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow up. ~bullet~There is no good evidence that the Epley manoeuvre provides a long term resolution of symptoms. ~bullet~There is no good evidence comparing the Epley manoeuvre with other physical, medical or surgical therapy for posterior canal BPPV.

### The epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^acca4de7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2002 and previously updated in 2004 and 2007. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres, including the Epley manoeuvre.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 January 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of the Epley manoeuvre versus placebo, no treatment or other active treatment for adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). The primary outcome of interest was complete resolution of vertigo symptoms. Secondary outcomes were conversion of a 'positive' Dix-Hallpike test to a 'negative' Dix-Hallpike test and adverse effects of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 11 trials in the review with a total of 745 patients. Five studies compared the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre, three against other particle repositioning manoeuvres (Semont, Brandt-Daroff and Gans) and three against a control (no treatment, medication only, postural restriction). Patients were treated in hospital otolaryngology departments in eight studies and family practices in two studies. All patients were adults aged 18 to 90 years old, with a sex ratio of 1:1.5 male to female. There was a low risk of overall bias in the studies included. All studies were randomised with six applying sealed envelope or external allocation techniques. Eight of the trials blinded the assessors to the participants' treatment group and data on all outcomes for all participants were reported in eight of the 11 studies. Complete resolution of vertigo Complete resolution of vertigo occurred significantly more often in the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control (odds ratio (OR) 4.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62 to 7.44; five studies, 273 participants); the proportion of patients resolving increased from 21% to 56%. None of the trials comparing Epley versus other particle repositioning manoeuvres reported vertigo resolution as an outcome. Conversion of Dix-Hallpike positional test result from positive to negative Conversion from a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test significantly favoured the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control (OR 9.62, 95% CI 6.0 to 15.42; eight studies, 507 participants). There was no difference when comparing the Epley with the Semont manoeuvre (two studies, 117 participants) or the Epley with the Gans manoeuvre (one study, 58 participants). In one study a single Epley treatment was more effective than a week of three times daily Brandt-Daroff exercises (OR 12.38, 95% CI 4.32 to 35.47; 81 participants). Adverse effects Adverse effects were infrequently reported. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. Rates of nausea during the repositioning manoeuvre varied from 16.7% to 32%. Some patients were unable to tolerate the manoeuvres because of cervical spine problems.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe, effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, based on the results of 11, mostly small, randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow-up. There is a high recurrence rate of BPPV after treatment (36%). Outcomes for Epley manoeuvre treatment are comparable to treatment with Semont and Gans manoeuvres, but superior to Brandt-Daroff exercises.

### Vestibular suppressants for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e7cdb4bf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of acute dizziness. Medication use for its treatment remains common despite guideline recommendations against their use.

Objectives

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vestibular suppressants in patients with BPPV compared to placebo, no treatment, or canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until March 25, 2022. for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antihistamines, phenothiazines, anticholinergics, and/or benzodiazepines to placebo, no treatment, or a CRM.

Results

Five RCTs, enrolling 296 patients, were included in the quantitative analysis. We found that vestibular suppressants may have no effect on symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up (14-31days in four studies) when evaluated as a continuous outcome (standardized mean difference -0.03 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53 to 0.47). Conversely, CRMs may improve symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up as a dichotomous outcome when compared to vestibular suppressants (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78). Vestibular suppressants had an uncertain effect on symptom resolution within 24h (mean difference [MD] 5 points, 95% CI -16.92 to 26.94), repeat emergency department (ED)/clinic visits (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.15), patient satisfaction (MD 0 points, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.02), and quality of life (MD -1.2 points, 95% CI -2.96 to 0.56). Vestibular suppressants had an uncertain effect on adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with BPPV, vestibular suppressants may have no effect on symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up; however, there is evidence toward the superiority of CRM over these medications. Vestibular suppressants have an uncertain effect on symptom resolution within 24h, repeat ED/clinic visits, patient satisfaction, quality of life, and adverse events. These data suggest that a CRM, and not vestibular suppressants, should be the primary treatment for BPPV.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^1e466731]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Randomisation

Patients with BPPV were sequentially randomised, using an online platform, to one of three interventions (re-positioning manoeuvres, Brandt–Daroff exercises or advice). Currently, routine practice in trauma centres does not include ward-based acute vestibular assessment and treatment. Thus, the advice arm constituted no change to current clinical practice, that is, comprised of the 'usual' or 'standard' care for participants. Additionally, there are currently no prospective, randomised treatment studies in acute TBI-related BPPV; thus, there are no data to guide the constituents of an effective intervention or the feasibility of an intervention. The lack of evidence is of critical importance, since the latest clinical guidelines, which follow evidence-based medicine, also do not advise routine assessment and treatment of BPPV in acute TBI. Minimisation criteria were used to ensure a similar distribution of patient-specific factors between intervention groups, including age ≤ 40 years vs > 40 years), TBI severity (highest Glasgow coma scale at 24 hours following GCS ≥ 9 vs GCS < 9) and ability to complete balance measures (Yes vs No). Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — vestibular suppressants recommendation and limited role: Policy level: Recommendation against and Differences of opinion: None. In summary, vestibular suppressant medications are not routinely recommended for treatment of BPPV, other than for the short-term management of autonomic symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting, in a severely symptomatic patient. A general lack of isolated benefit from vestibular suppressants and inferiority to particle repositioning maneuvers indicates that clinicians should not routinely substitute pharmacologic treatment of symptoms associated with BPPV in lieu of other, more effective treatment modalities. Examples of potential short-term uses include patients who are severely symptomatic yet refuse therapy or patients who become severely symptomatic after a CRP, and antiemetics may also be considered for prophylaxis for patients who have previously manifested severe nausea and/or vomiting with the Dix-Hallpike maneuvers and in whom a CRP is planned.

### A prospective multi-center implementation study to improve the diagnosis and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^108fc0a9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo, yet it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in emergency departments (EDs). Despite evidence-based guidelines recommending bedside diagnostic maneuvers (Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test) and canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs), these are infrequently utilized, leading to unnecessary imaging, prolonged symptoms, and increased healthcare utilization.

Objective

This study aimed to implement an educational strategy to improve the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV in the ED by increasing adherence to guideline-based practices.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter interrupted time series study from August 2020 to September 2023. The intervention, developed using the CAN-Implement framework, included online training, quick-reference tools, and a mobile app. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person training was canceled. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of patients receiving the appropriate CRM based on positional test results. Implementation outcomes included fidelity, appropriateness, adoption, penetration, and system impact, reported using the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) guidelines.

Results

We included 1682 patients (1252 pre-intervention, 430 post-intervention). There was no significant change in the primary outcome (appropriate CRM use, OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.76–1.40). However, selective CT use improved (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.09–1.49), supine roll testing increased from 14.2% to 23.5%, and neurology consults decreased from 7.1% to 4.0%. Documentation of diagnostic test descriptors improved, while neurological exam documentation declined.

Conclusion

The intervention did not significantly increase appropriate CRM use but led to improvements in selective imaging, neurology consultation, and horizontal canal testing. Provision of educational tools alone was insufficient to overcome identified environmental barriers. To effectively improve BPPV management in the ED, future efforts should combine hands-on training with system-level supports and workflow integration.

### Management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^b91b01c4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

In vertigo, people experience an illusion of movement of the environment about them, or of themselves with respect to the environment. Vertigo usually originates in the peripheral nervous system (e.g. due to a disorder of the inner ear) but can, rarely, have a CNS origin (e.g. an intracranial tumour or brainstem lesion). It is commonly due to a peripheral disorder known as 'benign paroxysmal positional vertigo' (BPPV). Here we discuss BPPV and the management of patients with the condition, including diagnostic and therapeutic manoeuvres.

### Best practice assessment and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in older adults [^b3146800]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Barrier 11: recurrence of symptoms

Recurrence rates of BPPV are higher in older adults (23.2% vs 18.6%). A phenomenon known as vestibular agnosia can lead to persistent unsteadiness and disequilibrium rather than vertigo, following effective treatment of BPPV, in as many as 30%–61% of cases. This can result in apathy and disengagement as patients feel treatments are unsuccessful.

Solution:

Evaluate symptoms during testing and treatment to educate patients to recognise their symptoms and guide follow-up strategies.
Follow-up people who have been treated, to identify any recurrence of BPPV, and to assess need for balance rehabilitation.
Educate patients about recurrence of BPPV, how to recognise it, and who they should contact to seek treatment. Patient-initiated follow-up is one solution, whereby they can request follow-up if their symptoms recur.

Summary:

Older adults report a wide range of symptoms with BPPV and may not report dizziness. Consider assessing for BPPV in any older adult with balance difficulties or falls.
There is limited evidence specific to the older adult population, and it is the older population who more frequently require modified investigation and treatment of BPPV
Assess the range of motion of the spine, review precautions and consider medical history prior to selecting the most appropriate test, and if indicated treatment.
Consider the number of staff required and clinic environment to adapt tests and treatment to ensure comfort for both patient and staff and effectiveness of the manoeuvre.
Services need clinicians that have training and understanding of a variety of BPPV tests and treatment approaches and cannot use a one treatment fits all approach (Table 1).

Observation — management option for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is described as an option for posterior canal semicircular canal BPPV and lateral semicircular canal BPPV in some patients. Spontaneous symptom resolution of BPPV ranged from 27% to 38%, and a Cochrane commentary noted "successful resolution of BPPV with no treatment except observation in 35%-50% of patients". Adverse effects from CRP are infrequently reported, with nausea during the repositioning maneuver reported at 16.7% to 32%. In one study of untreated patients (n = 34), posterior canal BPPV had a mean time to spontaneous resolution about twice that of lateral canal BPPV (39 vs 16 days). There was no consensus regarding the optimal duration of observation, and waiting for recurrence or persistence of what would be expected to be self-limited symptoms may be 1 possible option to make routine use of CRP and vestibular rehabilitation (VR) services more rational and cost-effective. In older adults, unrecognized BPPV showed higher fall prevalence (78% vs 35%, P = 0.026; OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.2–31). Observation offers benefits of avoiding provocation of new symptoms and discomfort from repositioning maneuvers or VR and may reduce referrals for VR or CRP; patients choosing observation should be informed about the possibility of longer symptom duration and the potential for higher recurrence rates of another BPPV episode.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) persistent symptoms — reassessment and associated conditions are addressed as follows: For persistent lateral canal symptoms, the supine roll test should be repeated and a CRP for lateral canal BPPV may be repeated; some studies indicate cure rates of 86% to 100% with up to 4 CRP treatments. Canal conversion can occur, with initially lateral canal BPPV transforming into posterior canal BPPV in up to 6% of cases and posterior canal BPPV transitioning to lateral canal BPPV also approximating 6%; although rare, 2 semicircular canals may be simultaneously involved. Evidence suggests that balance function continues to be affected between 1 and 3 months after repositioning maneuvers, so reevaluation of BPPV treatment failures should include a search for these associated conditions; when coexisting vestibular system dysfunction is suspected, additional testing should be considered, and this may include audiometric testing to screen for Ménière's disease and eighth nerve pathology, vestibular function testing, and CNS imaging. VR has been shown to be an effective treatment for vestibular symptoms due to the potentially persistent vestibular dysfunction associated with BPPV and may reduce fall risk. CNS disorders can masquerade as BPPV; in 1 study, a CNS disorder explaining BPPV treatment failure was found in 3% of patients, and patients not improving after CRP, especially after 2 or 3 attempted maneuvers, should be evaluated with a thorough neurologic examination, additional CNS testing, and, or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and posterior fossa.

Classification of evidence-based statements — principles and interpretation emphasize that guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm, with statements reflecting both quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinical discretion; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than for a recommendation, whereas options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that best serves their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations, and guidelines represent the best judgment of a team addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic.

### Efficacy of BPPV diagnosis and treatment system for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^8296129e]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of automatic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) diagnosis and treatment system for BPPV compared with the manual repositioning group.

Methods

Two hundred thirty patients diagnosed as idiopathic BPPV who were admitted from August 2018 to July 2019 in Zhejiang Hospital were included. Among them, 150 patients of posterior semicircular canal BPPV(pc-BPPV), 53 patients of horizontal semicircular canal BPPV(hc-BPPV), and 27 patients of horizontal semicircular canal calculus (hc-BPPV-cu) were randomly treated with BPPV diagnosis and treatment system(the experimental group) or manual repositioning (the control group). Resolution of vertigo and nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike and Roll test on day 3, day 7, day 14 and day 28 follow-up after first treatment was the main outcome measure to assess the efficacy of treatment.

Results

At 3-day and 7-day follow-up after treatment with BPPV diagnosis and treatment system, 79%, 91%had complete resolution of vertigo and nystagmus, the effective rate in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group, the differences were statistically significant(P < .05). On day 14, the effective rate in the experimental group (96%) was slightly higher than that in the control group(91%), but there was no significant difference between the two groups. And at 28-day after the first treatment, the effective rate was 100% in the experimental group and the control group. The repositioning efficiency of pc-BPPV (the first, second, third treatment), hc-BPPV (the first, second, third treatment), hc-BPPV-cu(the first, second treatment) in the experimental group were higher than the control group, and the secondary reposition of pc-BPPV in the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group(96%vs.84%; P < .05). While for the hc-BPPV-cu patients, the effective rate of the third treatment in the experimental group was slightly lower than that of the control group, but the differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

BPPV diagnosis and treatment system is effective for the treatment of BPPV, with a better effective rate than those treated with manual maneuver, and is safe and easy to perform on patients.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To describe the pathophysiology of horizontal canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the available maneuvers for its management, and the recommended treatment.

Data Sources

Review Methods

Review of the available literature.

Results

Two theories of pathophysiology underlying the disease are described, along with available maneuvers reflecting those theories; and videos of the maneuvers are provided. A comparison of available treatments is made.

Conclusion

A variety of maneuvers is available related to the pathophysiology underlying the disease. The treatment chosen should be appropriate to the patients' ages, general conditions, and other diseases they may have. No treatment was found to be superior over the others regarding the success rate. In the case of geotropic nystagmus, the Gufoni maneuver is superior in its ease of performance. When it comes to apogeotropic nystagmus, the Barbecue and Gufoni maneuvers have comparable success rates.

Posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) postmaneuver restrictions after CRP have limited supportive evidence, as "Overall, there is insufficient evidence to recommend postmaneuver restrictions for most patients with posterior semicircular canal BPPV who are treated with a CRP". Trials show mixed results, with "At least 9 investigations indicate no effect. Two investigations report statistically significant benefit from use of postmaneuver restrictions". A meta-analysis "conducted a meta-analysis based on data from 6 investigations with 523 patients meeting all inclusion criteria. With this analysis, they found no effect when outcomes from the 2 groups were compared (ie, restrictions vs no restrictions)", whereas a subsequent review "identified 9 studies for further analysis of the effects of postural restrictions on BPPV treatment efficacy. They included data from 528 patients from the 9 trials", finding that restrictions "provided a statistically significant improvement in outcome when the pooled data were considered", but "the authors noted a small effect size and stated that the statistically significant effect highlights only a small improvement in treatment efficacy". More recently, "there have been 2 additional investigations reporting no significant effect of postmaneuver restrictions on BPPV treatment outcome". Populations studied were limited because "these published investigations specifically excluded patients with BPPV and concomitant vestibular disorders, such as Ménière's disease, migraine, vestibular neuritis, and so on. Patients with bilateral and/or multicanal involvement were also excluded", and "It is possible that some of these groups may benefit from postmaneuver restrictions, and this may be considered by the clinician in select cases".

### Effect of vestibular exercises associated with repositioning maneuvers in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^10b9d3aa]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to positional vertigo, it is quite common for patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) to present complaints associated with balance problems and a feeling of dizziness even after repositioning maneuvers.

Objective

It was to evaluate the additional effects of vestibular rehabilitation exercises as a therapeutic resource in the treatment of BPPV, to improve symptoms and reduce recurrence.

Study Design

This was an experimental, prospective, randomized, controlled study.

Setting

Instituto Brasiliense de Otorrinolaringologia (IBORL) from August 2016 to September 2017.

Patients

Thirty-two individuals, both men and women, over 18 years of age with BPPV.

Intervention

They were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group (n = 15) performing only the maneuver technique as treatment and the experimental group (n = 17) performing the maneuvers and vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Patients underwent treatment and responded to the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) and visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires for comparison between groups. Participants were followed up for 6 months to observe recurrence of symptoms.

Main Outcome Measures

To investigate the additional effects of vestibular exercises in the treatment of BPPV.

Results

The experimental group had a lower level of dizziness in the posttreatment period (p < 0.05) and a lower incidence of recurrences (p = 0.038) than the control group.

Conclusions

Vestibular exercises performed after repositioning treatments for BPPV increased the overall efficacy of treatment by improving symptoms with a lower rate of recurrence.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^0338731a]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in under 40-year-olds in the UK. Imbalance and dizziness secondary to vestibular dysfunction, involving damage to peripheral and/or central vestibular structures, affect most patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. Persistent vestibular dysfunction is linked to physical and psychosocial morbidity, including delayed return-to-workand falls. Critically, falls causing unintentional trauma are linked to excess mortality in community-dwelling TBI survivors.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent cause of peripheral vestibular dysfunction in acute TBIand is a treatable risk factor for falls in idiopathic BPPV. However, current evidence indicates that routine assessment and treatment of BPPV in acute TBI is uncommon, seemingly due to a variety of knowledge and role-based barriers. Notably, previous qualitative work demonstrated that healthcare professionals had concerns regarding the assessment and treatment procedures for BPPV in the acute TBI cohort, while post-traumatic dizziness was viewed by some as self-limiting and non-specific. These concerns also included practical considerations such as patients' pain, cognition and how to complete procedures in those with spinal and limb trauma. Healthcare professionals were also apprehensive about patients' tolerability and response to treatment. Currently, there are no patient- or healthcare professional-derived data on the tolerability, practicability or acceptability of BPPV assessment and treatment procedures in acute TBI. This would be critical for the implementation of any changes to practice. Furthermore, there are no prospective data on the effectiveness of treatment, via repositioning manoeuvres, in post-traumatic BPPV. Indeed, despite the frequency of BPPV in the TBI population, the latest clinical guidelines for early head injury management do not mention the need for vestibular, or more specifically BPPV, assessment or treatment.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline — diagnosis and testing: Clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and the maneuver should be repeated with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative (Strong recommendation). If the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus, the clinician should perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV (Recommendation). Clinicians should differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo (Recommendation). Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging (Recommendation (against)), and clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing (Recommendation (against)).

### Epley maneuver for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: evidence synthesis for guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department [^b0e02e79]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Canalith repositioning maneuvers (such as the Epley maneuver) are recommended by specialty guidelines for management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) yet are frequently underutilized in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews to summarize the evidence of Epley maneuver for the treatment of posterior canal (pc) BPPV in any setting. We included systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared Epley to control in adult patients with pc-BPPV. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened in duplicate. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment was used to rate certainty of evidence. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Meta-analysis of individual studies was conducted with random and fixed effects.

Results

From 2,228 titles, 7 systematic reviews were selected for quality assessment. One review was of higher methodological quality, included only RCTs, and was the most current and comprehensive. Five of the 11 RCTs of the review, including 312 patients with pc-BPPV diagnosed by Dix-Hallpike, were relevant to our question. Meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (251 patients) showed the use of Epley (as compared to control) was associated with higher complete resolution of vertigo at 1 week (OR 7.19, CI 1.52 to 33.98, moderate certainty). Meta-analysis of 3 RCTs (195 patients) showed the use of Epley was associated with higher conversion to negative Dix-Hallpike at 1 week (OR 6.67, CI 1.52 to 33.98, moderate certainty). The number-needed-to-treat was 3. Meta-analysis of the outcomes at 1 month, and when observational studies were included, showed similar results. No serious adverse effects were reported.

Conclusions

Symptoms of pc-BPPV improve with the Epley maneuver. Emergency clinicians should become familiar with performing the Epley for BPPV. Further studies on ED implementation and clinician education of Epley are needed.

To review the effectiveness of the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) in the treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with a critical review of the literature and meta-analysis.

Study Design

Meta-analysis.

Methods

Studies eligible for inclusion were randomized, controlled trials of the CRP performed on clearly defined cases of BPPV. A total of nine studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified by two independent literature searches of Medline. Treatment and control groups were compared for symptom resolution and elimination of a positive Dix-Hallpike test.

Results

Patients treated with CRP were more likely to demonstrate symptom resolution (odds ratio [OR] 4.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8–7.6) and negative Dix-Hallpike (OR 5.2; 95% CI 3.0–8.8) at the time of first follow-up. The effect of CRP for symptom improvement was strongest within the first month after treatment (OR 4.1; 95% CI 3.1–5.2) with some decline thereafter (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.7–3.9). Conversely, the ability of CRP to produce a negative Dix-Hallpike strengthened between the first month after treatment (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.8–4.0) and later follow-up times (OR 5.0; 95% CI 3.9–6.1).

Conclusions

The CRP is more effective than control in resolving vertigo and positive Dix-Hallpike associated with BPPV. This finding was consistent among a variety of studies using different study designs. Untreated patients may demonstrate symptom improvement with time; however, many will continue to have a positive Dix-Hallpike when examined. Resolution of vertigo in untreated patients is therefore most likely because of avoidance of provocative positions.

### Diagnostic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic aspects of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^407f5496]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder. It can be defined as transient vertigo induced by a rapid head position change, associated with a characteristic paroxysmal positional nystagmus. Canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal is considered the most convincing theory of its pathogenesis and the development of appropriate therapeutic maneuvers resulted in its effective treatment. However, involvement of the horizontal or the anterior canal has been found in a significant rate and the recognition and treatment of these variants completed the clinical picture of the disease. This paper describes the advances in understanding how this disease is generated and discusses the current therapeutic modalities.

### Vestibular rehabilitation [^5db8e435]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the research from 2011 through 2012 on treatment efficacy in two common vestibular disorders - vestibular hypofunction and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).

Recent Findings

Significant numbers of randomized controlled trials now support the use of specific exercises for the treatment of patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. We do not know if some treatment approaches are more effective than others. There is preliminary evidence that head movement may be the component critical to recovered function and decreased symptoms. Some patient characteristics and initial assessment results appear to predict treatment outcome but the evidence is incomplete. Treatment of posterior canal BPPV canalithiasis is well established. New evidence supports certain treatments for horizontal canal BPPV.

Summary

Treatments for unilateral vestibular hypofunction and for posterior canal BPPV are effective; however, there are many as yet unanswered questions such as why some patients with vestibular hypofunction do not improve with a course of vestibular exercises. We also do not know what would be the best treatment for anterior canal BPPV or for multiple-canal involvement BPPV.

### Modifications of the epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) [^bee43a26]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Benign paroxsymal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo associated with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology (ENT) clinics. BPPV of the posterior canal is a specific type of BPPV for which the Epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre is a verified treatment. A range of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre are used in clinical practice, including post-Epley vestibular exercises and post-Epley postural restrictions.

Objectives

To assess whether the various modifications of the Epley manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV enhance its efficacy in clinical practice.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 15 December 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre versus a standard Epley manoeuvre as a control in adults with posterior canal BPPV diagnosed with a positive Dix-Hallpike test. Specific modifications sought were: application of vibration/oscillation to the mastoid region, vestibular rehabilitation exercises, additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre and post-treatment instructions relating to movement restriction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and the third author reviewed and resolved any disagreement. Two authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardised data forms. All authors independently assessed the trials for risk of bias.

Main Results

The review includes 11 trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used post-Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data. All nine trials included the conversion of a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure. Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restrictions in the frequency of Dix-Hallpike conversion when compared to the Epley manoeuvre alone. In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients versus 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control group converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.22, P = 0.002). No serious adverse effects were reported, however three studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, dizziness and disequilibrium in some patients. There was no evidence of benefit of mastoid oscillation applied during the Epley manoeuvre, or of additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre. No adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence supporting a statistically significant effect of post-Epley postural restrictions in comparison to the Epley manoeuvre alone. However, it important to note that this statistically significant effect only highlights a small improvement in treatment efficacy. An Epley manoeuvre alone is effective in just under 80% of patients with typical BPPV. The additional intervention of postural restrictions has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be cured in most instances. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoid oscillation during the Epley manoeuvre, or additional steps in an 'augmented' Epley manoeuvre. Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes. Further studies should employ a rigorous randomisation technique, blinded outcome assessment, a post-treatment Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure and longer-term follow-up of patients.

### Epley and beyond: an update on treating positional vertigo [^cdda9e32]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the commonest cause of dizziness. It is characterised by brief episodes of vertigo and imbalance with nystagmus. The direction of nystagmus allows the identification of the culprit semicircular canal. As it is readily treatable — and often curable — BPPV should not be missed. Although recurrent episodes of vertigo triggered by movement suggest BPPV, the diagnosis can only be confirmed with the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre. Here we review the diagnostic manoeuvres required to diagnose BPPV, and the various repositioning manoeuvres for treating different types of BPPV.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^76bb1665]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) affects approximately half of acute, moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. To date, there have been no rigorous studies of BPPV assessment or treatment in this cohort. We aimed to determine the safety, practicability, and efficacy of therapist-led BPPV management in acute TBI and the feasibility of a larger effectiveness trial.

Methods

This was a multi-centre, three-arm, parallel-groups, randomised, feasibility trial. Recruitment was via convenience sampling. The main inclusion criteria were age over 18 years and a confirmed, non-penetrating, acute TBI. BPPV-positive patients were randomly allocated to one of three interventions (repositioning manoeuvres, Brandt–Daroff exercises or advice) using minimisation criteria. Outcome assessors were blinded to the intervention.

Results

Of 2014 patients screened for inclusion, 180 were assessed for BPPV. Of those assessed, 34% (62/180) had BPPV, and 58 patients received an intervention. Therapist-led interventions were delivered safely and accurately according to intervention monitoring criteria. Resolution of BPPV was observed in 35/58 (60%) patients. The resolution rate was highest following repositioning manoeuvres (78%), followed by the advice (53%) and Brandt–Daroff interventions (42%). 10 patients experienced recurrence. This was observed more frequently in those with skull fractures and bilateral or mixed BPPV.

Conclusions

Overall, the results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of a future trial. Therapist-led management of BPPV in acute TBI was safe and practicable. Repositioning manoeuvres seemingly yielded a superior treatment effect. However, given the high recurrence rate of post-traumatic BPPV, the optimal time to treat according to patients' specific recurrence risk requires further investigation.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) diagnostic pathway — patients with compatible history or symptoms proceed to differentiate BPPV from other causes of vertigo. If consistent with BPPV, evaluation includes performing the Dix-Hallpike maneuver for posterior canal BPPV with assessment for torsional up-beating nystagmus and, when indicated, the supine roll test for lateral canal BPPV with characteristic direction changing nystagmus. The algorithm also includes do not obtain radiographic imaging and do not order vestibular testing.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient information — definition, triggers, symptoms, and epidemiology are described: BPPV is "the most common inner ear problem and cause of vertigo", and "certain head positions or movements can trigger a spell". Common symptoms are "distinct triggered spells of vertigo or spinning sensations" with nausea, disorientation, and instability, and "these symptoms will be intense for seconds to minutes". In seniors, it can present as "an isolated sense of instability brought on by position change", and BPPV "does not affect your hearing or cause you to faint", with "the natural course of BPPV" being to "become less severe over time". BPPV is very common and "is more common in older people", with most cases occurring "for no reason" though associations include trauma, migraine, other inner ear problems, diabetes, osteoporosis, and prolonged bed rest. Mechanistically, BPPV occurs when inner ear calcium carbonate crystals become "unglued" and "float around and/or get stuck on sensors", and symptom intensity relates to how long the crystal/sensor takes "to settle after you move or change your head or body position".

### Guideline adherence to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo treatment and management in primary care [^b9b89c80]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine adherence to the 2017 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guidelines for the management and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in primary care (PC) and compare whether key recommendations differed by sex, race, or insurance status.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Twenty-six clinic locations within a single healthcare system.

Methods

Charts of 458 patients diagnosed with BPPV in PC between 2018 and 2022 were reviewed. Encounters where the diagnosis of BPPV was made were identified. From the clinical encounter note, demographics, symptomatology, management, and treatment were extracted. Nonparametric analyses were used to identify whether AAO-HNS guidelines differed regarding sex, race, or insurance status.

Results

Of 458 patients, 249 (54.4%) did not receive a diagnostic exam, and only 4 (0.9%) patients received imaging. Regarding treatment, only 51 (11.1%) received the Epley maneuver, with 263 (57.4%) receiving vestibular suppressant medication and 12.4% receiving a referral to a specialist. In regard to sex, race, or insurance status, there was no significant difference in receiving a Dix-Hallpike diagnostic maneuver, Epley maneuver, vestibular suppressant medication, imaging, or referral to a specialist.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that there continue to be gaps in the adherence to AAO-HNS guidelines; however, these gaps did not differ by sex, race, or insurance status. Care should be taken to increase the use of diagnostic and treatment maneuvers but decrease the use of vestibular-suppressant medications for the treatment of BPPV in PC.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) executive summary [^b6581d79]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the "Clinical Practice Guideline: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (Update)". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing, and increasing the appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

Statement 1b — diagnosis of lateral (horizontal) semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — If the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus, the clinician should perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV. Recommendation based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B and level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits include avoiding missed diagnoses and allowing accurate diagnosis of lateral canal BPPV with avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatment; risks include provoking temporary symptoms of BPPV. Benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; policy level: Recommendation. Exceptions include patients with physical limitations including cervical stenosis, severe kyphoscoliosis, limited cervical range of motion, Down's syndrome, severe rheumatoid arthritis, cervical radiculopathies, Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, low back dysfunction, spinal cord injuries, and the morbidly obese.

### Canalith repositioning variations for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^832150e8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if variations in common treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) affected efficacy.

Study Design

Prospective, pseudo-randomized study.

Setting

Outpatient practice in a tertiary care facility.

Subjects and Methods

Patients (n = 118) with unilateral BPPV of the posterior canal, including 13 patients with BPPV of the lateral canal, were tested at a tertiary care center on one of five interventions: canalith repositioning maneuver (CRP), CRP plus home exercise, modified CRP, CRP for patients with involvement of two semicircular canals, and self-CRP home exercise. Self-CRP was also compared to previously published data on efficacy of the Brandt Daroff exercise. Main outcome measures were vertigo intensity and frequency, presence/absence of Dix-Hallpike responses, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale (VADL), and computerized dynamic posturography.

Results

Vertigo intensity and frequency and Dix-Hallpike responses decreased significantly, and posturography and VADL improved significantly from pre- to post tests. No other significant changes were found. The groups did not differ significantly. Vertigo intensity and frequency were not strongly related at pretest but were related at post-test. Length of illness and age did not influence the results.

Conclusion

However the head is moved, as long as it is moved rapidly enough and through the correct planes in space, repositioning treatments are likely to be effective. Therefore, clinicians have a range of choices in selecting the treatment best suited for each patient's unique needs.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^91ddba35]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that clinical, bedside assessment and treatment of acute post-traumatic BPPV is safe and practical. Trial progression criteria were met, supporting the advancement to a multi-centre effectiveness trial. Repositioning manoeuvres demonstrated a superior resolution rate, but high rates of BPPV recurrence mean optimal timing of treatment remains unclear. BPPV resolution was associated with improved gait speed (itself linked to lower fall risk), while active BPPV was linked to falls. Thus, treating post-traumatic BPPV may modify fall risk.

Postprocedural restrictions after CRP for posterior canal BPPV — Clinicians should not recommend postprocedural postural restrictions after CRP for posterior canal BPPV; this is a strong recommendation against based on RCTs with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action profile cites quality improvement opportunity, aggregate evidence quality Grade A, high confidence, benefits including faster return to normal lifestyle and reduced anxiety and costs, potential risk for increased failure risk in a small subset of patients, a preponderance of benefit on benefit-harm assessment, no value judgments, intentional vagueness about what restrictions encompass, a small role for patient preferences, no exceptions, and a policy level of strong recommendation against.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) in primary care and application variability: treatment effects between CRP and control tended to diminish over time; in a primary care setting, symptomatic benefit was not significant, although conversion to a negative Dix‑Hallpike at 1 week was more likely with CRP than sham; considerable variability exists in initial application, with some using only 1 CRP cycle and others repeating cycles until vertigo extinguishes or the Dix‑Hallpike converts negative.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^be39c575]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) implementation and patient counseling — barriers noted include that many clinicians are likely to be unfamiliar with the CRP or other treatment maneuvers and that diagnosing physicians may be unable or unwilling to take additional time to treat BPPV at the same office visit as diagnosis. Access may improve because increasing familiarity with CRP or additional training of clinicians such as audiologists, physical therapists, and other providers may facilitate patients' access to CRP, and training courses on performance of the CRP offered at clinical education meetings will also help overcome this barrier. Patients may seek simpler solutions such as medication therapy for BPPV, but medication therapy has not been shown effective in the treatment of BPPV and clinicians will need to educate patients that these medications offer more harm than benefit; additional education with handouts or brochures describing risks including risks for falls, recurrence of BPPV, and treatment options, plus algorithms for fall assessment and home safety assessment, will allow clinicians to stratify patients about these risks.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — comparative effectiveness of medications versus repositioning maneuvers: There is no evidence in the literature to suggest that any of these vestibular suppressant medications are effective as a definitive, primary treatment for BPPV or effective as a substitute for repositioning maneuvers. In 1 double-blind controlled trial comparing diazepam, lorazepam, and placebo, all groups showed a gradual decline in symptoms with no additional relief in the drug treatment arms. A small study compared particle repositioning maneuvers to a medication-alone treatment arm and found that particle repositioning maneuvers had substantially higher treatment response rates (78.6%-93.3% improvement) compared with medication alone (30.8% improvement) at 2-week follow-up. Similar findings were noted when comparing canal repositioning maneuvers to betahistine where patients randomized to canal repositioning maneuvers had faster physical and mental recovery than their pharmacologic counterparts. A more recent study showed that patients who underwent the Epley maneuver alone recovered faster than those who underwent the Epley maneuver and concurrently received a labyrinthine sedative, and the addition of an antihistamine to canal repositioning maneuvers demonstrated no change in the Dizziness Handicap Inventory score.
