## Question

What's the dose for the lidocaine topical for peripheral neuropathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of topical lidocaine for peripheral neuropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which topical lidocaine formulations are relevant and FDA-labeled. Then, I should verify the labeled dosing for the 5% patch and whether it applies beyond postherpetic neuralgia. Next, I will review guideline positions for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and other localized neuropathic pain. After that, I should check pharmacokinetics and safety constraints that inform maximum use. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, condition-specific dosing recommendation with monitoring and counseling points, and I will double-check for any exceptions or off-label nuances I might miss.

> Let me first confirm the formulation and indication context. The most studied and commonly used topical lidocaine product for neuropathic pain is the 5% medicated patch/plaster, which is FDA-approved for postherpetic neuralgia and contains 700 mg lidocaine per 10 × 14 cm patch, with several bioequivalent generics and a 1.8% topical system that delivers comparable exposure with a lower drug load per system [^44d73d96] [^8f661ce9].

> I need to verify the labeled dosing instructions. The FDA labeling for the 5% lidocaine patch specifies application of up to three patches at a time for 12 hours, followed by a 12-hour patch-free interval, and this 12 hours on/12 hours off cycle is the standard regimen. Patches can be cut to fit the painful area, and they should be applied only to intact skin, not to open wounds or inflamed skin [^44d73d96] [^f40e85de].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using the same dose for diabetic peripheral neuropathy or other peripheral neuropathies. I should confirm guideline positions. The American Diabetes Association's 2025 Standards note that lidocaine patches have limited data in DPN and are not effective in some DPN phenotypes, and when used, they should not be applied for more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period, aligning with the labeled regimen; the AAN guideline suggests considering topical therapies, including lidocaine, when patients prefer topical options, but it does not specify a dose beyond standard patch use; the AAFP 2024 guideline lists topical lidocaine as a second-line option for DPN, again implying standard patch dosing rather than a different regimen [^9ba7cd8b] [^51395103] [^161bc294].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for non-PHN peripheral neuropathic pain. Multiple reviews and guidelines place topical lidocaine as a second-line or adjunctive option for localized peripheral neuropathic pain, with modest efficacy signals and favorable tolerability; real-world and comparative studies in painful DPN suggest clinically meaningful pain reductions and better tolerability versus oral agents, though these are nonrandomized and should be interpreted cautiously; nonetheless, they support using the standard 5% patch regimen when topical therapy is chosen [^ad6d5783] [^557c65ef] [^7f259b8c].

> I should confirm the pharmacokinetic rationale for the 12-hour limit. With three 5% patches, the maximum theoretical lidocaine exposure is about 2.1 g, yet only about 3% is systemically absorbed, yielding low plasma levels and a favorable safety profile when used on intact skin; however, absorption increases with broken skin or excessive duration, so adhering to the 12-hour on/12-hour off schedule and avoiding use on damaged skin mitigates systemic toxicity risk [^e8e1adef] [^44d73d96].

> Let me consider practical application details. Patches should be placed directly over the area of maximal pain, overlapping as needed to cover the painful region, and can be trimmed to fit. A typical trial of 2–4 weeks is reasonable to assess response, with adjustments in the number of patches (up to three) based on pain distribution and tolerability; if effective, many patients continue long term with sustained benefit and low adverse event rates in observational cohorts [^12315c7f] [^160f8781].

> But wait, what if someone proposes continuous wear beyond 12 hours for added benefit? I should double-check that this is not recommended. The label and safety data support a mandatory 12-hour off period to prevent accumulation and local skin irritation, and there is no high-quality evidence that continuous wear improves outcomes while maintaining safety; therefore, I should advise against exceeding 12 hours in a 24-hour period [^44d73d96] [^9ba7cd8b].

> I will now examine alternatives and special situations. For patients with focal, well-circumscribed pain who cannot tolerate or prefer to avoid systemic therapy, topical lidocaine is a reasonable option; for diffuse polyneuropathy or when pain extends beyond what patches can reasonably cover, systemic first-line agents remain preferred; in elderly or multimorbid patients, the low systemic exposure of topical lidocaine can be advantageous, though I should still screen for skin integrity and allergies before prescribing [^ad6d5783] [^55434760] [^55af095b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final, condition-aware dosing recommendation. For peripheral neuropathic pain, when topical lidocaine is indicated or preferred, use the 5% lidocaine patch: apply up to three patches to the painful area for 12 hours, then remove and leave off for 12 hours before reapplication; this cycle can be repeated daily, and patches may be cut to fit the pain territory. A therapeutic trial of 2–4 weeks is appropriate to judge efficacy, and use should be limited to intact skin with monitoring for local irritation or rare hypersensitivity [^44d73d96] [^12315c7f] [^9ba7cd8b].

---

The recommended dose of topical lidocaine for peripheral neuropathy is **5% lidocaine patches**, applied as up to three patches at a time for 12 hours, followed by a 12-hour patch-free period [^44d73d96] [^f40e85de]. Each patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine, and the maximum daily dose is **three patches (2,100 mg)** [^e8e1adef]. This regimen is supported for postherpetic neuralgia and may be considered for other localized neuropathic pain, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, though evidence is weaker and use is often second-line [^ad6d5783] [^161bc294]. Apply only to intact skin, avoid broken or inflamed areas, and monitor for local irritation or hypersensitivity [^f40e85de].

---

## Recommended dosage and application

- **Formulation**: 5% lidocaine medicated plaster (patch) [^44d73d96].
- **Patch size**: 10 cm × 14 cm, containing 700 mg lidocaine per patch [^e8e1adef].
- **Standard regimen**: Apply up to three patches to the painful area for 12 hours, then remove and leave off for 12 hours; repeat daily [^f40e85de].
- **Maximum dose**: Three patches per day (total 2,100 mg lidocaine) [^f40e85de].
- **Application site**: Intact skin only; avoid open wounds, broken, or inflamed skin [^f40e85de].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosage

- **Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)**: Strong evidence supports 5% lidocaine patches for PHN, with randomized controlled trials showing significant pain reduction and improved quality of life [^a8456192] [^4f596379].
- **Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)**: Evidence is moderate; some guidelines list topical lidocaine as a second-line option, and real-world data suggest benefit in refractory cases [^161bc294] [^557c65ef].
- **Other localized neuropathies**: Small studies and case series report benefit in post-surgical and post-traumatic neuropathic pain, but high-quality evidence is limited [^22a4cbd6] [^4f596379].

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

- **Systemic absorption**: Minimal (~3%) with intact skin; risk rises with broken skin or excessive use [^e8e1adef].
- **Local reactions**: Mild erythema, itching, or rash are common; usually resolve after removal [^44d73d96].
- **Systemic toxicity**: Rare with topical use; avoid overdose and monitor for CNS or cardiac effects if absorbed excessively [^2559a479].
- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics; avoid use on mucous membranes or eyes [^e188ac3a].

## Comparison with other topical agents

| **Attribute** | **Lidocaine 5% patch** | **Capsaicin 8% patch** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Sodium channel blockade | TRPV1 desensitization |
| Application | 12 hours on, 12 hours off | Single 30–60 minute application every 3 months |
| Efficacy | Moderate in PHN; limited in DPN | Moderate in PHN and DPN |
| Side effects | Local irritation | Burning pain, erythema |
| Guideline status | Second-line for DPN | Second-line for DPN |

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggest topical lidocaine as a **second-line option** for painful diabetic neuropathy, particularly when oral medications are not tolerated or are contraindicated [^notfound]. The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) recommends topical lidocaine as **first-line therapy for elderly patients with PHN** because of its favorable safety profile [^12315c7f].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Ideal for localized, focal neuropathic pain with allodynia or hyperalgesia [^c12c96eb].
- **Trial period**: Use for 2–4 weeks to assess response; discontinue if ineffective [^12315c7f].
- **Combination therapy**: Can be combined with oral agents for additive effect in refractory cases [^246abf27].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess pain, function, and adverse effects; adjust the number of patches to the painful area [^44d73d96].

---

The standard topical lidocaine regimen for peripheral neuropathy is **5% patches, up to three at a time for 12 hours with a 12-hour break**, with strongest support in PHN and conditional use in DPN; apply to intact skin and monitor for local reactions.

Background

Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic that is sometimes used on the skin to treat neuropathic pain.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of topical lidocaine for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and to assess the associated adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 1 July 2014, together with the reference lists of retrieved papers and other reviews. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing any formulation of topical lidocaine with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were adults aged 18 and over. We included only full journal publication articles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design); second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and that we considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison; and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that we considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both.

Main Results

We included 12 studies (508 participants) in comparisons with placebo or an active control. Six studies enrolled participants with moderate or severe postherpetic neuralgia, and the remaining studies enrolled different, or mixed, neuropathic pain conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia and postsurgical or post-traumatic neuralgia. Four different formulations were used: 5% medicated patch, 5% cream, 5% gel, and 8% spray. Most studies used a cross-over design, and two used a parallel-group design. Two studies used enriched enrolment with randomised withdrawal. Seven studies used multiple doses, with one to four-week treatment periods, and five used single applications. We judged all of the studies at high risk of bias because of small size or incomplete outcome assessment, or both. There was no first or second tier evidence, and no pooling of data was possible for efficacy outcomes. Only one multiple-dose study reported our primary outcome of participants with ≥ 50% or ≥ 30% pain intensity reduction. Three single-dose studies reported participants who were pain-free at a particular time point, or had a 2-point (of 10) reduction in pain intensity. The two enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal studies reported time to loss of efficacy. In all but one study, third tier (very low quality) evidence indicated that lidocaine was better than placebo for some measure of pain relief. Pooling multiple-dose studies across conditions demonstrated no clear evidence of an effect of lidocaine on the incidence of adverse events or withdrawals, but there were few events and the withdrawal phase of enriched enrolment designs is not suitable to assess the true impact of adverse events (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no evidence from good quality randomised controlled studies to support the use of topical lidocaine to treat neuropathic pain, although individual studies indicated that it was effective for relief of pain. Clinical experience also supports efficacy in some patients. Several large ongoing studies, of adequate duration, with clinically useful outcomes should provide more robust conclusions about both efficacy and harm.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^ab49c5d1]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

The use of NNT can be criticized for several reasons and can only be calculated reliably for parallel designed, placebo-controlled studies with comparable inclusion and exclusion criteria. As study designs for the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster trials were mainly withdrawal designs, NNT calculation was often not possible. Thus, by using this assessment method, very few studies with NNT data are available for the 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster. However, the available NNT data are in line with those recommended as first-line medications. In fact, in patients with various localized peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes, including the presence of mechanical allodynia, the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster as an add-on therapy reduced ongoing pain and allodynia with an NNT of 4.4 (2.5–17.5). This is an important observation because, in clinical practice, multimodal therapy is considered the "gold standard" for the treatment of localized peripheral neuropathic pain. Moreover, there is a knowledge gap in the majority of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, as they have not been able to provide recommendations for the treatment of individuals who fail monotherapy. In fact, for patients who are treated based on these guideline recommendations and do not experience at least 50% pain control, the core of the NNT concept, clinicians are currently using multimodal therapy with the addition of a second, third, or even fourth medication based on the age of the patient, potential for drug–drug interactions, potential for side effects, and opportunity to also treat comorbid conditions (eg, insomnia, depression, or anxiety). Consequently, the available guidelines have very little clinical application to daily practice as data on the use of multimodal therapy in the treatment of neuropathic pain are lacking. Moreover, there are serious flaws in performing the analysis of the studies as it was done for the guidelines:
Recommendations are mainly based on NNTs that are derived from the evaluation of pain based on visual analog scales. Clinical pain researchers have recognized that this evaluation may not be accurate, and patient global impression of pain improvement, psychosocial functioning, and activity are now utilized to fully evaluate the success of analgesic medication.
The role of anxiety and depression in amplifying pain symptoms is also not accounted for in these studies.
The placebo effect introduced by the research nurses may also be a potential bias in these evaluations.–
The statistical design varies from study to study. Some studies use the baseline evaluation carried forward, whereas others use the last evaluation carried forward when analyzing data for patients who dropped out of the studies. This has not been accounted for in the analysis done for the guidelines.
The maximum dose used for the majority of the medications studied varies from study to study. Thus, efficacy can be expected to vary as well. Clinicians are universally using higher doses/numbers of plasters for the treatment of their patients as postmarketing studies have demonstrated increased analgesic efficacy when this approach is utilized.

Discussion

This review provides an updated summary of the published clinical experience with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in a wide range of LNP conditions. The data presented suggest that the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option in patients with LNP, particularly those with PHN. Indeed, numerous systematic reviews and international guidelines include the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster as a first-line option in PHN.

In contrast, a recent systematic review/meta-analysis, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria and an assessment of number needed to treat (NNT) for 50% pain relief as a primary measure, recommends the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster as a second-line treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The analysis included randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with parallel group or crossover study designs that had at least ten patients per group – from these data, NNTs were generated. Randomized, enriched enrollment withdrawal trials were summarized separately. As discussed earlier, a number of pivotal studies of the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster were enriched enrollment/withdrawal studies, a study design that is not conducive to inclusion/consideration in meta-analyses. This is despite the fact that this study design is in agreement with regulatory authority (eg, US FDA) guidance for the approval of analgesic medications. Enrichment designs can be useful to determine the success of a medication when compared to placebo because it allows for the decrease in early study dropouts caused by adverse events. This is particularly important in studies evaluating the therapeutic effect of a pain medication because the placebo effect is very strong in patients with pain. Furthermore, an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial design allows the ability to detect desirable efficacy in a subgroup (and may, therefore, provide a strategy for establishing pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic patient profiles), and it can cope with initial dose titration to mimic clinical practice, with the promise of greater translational impact. Based on a comparison of results from enriched and nonenriched enrollment randomized withdrawal clinical trials of opioids in chronic noncancer pain, there also appears to be no difference in efficacy between enriched and nonenriched studies. However, in the systematic review by Finnerup et al, one of the consequences of summarizing enriched enrollment studies separately and excluding studies in everyday clinical practice, which represent a large proportion of actual usage, is that NNTs were not determined for the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster, resulting in a weak recommendation for use.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^72b75304]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to its safety profile and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio, topical lidocaine could be an excellent alternative on its own or as an addition to systemic medications and nonpharmacologic approaches for optimized pain management and multimodal analgesia. However, more evidence is needed to support its analgesic efficacy. Like capsaicin, there is a growing need for more randomized controlled trials with larger patient cohorts to evaluate the analgesic potential of high-concentration topical lidocaine in various chronic and neuropathic pain conditions. In the management of cancer pain, topical lidocaine can be used as a coanalgesic in the form of either high-dose patches or low-dose local anesthetic creams. However, similar to capsaicin, topical lidocaine is not recommended as main analgesic for the treatment of nonneuropathic cancer pain, as opioids remain the most effective analgesics for this specific type of pain.

### Topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain: applying the evidence [^f5dc840e]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (NP) may only achieve partial pain relief with currently recommended first-line oral treatments, which are also associated with systemic adverse events. Topical treatments are currently considered second- or third-line options, but a recent pharmacologic treatment algorithm has called for broader first-line use of these agents. This has highlighted a need to communicate the benefits associated with topical agents, in particular around the efficacy, targeted local action, and limited systemic availability resulting in minimal systemic adverse events and drug-drug interactions.

Objectives

This review aims to evaluate the evidence base for topical therapies currently used to treat peripheral NP, discuss the evidence comparing these treatments head-to-head with oral standard of care, and evaluate how they fit into treatment regimens in the "real world".

Methods

This is a narrative review.

Results

Two topical treatments are currently licensed: lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (post-herpetic neuralgia) and the capsaicin 8% patch (peripheral NP). When compared head to head with the oral standard of care (pregabalin), the lidocaine 5% medicated plaster provided similar relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia but did not meet the primary predefined criteria for noninferiority. The capsaicin 8% patch, however, demonstrated noninferior efficacy when compared head-to-head with pregabalin across a wide range of peripheral NP etiologies. Importantly, both treatments demonstrated effective pain relief without the systemic adverse events associated with oral therapies.

Conclusion

First-line use of topical agents may be of particular benefit in patients where the safety and tolerability of oral therapy is a concern.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^c12c96eb]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Topical — Lidocaine, Capsaicin, and Transdermal Substances

The side effect profile of TCAs, SNRIs, and gabapentanoids requires extremely cautious dosing in many patients, especially the elderly, with some patients having side effects with the lowest available doses. As an alternative, topical medications are supported by multiple guidelines, but where they fit into the algorithm varies from firstline to not at all. The topical preparations referred to in guidelines are limited to lidocaine patches and capsaicin. However, there is some evidence on other topical antineuropathics that may provide a practical solution in some patients who are intolerant, or in whom it is unsafe to use oral medications.

Lidocaine. Topical lidocaine works by decreasing ectopic firing of peripheral nerves. It is recommended as firstline or second-line for the treatment of focal neuropathic pain such as post-herpetic neuralgia. However, it has been shown to be ineffective in postsurgical neuropathic pain and diabetic peripheral neuropathy with allodynia or hyperalgesia. It is difficult to apply topical lidocaine to the distal extremity neuropathies. A 5% lidocaine patch has been shown to be effective in five RCTs in post-herpetic neuralgia with brush allodynia and to be noninferior to pregabalin with better tolerability. A modest decrease in pain is commonly seen, but it is safe and well tolerated by the elderly. A standard trial period should be three weeks.

Effectiveness of Topical Lidocaine in Pain Management

Topical lidocaine is widely used for various pain conditions due to its limited absorption and relative lack of systemic adverse effects, making it an attractive option for many vulnerable patients. For acute pain in superficial surgical procedures, such as minor skin excisions or painful biopsies, lidocaine-containing creams like EMLA can be used. EMLA cream consists of lidocaine and prilocaine in a 1:1 ratio (25 mg each per gram) combined with a thickener (carboxypolymethylene), an emulsifier (polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters), and water. This formulation creates a eutectic oil-in-water emulsion, allowing the lidocaine and prilocaine to remain in liquid form at room temperature. Adverse events are generally mild and localized, typically involving minor allergic reactions.

A higher-concentration patch containing 5% lidocaine (w/w) can be applied to the painful area for 12 h per day, followed by a 12-h break. The maximum dose is three patches within a 24-h period. As with the capsaicin patch, topical lidocaine should be applied only to intact skin, not to open wounds, burns, or broken or inflamed skin, avoiding contact with the eyes, and the patch should cover the entire painful area. Although primarily indicated for postherpetic neuralgia (table 1), it may also be effective for carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and osteoarthritis-induced pain.

For neuropathic pain, lidocaine patches were previously recommended as a first-line treatment alongside tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin, and gabapentin. However, the most recent meta-analysis by NeuPSIG and a Cochrane review found low effect sizes and low-quality evidence for the efficacy of topical lidocaine. As a result, NeuPSIG no longer recommends lidocaine patches as a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain and instead gives it a weak recommendation. However, due to its good safety profile, high patient values and preferences, and positive results from initial short-term studies, they still propose topical lidocaine as a second-line treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain (fig. 3; table 2).

Mechanisms of Action of Topical Lidocaine

Lidocaine was discovered at the Institute of Chemistry at Stockholm University (Stockholm, Sweden) and was the first local anesthetic with an amino amide structure. Its primary mechanism of action is in reducing the open probability of voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly Na (v) 1.7 and Na (v) 1.8, in peripheral nerves(fig. 1). Although lidocaine can also affect the activity of other ion channels such as hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and neurotransmitter receptors when applied systemically, it is unclear whether these effects contribute significantly to peripheral analgesia of topical applications.

Lidocaine is absorbed well and rapidly from mucous membranes and from injection sites, but poorly from intact skin. Like NSAIDs, it requires a formulation that allows it to penetrate through the stratum corneum. Lidocaine can be applied as cream, gel, foam spray, and solution for short‐term analgesia. However, its most widespread application for the treatment of neuropathic pain is an adhesive patch with the dimensions 10 × 14 cm, containing 5% (w/w) lidocaine.

Each 5% lidocaine plaster contains 700 mg lidocaine, for which a maximum of three plasters applied simultaneously for 12 h is allowed. Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that only 3 ± 2% of this maximum recommended dose is systemically absorbed, which minimizes the risk of systemic adverse events. When absorbed, lidocaine primarily binds to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and likely diffuses passively across the placental and blood–brain barriers. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver to nonactive metabolites that are excreted by the kidneys with an elimination half-life of 7.6 h.

### Topical analgesics for neuropathic pain: an evidence-informed guide for the practicing clinician [^4c1aefa5]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate available evidence regarding efficacy and safety of topical analgesics for neuropathic pain and offer treatment guidance.

Methods

An expert panel searched PubMed (Medline) and reference lists of published articles for available literature assessing 8 categories of topical analgesics used to treat various neuropathic pain conditions. The panel rated the level of analgesic efficacy evidence for each treatment and considered safety, ease of use, and cost. Degree of consensus among panelists regarding recommendations was measured.

Results

There was strong evidence and high consensus that capsaicin 8% is effective for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, and lidocaine is effective for postherpetic neuralgia. There was strong evidence and moderate consensus that capsaicin 8% may be effective for HIV-induced neuropathy. There was moderate evidence and high consensus that lidocaine is likely effective for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, idiopathic neuropathy, and post-surgical neuropathy and that capsaicin 8% may be effective for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. Evidence was weak for other topical medications, though the panel strongly agreed that antidepressants may help with postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, post-surgical neuropathy, and post-traumatic neuropathy; that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help with post-surgical neuropathy; and that gabapentin may benefit vulvodynia. There was less agreement whether antidepressants may benefit diabetic peripheral neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and vulvodynia and whether capsaicin 8% could be effective for post-surgical neuropathy.

Conclusions

Recommendations were based on a survey and grading of existing literature and, when strong evidence was lacking, the collective clinical expertise of panelists.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^246abf27]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Topical 5% lidocaine medicated plasters represent a well-established first-line option for the treatment of peripheral localized neuropathic pain (LNP). This review provides an updated overview of the clinical evidence (randomized, controlled, and open-label clinical studies, real-life daily clinical practice, and case series). The 5% lidocaine medicated plaster effectively provides pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, and data from a large open-label controlled study indicate that the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster is as effective as systemic pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic polyneuropathy but with an improved tolerability profile. Additionally, improved analgesia and fewer side effects were experienced by patients treated synchronously with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster, further demonstrating the value of multimodal analgesia in LNP. The 5% lidocaine medicated plaster provides continued benefit after long-term (≤ 7 years) use and is also effective in various other LNP conditions. Minor application-site reactions are the most common adverse events associated with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster; there is minimal risk of systemic adverse events and drug–drug interactions. Although further well-controlled studies are warranted, the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster is efficacious and safe in LNP and may have particular clinical benefit in elderly and/or medically compromised patients because of the low incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

Altogether, these data suggest that 5% lidocaine plaster may be useful as add-on therapy in patients with chronic peripheral neuropathic pain conditions. The observed improvement in patients with CRPS may open a new therapeutic strategy in management of this complex and challenging condition. Further high-quality controlled studies to corroborate the efficacy and effectiveness of topical lidocaine in CRPS are warranted.

### Lidocaine ointment USP, 5% FOR TOPICAL USE DO… [^e188ac3a]. FDA (DailyMed) (2018). Low credibility.

Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type or to other components of Lidocaine Ointment 5%. EXCESSIVE DOSAGE, OR SHORT INTERVALS BETWEEN DOSES, CAN RESULT IN HIGH PLASMA LEVELS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS, PATIENTS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES AS SET FORTH IN THIS PACKAGE INSERT. Dosage in children should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight and physical condition. Caution must be taken to avoid overdosage when applying Lidocaine Ointment 5% to large areas of injured or abraded skin, since the systemic absorption of lidocaine may be increased under such conditions. The oral LD50 of lidocaine HCI in non-fasted female rats is 459 mg/kg and 214 mg/kg in fasted female rats.

When Lidocaine Ointment 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, the total dose contributed by all formulations must be kept in mind. Adult A single application should not exceed 5 g of Lidocaine Ointment 5%, containing 250 mg of lidocaine base. This is roughly equivalent to squeezing a six inch length of ointment from the tube. In a 70 kg adult this dose equals 3. 6 mg/kg lidocaine base. No more than one-half tube, approximately 17 g to 20 g of ointment or 850 mg to 1000 mg lidocaine base, should be administered in any one day. Although the incidence of adverse effects with Lidocaine Ointment 5% is quite low, caution should be exercised, particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent administered. Dosage for children. For example a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75 mg to 100 mg when calculated according to Clark's rule. In any case, the maximum amount of lidocaine administered should not exceed 4. 5 mg/kg of body weight.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^ba3d503f]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Numerous reviews and clinical guidelines recommend the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster as a first-line option for LNP,–with the majority of clinical evidence available for patients with PHN. However, due to differences in data analysis and without significant changes in the available data in the last 5 years (see "Discussion" section), recommendations are not always aligned. The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster is approved in ~50 countries worldwide for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster infection; in nine of these countries, it is also approved for the treatment of LNP. It is estimated that, since the first marketing approval in 1999 and up to June 2014, the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster has been prescribed to ~20 million patients worldwide.

This article presents an updated narrative appraisal of the clinical evidence (efficacy and safety in clinical trials, in addition to extensive experience gained in daily clinical practice) with the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in LNP, focusing primarily on its use in patients with PHN and DPN and presenting a brief overview of recent evidence in other LNP conditions. In order to provide a reappraisal of the clinical evidence for the use of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in the treatment of LNP conditions, all efficacy and safety studies (randomized, controlled, or open label with a well-described methodology), case reports, and observational studies on the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster were retrieved from a PubMed literature search (1960 to September 30, 2015). Additional references were identified from the reference lists of published articles. Search terms were "lidocaine" and ("patch" or "topical") or "lidocaine medicated plaster". Inclusion of studies was based mainly on the methods section of the trials. If available, large, well-controlled trials with appropriate statistical methodology were preferred.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^2f660d6d]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these encouraging reports, the efficacy of topical high-dose capsaicin for the relief of neuropathic pain is quite low. A meta-analysis conducted by the International Association for the Study of Pain (Washington, D.C.) Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) concludes that the NNT for high-concentration capsaicin patches in neuropathic pain states is 10.6 (95% CI, 7.4 to 18.8) and the most recent study gives it a weak recommendation for use as second-line therapy for peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, the most recent Cochrane report concluded that the quality of evidence is low, emphasizing the need for more randomized controlled trials with larger patient cohorts to evaluate the analgesic potential of high-concentration topical capsaicin in various chronic and neuropathic pain conditions. Aside from temporary local reactions at the application site, such as procedural pain and erythema, there are no significant safety concerns related to skin exposure to capsaicin. Concerning adverse events and safety, clinical studies have not observed long-term damage to sensory nerve fibers. Instead, sensory function and epidermal nerve fiber reinnervation have been shown to return after 24 weeks in clinical trials. It is important to note that capsaicin provides analgesia for neuropathic pain only when hyperalgesia is mediated and maintained by TRPV1-positive epidermal nerve fibers. Capsaicin selectively ablates TRPV1-positive nerve fibers while preserving the function of TRPV1-negative fibers, thereby maintaining protective cutaneous sensation.

In summary, high-dose topical capsaicin is recommended as a second-line treatment for postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, supported by moderate evidence (fig. 3; table 2). In cancer pain, topical capsaicin can be used as coanalgesic when a neuropathic component contributes to the pain. For nonneuropathic cancer pain, capsaicin is not recommended. Currently there is no evidence to support recommending low-dose capsaicin for analgesic therapy.

Introduction

Diabetic neuropathies are common chronic microvascular complications affecting the somatic and/or autonomic nervous system exclusively as a consequence of diabetes mellitus. The most common type is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy defined for clinical practice as 'the presence of symptoms and/or signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction in people with diabetes after the exclusion of other causes'. Many patients with diabetic neuropathy experience neuropathic symptoms such as burning, shooting, or lancinating pain (with or without numbness), tingling sensations, or stimulus-evoked pain (allodynia or hyperalgesia). In Europe, the prevalence of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) ranges from 6% to 34% of patients with diabetes.PDPN affects daily functioning and sleep, often results in anxiety and depression, and is associated with diminished quality of life; the impact on both the individual patient and society is significant.

Symptomatic treatment of neuropathic pain is challenging. Available pharmacological treatment options for painful diabetic neuropathy have been recently reviewed. Recent guidelines for PDPN treatment mainly recommend pharmacotherapy with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), the antiepileptics pregabalin and gabapentin, the selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) duloxetine and venlafaxine, and high concentration capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) patch. The lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster (LMP) has been recommended for general peripheral neuropathic pain treatment in recent guidelines. The use of oral medications is limited by a number of factors including systemic side effects, drug–drug interactions, a slow onset of action, the need for titration, and the need for multiple daily dosing, which can lead to suboptimal adherence to treatment. A US claims database analysis estimated that up to 50% of patients discontinued their initial PDPN treatment within 3 months of initiation. In contrast, topical treatments provide pain relief by directly targeting the site of the pain, and the low systemic exposure reduces the risk of systemic side effects. Thus, the benefit/risk ratio of topical treatments may be more favorable than that of oral medications, and they may offer a valuable analgesic treatment option, particularly considering that patients with PDPN are often multimorbid and polymedicated.

Research design and methods

The datasets in this subgroup analysis of patients with PDPN were included in a previously reported non-interventional study analyzing data of patients with localized peripheral neuropathic pain obtained from the GPeR. Patients had been unsuccessfully treated with recommendedoral first-line medications (OM) and had been receiving a new treatment of either LMP or an OM and were then followed up for 24 weeks. Based on individual patient needs and prior treatment experience, treating physicians solely decided about the selection of analgesic medication, initial dosing, dose adjustments, continuation or discontinuation based on individual response, and other treatment options. Propensity score matching in the original studyprovided 732 pairs of datasets from patients with a diagnosis of PDPN for a comparison of LMP and oral first-line medications.

### 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster for the treatment of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain: complex regional pain syndrome and other neuropathic conditions [^86504338]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain can be defined as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system". It is a disabling condition that affects between 7% and 10% of the general population. While many cases of acute neuropathic pain have a benign course and resolve within a few months, in a proportion of patients the condition becomes chronic and persists for years, impairing physical functioning and severely affecting patient's quality of life. Neuropathic pain can be central (caused by a lesion or disease of the central somatosensory nervous system) or peripheral (caused by damage to peripheral somatosensory nervous system). It is estimated that in ~60% of cases, the neuropathic pain is localized, ie, characterized by well-defined, circumscribed area(s) of maximum pain.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare and poorly understood neuropathic pain condition. It is usually associated with signs of autonomic and inflammatory changes: changes in skin color and temperature, sweating, edema, reduced strength, tremors, and dystonia. Perception can also be affected, reducing movement accuracy. Patients often experience serious impairments in activities of daily living and in ability to function.

Pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain, in general, and of CRPS, in particular, is challenging, with only few patients responding well to any given treatment. Conventional analgesics, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids, usually provide little relief, and the use of nonconventional analgesics (ie, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and psychotropics) is common in clinical practice, although in case of CRPS the supporting clinical evidence is limited.

Topical treatments can be an alternative or add-on therapy particularly useful in case of localized neuropathic pain. Their advantages, compared with systemic medications, include lower systemic dose, site-specific drug delivery, better tolerability, and avoidance of major drug–drug interactions, which can be particularly relevant in older patients.

In many countries, including Spain, 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster is approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). However, because of its effectiveness and safety in the management of PHN and its mechanism of action, lidocaine-medicated plaster is being increasingly used to treat other localized neuropathic pain conditions, such as postsurgical pain and painful diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). Few published case reports suggest that 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster might also be effective in CRPS, but the evidence so far has been anecdotal.

Discussion

In many countries, including Spain, 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster is currently approved only for treating a particular type of neuropathic pain, the postherpetic neuralgia. However, an increasing body of clinical evidence suggests that 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster may be effective for treating other types of peripheral neuropathic pain. Some authors proposed algorithms for identifying and treating patients with localized neuropathic pain, in which topical agents, such as 5% lidocaine plasters, are incorporated as cornerstones. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there was "no evidence from good quality randomized controlled studies to support the use of topical lidocaine to treat neuropathic pain, although individual studies indicated that it was effective for relief of pain". However, most studies on effectiveness of topical lidocaine in peripheral neuropathic pain were focused on PHN, DPN, postsurgical, and posttraumatic pain. Until now, to our knowledge, only few case reports suggested potential usefulness of lidocaine plasters in patients with CRPS.

The present study, which was set in a specialized pain unit in a tertiary hospital, provides further insight into the usefulness of 5% lidocaine-medicated plasters in patients with chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. A rapid marked improvement in pain intensity was observed in most patients across all the groups, including patients with CRPS. The response was numerically higher in the PHN and DPN groups and numerically lower in the CRPS group, both for the average change in NRS score and for the proportion of 50% responders. However, it is hard to appreciate the statistical significance of these differences due to the low number of patients.

Interestingly, in all groups the average pain intensity continued to decrease after 1 month, and the number of 50% responders plateaued after 3 months of treatment (Figures 1 and 2). This suggests that some patients respond to treatment in a gradual and progressive manner, and that the treatment should not be discontinued too prematurely in case of slow response.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: real-world comparison between topical treatment with lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster and oral treatments [^945eb90a]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

The focus of the current study was to compare LMP with oral treatments used as first-line treatments in PDPN. There are other topical treatments indicated for PDPN, such as the capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch. To our knowledge, no studies are available that directly compare LMP and the capsaicin patch when both are used as recommended. Recently, a meta-analysis of 12 trials compared topical treatments used for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and concluded that LMP was the most effective and most tolerable topical treatment.

This subgroup analysis has all the limitations stated for the original non-interventional retrospective cohort study. Briefly, propensity score matching was employed to eliminate the main confounding factors and to reduce selection bias; however, other confounders might have been present. The registry data capture the prescribed regimens/dosages of the medications under evaluation but do not provide information about treatment compliance or reasons for the prescription of concomitant analgesics. Treatment outcomes could have been biased by the prescription of specific PDPN medications based on individual patient needs and the response to previous therapies. Physicians prescribing oral medications might also have paid closer attention to side effects. In addition, confirmation / verification of data to detect errors in measurement or misclassification was not possible, as only anonymized data were available due to data protection regulations.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^f5eaa985]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain is the primary reason patients seek medical attention. Accurately diagnosing and treating the specific type of pain with appropriate pain medications is essential to provide analgesia. Pain management involves not only selecting the appropriate analgesic but also determining the optimal route of administration. Oral administration can be challenging in some cases due to swallowing difficulties or gastrointestinal issues that affect drug absorption. In other cases, pain is strictly localized. For these patients, topical analgesics offer a suitable alternative. Although designed for localized pain relief, they are also effective in managing a range of painful conditions. These include acute pain, such as strains, muscle aches, and sprains, as well as chronic inflammatory pain, such as osteoarthritis-related pain, and neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia and pain from diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The spectrum of analgesics suitable for topical pain management encompasses nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the local anesthetic lidocaine, and other substances such as capsaicin, a vanilloid, a voltage gated channel blocker, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel (TRPV1) agonist. Topical analgesics can be similarly effective to oral analgesics, but they can bypass the risk of systemic adverse effects and problems associated with systemic absorption, metabolization and elimination. They can be beneficial for patients with impaired drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract or other gastrointestinal issues such as nausea/vomiting or difficulty swallowing.

The pharmacologic treatment of neuropathic pain remains particularly challenging due to the limited effectiveness of current therapies and the distinct mechanisms compared to acute and inflammatory pain. Topical analgesics, such as high-concentration lidocaine and capsaicin patches, have also found application and are recommended as potential therapeutics in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Here, we review pharmacology and efficacy of topical analgesics to provide recommendations for their application.

Because of their localized activity and low systemic absorption, topical analgesics have a favorable safety profile and a low risk for drug-drug interactions. There is a growing body of evidence on the efficacy and safety of these agents in a variety of pain disorders, including the most prevalent neuropathic pain conditions. The molecular basis for the usage of peripheral analgesics in neuropathic pain and the available clinical trial evidence for a wide variety of topical agents are reviewed.

Compared with pregabalin

The 5% lidocaine medicated plaster has been compared with pregabalin in an open-label trial in patients with PHN (n = 96) or painful DPN (n = 204). At baseline, patients had a mean pain intensity score of 6.75 on the 11-point NRS during the previous 3 days (NRS-3). Patients received the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster (applied to the most painful skin area) or twice-daily pregabalin capsules (150−600 mg/d titrated to effect) in a 1:1 ratio at 51 European centers in this two-stage, randomized, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority study. During the initial 4-week comparative stage, the response rate (average reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points or an absolute value of ≤ 4 points on the NRS-3) in the full analysis set (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the investigational products and for whom at least one postbaseline assessment of pain intensity [NRS-3] was available) was 66.4% (101/152) with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster and 61.5% (91/148) with pregabalin, indicating noninferiority of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster to pregabalin (P = 0.00229). When the results were analyzed by indication, more patients in the PHN group responded to the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster than to pregabalin treatment (63.3% vs 46.8%; statistical data not reported), while in the painful DPN group, the between-treatment response was comparable (68.0% vs 68.3%).

### Topical lidocaine for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^a8456192]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The cause of postherpetic neuralgia is damage to peripheral neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, secondary to herpes zoster infection (shingles). In postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neurons discharge spontaneously and have lowered activation thresholds, and exhibit an exaggerated response to stimuli. Topical lidocaine dampens peripheral nociceptor sensitisation and central nervous system hyperexcitability, and may benefit patients with postherpetic neuralgia.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and safety of topical lidocaine in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS, SIGLE for conference proceedings, Citation Index, the reference lists of all eligible trials, key textbooks, and previous systematic reviews. We also wrote to authors of all identified trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing all topical applications of lidocaine, including gels and patches in patients of all ages with postherpetic neuralgia (pain persisting at the site of shingles at least one month after the onset of the acute rash).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data, and a third checked them. We obtained some missing data from the US Food and Drugs Administration.

Main Results

Three trials involving 182 topical lidocaine treated participants and 132 control participants were included. Two trials gave data on pain relief, and the remaining study provided data on secondary outcome measures. The largest trial published as an abstract compared topical lidocaine patch to a placebo patch and accounted for 150 of the 314 patients (48%). A meta-analysis combining two of the three studies identified a significant difference between the topical lidocaine and control groups for the primary outcome measure: a mean improvement in pain relief according to a pain relief scale. Topical lidocaine relieved pain better than placebo (P = 0.003). There was a statistical difference between the groups for the secondary outcome measure of mean VAS score reduction (P = 0.03), but this was only for a single small trial. There were a similar number of adverse skin reactions in both treatment and placebo groups. The highest recorded blood lidocaine concentration varied between 59 ng/ml and 431 ng/ml between trials. The latter figure is high and the authors of the study suggest that the sample had been contaminated during the assay procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to recommend topical lidocaine as a first-line agent in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia with allodynia. Further research should be undertaken on the efficacy of topical lidocaine for other chronic neuropathic pain disorders, and also to compare different classes of drugs (e.g. topical anaesthetics versus anti-epileptics).

Another medication that has been shown to be efficacious for treating particular conditions with neuropathic pain, such as CSPN, is mexiletine, a class Ib antiarrhythmic oral medication. Unfortunately, its side effect profile makes it intolerable for many patients and due to this, mexiletine has previously carried a strong recommendation against its use in treatment of neuropathic pain more broadly but may have use in limited instances, such as CSPN.

Other forms of treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain include topical agents, namely, capsaicin and lidocaine patches. Capsaicin is derived from chili peppers. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is thought to cause an analgesic effect through desensitization of the TRPV1 receptor which can diminish the amount of substance P in nerve fibers leading to pain relief. Capsaicin is typically applied either in the high concentration form of capsaicin patches (8%) or in the low concentration form of capsaicin cream (< 1%). Capsaicin 8% patches have a weak recommendation for use as a second line agent specifically in peripheral neuropathic pain. Guidelines suggest using one to four patches on the painful area for 30–60 min in a single session which can be repeated every 3 months as needed. Capsaicin cream on the other hand, has less research supporting its use and thus is categorized with an inconclusive recommendation via the current guidelines. Common side effects of capsaicin include pain, erythema, rash, and itching. Lidocaine patches also have a weak recommendation for use as a second line agent in peripheral neuropathic pain. Topical lidocaine is absorbed into the skin and diffuses across the neural sheath where it binds to sodium channels which inhibits depolarization. The recommendation for use in peripheral neuropathic pain is one to three patches applied to the skin around the painful area once a day for up to 12 h. Common side effects include erythema, itching, and rash.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: real-world comparison between topical treatment with lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster and oral treatments [^557c65ef]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN), a common complication of diabetes mellitus, is challenging to treat. Efficacy and tolerability of the topical lidocaine 700mg medicated plaster (LMP) and well-established first-line oral medications (OM) were compared in refractory PDPN patients.

Research Design and Methods

This is a subgroup analysis of a non-interventional, retrospective 24-week cohort study using anonymized routine medical care data from the German Pain eRegistry. Propensity score matching provided 732 datasets per treatment group. Primary effectiveness endpoint was the absolute change in average 24-hour Pain Intensity Index (0-100mm) from baseline after 4, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment and over the entire treatment period.

Results

The majority of this multimorbid and polymedicated study population of patients with PDPN had suffered pain for more than a year and presented with a high pain burden despite a median of seven previous analgesic medications. LMP treatment resulted in significant reductions in pain intensity and improvements in daily functioning already after 4 treatment weeks. Effectiveness was maintained over the treatment period even when concomitant analgesics were reduced or discontinued and quality of life improved. Mean change in the primary effectiveness parameter over the 24-week treatment period was -30.2mm (SE 0.38) and -17.0mm (SE 0.51) in the LMP and OM groups, respectively. Improvements in all effectiveness parameters were significantly greater under LMP than under OM treatment (p < 0.001). Significantly fewer patients under LMP than OM experienced drug-related adverse events (DRAEs; 9.6% vs 61.6%, p < 0.001) and discontinued treatment due to DRAEs (4.4% vs 35.8%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

LMP was effective and well tolerated in routine clinical care of patients with PDPN. The more favorable benefit/risk profile and greater reduction in intake of concomitant analgesics compared with OM suggest LMP as a useful treatment option for PDPN.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: real-world comparison between topical treatment with lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster and oral treatments [^2622d05e]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Restoring or preserving patients' independence and quality of life is an important goal in pain management. In addition to pain intensity, it is thus also important to take into account the pain-related limitations in daily functioning and the pain-related distress experienced by the patient. The new International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision, coding proposes these three dimensions as optional specifiers ('extension codes') for chronic pain diagnoses for the determination of pain severity. These dimensions can aid the selection of an appropriate pain medication. The German Diabetes Association states in their practice recommendations under pharmacotherapy for PDNP: 'Pain therapy should not merely mitigate pain but should also improve the quality of sleep, mobility and overall quality of life'.

The clinical practice data presented here show that topical LMP treatment considerably improved pain intensity and daily functioning and resulted in an overall better health status after 24 weeks of treatment. Marked improvements were already observed after 4 treatment weeks and were maintained over the treatment period. In particular, the effect on physical functioning in this population is remarkable, given that improvement in this domain could be very beneficial. There is increasing evidence that physical activity as well as dietary interventions are effective in reducing the severity of both somatic and autonomic neuropathies. There appeared to be no tolerance development to the LMP effect. The number of plasters used is determined by the skin area to be treated; the dose is therefore fixed and there is no tendency for a dose increase over time as can be observed with certain oral treatments. Effectiveness of the plaster was observed despite the lower intake of concomitant analgesic medications and rescue medications. Most patients on LMP (92%) could reduce and 43% were able to discontinue concomitant analgesics, thus easing the burden of polypharmacy. The decrease in strong opioid use (44% of the patients) is particularly noteworthy.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^55af095b]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Consequently, it is not surprising that the general findings of the recent evaluation by Finnerup et alare largely reflected in a recent Cochrane review of all topical lidocaine preparations that found no evidence from good-quality randomized controlled studies to support the use of topical lidocaine to treat neuropathic pain, although individual studies indicated that it was effective for pain relief. The Cochrane review also noted that clinical experience supports the efficacy of topical lidocaine in some patients. Despite the general paucity of direct comparative data from randomized, controlled studies, there is a substantial body of clinical evidence and experience that the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster is a valuable and safe option in the management of LNP. Given the recognition that LNP is a subset of neuropathic pain, a treatment algorithm was developed recently in order to identify patients with LNP and to guide targeted topical treatment with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster. Generally, the more localized the pain (ie, the area of an A4 sheet of paper) the better the results of topical treatment.

The 5% lidocaine medicated plaster is easy to use, improves patient QoL, has a good tolerability profile, and is associated with a lack of systemic adverse events and a low potential for drug–drug interactions (particularly when compared with systemic medications); moreover, in contrast to systemic therapies, there is no requirement to titrate the dose. These characteristics are particularly beneficial in elderly and medically complicated patients, including those with underlying comorbidities that require a polypharmacy management approach. Indeed, the most recent NeuPSIG recommendations also acknowledge the first-line use of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster as a safe and well-accepted option, particularly in frail or elderly individuals, where adverse effects or safety issues associated with systemic therapy are of concern. Extensive postmarketing surveillance has confirmed the favorable safety profile of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster, supporting its first-line use in the treatment of LNP after herpes zoster infection.

Based on the results of randomized, controlled, and open-label trials and numerous studies designed to gauge response and experience in real-life clinical practice settings, the use of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster would appear to be indicated as the first step in the treatment of LNP as part of a multimodal approach or as a single agent. Recent developments with regard to the potential clinical benefit of reducing the size of the painful area using the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster warrant further investigation in well-controlled clinical studies.

Local anesthetics — Local anesthetic agents act by prolonging deactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels in peripheral neurons to reduce or reversibly block neuronal transmission and produce local analgesia or anesthesia, but when absorbed systemically they can cause severe adverse effects such as cardiac arrest and seizure. Attention must thus be given to weight-based maximum doses to avoid toxicity (eg, lidocaine 4–5 mg/kg, maximum 300 mg/dose and 2400 mg/day), and care must be taken to avoid intravascular or intraneural injection. Local anesthetics can be applied topically to the skin or mucous membranes, injected directly into peripheral tissues, or adjacent to regional nerves or even the spinal cord to produce regional or neuraxial analgesia or anesthesia.

### Open-label adhesion performance study of a prescription lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus three lidocaine-containing over-the-counter patches in healthy subjects [^0f48d2d1]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lidocaine, a well-established topical analgesic in the treatment of neuropathic pain, is available in prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) products in dosage forms including gels, salves, liquids, sprays and patches/topical systems. The rising importance of topical lidocaine in the treatment of neuropathic pain is a culmination of its safety relative to oral OTC and prescription analgesics (ie, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioids) that have not demonstrated meaningful efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain in large adequately controlled clinical studies and have well-documented treatment-limiting toxicities, and its multimodal analgesia for neuropathic pain due to its interruption of the pain signals along the neural pathways in skin. These properties recently led the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to recommend that clinicians consider topical agents, including lidocaine, as alternative first-line therapies for neuropathic pain treatment. There is an overall trend towards the use of topical products in general for the pharmacologic treatment of pain due to reduced systemic toxicities. In fact, the 2019 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline suggests that topical therapies (ie, NSAIDs and capsaicin) should be considered for first-line pharmacologic treatment of osteoarthritis.

Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent that stabilizes neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of nerve impulses (ie, pain signals). Because topically applied lidocaine penetrates only about 8 to 10 mm into skin, it is well suited for targeted use in peripherally localized pain. Penetration of lidocaine after application of the lidocaine patch 5% was sufficient to produce an analgesic effect in the treatment of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. In 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for Lidoderm ® (lidocaine patch 5%; Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Malvern, PA) as the first medication specifically indicated for the treatment of PHN pain.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^5d6fd96d]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Selection of Studies for Pooled Analysis

The studies included in this analysis were identified from the clinical development program for the capsaicin patch. This program comprised a series of interventional Phase 2, 3, and 4 trials, specifically aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of the capsaicin 179 mg patch in treating various neuropathic pain conditions. All trials were supported by companies with direct involvement in the development of the capsaicin patch. An additional search of the literature resulted in the identification of clinical trials that included adult and older patients but lacked specific information regarding older patients. Therefore these trials were not considered in this analysis. For the pooled analysis of efficacy according to participant age, only randomized, double-blind, 12-week efficacy studies with similar trial design, and that included patients older than the median age in the pooled dataset (ie aged ≥ 73 years), were selected. Four Phase 2/3 studies (C108, C110, C116, and C117) were identified (pooled n = 1,272), each of which compared the efficacy of a single treatment with the capsaicin patch with that of a low-concentration capsaicin (0.04%) control patch in patients with moderate-to-severe neuropathic pain resulting from PHN (Table 1). Excluded single-treatment randomized controlled trials included STEP (comparator, placebo) and trials C107, C109, C112, and C119 that did not include patients ≥ 73 years old. Duration of patch application was 60 minutes, except for trial C108 in which some patients were treated for 30 minutes or 60 minutes. Only patients who were treated for 60 minutes in the double-blind phase were included in the pooled capsaicin patch treatment group, whereas the pooled control group contained all patients treated with the control patch for any duration across the four studies. All treated patients received pretreatment of their painful areas with a topical local anesthetic cream (lidocaine 4%) before study patch application, to offset potential treatment-related discomfort or pain resulting from capsaicin. Patients used a diary to record numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) scores (from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating worst possible pain) from the evening of the treatment day (day 0) through to the evening before the week 12 visit. Baseline NPRS scores were recorded during the screening period (starting 7 days before randomization for trials C108 and C110, and 14 days before randomization for C116 and C117, and ending prior to randomization). The primary efficacy endpoint for each individual trial was the mean percent change from baseline to weeks 2–8 for "average pain for the past 24 hours" using the NPRS. However, as the trials were of 12 weeks' duration, the predefined analysis of the mean percent change from baseline to weeks 2–12 for "average pain for the past 24 hours" was considered for the current analyses, to ensure that the full duration of the trial was reflected.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^d9ee62ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

HIV neuropathic pain — nonopioid pharmacological treatments: Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended for the prevention and treatment of HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (strong, low). Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line pharmacological treatment of chronic HIV-associated neuropathic pain (strong, moderate); a typical adult regimen will titrate to 2400 mg per day in divided doses, and evidence also supports that gabapentin improves sleep scores with somnolence reported by 80% of patients who received gabapentin. If patients have an inadequate response to gabapentin, clinicians might consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors based on their effectiveness in the general population (weak, moderate), a trial of tricyclic antidepressants (weak, moderate), or a trial of pregabalin for patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (weak, moderate). Capsaicin is recommended as a topical treatment for the management of chronic HIV-associated peripheral neuropathic pain (strong, high); a single 30-minute application of an 8% dermal patch or cream administered at the site of pain can provide pain relief for at least 12 weeks, and erythema and pain are common side effects for which a 60-minute application of 4% lidocaine can be applied and wiped off before applying capsaicin.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^ff761579]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Two clinical studies used a randomized, withdrawal (enriched enrollment) design. In the study by Galer et al, patients had been treated successfully with topical 5% lidocaine medicated plasters on a regular basis for at least 1 month before study enrollment. Subjects were subsequently enrolled in a randomized, two-treatment period, vehicle-controlled, crossover study. The primary efficacy variable was "time to exit" due to a lack of efficacy (defined as a decrease in pain relief score by two or more categories on a six-item pain relief scale for any 2 consecutive days). The median time to exit with the lidocaine plaster was significantly greater than with the vehicle plaster (> 14 days vs 3.8 days, P < 0.001). At study completion, significantly more patients expressed a preference for the lidocaine plaster than the vehicle plaster (78.1% vs 9.4%, P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant between-group differences with regard to side effects.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^e6699d86]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in patients with DPN indicated that the effects of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster on pain reduction are comparable to those of amitriptyline, capsaicin, gabapentin, and pregabalin. In the meta-analysis, all interventions remained effective compared with placebo (mean difference in change of pain from baseline compared with placebo, amitriptyline: −12.58 [95% confidence interval {CI}, −16.66 to −8.50]; capsaicin: –9.40 [95% CI, −13.92 to −4.88]; gabapentin: −10.22 [95% CI, −17.25 to −3.19]; pregabalin: −10.53 [95% CI, −14.74 to −6.32]; 5% lidocaine medicated plaster: −9.10 [95% CI, −13.93 to −4.26]), and the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster was comparable to all other interventions (amitriptyline: 3.48 [95% CI, −0.78 to 7.75]; capsaicin: 0.31 [95% CI, −4.39 to 5.00]; gabapentin: 1.12 [95% CI, −6.02 to 8.27]; and pregabalin: 1.43 [95% CI, −2.96 to 5.83]). The authors concluded that topical agents such as the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster may be associated with fewer and less clinically significant adverse events than is the case for systemic agents. However, the results of the systematic review were limited by the number and size of studies included, warranting further well-designed studies in this patient population.

### A randomized, open-label, bioequivalence study of lidocaine topical system 1.8% and lidocaine patch 5% in healthy subjects [^bd1e2440]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Each year in the United States, an estimated one million individuals are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles.HZ is caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus in the dorsal root ganglia and typically presents as a unilateral, painful, blistering rash in the affected dermatome(s). It most often occurs in patients ≥ 50 years old; women are at greater risk than men. Approximately 20% of HZ patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complication characterized by neuropathic pain within the zoster-affected dermatome(s) that is sustained for at least 3 months after the rash has healed.PHN pain is often associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia and can persist for years. Pharmacologic treatment usually includes oral medications, such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids, as well as topical analgesics, such as the lidocaine patch. Advantages of topical drug delivery systems include providing targeted site-specific therapy while minimizing entry and level of drugs in the systemic circulation; this therapy often avoids or reduces side effects or toxicities of commonly used oral medications.

Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic that blocks sodium ion channels required for the initiation and conduction of neuronal impulses. Blocking sodium channels in the dermal nociceptors of A delta and C fibers reduces the frequency of ectopic discharges that contribute to neuropathic pain. Topical patches and other delivery systems have been developed to deliver lidocaine locally for the treatment of PHN. In 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lidocaine patch 5% (Lidoderm ®, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Malvern, PA) for the relief of pain associated with PHN. The lidocaine patch 5% contains 700 mg of lidocaine (5% = 50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous ("hydrogel") matrix. The analgesic efficacy of topical lidocaine in PHN has been demonstrated in several randomized clinical trials, which show that patients experience pain relief within hours of application of lidocaine patches and that treatment is well tolerated. Topical lidocaine remains an effective treatment option for PHN over time, with up to 4 years of available safety and efficacy data on long-term treatment outcomes. Additionally, topical lidocaine has been reported to have analgesic effects in other conditions, such as lower back pain, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, and osteoarthritis pain.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^5e6d0c43]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Section 2. Topical Treatments

While oral medications are commonly used to treat painful diabetic neuropathy, their use is typically limited by significant side effects, a high number-needed-to-treat (NNT), and a high non-responder rate. As such, the application of topical medications is gaining significant interest and has in many instances become a routine aspect of patient care in patients with PDN. While many medications are used in the topical treatment of PDN, this section focuses on the most commonly utilized medications including, lidocaine, capsaicin, and amitriptyline.

Topical Lidocaine

Though not specifically mentioned in the 2021 American Diabetes Association guidelines for standard of care management of PDN, topical lidocaine presents a low-risk option for patients refractory to FDA approved treatments. Lidocaine, an amide local anesthetic, mitigates neuropathic pain by reversibly blocking voltage-gated sodium channels on neuronal membranes. This action inhibits sodium influx during action potential generation, dampening nerve impulse transmission and inducing a numbing state. Lidocaine preferentially targets channels in hyperexcitable, pathologically signaling neurons, due to its higher affinity for open and inactivated states. This selective targeting lends to its effectiveness in managing chronic neuropathic pain.

Topical lidocaine has been the subject of significant clinical research in the management of PDN for years. In 2004, Argoff et al performed an open-label, non-randomized prospective study with 41 subjects which demonstrated that a 5% lidocaine patch significantly improved pain scores as compared to baseline, with no systemic side effects or drug interactions over a 2-week observation period. Barbano et al observed a similar pain reduction (VAS 68.6 at baseline vs 42.4 at 3 weeks, p < 0.001) in a 3-week trial with 56 participants in an open-label, flexible-dosing prospective study. While effective as proof of concepts for the utilization of topical lidocaine in the management of PDN, both of these studies had significant limitations in that they were non-randomized, non-blinded, and did not have a control arm.

### Topical phenytoin for the treatment of neuropathic pain [^59371187]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Two commonly used topical analgesics are lidocaine (a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker) and capsaicin (a vanilloid receptor agonist).

Lidocaine inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, and thus stabilizes the neuronal membrane potential of abnormally excitable peripheral nerve fibers. This results in a decrease of allodynia and hyperalgesia. Lidocaine 5% patch is registered for the treatment of neuropathic pain in several countries and its numbers needed to treat (NNT) is ~4. The patch needs to be replaced every 12 hours, with patch-free intervals of at least 12 hours and cannot be used on wounds, ulcers, damaged, or inflamed skin, commonly seen in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Guidelines recommend lidocaine patch in elderly as a first-line treatment, especially if there are concerns about the CNS side effects of oral medications. One study shows that topical lidocaine gives no rise to cognitive impairment in elderly, whereas oral analgesics do.

Capsaicin is thought to cause desensitization and denervation, the latter through reversible retraction of the nerve endings induced by TRPV1 receptor activation, leading to an overall long-term reduction of pain. Capsaicin 8% patch, however, has the disadvantage that it can provoke or increase burning pain and often needs to be combined with a local anesthetic. The patch has to be applied once every 3 months in a pain clinic. Its NNT is disappointingly low, between 6 and 12. Topical capsaicin 0.025%–0.075% cream has the disadvantage that it has to be applied 3–4 times daily during 5–6 weeks, its NNT is ~7, and considerable side effects, such as burning, stinging, or erythema, complicate its use. Because capsaicin is lipophilic and usually is emulsified in a cream, thorough hand washing or the use of hand gloves is necessary to avoid irritation of eyes and/or mucous membranes, all leading to decrease in patient compliance.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: real-world comparison between topical treatment with lidocaine 700 mg medicated plaster and oral treatments [^79b2056d]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Real-world data can provide insights into what may be effective treatment paradigms for routine clinical practice. To date, LMP is approved in 54 countries worldwide for postherpetic neuralgia; its effectiveness and good tolerability in the treatment of this condition was recently confirmed by real-world data obtained from the German Pain eRegistry (GPeR). Additionally, LMP has been approved in 15 of these countries for the treatment of localized peripheral neuropathic pain (including PDPN). As LMP has also been used for the treatment of localized peripheral neuropathic pain conditions other than postherpetic neuralgia in Germany, GPeR data were available for an analysis of the datasets of all patients with PDPN treated with either topical LMP or oral medications.

### Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad6d5783]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

New drug treatments, clinical trials, and standards of quality for assessment of evidence justify an update of evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), we revised the Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain based on the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Between April, 2013, and January, 2014, NeuPSIG of the International Association for the Study of Pain did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind studies of oral and topical pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain, including studies published in peer-reviewed journals since January, 1966, and unpublished trials retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov and websites of pharmaceutical companies. We used number needed to treat (NNT) for 50% pain relief as a primary measure and assessed publication bias; NNT was calculated with the fixed-effects Mantel-Haenszel method.

Findings

229 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Analysis of publication bias suggested a 10% overstatement of treatment effects. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals reported greater effects than did unpublished studies (r² 9.3%, p = 0.009). Trial outcomes were generally modest: in particular, combined NNTs were 6.4 (95% CI 5.2–8.4) for serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, mainly including duloxetine (nine of 14 studies); 7.7 (6.5–9.4) for pregabalin; 7.2 (5.9–9.21) for gabapentin, including gabapentin extended release and enacarbil; and 10.6 (7.4–19.0) for capsaicin high-concentration patches. NNTs were lower for tricyclic antidepressants, strong opioids, tramadol, and botulinum toxin A, and undetermined for lidocaine patches. Based on GRADE, final quality of evidence was moderate or high for all treatments apart from lidocaine patches; tolerability and safety, and values and preferences were higher for topical drugs; and cost was lower for tricyclic antidepressants and tramadol. These findings permitted a strong recommendation for use and proposal as first-line treatment in neuropathic pain for tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, pregabalin, and gabapentin; a weak recommendation for use and proposal as second line for lidocaine patches, capsaicin high-concentration patches, and tramadol; and a weak recommendation for use and proposal as third line for strong opioids and botulinum toxin A. Topical agents and botulinum toxin A are recommended for peripheral neuropathic pain only.

Interpretation

Our results support a revision of the NeuPSIG recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain. Inadequate response to drug treatments constitutes a substantial unmet need in patients with neuropathic pain. Modest efficacy, large placebo responses, heterogeneous diagnostic criteria, and poor phenotypic profiling probably account for moderate trial outcomes and should be taken into account in future studies.

### Differential effects of a 5% lidocaine medicated patch in peripheral nerve injury [^ee656423]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

We examined the effect of topical lidocaine on the function of small and large fibers in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain due to traumatic or postoperative nerve injury.

Methods

In an open-label study, 24 patients were treated with a 5% lidocaine patch for up to 12 weeks. We recorded contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPs) and performed quantitative sensory testing (QST) before and after treatment with the contralateral side as control.

Results

Twenty-one patients (mean age 47.6 ± 13.5 years) completed the study. Lidocaine increased cold pain threshold (P = 0.04) and reduced CHEP amplitude (P = 0.007) with no effect on other QST parameters. Patients responding to treatment had less cold detection deficit on the affected side and had a larger increase in cold pain detection threshold following treatment than nonresponders.

Conclusions

Controlled trials are warranted to further understand the mechanisms mediating the effects of topical lidocaine.

Topical Treatments

Topical treatments must be distinguished from transdermal formulations such as the fentanyl or clonidine patches that deliver systemic medication through the skin. Topical medications remain local, reaching dermal nerve endings, blood vessels, and other cells in the skin. Topical medications are appealing by virtue of their relative lack of systemic effects; rashes and allergies are their only major adverse effect. Topical options to consider for CRPS include the 5% lidocaine impregnated patch, the capsaicin and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (all level 4 for CRPS).

Some clinicians endorse the use Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) for patients with CRPS (level 3 evidence) but it must be applied under an occlusive cover (e.g. plastic food wrap) to maximize penetration. The 5% lidocaine patch is FDA-approved for treating PHN, and is available in generic formulation. It may have efficacy in some local or focal CRPS phenomena such as allodynia (level 4).

Capsaicin, the vanilloid compound in chili peppers, is a highly selective agonist for the Transient Receptor Potential channel, Vanilloid-receptor type 1 (TRPV1) that is expressed on central and peripheral terminals of nociceptive primary sensory neurons. Topical capsaicin causes activation followed by dying-back of nociceptive nerve endings by allowing unchecked cation influx. Use is limited by the painful burning sensation it evokes at the site of application until the site becomes denervated. In an RCT, topical capsaicin showed modest efficacy for PHN (level 2). A preliminary study of high-dose topical capsaicin plus regional anesthesia for CRPS demonstrated partial efficacy (level 3). We have found topical capsaicin to be intolerably painful, somewhat messy, and unacceptable to most patients (level 4). In 2009, the FDA approved a high concentration 8% capsaicin patch for treating PHN once every 3 months. It is applied to the painful area for 1 hour after topical local anesthesia. Two additional well-powered RCTs (level 2) were positive for high-versus low-dose capsaicin in peripheral neuropathic pain, including in HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy. However, in CRPS, exacerbated pain may render this treatment unsuitable (level 4).

DMSO is a free radical-scavenging agent. In a systematic review (level 1) DMSO (50% cream for 2 months) provided significant CRPS symptom reduction when compared with placebo, however pain intensity was not improved.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^43f85b0c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain, one of the underlying causes of chronic pain, may result from a lesion or a disease of the somatosensory system. Depending on the site of the lesion within the nervous system, the origin of neuropathic pain can be either central or peripheral. Although prevalence estimates vary, neuropathic pain is reported to affect up to ~18% of the population in developed countries, with up to ~60% of patients presenting with localized symptoms (localized neuropathic pain [LNP]). Based on the International Association for the Study of Pain definition of neuropathic pain, LNP is defined as a type of neuropathic pain that is "characterized by consistent and circumscribed area(s) of maximum pain associated with negative or positive sensory signs and/or spontaneous symptoms characteristic of neuropathic pain". Common LNP conditions, predominantly occurring in elderly individuals, include postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), and neuropathic postoperative pain.–Neuropathic pain conditions can be debilitating, with a serious negative impact on patient functioning, daily activities, and overall quality of life (QoL).

The management of neuropathic pain is complex and multidisciplinary, requiring thorough physician knowledge of the various underlying pain mechanisms involved, the pharmacological options available for optimal pain management, and the individual needs of the patient (eg, elderly, receiving multiple medications). Nevertheless, despite the availability of numerous management guidelines, many patients do not receive adequate pain management, and many are not satisfied with their treatment. Pharmacological treatment options include the topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin and pregabalin, and opioids.–

As discussed previously, the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster (a 10 cm×14 cm adhesive plaster, containing 700 mg [5% w/w] lidocaine; Versatis ®, Grünenthal) has a dual mode of action by providing a mechanical barrier effect and a pharmacological action via voltage-gated sodium channel blockade as a direct result of lidocaine action.

### Efficacy of lidocaine patch 5% in the treatment of focal peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^4f596379]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes (PNPS) are difficult to treat because commonly used analgesics are often ineffective when, for example, touch-evoked allodynia, hyperalgesia, and pain paroxysms are present. To investigate whether lidocaine patch 5% treatment is also effective in postherpetic neuropathy (PHN) and in other PNPS, 40 patients with various forms and localizations of PNPS completed a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-way, cross-over study in three medical hospitals. Patients suffering from pain in a localized skin area with intensity above 40 mm visual analog scale (VAS) and a stable consumption of pain medication were included in this study. The study was divided into four phases: 3-day run-in phase, treatment phase 1, wash-out period, and treatment phase 2, each lasting 1 week. At the discretion of the patients, up to four patches (covering a maximum of 560 cm2) were applied onto the maximally painful area for 12 consecutive hours daily, always either by day or at night. Throughout the four phases, ongoing pain, allodynia, quality of neuropathic symptoms, quality of sleep, and adverse events were assessed. When, after the wash-out period, the pain intensity scores did not return to the pre-treatment values (± 20%), these patients were excluded from the study. The present study revealed that, as an add-on therapy, the lidocaine patch 5% was clearly effective in reducing ongoing pain (P = 0.017) and allodynia (P = 0.023) during the first 8 h after application and that the patches also worked well over a period of 7 days (P = 0.018) in diverse focal PNPS. Calculation of the numbers needed to treat (NNT) to obtain one patient with more than 50% relief of ongoing pain revealed that the NNT of 4.4 in the present study compared reasonably well with other studies of PHN, such as topically applied capsaicin (NNT: 5.3-infinity) or systemic treatment with gabapentin (NNT: 3.2–5.0).

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^9ee733ce]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

The study by Binder et al, a double-blind, placebo plaster-controlled, parallel group study, was conducted at 33 outpatient centers in 12 European countries between April 2003 and June 2004. Patients aged ≥ 50 years with PHN and neuropathic pain persisting ≥ 3 months postrash healing and mean pain intensity of ≥ 4 on the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11) were enrolled in an 8-week open-label, active treatment (5% lidocaine medicated plaster) run-in phase. Responders entered a 2-week, double-blind phase and were randomized to the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster or a placebo plaster. Patients applied up to three plasters for up to 12 hours/day. The primary endpoint was time to exit due to a ≥ 2-point reduction in pain relief on 2 consecutive days of plaster application using a six-item verbal rating scale. Among the 263 patients entering the initial 8-week run-in phase, 51.7% (n = 137) achieved at least moderate pain relief on active treatment (responders). Seventy-one responders completed the entire 8-week initial phase and subsequently entered the double-blind phase and were randomized to the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster (n = 36) or a placebo plaster (n = 35). Median time to exit was numerically longer for the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster than the placebo plaster group (13.5 [range: 2–14] vs 9.0 [range: 1–14] days, P = 0.151). For per-protocol patients (n = 34), median time to exit was significantly longer in the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster than the placebo plaster group (14.0 [range: 3–14] vs 6.0 [range: 1–14] days, P = 0.0398). During the 8-week run-in phase, treatment with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster was associated with clinically relevant improvements in extremely painful and painful allodynia, QoL, and sleep measures, particularly in patients identified as responders.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: treatment of diabetic neuropathy [^51489e2b]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

VG: Are there any topical treatments that are used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, and which are the ones you use in clinical practice?

UA: So yes there are a number of topical treatments. So if we think about the topical treatments that I use in my own clinical practice, this includes a lidocaine patch, a 5% patch, and a glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patch. Now there is some data that suggests that these can be helpful and I tend to use this in tandem with using the 5% lidocaine patch during the day and the GTN patch at night. The initial studies were actually done with isosorbide mononitrate spray which was spayed on the feet but then subsequently Gerry Rayman showed that GTN was also effective in their study published in 2003. The other topical therapy which can be used in painful diabetic neuropathy is capsaicin cream. Now capsaicin cream needs to be applied multiple times a day and it can actually induce a burning feeling when it's applied. It has an effect via a TRPV1 receptor, also known as the chilli receptor, but that sort of limits its use due to the number of times daily that the application is required and some of the side effects that go with it. There is, however, an 8% capsaicin patch which can be applied now; this is applied and then the repeat therapy is required a number of weeks later. But there's not a great deal of data really for painful diabetic neuropathy for this patch, but I am aware that there are some ongoing studies.

VG: And are there any other options for people who do not respond to oral and topical therapies?

UA: So for those with intractable pain who are really refractive to oral and to topical therapy, there is the IV lidocaine infusion. Now, this has previously been used in a study in 2006 which was published in the Journal of Diabetes and its Complications and was used in painful diabetic neuropathy. So the dose is recommended at 5–7.5 mg per kg over a period of 4 h and then generally the therapy is repeated at a 10-weekly basis. And it's thought around half of people with intractable pain will have some kind of benefit from IV lidocaine and it's thought the mechanism can be twofold: one is to reduce the central sensitisation, and the other is modulation of sodium channels. But this, of course, requires treatment in a specialist setting and usually in a pain clinic with [continuous] ECG monitoring.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^8251d968]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) — nonopioid pharmacological recommendations include early initiation of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (strong, low). Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line oral pharmacological treatment (strong, moderate), with a typical adult regimen that will titrate to 2400 mg per day in divided doses; somnolence was reported by 80% of patients who received gabapentin. If patients have an inadequate response to gabapentin, clinicians might consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors based on their effectiveness in the general population (weak, moderate), a trial of tricyclic antidepressants (weak, moderate), or a trial of pregabalin for patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (weak, moderate). Capsaicin is recommended as a topical treatment for chronic HIV-associated peripheral neuropathic pain (strong, high), with a single 30-minute application of an 8% dermal patch or cream at the site of pain providing pain relief for at least 12 weeks; erythema and pain are common side effects for which a 60-minute application of 4% lidocaine can be applied and wiped off before applying capsaicin. Medical cannabis may be an effective treatment in appropriate patients (weak, moderate), and values and preferences place a relatively high value on symptom reduction and a relatively low value on the legal implication of medical cannabis possession; current evidence suggests medical cannabis may be more effective for patients with a history of prior cannabis use.

Regarding medical management for postherpetic neuralgia, more specifically with respect to topical anesthetics, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to consider offering topical lidocaine as first-line therapy in elderly patients with PHN, especially if there are concerns regarding the CNS side effects of oral medications. Attempt a trial of 2–4 weeks before starting other therapy.

### Effect and safety profile of topical lidocaine on post-surgical neuropathic pain and quality of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^22a4cbd6]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Post-surgical chronic pain with a neuropathic component is usually more severe and leads to worse quality of life. We conducted this systematic review to examine the evidence of topical lidocaine for post-surgical neuropathic pain.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis.

Setting

Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical lidocaine with placebo or no topical lidocaine for post-surgical neuropathic pain.

Patients

Seven RCTs including 585 patients.

Interventions

We systematically searched databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect and safety outcomes of topical lidocaine compared with placebo or no intervention.

Measurements

We conducted meta-analyses to evaluate the effect of topical lidocaine on pain intensity, adverse events, and quality of life. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs were effect measures for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. We assessed the risk of bias of included trials and the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Our review included 7 studies with 585 participants. There is moderate certainty evidence that topical lidocaine may increase the likelihood of global pain relief, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 3.76; I² = 70%, P = 0.04). Low certainty evidence suggested topical lidocaine may lead to more reduction in pain intensity (SMD: -0.70; 95% confidence interval: -1.46, 0.06; I² = 93%, P = 0.07). High certainty evidence showed that topical lidocaine did not increase the adverse event risk (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.16; I² = 0%, P = 0.51).

Conclusions

Topical lidocaine may lead to pain relief and is safe to use for patient with post-surgical pain, though its impact on quality of life is unclear. This review supports the use of topical lidocaine for patients with post-surgical pain, and reveals the evidence gap in topical lidocaine use. (Registration: PROSPERO CRD42021294100).

Further outcomes

Patients reported marked impairments in daily life activities at baseline (table 1), which improved under both treatments over the observation period (p < 0.001 in favor of LMP, figure 2C). Similar to the observations for pain intensity changes, considerable improvements had already occurred after 4 weeks of LMP treatment with further slight improvements in the following 20 weeks.

Pain-related quality of life was also considerably impaired at baseline: 76.6% of patients on LMP and 73.6% of patients on OM were severely affected with a QLIP sum score of ≤ 20. Continuous improvements were observed under both treatments, however, with a significant treatment difference in favor of LMP (p < 0.001, figure 2D). At week 24, the proportion of severely impaired patients had decreased to 12.7% in the LMP group and 32% in the OM group.

Overall quality of life with respect to the physical components was markedly affected at baseline. Under LMP treatment, it had already considerably improved after 4 treatment weeks with a further slight increase until the end of observation (median relative change 10.1% after 4, 11.2% after 12, and 12.1% after 24 weeks). In contrast, the median relative change under OM treatment was 0%, 0%, and 1.1%, respectively. Improvements under LMP treatment were significantly greater than under OM treatment over the observation period (p < 0.001, figure 2E). The MCS of quality of life only slightly changed over the observation period but to a significantly greater extent in the LMP group (p < 0.001, figure 2F). The median relative change from baseline was 2.6%, 2.9%, and 4% for LMP and 0% under OM treatment.

Pain intensity

At baseline, the mean PIX was 64.2 ± 14.9 mm for patients on LMP and 64.1 ± 14.9 mm for patients on OM (table 1). Reductions in pain intensity were already considerable after 4 weeks of LMP treatment with further slight improvements in the following 20 weeks. The absolute change in average 24-hour PIX from baseline (primary effectiveness endpoint) was significantly greater for patients on LMP than for patients on OM at all three timepoints (4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment) with an effect size of 0.662 at end of observation (figure 2A). The change in absolute scores for the average 24-hour PIX was mean −30.2 mm (SE 0.38) in the LMP group and −17.0 mm (SE 0.51) in the OM group over the 24-week treatment period. A relative mean change from baseline in PIX was noted in 51.4% of patients on LMP and 27.7% of patients on OM at end of observation (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.888). Treatment response after 24 weeks was significantly higher in the LMP group than in the OM group (figure 2B).

### Pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain: evidence-based recommendations [^3ca12f90]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with neuropathic pain (NP) are challenging to manage and evidence-based clinical recommendations for pharmacologic management are needed. Systematic literature reviews, randomized clinical trials, and existing guidelines were evaluated at a consensus meeting. Medications were considered for recommendation if their efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically-sound, randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrating superiority to placebo or a relevant comparison treatment. Recommendations were based on the amount and consistency of evidence, degree of efficacy, safety, and clinical experience of the authors. Available RCTs typically evaluated chronic NP of moderate to severe intensity. Recommended first-line treatments include certain antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine), calcium channel alpha2-delta ligands (i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol are recommended as generally second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in select clinical circumstances. Other medications that would generally be used as third-line treatments but that could also be used as second-line treatments in some circumstances include certain antiepileptic and antidepressant medications, mexiletine, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and topical capsaicin. Medication selection should be individualized, considering side effects, potential beneficial or deleterious effects on comorbidities, and whether prompt onset of pain relief is necessary. To date, no medications have demonstrated efficacy in lumbosacral radiculopathy, which is probably the most common type of NP. Long-term studies, head-to-head comparisons between medications, studies involving combinations of medications, and RCTs examining treatment of central NP are lacking and should be a priority for future research.

### The analgesic effect of a metered-dose 8% lidocaine pump spray in posttraumatic peripheral neuropathy: a pilot study [^ec9d2f95]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A topical lidocaine patch is effective in the treatment of posttraumatic peripheral neuropathy (PTPN), but it is not suited for breakthrough pain because of difficulty with an additional application. Here, we examined the effect of 8% lidocaine pump spray (Xylocaine pump spray, XPS) on peripheral neuropathic pain caused by surgery or injury.

Methods

Thirty-one patients with PTPN were randomized to receive either XPS or saline placebo pump spray applied to painful skin areas. The optimal dose of up to 30 sprays (0.1 mL/single spray, 30 times) was individually determined as the dose which completely covered the painful site. After a 7-day period, the patients were crossed over to receive the optimal dose of the alternative spray. Pain was assessed with a visual analog scale.

Results

XPS, but not placebo pump spray, significantly decreased the visual analog scale for continuing pain and tactile allodynia. The effect persisted for a median of 5 h (range, 2–60 h) after application. Mild side effects were reported in three patients with XPS consisting of local irritation (n = 3) and local flare (n = 1). All adverse events disappeared without medication within a few hours.

Conclusions

The present study suggests that XPS provides a significant improvement in PTPN due to its prompt analgesia, lack of systemic side effects and convenience.

A recent review and meta-analysis on pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain provides a precise update on treatment efficacy and adverse effects. The authors offer revised evidence-based recommendations for first-line therapies and subsequent options, but we still a need to improve individual treatment decisions, including nonpharmacological therapies, in affected patients.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy: prevention and treatment [^95434760]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic, objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Pharmacology and treatment of neuropathic pains [^f5c9c777]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review briefly discusses the definition and clinical presentation of neuropathic pain and highlights recent advances in the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Recent Findings

Recent publications have confirmed the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and tramadol for various neuropathic pain conditions. Selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have been found to reduce pain in painful neuropathy. The new anticonvulsant lacosamide may have some effect in painful polyneuropathy, whereas levetiracetam has failed to relieve postmastectomy and spinal cord injury pain. The role of the old anticonvulsant phenytoin is still unsettled. A recent trial has found an effect of cannabinoids also in peripheral neuropathic pain. Various topical treatments such as topical lidocaine, topically applied capsaicin in high concentrations (8%), and botulinum toxin have recently been shown to have a pain-relieving effect in various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions. Spinal cord and transcranial magnetic stimulation are stimulation therapies with some evidence for efficacy.

Summary

Treating neuropathic pain remains a great challenge, and the treatment has to be individualized to the single patient, taking into account side effects, pain type, comorbidities, and drug interactions.

### EFNS guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain: 2010 revision [^83feaf61]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

This second European Federation of Neurological Societies Task Force aimed at updating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain since 2005.

Methods

Studies were identified using the Cochrane Database and Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed; lower class studies were considered only in conditions that had no top-level studies. Treatments administered using repeated or single administrations were considered, provided they are feasible in an outpatient setting.

Results

Most large RCTs included patients with diabetic polyneuropathies and post-herpetic neuralgia, while an increasing number of smaller studies explored other conditions. Drugs generally have similar efficacy in various conditions, except in trigeminal neuralgia, chronic radiculopathy and HIV neuropathy, with level A evidence in support of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), pregabalin, gabapentin, tramadol and opioids (in various conditions), duloxetine, venlafaxine, topical lidocaine and capsaicin patches (in restricted conditions). Combination therapy appears useful for TCA-gabapentin and gabapentin-opioids (level A).

Conclusions

There are still too few large-scale comparative studies. For future trials, we recommend to assess comorbidities, quality of life, symptoms and signs with standardized tools and attempt to better define responder profiles to specific drug treatments.

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^b431b920]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Painful DPN

As overviewed in Table 1, the effectiveness and safety of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster have been evaluated in several open-label studies in patients with DPN,–some of which also included patients with PHN,–or low back pain.

The comparative efficacy and tolerability of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster and pregabalin were evaluated in one study (discussed in more detail later). In the study that enrolled only patients with clinically defined painful DPN of > 3 months' duration, significant improvements in pain and QoL outcomes were observed after 3 weeks of treatment with up to four 5% lidocaine medicated plasters daily for 18 hours. Patients received the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster as add-on therapy to a stable analgesic regimen. The mean daily pain rating (using the Brief Pain Inventory [primary outcome]) reduced from 6.3 ± 1.5 (baseline) to 3.6 ± 2.1 (week 3; P ≤ 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed from baseline to week 3 in sleep quality (26.9 vs 59.6; P ≤ 0.001), all individual aspects and the overall summary score of pain interference assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (summary score: 32.1 ± 15.6 vs 20.3 ± 16.2; P ≤ 0.001), Beck Depression Inventory scores (10.5 ± 6.7 vs 7.2 ± 5.7; P ≤ 0.001), and the Profile of Mood States tension–anxiety (5.2 ± 6.8 vs 2.4 ± 5.6; P ≤ 0.001), depression–dejection (7.3 ± 8.5 vs 4.7 ± 6.3; P ≤ 0.01), anger–hostility (5.6 ± 7.0 vs 4.0 ± 6.0; P ≤ 0.05), fatigue–inertia (11.0 ± 6.7 vs 8.4 ± 6.7; P ≤ 0.001), and total mood disturbance (44.6 ± 24.6 vs 35.2 ± 19.1; P ≤ 0.001) scales. Improvements were maintained for up to a total of 8 weeks in a subgroup of patients (tapering of concomitant analgesic therapy was permitted during the 5-week extension phase). There was no systemic accumulation of lidocaine, and adverse events were minimal (mostly minor application-site events).

### The topical 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in localized neuropathic pain: a reappraisal of the clinical evidence [^4e2944cf]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Among the secondary end points, ≥ 30% (57.8% vs 48.8%) and ≥ 50% (35.6% vs 20.9%) reductions in NRS-3 scores were greater with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster than with pregabalin in patients with PHN but not in patients with DPN ([59.6% vs 56.4%] and [40.4% vs 37.2%]). Despite greater baseline values in patients with PHN than in those with painful DPN, reductions in the rates of "painful" and "extremely painful" allodynia were greater with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster (57.8% at baseline to 25.0%) than with pregabalin (62.8%–41.2%) in patients with PHN; the between-treatment reduction in allodynia severity was comparable in patients with painful DPN. Significantly fewer patients using the lidocaine patch 5% experienced drug-related adverse events compared with those taking pregabalin (P < 0.0001). Adverse events associated with the use of the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster were mainly mild-to-moderate application-site reactions, whereas, in pregabalin recipients, adverse events mainly affected the central nervous system and were of moderate-to-severe intensity.

### Characteristics of analgesic patch formulations [^34b66c62]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Analgesic patch systems, both topical and transdermal, are an effective option for treating a variety of pain syndromes and have advantages for drug delivery. Topical and transdermal systems provide benefits over oral dosing and can control drug release for prolonged delivery of analgesic medications. Topical patches are designed to keep medication localized for targeted delivery and can reduce side effects from systemic exposure. Transdermal patches deliver medication systemically and can provide more uniform plasma drug levels compared to oral administration, potentially improving compliance while bypassing first-pass metabolism and minimizing GI side effects.

Design is important in patch system creation, and characteristics and attributes of patch delivery systems affect the delivery, efficacy, and safety of the analgesic. Adhesion, though initial tack, withstanding shear, and on peeling, is a critical attribute of these systems, which also impacts compliance, cost, efficacy and safety. Patch lift can result in suboptimal drug delivery.

The amount of analgesic delivered is more important than the concentration of drug in the patch. Patch delivery systems, after use, have a residual of 10–95% of drug originally in the system. Patches that are bioequivalent may deliver the same amount of drug, but can differ substantially in design, adhesive used, and properties such as the amount of drug in the patch and the amount of residue.

Topical analgesic patch systems deliver lidocaine, lidocaine plus tetracaine, capsaicin, or diclofenac. Lidocaine patch systems, which come in a variety of bioequivalent formulations, are indicated for PHN pain, but there is evidence of providing benefit in other neuropathic pain conditions. Capsaicin patches are indicated for the management of PHN neuropathic pain in the US and recently filed for approval for treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Treatment is repeated every 3 months in a clinic setting under medical supervision. Diclofenac topical patches are available in topical formulations and could potentially minimize the systemic side effects associated with oral NSAIDs.

Fentanyl or buprenorphine transdermal analgesic patch systems in the US are designed to provide steady delivery with nearly constant plasma concentrations for several days. Buprenorphine transdermal patches are applied for 7 days and have multiple dose options available, although QTc prolongation has been seen at 40 µg/hr and higher. Exposure to heat has been a concern for transdermal medication patch systems, resulting in accelerated delivery and serious adverse events including deaths.

Analgesic patch systems are an effective option for treating a variety of pain syndromes. Attributes of these patch systems, that derive from their design and composition, affect the delivery of drug, and their efficacy and safety.

### Pain relief with lidocaine 5% patch in localized peripheral neuropathic pain in relation to pain phenotype: a randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, phenotype panel study [^9edacc06]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

In neuropathic pain with irritable nociceptor (IN) phenotype, upregulation of sodium channels on nociceptors is supposed to be an important pain mechanism that may be targeted by topical sodium channel blockade. This randomised, double-blind, phenotype panel, crossover study with 4-week treatment periods of lidocaine 5% patch and placebo was performed to search for phenotype differences in effect. The primary efficacy measure was the total pain intensity on an 11-point numeric rating scale, and the primary objective was to compare the effect of lidocaine in patients with and without IN phenotype as defined by hypersensitivity and preserved small-fibre function determined by quantitative sensory testing. Forty-six patients with neuropathic pain due to nerve injury or postherpetic neuralgia were randomised. The modified intention-to-treat population comprised 15 patients with irritable nociceptor and 25 patients with nonirritable nociceptor. In the total sample, lidocaine reduced pain by 0.3 numeric rating scale points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1–0.5) and pain-related sleep disturbance by 0.6 points (95% CI: 0.4–0.8) more than placebo (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001) and relieved pain by 0.4 verbal score (-1-5) points more (P = 0.036). For these measures, there was no significant interaction between treatment and phenotype, but there was a significant interaction for pain paroxysms (0.8, 95% CI: 0.4–1.2, P < 0.001) and deep aching pain (0.6, 95% CI: 0.1–1.0, P = 0.013). In conclusion, lidocaine 5% patch had an effect on peripheral neuropathic pain, and it may be most efficacious in patients with IN phenotype. The lack of significant phenotype differences may be caused by too low statistical power.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^4a778cb7]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Capsaicin. Capsaicin has its action through binding to the TRPV1 receptor located on the Aδ and C-nerve fibers. This results in release of substance P and depolarization of the nerve. Long-term exposure causes overstimulation, depletion of substance P, desensitization of the nerve, and reversible nerve degeneration. High-concentration capsaicin (8%) is recommended as third-line, fourth-line, and as an alternative in focal neuropathic pain for those who "wish to avoid, or who cannot tolerate, oral treatments". Capsaicin is painful on initial application, and its efficacy depends on regular consistent use, thus making compliance with a capsaicin-based regimen challenging for many.

A recent Cochrane review of 8% capsaicin in PHN showed 30–50% pain relief at 12 weeks, and the NNT was 10–12 for PHN and 11 for HIV-related peripheral neuropathy. Ten percent of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy reported feeling "much improved", and for HIV peripheral neuropathy, the NNT to report being "much improved" was 8.8 (5.3–2.6). Finnerup and colleagues' meta-analysis for the treatment of PHN and HIV peripheral neuropathy demonstrated a combined NNT of 10 (7.4–19).

Transdermal Substances

Only lidocaine and capsaicin are referred to in the various international guidelines on management of neuropathic pain. However, some limited evidence is available on topical preparations of ketamine, amitriptyline, diclofenac, and clonidine. A transdermal approach may provide an alternative approach for some patients. It is also worth noting that some medications are ineffective topically.

Ketamine at 10% has been shown to be effective in CRPS, whereas lower doses were not more beneficial than placebo in PHN and DPN. Diclofenac may decrease burning in PHN and CRPS but has no effect on other features of neuropathic pain. Clonidine has a limited effect, decreasing pain up to 30% in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, with an NNT of 8.33 (4.3–5.0). Alternatively, amitriptyline in concentrations of 1–5% has been shown to be ineffective in the treatment of PHN, DPN, postsurgical neuropathic pain, and painful peripheral neuropathy.

Second-Line Treatment

### Characteristics of analgesic patch formulations [^44d73d96]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical Analgesic Patch Systems

Analgesics used in prescription topical analgesic patch systems include lidocaine, lidocaine plus tetracaine, lidocaine plus prilocaine, capsaicin, and diclofenac. These systems are designed to deliver the drug locally, minimizing systemic exposure.

Prescription Lidocaine Patch Systems

Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels involved in the propagation of action potentials. Lidocaine patch systems target these channels are expressed on A delta and C fibers, some of which are found in or just under the skin. Blockage reduces ectopic discharges thought to underlie certain aspects of persistent pain.

Lidocaine patch systems are indicated for the relief of pain associated with PHN. Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of prescription lidocaine patch systems in PHN. There are also studies that show that topical lidocaine patch systems may be effective in relieving pain associated with other painful conditions such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, lower back pain, and osteoarthritis. These findings warrant further study. Lidocaine patches are generally regarded to have limited safety concerns. Application site reactions occur with the most common being skin irritation that is usually mild and transient.,

There are seven lidocaine patch systems marketed in the United States, the original 5% lidocaine patch and six others approved through the ANDA and 505(b)(2) pathways (Table 1). All seven are of the DIA design and are indicated for the treatment of pain associated with PHN. Lidocaine patch systems are applied for a 12-hour dosing period followed by a 12-hour off/rest period. A maximum of three patches can be applied at a time and they may be cut into smaller pieces.

Table 1
Characteristics and Composition of Prescription Lidocaine Topical Formulations

There are three patch types available (Table 1). The original 5% patch system and four generics have similar compositions, use acrylic-based PSAs, and each contains 700 mg of lidocaine in 14 g of adhesive mix. Another 5% patch differs in that it uses a PBI-based PSA adhesive and contains 140 mg of lidocaine in 2.8 g of adhesive. The remaining patch is a 1.8% lidocaine patch system. All are the same size (10 × 14 cm), although the last two patch systems described are considerably thinner than the others (Table 1).

### Long-term treatment of neuropathic pain with a 5% lidocaine medicated plaster [^160f8781]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The 5% lidocaine medicated plaster is a topical treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain symptoms (e.g. burning, shooting and stabbing pain) and is registered for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. This study examined the efficacy and tolerability of long-term treatment with the 5% lidocaine medicated plaster in patients with localized neuropathic pain conditions.

Methods

Twenty patients with localized neuropathic pain [postoperative neuropathic pain (n = 14); complex regional pain syndrome (n = 2); and postherpetic neuralgia (n = 4)], who had been successfully treated with 5% lidocaine medicated plaster, were followed up by telephone interview after 3 and 5 years. Questions were related to the efficacy, development of tolerance, tolerability, wear time and comfort of the plaster.

Results

At 3 years, 10 out of 20 (50%) initial responders were still using the plasters with no decline in analgesic efficacy. After 5 years, eight of the original 20 responders (40%) maintained treatment and continued to experience effective pain relief. The 12 responders who discontinued treatment did so because they no longer required analgesic therapy (n = 4); their health insurer refused to fund treatment (n = 2); they were lost to follow-up (n = 1); or had died from an illness unrelated to plaster treatment (n = 5). No patient discontinued because of inadequate analgesia or intolerable side effects. Reversible erythema occurred in two patients wearing the plaster for more than 16 h. There were no systemic side effects.

Conclusion

The 5% lidocaine medicated plaster provides sustained pain relief over long-term treatment in patients with neuropathic pain of various causes and is well tolerated.

### The efficacy and safety profile of capsaicin 8% patch versus 5% lidocaine patch in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, placebo-controlled study of south Asian male patients [^66292a88]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects up to 60% of individuals and often leads to foot ulceration and eventual amputation. When oral therapy has failed to achieve pain relief, the first line local treatment is the 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster which provides local relief. Capsaicin 8% patch is considered a promising topical treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The present study investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of capsaicin 8% patch vs 5% lidocaine patch treatments over 24 weeks in South Asian male diabetic patients with established peripheral diabetic neuropathy.

Methods

Analgesic effectiveness was assessed by observing any change in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN question 4) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). All patients received 4% lidocaine gel/cream for 60 min prior to patch application. The trial was probably underpowered, taking into account the smaller than expected number of participants from the calculated 350 sample size required for the whole study. Two hundred ninety-one individuals were divided into three groups based on treatment regimen; Group LL (Lidocaine + Lidocaine), Group LP (Lidocaine + Placebo), Group LC (Lidocaine + Capsaicin). The treatment procedure was conducted once initially and then repeated once at 12 weeks. The patients were followed up on alternate weeks till 24 weeks after the initial treatment.

Results

Group LC experienced a more significant reduction in the average pain intensity (p < 0.05) during the last twenty-four hours. Group LC showed more significant reduction of pain compared to control (p < 0.01), a baseline score of 5.4 ± 1.2 dropped to 3.2 ± 1.5 by week 24 of treatment. The change in mean daily pain intensity was - 2.2 ± 1.5 [95% CI: -2.45, -1.5]. Group LL and LC experienced a significant overall improvement (slightly, much or very much) in the health status during the study. After the second week of the treatment, patient satisfaction scores were 2.1 ± 1.1 in Group LL which increased to 3.2 ± 1.2 by week 24 of treatment. The capsaicin 8% patch appears to be reasonably well tolerated since there were no discontinuations because of serious drug-related treatment emergent adverse event (TEAEs).

Conclusions

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the 8% capsaicin patch in patients with established painful diabetic neuropathy. There was a sustained treatment response to the initial and repeat treatment of the capsaicin 8% patch over the 24 weeks. The study population was very specific so further studies are required to investigate the generalizability of the results for patients experiencing painful diabetic neuropathy. The patch could be considered as an effective long-term treatment option in individuals with painful diabetic neuropathy, particularly those experiencing inadequate pain relief or side effects from systemic therapies.

The use of nonopioid analgesics — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be administered at their lowest effective analgesic doses both in the ED and upon discharge, and should be given for the shortest appropriate treatment course, with caution strongly advised in patients at risk for renal insufficiency, heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and in the elderly. Patients who present with acute pain warranting NSAIDs can be given topical NSAID preparations (Diclofenac gel or patch) when there are contraindications to systemic use. Other considerations include topical preparations of lidocaine, which is available as both a gel and patch, and lidocaine comes available in a 5% patch formulation, which has shown to be both safe and effective for various neurologic and musculoskeletal conditions including acute and chronic low back pain, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^249a3ce0]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacologic analgesia — lidocaine: Intravenous lidocaine infusions decrease pain by multiple mechanisms, but while some perioperative evidence exists, studies on trauma patients are lacking; in a high-quality, prospective randomized controlled trial in total hip arthroplasty, no difference in pain scores or opioid requirements was observed with perioperative lidocaine infusions versus placebo. Consider regional blocks (neuraxial/peripheral nerve blocks) in localized injury patterns, and the assistance of an acute pain service is recommended. Topical lidocaine patches may offer pain reduction with minimal concern for systemic absorption, but efficacy remains unclear; use patches with caution near open wounds. Do not administer a continuous infusion of lidocaine to patients with a regional block when also infusing an amide anesthetic due to risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), and protocols for recognizing LAST are recommended.

### Bottlenecks in the development of topical analgesics: molecule, formulation, dose-finding, and phase III design [^eeff8712]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Many more pathophysiological mechanisms can be involved in the development and maintenance of a specific neuropathic pain syndrome. For example, for both capsaicin and lidocaine plasters, the approved indication is postherpetic neuralgia. The two APIs have entirely different mechanisms of action and thus influence different parts of the multifactorial pathophysiological mechanism. It would therefore not be surprising that synergism might occur when combined together. However, both in the preclinical models for neuropathic pain and in clinical trials, a rational approach to the analysis of optimal combinations is missing.

First, a good match is needed between the selected APIs and the indication. There are a multitude of neuropathic pain states, which most certainly differ in pathogenesis. SFN in sarcoidosis will have many different pathogenetic characteristics compared to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), and diabetic neuropathy will differ from postherpetic neuropathy and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. For instance, many inflammatory markers are upregulated in the skin of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy patients, just as in Lyme disease, but not in the skin of diabetic patients. The same holds true for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), where keratinocyte and mast cell activation and proliferation as well as inflammatory mediator release can be found in the skin. In diabetes patients, the epidermal neuropilin-1 receptor expression is high in the epidermal layer of diabetic subjects suffering from polyneuropathy, compared to controls. Neuropilin-1 receptor trafficking toward the membranes of all epidermal cells in diabetes might play an important role in the development of SFN. An understanding of the exact pathogenesis in the skin in a variety of neuropathic pain syndromes is still preliminary, but, clearly, it will differ considerably in various syndromes. Topical ketamine and/or clonidine, for instance, might be more suitable and more directly linked to the pathogenesis in CRPS compared to topical baclofen.–Second, the selected end points can make or break the study. In the amitriptyline-ketamine study, the primary analysis as defined in the protocol was an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to assess changes in pain, numbness, and tingling from baseline to week 6. To expect analgesics to influence numbness, without any indications of such an effect from past studies, seems unrealistic. The selection of

### Treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: an update [^fd1ba635]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in approximately 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus who are treated in the office setting and significantly affects quality of life. It typically causes burning pain, paresthesias, and numbness in a stocking-glove pattern that progresses proximally from the feet and hands. Clinicians should carefully consider the patient's goals and functional status and potential adverse effects of medication when choosing a treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Pregabalin and duloxetine are the only medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating this disorder. Based on current practice guidelines, these medications, with gabapentin and amitriptyline, should be considered for the initial treatment. Second-line therapy includes opioid-like medications (tramadol and tapentadol), venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and topical agents (lidocaine patches and capsaicin cream). Isosorbide dinitrate spray and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may provide relief in some patients and can be considered at any point during therapy. Opioids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are optional third-line medications. Acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, alpha lipoic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine, primrose oil, and electromagnetic field application lack high-quality evidence to support their use.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^8cf84612]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pooled Dataset Analyses

Efficacy in the pooled efficacy population was evaluated in two patient subpopulations defined by median age at baseline: < 73 years and ≥ 73 years. The cut-off of 73 years was chosen as it represents the median age of participants in the included trials, providing a balanced perspective on the treatment's impact across the study population. The following outcomes, all based on the NPRS score for patients' average pain intensity experienced in the previous 24 hours, were evaluated in the capsaicin patch and low-dose capsaicin control patch groups: mean change and mean percent change from baseline to week 2–12; and responder status defined as mean decrease in NPRS score from baseline to week 2–12 of i) ≥ 30%; ii) ≥ 50%; and iii) ≥ 2 points. The cut-off values for the definition of responders have been based on the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations.

In the pooled safety population, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were also evaluated in two patient subpopulations, < 75 years and ≥ 75 years, according to treatment received (capsaicin patch or control/SoC). The age threshold was set at 75 years in line with regulatory guidelines that emphasize the importance of evaluating treatment effects in patients aged 75 years and above, a demographic often underrepresented in clinical research. Overall, 1,924 patients had received a single application of the capsaicin patch, and 924 patients had received multiple (up to nine) capsaicin patch treatments. Some patients were offered the option to enter long-term open-label extension trials and receive capsaicin patch treatments after having completed a randomized single-application trial. As a result, of the 924 patients with multiple capsaicin patch treatments, 153 patients had already received a prior control treatment.

The cut-off of 75 years for the elderly subpopulation was selected to encompass the upper two of the three life stages that the older adult population is commonly divided into ("young-old" [65–74 years], "middle-old" [75–84 years], and "old-old" [≥ 85 years]). AEs were considered treatment-emergent if onset was on or after the first topical local anesthetic application or if a pre-existing medical condition worsened on or after the first day of treatment. All AEs for the pooled analysis were coded to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 13.1.

### Open-label adhesion performance studies of a new lidocaine topical system 1.8% versus lidocaine patches 5% and lidocaine medicated plaster 5% in healthy subjects [^8f661ce9]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

FDA recently moved to use of a standardized nomenclature for topical or transdermal dosage forms, referred to as "systems" instead of "patches". In February 2018, FDA approved ZTlido ® (lidocaine topical system 1.8%; Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. San Diego, CA), which is indicated for relief of pain associated with PHN. The lidocaine topical system 1.8%, lidocaine medicated plaster 5%, and lidocaine patch 5% products are all topical dosage forms (ie, they all deliver lidocaine topically to the site of pain). The lidocaine topical system 1.8% is a thin and flexible anhydrous lidocaine delivery system that was developed to provide transcutaneous lidocaine exposure equivalent to the prescription lidocaine 5% products (lidocaine patch 5% and lidocaine medicated plaster 5% in the United States and European Union, respectively), with a significantly reduced drug load per system (36 mg vs 700 mg). Approval of the lidocaine topical system 1.8% was based, in part, on its demonstrated bioequivalence to the lidocaine patch 5%, allowing for comparable pain relief with greater bioavailability of lidocaine. Thus, with the same surface area, 140 cm 2, one dose of the lidocaine topical system 1.8% provides lidocaine exposure equivalent to one lidocaine patch 5%.

Pain Management

Overall, it is estimated that more than half of patients with T2D develop signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy during their lifetime, with rates of 20–30% in newly diagnosed and early-stage (first few years) disease. Neuropathic pain is a cardinal symptom of DPN and is often severe, poorly diagnosed and difficult to treat. From the patient's perspective, painful DPN has a marked negative impact on daily functioning (sleeping, walking, driving, exercising, working, and performing other daily activities) and HR-QoL which, in turn, increases the social and economic burden of the disease.

Successful treatment of painful DPN requires a personalized approach balancing pain relief with improvements in daily functioning and HR-QoL. To achieve this, it is likely that more sophisticated tools beyond simple pain scores (eg, VAS or NPRS) will provide better feedback about neuropathic symptoms. The Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 evaluates the frequency and intensity of individual neuropathy sensory symptoms frequently identified by DPN patients (ie, numbness and/or insensitivity, prickling and/or tingling sensation, burning sensation, aching pain and/or tightness, sharp, shooting, lancinating pain, and allodynia and/or hyperalgesia). The modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score evaluates the presence of symptoms (ie, foot pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, ataxia and upper limb symptoms) and clinical signs (ie sensory pinprick, temperature, light touch, vibration, and position sense) associated with DPN.

At present, there is a significant need for more effective and better-tolerated treatment options for painful DPN, as many affected patients continue to experience pain despite treatment. While initial responses to current guideline-recommended oral treatments (eg, antiepileptics and antidepressants) may be good, pharmacological tolerance often occurs and higher dosages may be needed to achieve the same level of pain relief. This increases the likelihood of ADRs. Such patients may benefit from treatment choices that are better tolerated, such as lower-dose combination therapy (pharmacological and non-pharmacological), topical agents (eg, capsaicin 8% topical systems), nutraceuticals, and non-pharmacological approaches (eg, nerve stimulation).

### Reduction of painful area as new possible therapeutic target in post-herpetic neuropathic pain treated with 5% lidocaine medicated plaster: a case series [^5000ae9a]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is neuropathic pain persisting after an acute episode of herpes zoster, and is associated with severe pain and sensory abnormalities that adversely affect the patient's quality of life and increase health care costs. Up to 83% of patients with PHN describe localized neuropathic pain, defined as "a type of neuropathic pain characterized by consistent and circumscribed area(s) of maximum pain". Topical treatments have been suggested as a first-line treatment for localized neuropathic pain. Use of 5% lidocaine medicated plaster could reduce abnormal nervous peripheral discharge and via the plaster could have a "protective" function in the affected area. It has been suggested that use of this plaster could reduce pain as well as the size of the painful area. To evaluate this possible outcome, we retrospectively reviewed eight patients with PHN, treated using 5% lidocaine medicated plaster. During a follow-up period of 3 months, we observed good pain relief, which was associated with a 46% reduction in size of the painful area after one month (from 236.38 ± 140.34 cm 2 to 128.80 ± 95.7 cm 2) and a 66% reduction after 3 months (81.38 ± 59.19 cm 2). Our study cohort was composed mainly of elderly patients taking multiple drugs to treat comorbidities, who have a high risk of drug–drug interactions. Such patients benefit greatly from topical treatment of PHN. Our observations confirm the effectiveness of lidocaine plasters in the treatment of PHN, indicating that 5% lidocaine medicated plaster could reduce the size of the painful area. This last observation has to be confirmed and the mechanisms clarified in appropriate larger randomized controlled trials.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^bd3de9a6]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy can be used as an adjunct or to address comorbid symptoms in the general population; however, options are very limited in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with adverse effects. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, or acetaminophen (500 mg every 6 h, maximum dose of 2 g per day) can be used for nociceptive pain. If necessary, opioids can be used in the short term for acute pain (e.g. hydromorphone 1 mg every 6 h as needed; oxycodone 2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed; or fentanyl patch in select patients).TCAs (e.g. nortriptyline 10 mg nightly) can be used with caution for multiple symptoms, as well as neuropathic pain. Low‐dose SNRIs can be used for neuropathic pain or to relieve associated depression or fatigue with a small risk of hepatotoxicity. Gabapentin at low starting doses (e.g. 300 mg per day) or pregabalin (e.g. 50 mg twice per day) can relieve neuropathic pain or associated sleep difficulties or anxiety. Lidocaine patches can be used for peripheral neuropathic pain or postherpetic neuralgia. Topical capsaicin can also be used for peripheral neuropathic pain.

Peripheral neuropathic pain — non-opioid pharmacologic therapy is described with tiered options: "First-line drugs include gabapentinoid agents and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, second-line drugs such as capsaicin and lidocaine patches and creams, and third-line drugs including opioids". Gabapentinoids "such as gabapentin and pregabalin, are commonly prescribed", they "function through binding to voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) found on the presynaptic membrane", thereby "reducing calcium influx at presynaptic terminals", though "they also induce adverse effects, resulting in patients discontinuing treatment". Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors "have emerged as key pharmacological treatments", they "impede reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine", and "Venlafaxine and duloxetine are both highly therapeutic options… However, they also may have significant side effects, leading to discontinuation". Topical options include that "Lidocaine transdermal patches and capsaicin cream act as viable second-line pharmacologic interventions", where "Lidocaine works through… inhibition of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels (VGSCs), whereas capsaicin… interacts with Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)… resulting in desensitization of nociceptive nerves". Emerging approaches note "potential roles for… small molecule inhibitors… anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, and gene therapy… with evolving research focused on LX9211, Vixotrigine, Mirogabalin, Adalimumab and infliximab, and Engensis".

### Interventional clinical trials on diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a retrospective analysis [^8c495108]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of medical products need to be reviewed before they are used in the general population, which is supervised and implemented by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Drugs can be approved by the FDA in a variety of ways.FDA approval of a new drug is associated with an increase in the publication of clinical trial registrations and reports of results for the drug. However, the failure of new DPN drugs approved by the FDA may be related to the low annual registration rate of clinical trials, the delay in reporting test results, the low publication rate of articles or the stage of the clinical trial. Therefore, in future research, we should develop drugs based on the pathogenesis of DPN and reduce side effects. External treatments of DPN include topical drug therapies and device treatments. For patients who cannot tolerate oral medications, topical medication is a good choice. The most common local analgesics are lidocaine, capsaicin, and amitriptyline. Lidocaine patches can improve the quality of life of patients with DPN, and their efficacy is equivalent to that of pregabalin. Capsaicin can reduce pain and improve sleep quality in patients with DPN. Our study found that 11 clinical trials investigated topical drugs as interventions, and 7% of the published clinical trials involved topical drug therapies. Topical drug therapies are safe and effective and are a valuable choice for the treatment of DPN. Due to oral drug intolerance and the high proportion of elderly patients, the development of topical drugs has great potential.

Research on device treatments has shown that high-frequency spinal cord stimulation is a safe and effective means of providing analgesia, and pulsed electromagnetic fields can regulate neuropathic pain and nerve impulses. Plantar electrical stimulation can improve the ankle brachial index and enhance motor ability and plantar sensation in patients with DPN. In this study, we found that electrical stimulation device studies accounted for half of the studies on devices. Electrical stimulation has no contraindications or side effects and may be an effective alternative and adjuvant therapy for DPN.

### An open-label study of the lidocaine patch 5% in painful idiopathic sensory polyneuropathy [^084a2e5a]. Pain Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Painful idiopathic distal sensory polyneuropathy is common, but has been largely ignored as a model for the evaluation of neuropathic pain therapies. We have therefore conducted a safety, tolerability, and effectiveness study of the lidocaine patch 5% in painful idiopathic distal sensory polyneuropathy.

Design

A prospective open-label, flexible dosing, 3-week study period with a 5-week extension.

Setting

Peripheral Neuropathy clinics and Anesthesiology Clinical Research Center at a tertiary care facility.

Patients

Twenty subjects with a diagnosis of idiopathic distal sensory polyneuropathy (with or without associated impaired glucose tolerance), with a baseline mean pain daily rating of ≥ 4 on a visual analog scale. Intervention. Lidocaine patch 5%, maximum of four patches daily for 18 hours.

Main Outcome Measure

Change from baseline week to week 3 mean daily diary pain ratings. Secondary endpoints included assessments of safety and tolerability as well as quality of life measures.

Results

Subjects with idiopathic distal sensory polyneuropathy, both with and without impaired glucose tolerance, showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life outcome measures over a 3-week treatment period. These improvements were maintained in a subgroup of patients treated for an additional 5 weeks and permitted a taper of concomitant analgesics in 25% of subjects. The lidocaine patch 5% was well tolerated.

Conclusions

The lidocaine patch 5% appeared well tolerated and potentially effective in the management of painful idiopathic distal sensory polyneuropathy. Idiopathic distal sensory polyneuropathy is an appropriate patient population for the conduct of clinical trials of neuropathic pain therapies.

### Systemic administration of local anesthetics to relieve neuropathic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^42f0c883]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

We reviewed randomized controlled trials to determine the efficacy and safety of systemically administered local anesthetics compared with placebo or active drugs. Of 41 retrieved studies, 27 trials of diverse quality were included in the systematic review. Ten lidocaine and nine mexiletine trials had data suitable for meta-analysis (n = 706 patients total). Lidocaine (most commonly 5 mg/kg IV over 30–60 min) and mexiletine (median dose, 600 mg daily) were superior to placebo (weighted mean difference on a 0–100 mm pain intensity visual analog scale = -10.60; 95% confidence interval: -14.52 to -6.68; P < 0.00001) and equal to morphine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and amantadine (weighted mean difference = -0.60; 95% confidence interval: -6.96 to 5.75) for neuropathic pain. The therapeutic benefit was more consistent for peripheral pain (trauma, diabetes) and central pain. The most common adverse effects of lidocaine and mexiletine were drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness. The adverse event rate for systemically administered local anesthetics was more than for placebo but equivalent to morphine, amitriptyline, or gabapentin (odds ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence interval: 0.22 to 6.90). Lidocaine and mexiletine produced no major adverse events in controlled clinical trials, were superior to placebo to relieve neuropathic pain, and were as effective as other analgesics used for this condition.

### Real-world evaluation of botulinum toxin A in focal peripheral neuropathic pain: longitudinal outcomes [^32d1c352]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design

This was a prospective, observational, bi‐centric study conducted in two pain centers in southern France (Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Marseille and CHU de Nice).

2.2 Patient Population

Adult patients referred for chronic focal peripheral NP refractory to conventional treatments were consecutively included between May 2022 and May 2025. This date corresponded to the predefined censoring point for data extraction.

All patients received botulinum toxin type A (BT‐A) as part of standard care, following a multidisciplinary clinical decision. Eligible patients presented with pain that was localized, persistent for at least 3 months, and compatible with a diagnosis of peripheral NP according to the grading system proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Patients had previously failed or not tolerated at least two pharmacological options, including gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. duloxetine, venlafaxine), or topical agents (capsaicin, lidocaine).

Patients were excluded if previously treated with BT‐A in the past year, allergic, or pregnant/breastfeeding. All patients provided written consent for the use of their anonymized clinical data for research purposes.

2.3 Treatment Protocol

Patients received subcutaneous injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), administered according to standard clinical practice. Injection sites and dosages were individualized by the treating physician based on the distribution and intensity of pain, without a standardized injection scheme. In accordance with current prescribing recommendations, the maximum dose per treatment cycle did not exceed 150 units for facial indications and 300 units for other body regions. Treatment cycles were generally spaced at approximately three‐month intervals, although this timing could vary by approximately 15 days depending on clinical or logistical constraints.

On patient request, additional comfort measures could be provided, including topical anesthetic patches (lidocaine/prilocaine), nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation (N 2 O/O 2), relaxation techniques, or hypnosis (delivered by a specialized nurse assisting during the procedure).

### Intravenous lidocaine for treatment of chronic pain: a retrospective cohort study [^e1a26d47]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with peripheral (mono)neuropathy and small fiber neuropathy showed an above-average response to lidocaine as well. We hypothesize that this may be due to the direct blocking effect of lidocaine in several locations of abnormally behaving nerve tissues and/or preventing their excessive activation. Given the very small number of patients in the group with vascular pain, their response to lidocaine should be evaluated in a larger number of patients in order to interpret the meaning of this finding.

Opioid-refractory cancer pain was shown to be treated more effectively with intravenous lidocaine than with a placebo in a study by Sharma et al. Also, a systematic review by Lee et alshowed potential benefits of lidocaine in cancer pain. Our data cannot confirm these findings, since none of the patients with cancer pain reported any pain relief. This may be coincidental, due to the very small number of patients in this group (five), or perhaps the dosing scheme has something to do with the difference in effect.

A remarkable finding in our population is the small effect that lidocaine treatment seems to have on radicular pain, including postherpetic neuralgia. This is in contrast with some earlier studies, including a recent placebo-controlled study on postherpetic pain, which found a significantly lower VAS and decrease in analgesic rescue medication when lidocaine infusions were administered. Previous studies on postherpetic neuralgia, however, show only a moderate decrease in allodynia(not specifically tested by us) and benefit from lidocaine 5% patches. The latter was considered to arise from the systemic effects of the lidocaine, because of the large surface area of the patches, but nevertheless is a completely different treatment and hence, in our opinion, not comparable.

To our knowledge, this is one of the largest studies, or even the largest study, to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine infusion in neuropathic pain patients. Furthermore, it is the only study so far assessing the clinical effect in a heterogeneous study population, which enables the extrapolation of treatment effects to daily clinical pain practice. By stratifying treatment results on pain diagnosis, we were able to assess which pain patients would be likely to benefit most from lidocaine treatment. The described pain diagnoses for which lidocaine infusions were indicated resemble those reported in the literature. Moreover, a unique dosing scheme using a high total dose during a long infusion period, maintaining a low infusion rate, is used. No other study, to date, has reported the effects of a similar or comparable dosing scheme.

Recommendation 7 and Statements 7a–7d — trialing, switching, and combining medications: A series of medications may need to be tried to identify the treatment that most benefits a given patient with PDN, and a treatment to reduce neuropathic pain should be considered ineffective when titrated to a demonstrated effective dose and duration without significant pain reduction; the typical duration in which efficacy is demonstrated is approximately 12 weeks, with a range from 4 to 16 weeks. An intervention should be considered intolerable when medication causes adverse effects that outweigh any benefit, and overall failure is defined as either ineffective after 12 weeks or intolerable; choosing a different mechanism or class is expected to increase the likelihood of achieving new pain relief, and if only partial efficacy is achieved, adding a second medication of a different class may provide combined efficacy greater than that provided by each medication individually. Clinicians should counsel patients that a series of medications may need to be tried (Level B), should determine failure as approximately 12 weeks without clinically significant pain reduction or when side effects outweigh benefit (Level B), should offer a trial of a medication from a different effective class when there is no meaningful improvement or significant adverse effects with the initial therapeutic class (Level B), and should offer a trial of a medication from a different class for patients with partial improvement with an initial therapeutic class (Level B).

### Mechanisms and management of diabetic painful distal symmetrical polyneuropathy [^e73760b3]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The anticonvulsant gabapentin, which binds to the α2δ subunit of the calcium channel thereby reducing neurotransmitter release in the hyperexcited neuron, gradually titrated from 100 mg t.i.d. to 3,600 mg/day is also effective. More recently, there have been several clinical trials involving pregabalin in painful DSPN, and these showed clear efficacy in management of painful DSPN. Unlike gabapentin, pregabalin has linear pharmacokinetics, doesn't require a long titration period, and is started at 75 mg b.i.d. for about a week and increased to 150 mg b.i.d. maintenance dose with a maximum dose of 600 mg/day. The side effects include dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, headache, and weight gain.

Other effective but generally considered second line drugs for painful DSPN include other anticonvulsants, in particular carbamazepine, although it has troublesome side effects including dizziness, somnolence and gait disturbance; tramadol, a weak opioid and weak inhibitor of noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake; the strong opioid oxycodone controlled release; and topical treatments including the substance-P depleter, topical capsaicin and the lidocaine patch. Refractory cases of patients with painful DSPN may be treated with intravenous lignocaine (5 mg/kg over 30 min). Of the pathogenetically oriented treatments for painful DSPN only the antioxidant, α-lipoic acid administered intravenously over 3 weeks (600 mg i.v. per day) has been proven to be efficacious.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^50ef2044]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Guidelines Subcommittee analytic process — In November 2017, the Guidelines Subcommittee (GS) convened a panel and searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2008 to September 2018; the initial search yielded 1,044 articles, of which 155 were identified as potentially relevant and each of the 155 articles was reviewed by 2 panel members, leading to 95 articles selected for inclusion. The selected articles were required to be randomized controlled trials with more than 20 participants. An updated search in April 2020 identified an additional 20 potentially relevant articles, and 34 articles from the 2011 guideline had been previously rated as Class I or Class II; risk of bias for each of the 149 (95 + 20 + 34) articles was assessed independently by 2 authors using 2017 AAN criteria, with sixteen of the 149 rejected, and only Class I and Class II studies were included.

### A role for peripheral afferents in the pathophysiology and treatment of at-level neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury? A case report [^12da8645]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

At-level neuropathic pain is a frequent symptom following spinal cord injury, but the underlying pathophysiology is not completely understood. We report a patient suffering from treatment-resistant at-level pain characterized by ongoing pain and mechanical allodynia for three years after an incomplete spinal lesion. Quantitative sensory testing revealed severe thermosensory deficits in the neuropathic pain area. However, topical application of capsaicin in the neuropathic pain area induced a burning pain sensation, a marked decrease in heat pain threshold and an increase in mechanical allodynia. Treatment with topical lidocaine patches (5%) led to considerable pain relief. These results indicate a functional connection between peripheral, spinal and supraspinal nociceptive pathways and that peripheral afferents may contribute to at-level neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury in this patient. Lesioned peripheral afferents in combination with central neuronal hyperexcitability are discussed as a likely underlying pain mechanism.

Topical medications

Considering the relatively limited anatomical area causing pain in CPIP, it is reasonable to attempt a trial of topical medications. However, these alternatives may not absorb far enough to treat the underlying condition, and at present, no firm supportive evidence for lidocaine and capsaicin patches exists for CPIP. Lidocaine acts on voltage-gated sodium channels on hyperactive or damaged nociceptors, decreasing afferent nociceptive input, and has been shown effective in PHN and in various types of peripheral neuropathic pain with allodynia. However, in a well-designed small crossover trial (n = 21) of lidocaine patches (5%) in patients with severe CPIP, no reduction of pain ratings compared with placebo were found.

Capsaicin's analgesic effect is exerted through repeated applications causing persistent desensitization. While awaiting results from a Danish ongoing study examining capsaicin patches (8%) in CPIP (NCT01699854), evidence of capsaicin's effect in neuropathic pain has to be derived from other pain conditions. In a Cochrane review from 2013, with results based on PHN and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-neuropathy, NNTs for at least 30% pain intensity reduction week 2–12 were ten and eleven, respectively. Based on the high cost of repeated applications, scarce evidence and likely high NNTs, topical medications may be tried as second-line treatment or when the patient's comorbidities complicate use of the first-line alternatives.

### The clinical approach to small fibre neuropathy and painful channelopathy [^66df0815]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, we have no neuroprotective therapies for SFN. A number of trials have been undertaken to regenerate nerve fibres (particularly in diabetic neuropathy) through the administration of neuroprotective factors, such as nerve growth factor. These trials showed lack of efficacy and in some cases dose-limiting side effects. Therefore, once the underlying aetiology has been successfully managed the treatment of complications takes priority. Pain and autonomic dysfunction are the major problematic complications of SFN. Both are difficult to treat, and current treatments are far from satisfactory.

There are no guidelines specifically for pain associated with SFN. Recently, consensus guidelines for neuropathic pain have been adapted for treatment of pain in SFN. Pragmatic consensus guidelines include those of the UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and the Map of Medicine. This usually involves first-line treatment with gabapentinoids, gabapentin or pregabalin (that bind to α 2 δ 1 and alter trafficking of voltage-gated calcium channels), tricyclic antidepressant (unlicensed indication) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (licensed for painful diabetic neuropathy). Drugs must be introduced in a step-wise manner and titrated for efficacy and side effects. A common problem is insufficient dose titration. There is some evidence for combining drug classes to treat neuropathic pain. There is now increasing use of topical therapies such as 5% lidocaine plasters, which are helpful if the pain is focal (eg, mainly on the soles of the feet). Treatment with high-dose (8%) capsaicin cream causes desensitisation of cutaneous nerve fibres, and although early trials showed some efficacy in painful HIV neuropathythis has not been replicated in all trialsand needs to be given in the setting of a specialist clinic. If pain is severe and first-line treatment unsatisfactory, referral to a multidisciplinary pain clinic is essential to ensure holistic care for the patient. Adjuncts such as psychology assessment and management strategies can be extremely helpful. Our policy is to assess those patients in whom pain is not adequately controlled in a joint clinic with pain physicians with access to psychology support. Treating autonomic dysfunction is difficult, but can respond to specific interventions. It is difficult to be definitive as to duration of follow-up for patients with SFN. There needs to be a thorough investigation for underlying cause and we would normally assess at least up to one year in order to check for progression. Patients need long-term follow-up for pain management, which a pain clinic can provide.
