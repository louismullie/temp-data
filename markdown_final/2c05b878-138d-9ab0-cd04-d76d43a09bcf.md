## Question

What is the optimal dosage ratio of calcium citrate to magnesium for maximizing bone density benefits?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal dosage ratio of calcium citrate to magnesium for maximizing bone density benefits. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any randomized trials or guidelines have directly tested a fixed calcium citrate to magnesium ratio for bone outcomes. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence says about calcium alone and magnesium alone on bone mineral density. Next, I will examine indirect evidence on calcium to magnesium balance and whether a 2:1 ratio is evidence-based. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation and note uncertainties and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the direct evidence base. I need to check if any randomized controlled trials have evaluated a fixed calcium citrate to magnesium ratio for bone mineral density or fracture outcomes. Wait, let me verify the guidelines and meta-analyses: major osteoporosis guidelines and systematic reviews address calcium and vitamin D, and some discuss magnesium status, but none provide a recommended calcium citrate to magnesium ratio for bone health, and no RCTs in the provided corpus test a fixed ratio of calcium citrate to magnesium for BMD or fractures [^72bd8da1] [^04b39b02] [^eb0b0cba].

> Next, I should review what high-quality evidence says about calcium alone. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm magnitude and durability of BMD effects. Large meta-analyses of randomized trials show that increasing calcium intake from diet or supplements produces small, non-progressive increases in BMD of about 0.7–1.8% at 1–2 years, with no further gains thereafter, and these small BMD changes do not translate into clinically meaningful fracture reduction in most settings, which tempers expectations for any fixed-ratio combination strategy [^52efb0ac] [^89d30c70] [^ee1859a7].

> I will now examine magnesium-specific evidence. I should confirm whether magnesium supplementation improves BMD or fracture risk. The Endocrine Society and North American Menopause Society note that routine magnesium supplementation is not recommended for bone health in adults with normal diets, and there are no randomized trials demonstrating BMD or fracture benefits from magnesium supplementation alone, although maintaining normal magnesium status is important for mineral metabolism and may be relevant in deficiency states or specific conditions like malabsorption or diuretic use [^72bd8da1] [^eb0b0cba].

> But wait, what about the concept of a calcium to magnesium "balance" or a 2:1 ratio? I need to check the origin and strength of that claim. The 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio by weight is frequently cited in lay and integrative literature and stems from older hypotheses about mineral competition and cardiovascular risk mitigation, not from bone-specific RCTs; I should double-check that no bone trials validate a 2:1 pill ratio for BMD, and indeed, I do not find such trials in the provided sources, so this remains theoretical rather than evidence-based for bone outcomes [^aaa40b29].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility and safety. Magnesium is involved in vitamin D activation and parathyroid physiology, and very high calcium intakes may impair magnesium absorption when magnesium status is low, which supports the general principle of avoiding gross mineral imbalances; however, this does not establish a clinically validated pill ratio for bone benefit, and excess magnesium can cause GI effects, so I should be cautious not to over-supplement magnesium without indication [^b61b2f99] [^cd2231b1].

> I should confirm practical dosing principles for calcium citrate. For optimal absorption, elemental calcium should be limited to about 500–600 mg per dose, with larger total daily amounts divided, and calcium citrate can be taken with or without food and is preferred in achlorhydria or with PPIs; this frames how any magnesium would be layered alongside calcium, but again, no ratio is specified in guidelines [^c14bb6d5] [^066b661b].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the recommendation is honest about uncertainty. There is no established optimal calcium citrate to magnesium ratio supported by randomized trials or professional guidelines for maximizing bone density, and routine magnesium co-supplementation with calcium is not required for bone health in people with adequate magnesium intake; if a patient is borderline or deficient in magnesium, correcting magnesium to normal is reasonable, and if a ratio is desired for convenience, a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio by weight is a commonly used heuristic from non-bone literature, but it should not be interpreted as evidence-based for BMD benefit [^72bd8da1] [^eb0b0cba] [^aaa40b29].

> Practically, I would prioritize meeting total calcium targets (about 1,000–1,200 mg/day elemental calcium from diet plus supplements as needed), use divided calcium citrate doses of 500–600 mg, ensure vitamin D sufficiency, and assess dietary magnesium intake; if magnesium intake is low or if there are risk factors for hypomagnesemia, I would correct magnesium with a modest supplement and monitor for GI tolerance, recognizing that a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio is a convenient but unproven convention rather than a validated therapeutic ratio for bone outcomes [^c14bb6d5] [^87d41714] [^72bd8da1].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and monitoring. Excess calcium, especially above about 1,200–1,500 mg/day from supplements, may increase nephrolithiasis risk and has been associated with cardiovascular signals in some analyses, so total calcium intake should stay within recommended ranges, and magnesium should be titrated to tolerance given the risk of diarrhea; in patients with CKD or on dialysis, calcium and magnesium handling differ, and guideline-directed mineral management should be followed rather than fixed-ratio supplementation [^04b39b02] [^cd2231b1] [^30c5537b].

---

There is **no established optimal ratio** of calcium citrate to magnesium for maximizing bone density benefits, as high-quality evidence is lacking [^72bd8da1]. Current guidelines emphasize achieving **adequate total calcium intake** (1,000–1,200 mg/day) [^87d41714] and maintaining normal magnesium status (310–420 mg/day) [^cd2231b1] rather than a specific ratio. Magnesium supports calcium metabolism and vitamin D activation, but routine magnesium supplementation is not recommended unless there is a deficiency or specific risk factors [^72bd8da1]. If magnesium is supplemented, a common practice is to use a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio, but this is based on limited evidence and should be individualized to tolerance and clinical context [^aaa40b29].

## Evidence on calcium and magnesium for bone health

### Calcium

- **Calcium is essential** for bone mineralization and maintaining bone density [^de12aec6].
- **Meta-analyses show** that calcium supplementation (with or without vitamin D) produces small, non-progressive increases in bone mineral density (BMD) of about 1–2% over 1–2 years, with no further benefit beyond one year [^52efb0ac] [^89d30c70].
- **Fracture risk reduction** is modest and inconsistent, with some studies showing no significant reduction in fracture risk with calcium alone [^77335092] [^35e2eb63].

---

### Magnesium

- **Magnesium is involved** in calcium metabolism, vitamin D activation, and bone turnover regulation [^b61b2f99].
- **Observational studies** suggest that higher magnesium intake is associated with higher BMD and lower fracture risk, but causality cannot be inferred [^d736af12].
- **Randomized controlled trials** evaluating magnesium supplementation alone on BMD or fracture risk are limited and inconclusive [^72bd8da1].

---

## Calcium citrate vs. other calcium supplements

Calcium citrate has **better absorption** than calcium carbonate, particularly in individuals with low gastric acid or those taking proton pump inhibitors [^c14bb6d5] [^7468e143]. It is also less likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation and bloating [^c7bf0e97]. However, calcium citrate contains less elemental calcium per tablet (about 21%) compared to calcium carbonate (about 40%), necessitating more tablets to achieve the same dose [^c14bb6d5] [^7468e143].

---

## Interaction between calcium and magnesium

Calcium and magnesium share common absorption pathways, and high calcium intake may **compete with magnesium absorption** if magnesium intake is inadequate [^aaa40b29]. Maintaining a balanced intake of both minerals is important for optimal bone health and overall physiological function [^a7a32e57].

---

## Evidence on calcium to magnesium ratio

There is **limited direct evidence** regarding the optimal calcium to magnesium ratio for bone health. Some authors and practitioners advocate a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio based on theoretical considerations and limited observational data, but this ratio is not supported by robust clinical trials [^aaa40b29]. The concept of a fixed ratio oversimplifies the complex interactions between calcium, magnesium, and other nutrients, and individual requirements may vary based on age, sex, diet, and health status [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize achieving **adequate total calcium intake** (1,000–1,200 mg/day) [^87d41714] and maintaining normal magnesium status (310–420 mg/day) [^cd2231b1] rather than adhering to a specific calcium to magnesium ratio. Magnesium supplementation is generally not recommended unless there is a documented deficiency or specific risk factors (e.g. chronic alcohol use, certain medications, gastrointestinal disorders) [^72bd8da1].

---

## Practical considerations and safety

- **Calcium citrate** is well-absorbed and can be taken with or without food, making it a convenient option for many individuals [^c14bb6d5] [^066b661b].
- **Magnesium supplementation** is generally safe at recommended doses, but high doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea) [^cd2231b1].
- **Excessive calcium intake** (particularly from supplements) may increase the risk of kidney stones and cardiovascular events in some individuals, so total calcium intake should be monitored [^04b39b02] [^c32af07e].

## Summary of evidence

| **Nutrient** | **Evidence for bone health** | **Recommended intake** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Calcium | Strong evidence for modest increases in BMD; inconsistent fracture risk reduction | 1,000–1,200 mg/day | Calcium citrate is well-absorbed but contains less elemental calcium per tablet |
| Magnesium | Observational evidence suggests benefits; limited RCT data | 310–420 mg/day | Supplementation not routinely recommended unless deficient |
| Calcium to magnesium ratio | No established optimal ratio; 2:1 ratio is theoretical | Not specified | Individualize based on diet, age, sex, and health status |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no established optimal ratio** of calcium citrate to magnesium for maximizing bone density benefits. Current evidence supports achieving adequate total calcium intake (preferably from diet, with supplementation as needed) and maintaining normal magnesium status. If magnesium supplementation is considered, a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio may be used as a general guideline, but this should be individualized based on dietary intake, clinical context, and tolerance.

Balanced supplemental intakes of calcium and magnesium may be advisable

If high calcium intakes in humans can indeed impair magnesium balance when magnesium intakes are low, the clear implication is that calcium, when supplemented, should be given in conjunction with a balanced dose of magnesium; some authorities recommend a 2:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium (by weight) as most appropriate, both for supplementation and the total daily intake. This seems appropriate considering that good magnesium status also appears to favourably impact bone structure. The concept of 'balancing' calcium and magnesium in supplements has, in fact, been the accepted wisdom in 'health food' circles for decades, owing to Seelig's research and its promulgation by popular health food pundits. However, the calcium supplements featured in pharmacies and supermarkets — where most people shop — typically feature only calcium and vitamin D. Research and promotional efforts sponsored by the dairy industry have insured that calcium is highly valued by the general public, whereas magnesium, no less crucial to health, is essentially an 'orphan nutrient', lacking the advocacy of commercial interests.

It should be noted that calcium/magnesium balance may cut both ways. In China, where the use of dairy products is low, dietary calcium/magnesium ratios tend to be much lower than in the West (1.7 vs 3). A recent analysis of prospective cohort studies in Shanghai has observed that, among people with a calcium/magnesium ratio under 1.7, an increasing intake of magnesium correlates with increased total mortality, whereas in those with a calcium/magnesium ratio above 1.7, increases in intake of magnesium and/or calcium correlated with reduced mortality risk. Hence, a high supplemental intake of magnesium may be inadvisable when calcium intakes are low.

Thus, more clinical studies examining the impact of varying calcium intakes on magnesium balance in subjects with low-normal magnesium intakes are clearly needed, as is a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms, whereby calcium can both positively and negatively influence magnesium absorption and retention. Future epidemiological studies should make an effort to differentiate calcium supplementers into those who either do or do not use supplemental magnesium concurrently, and also take into consideration dietary magnesium intake. In the mean time, people (especially those consuming a relatively refined diet) who wish to supplement with calcium might be well advised to take a supplement that also includes highly bioavailable magnesium, targeting a 2:1 calcium to magnesium ratio in the overall diet.

### Citrate dose for continuous hemofiltration: effect on calcium and magnesium balance, parathormone and vitamin D status, a randomized controlled trial [^415f1fc1]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first randomized controlled study presenting the effects of high vs. low citrate concentrations on calcium balance whilst using an algorithm delivering 100% calcium compensation and evaluates PTH and Vitamin D using this algorithm, though only over the first 24 h of citrate CVVH. Furthermore, it is the first study measuring oxPTH in the setting of citrate CVVH allowing the calculation of noxPTH, which may reflect the hormone status more precisely. There are also limitations to this study. This study was single center and included only a small number of patients. Citrate doses were chosen to maximize the differences in calcium and magnesium loss and possible effects on PTH and vitamin D metabolism, though the dose in the higher group would not normally be applied clinically for longer periods. However, in clinical practice citrate doses may be increased and approach the higher dose regimen in case of higher PfiCa measurements or in case of repeated filter loss due to clotting.

This short-term mechanistic study was not designed to evaluate long-term effects of citrate on bone metabolism, though it should raise awareness for the possible pitfalls in long term use of citrate CVVH, especially in patients displaying hypercalcemia after prolongend immobiization. The study was also not designed to study the effects of citrate dose on filter lifespan, as clinicians were free to return to standard clinical practice for citrate CVVH after the 24 h of the study and differences between groups on citrate dose were therefore lost. Extra calcium, magnesium and phosphate supplementation (apart from the post-filter substitution fluid) was left to the discretion of the treating ICU physician, although the calcium target was protocolized. Ionized magnesium was not measured as part of the study. Effects of fecal loss, urinary loss or enteral feeding on calcium and magnesium balance were not taken into account. Post-filter iCa was measured using the ABL800 Flex blood gas analyzer (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). This habit is common, though the reliability of measuring iCa in this low range has been challenged.

Magnesium supplementation and monitoring — No randomized controlled study has evaluated the effect of magnesium intake on fracture risk or BMD, most people have adequate dietary intake, and individuals who are at risk for hypomagnesemia (e.g., those with GI malabsorption, chronic liver disease [including alcoholics], or renal tubular disorders; those who are taking diuretics, aminoglycoside antibiotics, calcineurin inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors, or other medications; and older adults) may benefit from evaluation of serum magnesium levels.

Calcium supplement formulations and dosing — Calcium carbonate has a generous calcium content (40%), may cause gastrointestinal complaints, requires gastric acid for absorption, and is best absorbed when taken with meals, whereas calcium citrate has a lower calcium content (21%), absorption is not dependent on gastric acid, and it may be less likely to cause GI complaints; in addition to tablets, chewable supplements as well as gummy preparations are available. For optimal absorption, calcium supplementation should not exceed 500 to 600 mg per dose, irrespective of the preparation, and for patients requiring more than 600 mg of calcium supplement daily, the dose should be divided.

Calcium supplementation and bone health

A recent large meta-analysis of 26 randomised controlled trials reported that calcium supplements lowered the risk of any fracture by a modest but statistically significant 11% (n = 58 573; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). Even so, the authors concluded that the evidence for calcium supplements on bone health was weak and inconsistent.

Other large meta-analyses found that calcium supplementation was most effective for preventing hip fractures when it was combined with Vit D. Indeed Vit D plays a major role in intestinal calcium absorption and bone health (figure 2). Additionally, calcium absorption is, in part, dependent on adequate stomach acid, and both these parameters tend to decrease with age. Drugs that markedly reduce stomach acid, such as proton pump inhibitors, have been shown to reduce calcium absorption and increase risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

Figure 2
Total hipbone mineral density by quartiles of calcium intake, stratified by 25(OH) vitamin D. Vitamin D status strongly modifies the bone building effects of oral calcium intake.

A large meta-analysis focusing on calcium intake and fracture risk found that in women (seven prospective cohort studies = 170 991 women, 2954 hip fractures), there was no association between total calcium intake and hip fracture risk (pooled RR per 300 mg total = 1.01; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05). In men (five prospective cohort studies = 68 606 men, 214 hip fractures), the pooled RR per 300 mg of calcium daily was 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.03).

Monosupplementation with calcium, especially using the most commonly prescribed formulations (calcium carbonate and calcium citrate) might drive down the absorption of phosphate, thereby contributing to bone demineralisation secondary to abnormal calcium to phosphate ratios. The recently updated US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has stated that there is insufficient evidence that calcium and Vit D prevent fractures in premenopausal women or in men who have not experienced a prior fracture. Indeed, the USPSTF now recommends against daily calcium supplementation for primary prevention of fragility fractures; stating, 'the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined'.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: micronutrient supplementation [^066b661b]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Calcium supplements — Calcium carbonate has the highest concentration of calcium among calcium salts but requires an acidic medium for optimal absorption, so it is recommended that it be consumed with meals; calcium citrate can be taken with or without foods and can be used by those with achlorydria, and maximum absorption is obtained with doses ≤ 500 mg, so splitting a 1,000-mg dose in two is advisable.

Current recommendations for calcium intake call for 1,000 mg per day for women ages 19–50 and 1,200 mg per day for women over age 50 to ensure bone health. Given recent concerns that calcium supplements may raise risk for cardiovascular disease and kidney stones, women should aim to meet this recommendation primarily by eating a calcium-rich diet and taking calcium supplements only if needed to reach the RDA goal (often only approximately 500 mg per day in supplements is required).

### Comparison of common calcium supplements… [^7468e143]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

A high dietary calcium intake combined with vitamin D can increase bone density and reduce fractures in older women and, probably, men. The Institute of Medicine recommends that persons 19 to 50 years of age consume 1, 000 mg per day of calcium and that persons older than 50 years consume 1, 200 mg per day. The average American consumes less than 800 mg of calcium per day. Calcium supplements are derivatives of natural products, such as oyster shell or bone. Some are marketed primarily as antacids. Calcium carbonate and phosphate preparations have the highest concentration of elemental calcium, about 40 percent. Calcium citrate contains 21 percent elemental calcium, and calcium lactate and gluconate contain 13 and 9 percent, respectively. A recent meta-analysis found that absorption of calcium citrate was 27 percent higher than that of calcium carbonate when taken on an empty stomach and 22 percent higher when taken with meals.

It did not make a difference which preparation of calcium was taken or in which dosage. Taking calcium with food in dosages of 500 mg or less increases absorption. Calcium preparations must be dissolved before they can be absorbed; the absorption rate for calcium is about 20 to 30 percent. The absorption of calcium supplements differs by preparation. Foods such as spinach, rhubarb and wheat bran can decrease calcium absorption. Calcium can interfere with absorption of iron, zinc, bisphosphonates and tetracycline. Absorption also requires adequate doses of vitamin D. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 200 IU for adults younger than 50 years and 600 IU for those older than 70 years. Vitamin D supplementation is especially important in elderly persons because skin synthesis and absorption of vitamin D may be impaired.

In postmenopausal women with low dietary calcium intake, specially prepared 500-mg tablets of calcium citrate malate were more effective in preventing bone loss than 500-mg tablets of calcium carbonate, although the difference was not significant. In another study, 500 mg of calcium citrate taken with breakfast produced serum calcium levels significantly higher than those demonstrated after 500 mg of calcium carbonate. Medical Letter consultants reiterate the need for adequate calcium supplementation in all persons, regardless of age or sex. Calcium carbonate may cause more adverse events. Calcium citrate may be better absorbed than the other calcium salts. The consultants conclude that any calcium supplement taken in dosages of 500 mg or less with meals may improve absorption.

Vitamins, caffeine, protein, and magnesium — excessive chronic intake of vitamin A (i.e., more than 10,000 IU daily) should be avoided due to detrimental effects on bone; vitamin K (1 mg/day) may reduce bone turnover and bone loss in postmenopausal women, although further studies are needed before vitamin K can be considered a part of standard prevention. "Natural" estrogen-receptor agonists, isoflavones, are promoted to prevent bone loss, but there are no conclusive data to support their use for increasing bone density or decreasing fracture risk. Patients should be advised to limit caffeine intake to less than 1 to 2 servings (8 to 12 ounces/serving) of caffeinated drinks per day. Adequate protein intake (U.S. recommended dietary allowance, 0.8 g/kg) helps minimize bone loss among patients who have suffered hip fractures; in one study, supplemental protein after hip fracture shortened hospital stay and improved functional recovery. Regarding magnesium, one study showed that adding 789 to 826 mg of magnesium per day did not increase rates of calcium absorption.

### Randomized controlled trial of calcium in healthy older women [^35e2eb63]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Calcium has been shown to have positive effects on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. However, these effects are small, it is unknown whether they are sustained with long-term use, they have not been shown with intention-to-treat analyses, and the evidence for fracture prevention with calcium monotherapy is inconsistent.

Methods

A randomized controlled trial of calcium (1 g/day as the citrate) in 1471 healthy postmenopausal women (aged 74 ± 4 years) was performed to assess the effects on bone density and fracture incidence over 5 years.

Results

Follow-up was complete in 90% of subjects, and average medication compliance was 55% to 58%. Calcium had a significant beneficial effect on bone density (intention-to-treat analysis), with between-groups differences at 5 years of 1.8% (spine), 1.6% (total hip), and 1.2% (total body). Effects were greater in a per-protocol analysis (5-year differences of 2.3%, 2.8%, and 1.8%, respectively). A total of 425 fractures occurred in 281 women. Hazard ratios, based on time to first fracture, were 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71–1.16) for any symptomatic fracture, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.44–1.18) for vertebral, 3.55 (95% CI, 1.31–9.63) for hip, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.41–1.04) for forearm fracture. Per-protocol analysis found respective hazard ratios of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.64–1.17), 0.62 (95% CI, 0.33–1.16), 3.24 (95% CI, 0.65–16.1), and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.24–0.87). Height loss was reduced by calcium in the per-protocol population (P = 0.03). Serum alkaline phosphatase and procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide were lower in the calcium group at 5 years, but constipation was more common.

Conclusions

Calcium results in a sustained reduction in bone loss and turnover, but its effect on fracture remains uncertain. Poor long-term compliance limits its effectiveness.

### Impact of calcium and two doses of vitamin D on bone metabolism in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial [^1460bbbb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

The optimal dose of vitamin D to optimize bone metabolism in the elderly is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that vitamin D, at a dose higher than recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), has a beneficial effect on bone remodeling and mass. In this double-blind trial we randomized 257 overweight elderly subjects to receive 1000mg of elemental calcium citrate/day, and the daily equivalent of 3750 IU/day or 600 IU/day of vitamin D3 for 1 year. The subjects' mean age was 71 ± 4 years, body mass index 30 ± 4kg/m 2, 55% were women, and 222 completed the 12-month follow-up. Mean serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was 20ng/mL, and rose to 26ng/mL in the low-dose arm, and 36ng/mL in the high-dose arm, at 1 year (p < 0.05). Plasma parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, and C-terminal telopeptide (Cross Laps) levels decreased significantly by 20% to 22% in both arms, but there were no differences between the two groups for any variable, at 6 or 12 months, with the exception of serum calcitriol, which was higher in the high-dose group at 12 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) increased significantly at the total hip and lumbar spine, but not the femoral neck, in both study arms, whereas subtotal body BMD increased in the high-dose group only, at 1 year. However, there were no significant differences in percent change BMD between the two study arms at any skeletal site. Subjects with serum 25OHD < 20ng/mL and PTH level > 76pg/mL showed a trend for higher BMD increments at all skeletal sites, in the high-dose group, that reached significance at the hip. Adverse events were comparable in the two study arms. This controlled trial shows little additional benefit in vitamin D supplementation at a dose exceeding the IOM recommendation of 600 IU/day on BMD and bone markers, in overweight elderly individuals. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^fe5c6736]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

REGIOCIT is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in circulatory shock with muscle hypoperfusion (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Excessive infusion of citrate can lead to acute hypocalcemia and metabolic alkalosis, with neurologic and cardiac complications. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the citrate infusion and infusion of calcium.

Endocrine and Metabolism

Hypocalcemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia, due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Administration).

Electrolyte and Acid–Base Balance

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which can influence the patient's electrolyte and acid–base balance. Plasma electrolyte and acid–base parameters should be closely monitored during CRRT. Closely monitor sodium, magnesium, potassium, phosphate, and calcium. Infusion of electrolytes may be needed to supplement any loss.

Hypercalcemia

Medicinal products containing calcium used for maintenance of calcium homeostasis in CRRT patients can increase the risk of hypercalcemia, and can result in a reduced anticoagulation effect. Care should be taken to avoid excessive titration in administering calcium as this can lead to hypercalcemia. Frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid-base imbalance.

Mineral supplements made from bone meal, when taken with food, theoretically might provide a more practical means to ensure adequate calcium intake without predisposing to CVD risk. Ingestion of microcrystalline hydroxyapatite (the form of calcium found in bone) produces less of an acute spike in blood calcium levels compared to soluble calcium salts typically used in standard supplements, and thus may be less likely to increase vascular calcification and coronary risk. Hydroxyapatite also stimulates bone osteoblast cells and contains virtually all the essential building blocks needed to construct bone tissue. In a small placebo-controlled randomised trial, women who took 1000 mg of calcium in the form of hydroxyapatite in conjunction with oral Vit D showed a significant increase in bone thickness, whereas those who took 1000 mg of a standard calcium carbonate supplement did not (figure 4). Another double-blind placebo-controlled study found that supplementing with hydroxyapatite and Vit D3 significantly improved serological markers of bone health.

Figure 4
Change in cortical bone thickness among 64 women with osteopenia randomised to 14-month treatment with no mineral therapy (red bar), calcium gluconate (blue bar), or calcium hydroxyapatite (green bar). The control group showed bone loss (p < 0.01 compared to baseline), while the hydroxyapatite group showed bone gain (p < 0.01 compared to baseline). The calcium gluconate showed no significant change.

In theory, the addition of Vit K2 and magnesium to an organic bone meal supplement might further enhance its effectiveness and reduce the risk of soft tissue calcification. However, the quantity and quality of the experimental data testing the effects of Vit D and calcium on bone health dwarfs the data for bone meal supplementation. Much larger randomised trials will be needed to firmly establish the safety and effectiveness of bone meal as well as Vit K and magnesium as supplements for building bone without increasing vascular calcification.

Dietary protein, calcium and bone health

Evolutionary evidence suggests that preagricultural diets were net base-yielding, and contributed to the robust bone health generally seen among hunter-gatherers. By contrast, processed foods displace base-yielding fruits and vegetables, thereby shifting to a net acid-yielding diet.

Increased protein intake can raise levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is anabolic, and contributes to bone building. Experts currently agree that diets moderate in protein (≈1.0–1.5 g/kg/day) are associated with normal calcium metabolism, and do not adversely alter bone metabolism; however, at lower protein intakes (< 0.8 g/kg/day), intestinal calcium absorption is reduced and levels of parathyroid hormone rise, causing the mobilisation of calcium from bone.

A growing body of evidence indicates that diets higher in animal protein associate with greater bone mass and fewer fractures, particularly if the calcium intake is also sufficient (approximately 1000 mg of calcium/day) (figure 1). Thus, a diet providing ample dietary calcium, along with alkalising nutrients, such as fruits and vegetables, and possibly also alkaline mineral waters, may create a milieu where moderate intake of animal protein contributes favourably to bone health. Additionally, intake of protein plus calcium with Vit D may reduce fracture rates through mechanisms independent of bone density.

Figure 1
A diet that contains moderate amounts of fresh, lean, animal protein, when combined with adequate calcium intake, promotes bone strength and reduces fracture risk. In contrast, high protein diet with inadequate calcium intake increases risk of fracture.

Magnesium

Maintaining replete magnesium status may reduce risk for the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension and MI. Circumstantial and experimental evidence has also implicated magnesium deficiency in osteoporosis. Optimal dietary magnesium intake is about 7–10 mg/kg/day, preferably in the context of a net base-yielding diet, since a net acid-yielding diet increases excretion of both magnesium and calcium (table 2).

### Calcium supplementation on bone loss in postmenopausal women [^77335092]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although calcium is one the simplest and least expensive strategies for preventing osteoporotic fractures calcium supplementation is nevertheless not without controversy (Kanis 1989; Nordin 1990). The Food and Drug Administration in the US has permitted a bone health claim for calcium-rich foods, and the NIH in its Consensus Development Process approved a statement that high calcium intake reduces the risk of osteoporosis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of calcium on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane Controlled Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 2001, and examined citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings.

Selection Criteria

Trials that randomized postmenopausal women to calcium supplementation or usual calcium intake in the diet and reported bone mineral density of the total body, vertebral spine, hip, or forearm or recorded the number of fractures, and followed patients for at least one year were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent reviewers assessed the methodologic quality and extracted data for each trial. For each bone density site (lumbar spine, total body, combined hip and combined forearm), we calculated the weighted mean difference in bone density between treatment and control groups using the percentage change from baseline. We constructed regression models in which the independent variables were year and dose, and the dependent variable was the effect size. This regression was used to determine the years across which pooling was appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed. For each fracture analysis we calculated a risk ratio.

Main Results

Fifteen trials, representing 1806 participants, were included. Calcium was more effective than placebo in reducing rates of bone loss after two or more years of treatment. The pooled difference in percentage change from baseline was 2.05% (95% CI 0.24 to 3.86) for total body bone density, 1.66% (95% CI 0.92 to 2.39) for the lumbar spine at 2 years, 1.60% (95% CI 0.78 to 2.41) for the hip, and 1.91% (95% CI 0.33 to 3.50) for the distal radius. The relative risk of fractures of the vertebrae was 0.79 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.09); the relative risk for non-vertebral fractures was 0.86 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.72).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Calcium supplementation alone has a small positive effect on bone density. The data show a trend toward reduction in vertebral fractures, but it is unclear if calcium reduces the incidence of non vertebral fractures.

Biochemical analysis

Fasting blood sampling was obtained in the morning (from 8:00 to 8:30 a.m.) before calcium supplementation. All biochemical parameters (serum total calcium, phosphorus, albumin, ionized serum calcium, 25‐hydroxy vitamin D, creatinine, intact PTH, urinary pH) were centrally measured. Serum total calcium (normal, 8.4 to 10.2 mg/dL) and albumin were measured using automated methods. Calcium values were corrected for albumin concentration by the following formula: Alb‐Ca = (0.8 [4.0 – patient's albumin] + serum calcium). Ionized serum calcium (normal, 1.12 to 1.32 mmol/L), serum phosphorus, and creatinine were also measured by automated techniques. 25‐hydroxy vitamin D was measured by an immunochemiluminometric assay (Abbott Laboratories Diagnostics Division, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Intact PTH (normal, 14 to 72 pg/mL) was measured by an immunochemiluminometric assay (second‐generation kit) using the automatic analyzer Modular E170 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Estimated GFR was calculated using the modification of diet in renal disease equation. Twenty‐four‐hour urine collections were obtained at baseline and at 2‐week intervals during the 2 months of the study. We calculated the renal clearance of creatinine from 24‐hour urinary creatinine and plasma creatinine. We defined hypercalciuria as urinary calcium excretion > 4 mg/kg/d. To inhibit the growth of microorganisms in the specimen, boric acid was used as preservative before collection. However, because of the use of acid as preservative, we collected an additional independent urine sample, in the morning, in fasting state, to measure pH. At each visit, we measured volume, sodium, calcium, magnesium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, potassium, creatinine, urea, chloride, phosphate, cystine, sulphate, and ammonium levels of the 24‐hour urine specimen. Relative supersaturation ratios for calcium oxalate, brushite, uric acid, ß struvite, and cystine acid were calculated with the software LITHORISK. The ion activity product of calcium oxalate (AP[CaOx] index) is calculated by means of the following formula:

The net gastrointestinal alkali absorption was measured by means of Oh's formula.

### A comparison of calcium acetate / magnesium carbonate and sevelamer-hydrochloride effects on fibroblast growth factor-23 and bone markers: post hoc evaluation from a controlled, randomized study [^bb0bd4c1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

There is a concern that increased serum Mg levels may potentially have a harmful effect on bone, such as mineralization defects and adynamic bone disease, in dialysis patients. In contrast, Mg levels in the upper normal range in the general population and mildly elevated levels in patients with CKD 5 have in fact been associated with benefits, including reduced cardiovascular calcification, reduced hypertension and reduced mortality.

In our study, we did not perform bone biopsies, which is a major limitation, and therefore we cannot exclude the possibility of development of adynamic bone disease. However, the observed lack of decrease in bone formation markers such as BAP, known for its high specificity and sensitivity in identifying bone remodelling when compared with bone biopsies, supports the absence of adynamic bone disease. In addition, a large bone biopsy study in 100 patients did not find Mg bone content to be correlated with osteomalacia or any other type of bone disease, even though the Mg/Ca ratio was elevated in dialysis patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, in 35 patients in the same study who were diagnosed with adynamic bone disease, the Mg content of bone biopsies did not differ significantly from other types of renal osteodystrophy.

In summary, in contrast to the sevelamer group, bone marker changes over time indicate that CaMg helps maintain bone health, causing neither an overstimulation nor a suppression of bone turnover.

### USPSTF evidence report: vitamin D and calcium for primary prevention of fractures… [^82ee570f]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

At the same time, it is important to understand potential harms of supplementation with these agents. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against daily supplementation of 400 IU or less of vitamin D3 and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized postmenopausal women. 3 The USPSTF also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation in premenopausal women and in men and at doses greater than 400 IU with or without calcium for noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women. The vitamin D3 doses used included 300 IU, 400 IU, or 700 IU daily or 100 000 IU every month or every 4 months. The calcium doses used included daily doses of 1000 mg, 1200 mg, or 1600 mg alone, or 500 mg or 1000 mg daily in combination with vitamin D.

For vitamin D combined with calcium compared with placebo, the WHI CaD trial reported 2102 fractures in the vitamin D with calcium group and 2158 in the placebo group in the vitamin D with calcium group and 9 deaths in the placebo group over 4 years.

Fluid and electrolytes

There are major gaps in knowledge regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying fluid balance and distribution in critically ill children, particularly preterm and extremely low birth weight (ELBW, < 1000 g) and very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1500 g) infants(Table 2). The movement of water between physical compartments in the immediate postnatal period, is also not fully understood.

The impact of fluid therapy during the transition phase in the first few days of life is not well described, and an understanding of the fluid shifts during this period is vital to define the "optimal weight loss" and consequent fluid and electrolyte intake strategy, particularly in small for gestational age and ELBW infants. Further work determining the optimal electrolyte to macronutrient ratios in PN for sodium, potassium, phosphorous, and other electrolytes is also a priority. Clinical trials to establish optimal fluid and electrolyte intake during mixed (parenteral and enteral) nutrition are also warranted, and there is interest in studying the consequences on the ratio of intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid (ECF), and its composition under the current PN recommendations.

For children and infants beyond the neonatal period, the most significant change relates to the use of isotonic fluid as an intravenous fluid for "maintenance hydration" in sick children –, especially during the first 24 h. Fluid distribution is different depending on the osmolarity of the solution being used, with hypotonic solutions distributed in the intracellular compartment and isotonic maintenance solutions mainly remaining in the extracellular compartment. The latter may imply a lower fluid requirement than the volumes estimated by the traditionally used Holliday-Segar formula. An understanding of this relationship between fluid distribution and fluid requirements is currently lacking.

Calcium, phosphate, and magnesium

There is currently no practical way of monitoring bone mineral (microcrystalline apatite) accretion at the bedside, and no good surrogate marker for monitoring bone mineral accretion. Therefore, it is not currently clear what amounts and ratios of calcium, phosphate and magnesium should be provided to ensure optimal growth and bone mineralization in children, particularly in the context of preterm infants and critically ill children. The optimal phosphate intakes for both stability, and growth and bone mineralization in the context of refeeding syndrome and critical illness should also be more clearly defined by research evidence, as should the optimal plasma phosphate concentration (Table 2).

### Potassium citrate supplementation results in sustained improvement in calcium balance in older men and women [^e4ff236a]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

The dietary acid load created by the typical Western diet may adversely impact the skeleton by disrupting calcium metabolism. Whether neutralizing dietary acid with alkaline potassium salts results in sustained improvements in calcium balance remains controversial. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 52 men and women (mean age 65.2 ± 6.2 years) were randomly assigned to potassium citrate 60mmol/d, 90mmol/d, or placebo daily with measurements of bone turnover markers, net acid excretion, and calcium metabolism, including intestinal fractional calcium absorption and calcium balance, obtained at baseline and at 6 months. At 6 months, net acid excretion was significantly lower in both treatment groups compared to placebo and it was negative, meaning subjects' dietary acid was completely neutralized (-11.3mmol/d on 60mmol/d; -29.5mmol/d on 90mmol/d, p < 0.001 compared to placebo). At 6 months, 24-hour urine calcium was significantly reduced in persons taking potassium citrate 60mmol/d (-46 ± 15.9mg/d) and 90mmol/d (-59 ± 31.6mg/d) compared with placebo (p < 0.01). Fractional calcium absorption was not changed by potassium citrate supplementation. Net calcium balance was significantly improved in participants taking potassium citrate 90mmol/d compared to placebo (142 ± 80mg/d on 90mmol/d versus -80 ± 54mg/d on placebo; p = 0.02). Calcium balance was also improved on potassium citrate 60mmol/d, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.18). Serum C-telopeptide decreased significantly in both potassium citrate groups compared to placebo (-34.6 ± 39.1ng/L on 90mmol/d, p = 0.05; -71.6 ± 40.7ng/L on 60mmol/d, p = 0.02) whereas bone-specific alkaline phosphatase did not change. Intact parathyroid hormone was significantly decreased in the 90mmol/d group (p = 0.01). Readily available, safe, and easily administered in an oral form, potassium citrate has the potential to improve skeletal health. Longer-term trials with definitive outcomes such as bone density and fracture are needed.

### Randomized controlled trial of calcium supplementation in healthy, nonosteoporotic, older men… [^514e8855]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

The BMD increased at all sites in the group receiving calcium, 1200 mg/d, by 1% to 1. 5% more than those receiving placebo. The results for the group receiving calcium, 600 mg/d, were not different from the placebo group at any BMD site. There was no interaction between the BMD treatment effect and either age or dietary calcium intake. Tooth loss, constipation, and cramps were unaffected by calcium supplementation, falls tended to be less frequent in the group receiving calcium, 1200 mg/d, but vascular events tended to be more common in the groups receiving calcium vs the group receiving placebo. Conclusion Calcium, 1200 mg/d, has effects on BMD in men comparable with those found in postmenopausal women but a dosage of 600 mg/d is ineffective for treating BMD. The present data establish that 1. 2 g of calcium given in a divided dose produces a substantial benefit to BMD throughout the skeleton in vitamin D–sufficient men.

This benefit occurs independent of age and dietary calcium intake. The increases in BMD are more rapid in the spine than in the total hip, possibly because the higher trabecular bone content of the spine results in a more obvious remodeling transient. These similarities in BMD changes suggest that calcium supplementation is likely to be of value in the treatment of osteoporosis in men, although undertaking a study such as the one described herein in men at high risk of fractures would not be ethically justifiable. Whatever the explanation, the clear implication from the present study is that a daily calcium dosage in the region of 1 g is necessary to achieve a BMD benefit in men, and it seems preferable to give this as at least 2 doses. The clear dissociation of bone turnover and BMD changes mandates caution in the use of markers as surrogates in evaluating calcium supplements.

In conclusion, the present study provides clear evidence that calcium supplements have a beneficial effect on BMD in men. The study size, high subject retention, and consistency across BMD measurement sites mean that the current findings are most unlikely to be subject to bias or significant experimental error. A daily dosage of 1. 2 g of elemental calcium is required to achieve this effect. These findings provide a rationale for conducting randomized studies of the effect of calcium supplementation on fracture incidence in men. Such studies should also assess the incidence of cardiovascular events so that the balance of risk and benefit can be clearly determined.

### Osteoporosis: the role of micronutrients [^da9f12fa]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis and low bone mass are currently estimated to be a major public health threat. Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D. Calcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone mass at all ages, although the results are not always consistent. Higher doses than the current US recommendation (600 IU) of vitamin D in the elderly (age ≥ 65 y) may actually be required for optimal bone health (800–1000 IU/d). The elderly can clearly benefit from increased vitamin D intakes; however, the potential importance of vitamin D in peak bone mass is just being investigated. Vitamin D has been related to falls, with supplementation reducing the number of falls. There are clear fracture benefits demonstrated in randomized clinical trials of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The other micronutrient needs for optimizing bone health can be easily met by a healthy diet that is high in fruits and vegetables to ensure adequate intakes for magnesium, potassium, vitamin C, vitamin K, and other potentially important nutrients. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes (easily monitored by serum 25(OH)D) for optimal bone health, as well as the prevention of falls and fractures. In addition, a healthy diet that includes 5 servings a day of fruits and vegetables should optimize the intake of micronutrients required for bone health.

### Enhancement of bone formation with a synthetic matrix containing bone morphogenetic protein-2 by the addition of calcium citrate [^caf5ceea]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to test whether calcium citrate combined with rhBMP-2 was able to enhance bone regeneration compared with a matrix containing only rhBMP-2.

Methods

In each of experimental mice, one cylinder of calcium citrate-rhBMP-2 or rhBMP-2 alone was implanted into the thigh muscle pouches of the mouse. The following two treatment modalities were randomly allocated: (1) empty control with rhBMP-2 alone in a gelatin matrix and (2) a gelatin matrix including both calcium citrate and BMP-2. After several weeks, bone granules were obtained by histological analysis.

Results

Histomorphometric analysis showed the greatest amount of newly formed bone was observed in the group that contained 10.0 mg calcium citrate with 2.0 mg rhBMP-2 (p < 0.05). Quantitative histomorphometry revealed in the calcium citrate-rhBMP-2 group an obvious increase in the fractional area and the average new bone mineral density of newly formed bone at 2, 4 and 6 weeks than in the rhBMP-2 group (p < 0.05). At 2 weeks time-point, the mature cancellous bone had formed in the calcium citrate-rhBMP-2 group.

Conclusions

From this study, it can be concluded that calcium citrate combined with rhBMP-2 significantly enhances bone regeneration in muscle. This synthetic gelatin matrix containing calcium citrate/gelatin granules fulfils a number of criteria required for an ideal carrier system for rhBMP-2. The calcium ions that calcium citrate releases into the surrounding environment can activate bone formation when used as part of a combination of calcium citrate and BMP-2.

### Decreased magnesium status may mediate the increased cardiovascular risk associated with calcium supplementation [^e06d32f9]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Can supplemental calcium increase cardiovascular risk?

A meta-analyses of randomised controlled studies of calcium supplementation (some including concurrent modest intakes of vitamin D) has observed a modest increase in risk for vascular events in the calcium-supplemented subjects. Some recent observational epidemiology in prospective cohorts has also linked supplemental calcium to increased vascular risk. Yet, rather perplexingly, relatively high dietary intakes of calcium have been associated with cardiovascular protection, or a neutral outcome in this regard. Moreover, there are theoretical grounds for expecting that superior calcium nutrition could be protective for vascular health. High-calcium diets decrease secretion of parathyroid hormone; even mild secondary hyperparathyroidism, common in the elderly, is suspected to increase vascular risk. A high calcium intake also tends to suppress absorption of dietary phosphate by forming an insoluble complex with it; emerging data suggest that high phosphate intakes may increase cardiovascular risk, even in those with normal renal function. High calcium intakes have not been found to correlate with increased risk for vascular calcification. The acute vascular impact of the modest rise in serum calcium following a bolus oral dose of calcium citrate has been studied; relative to placebo, arterial stiffness declined and myocardial perfusion increased in the calcium group. However, the diurnal decline in blood pressure was not as high in calcium-supplemented subjects and a coagulation index (thromboelastography) increased.

What could explain the increased risk for vascular events associated specifically with calcium supplementation in some controlled studies? Even if subsequent analyses fail to confirm a net negative impact of calcium supplementation on vascular health — this issue is hotly debated and cannot be considered resolvedthe fact that calcium could be expected to protect the vasculature for certain reasons suggests that it must be exerting some countervailing negative effect even if its impact on vascular health is neutral.

The acute impact of bolus calcium on coagulation mechanisms, as noted above, merits further study. Also, a high calcium intake might increase secretion of renin — which increases cardiovascular riskvia the prohypertensive, pro-oxidative effects of angiotensin II — by suppressing renal synthesis of calcitriol. Only a few pertinent clinical studies are currently available in this regard, however, and this prediction requires more verification in clinical studies using realistic supplemental intakes of calcium. Moreover, this explanation leaves unexplained the seeming discrepancy between the apparent cardioprotection of dietary calcium versus the potential cardiotoxicity of supplemental calcium.

### Calcium supplements: benefits and risks [^c32af07e]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium is an essential element in the diet, but there is continuing controversy regarding its optimal intake, and its role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Most studies show little evidence of a relationship between calcium intake and bone density, or the rate of bone loss. Re-analysis of data from the placebo group from the Auckland Calcium Study demonstrates no relationship between dietary calcium intake and rate of bone loss over 5 years in healthy older women with intakes varying from < 400 to > 1500 mg day(-1). Thus, supplements are not needed within this range of intakes to compensate for a demonstrable dietary deficiency, but might be acting as weak anti-resorptive agents via effects on parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. Consistent with this, supplements do acutely reduce bone resorption and produce small short-term effects on bone density, without evidence of a cumulative density benefit. As a result, anti-fracture efficacy remains unproven, with no evidence to support hip fracture prevention (other than in a cohort with severe vitamin D deficiency) and total fracture numbers are reduced by 0–10%, depending on which meta-analysis is considered. Five recent large studies have failed to demonstrate fracture prevention in their primary analyses. This must be balanced against an increase in gastrointestinal side effects (including a doubling of hospital admissions for these problems), a 17% increase in renal calculi and a 20–40% increase in risk of myocardial infarction. Each of these adverse events alone neutralizes any possible benefit in fracture prevention. Thus, calcium supplements appear to have a negative risk-benefit effect, and so should not be used routinely in the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^48643b29]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Short bowel syndrome — selected complications and management considerations are summarized in Table 2. For central venous catheter complications (infection, occlusion, thrombosis, breakage), management includes aseptic technique during placement and dressing changes, appropriate catheter and insertion site, proper catheter care and monitoring for infection, and catheter removal when no longer needed. For hepatobiliary complications (steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, cholelithiasis), approaches include avoid excesses and deficiencies in PN formula, limit intravenous lipid dose to < 1 g/kg/d, reduce/eliminate soybean-based intravenous lipid emulsion, use non–soybean-based intravenous lipid emulsions, cycle PN, increase oral/enteral intake, identify/treat sepsis or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and prophylactic cholecystectomy when abdominal surgery is being undertaken for other reasons. For metabolic bone disease, management includes periodic assessment of bone mineral density, monitoring calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D status with supplementation as needed, correcting metabolic acidosis when present, and specific osteoporosis treatments. Kidney injury measures include monitoring urine output periodically and maintaining adequate urine output with increased fluid intake, a low-fat, low-oxalate diet, potassium citrate supplementation, and calcium carbonate supplementation. Chronic diarrhea options include diet/oral fluid modifications, oral rehydration solution, antidiarrheal agents, antisecretory agents (proton pump inhibitor [PPI], histamine-2 receptor antagonist [H2RA]), somatostatin analogs, and intestinotrophic factor. For protein energy malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte and/or micronutrient deficiencies, management includes monitoring vitamin, mineral and electrolyte levels with supplementation as needed, optimizing oral diet and fluid intake, parenteral support (hydration, nutrition), and intestinotrophic factor.

### Effect of potassium citrate on bone density, microarchitecture, and fracture risk in healthy older adults without osteoporosis: a randomized controlled trial [^fc3c6cfe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

The acid load imposed by a modern diet may play an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis.

Objective

Our objective was to evaluate the skeletal efficacy and safety and the effect on fracture prediction of K-citrate to neutralize diet-induced acid loads.

Design and Setting

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at a teaching hospital.

Subjects

Subjects included 201 elderly (> 65 yr old) healthy men and women (t-score of -0.6 at lumbar spine).

Intervention

Intervention was 60 mEq of K-citrate daily or placebo by mouth. All subjects received calcium and vitamin D.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was change in areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the lumbar spine by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry after 24 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in volumetric density and microarchitectural parameters by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography in both radii and both tibiae and fracture risk assessment by FRAX (Switzerland).

Results

K-citrate increased aBMD at lumbar spine from baseline by 1.7 ± 1.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0–2.3, P < 0.001] net of placebo after 24 months. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography-measured trabecular densities increased at nondominant tibia (1.3 ± 1.3%, CI = 0.7–1.9, P < 0.001) and nondominant radius (2.0 ± 2.0%, CI = 1.4–2.7, P < 0.001). At nondominant radius, trabecular bone volume/tissue volume increased by 0.9 ± 0.8%, (CI = 0.1–1.7), trabecular thickness by 1.5 ± 1.6% (CI = 0.7–2.3), and trabecular number by 1.9 ± 1.8% (CI = 0.7–3.1, for all, P < 0.05). K-citrate diminished fracture prediction score by FRAX significantly in both sexes.

Conclusions

Among a group of healthy elderly persons without osteoporosis, treatment with K-citrate for 24 months resulted in a significant increase in aBMD and volumetric BMD at several sites tested, while also improving bone microarchitecture. Based on the effect on fracture prediction, an effect on future fractures by K-citrate is possible.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^8d89df9c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For Extracorporeal use only. Not for direct intravenous infusion. REGIOCIT solution is used as a renal replacement solution. The product has an

osmolarity of 244 mOsm/L and a pH of approximately 7.4.

Dosing Considerations

Dosing considerations of the drug:

REGIOCIT solution should not be used for direct intravenous infusion. The product must be used in pre-dilution mode only, with appropriate extracorporeal renal replacement equipment intended for CRRT, using an integrated pre-blood pump for RCA.
In addition to providing anticoagulation to the extracorporeal circuit and hemofilters, citrate also acts as a buffer source due to its metabolic conversion to bicarbonate systemically. Thus, the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution to be administered should take into account the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources, e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid. The product must be used together with a dialysis/replacement solution at an appropriate bicarbonate concentration.
Dose reduction may be needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In these patients, more frequent monitoring of citrate accumulation is advised. REGIOCIT solution should not be administered to patients with reduced liver and muscle perfusion, e.g., during conditions such as septic shock and lactic acidosis, or in patients with severe hepatic impairment, due to limited citrate metabolism (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
A separate systemic infusion of calcium is always required to prevent or treat hypocalcemia. Adjust calcium infusion depending on measured serum total-to-ionized calcium ratio and ionized calcium levels, to maintain values in the physiologic range. Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to the direction of the attending physician when REGIOCIT solution has been stopped.
Magnesium may need to be supplemented intravenously, based on systemic serum magnesium levels.

### Magnesium supplementation: a consideration in dialysis patients [^a564de3b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Even though disorders of magnesium (Mg) balance are common in dialyzed patients, this cation is often neglected. Many factors interfere with serum magnesium including diet, medications (eg, antacids or phosphate binders), and the dialysis prescription. Mg supplementation may help reduce serum phosphate concentration, PTH, and interfere with vascular calcification and bone mineralization. It could also decrease the all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities, although the results of current studies are conflicting. As with many other variables that influence hard endpoints in nephrology, additional research directly targeting the role of Mg supplementation in dialyzed patients are required. Nevertheless, a current risk/benefit assessment suggests that supplementation of Mg targeting high normal serum levels may represent a plausible option to improve the outcome of dialysis patients.

### Mineral metabolism and bone disease after bariatric surgery and ways to optimize bone health [^7fb3105a]. Obesity Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on how to protect the skeleton with adequate supplements in patients who have undergone bariatric operations. The main problem in mineral metabolism is usually related to secondary hyperparathyroidism (2 degrees HPT), often caused by a lack of dietary calcium, magnesium or vitamin D, together with changes in intestinal fermentation, transit time, and resorption surfaces left behind after bariatric operations. After primarily restrictive bariatric surgery, adequate mineral metabolism depends mainly on the active metabolite of vitamin D, whereas after primarily malabsorptive surgery, it depends largely on passive resorption by means of the calcium sensitizing receptor (CaSR). Notably, CaSR-activated calcium transport is coupled to the presence of sufficient magnesium. The current review discusses clinically relevant mechanisms of mineral metabolism and provides recommendations for adequate calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D supplementation. Nevertheless, formal supplementation guidelines are needed in the near future.

### Calcitriol (Rocaltrol) [^73637ab0]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The optimal daily dose of Rocaltrol must be carefully determined for each patient. Rocaltrol can be administered orally either as a capsule (0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg) or as an oral solution (1 mcg/mL). Rocaltrol therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of serum calcium.

The effectiveness of Rocaltrol therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate but not excessive daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.

Because of improved calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, some patients on Rocaltrol may be maintained on a lower calcium intake. Patients who tend to develop hypercalcemia may require only low doses of calcium or no supplementation at all.

During the titration period of treatment with Rocaltrol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly. When the optimal dosage of Rocaltrol has been determined, serum calcium levels should be checked every month (or as given below for individual indications). Samples for serum calcium estimation should be taken without a tourniquet.

Dialysis Patients

The recommended initial dose of Rocaltrol is 0.25 mcg/day. If a satisfactory response in the biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations of the disease state is not observed, dosage may be increased by 0.25 mcg/day at 4- to 8-week intervals. During this titration period, serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly, and if hypercalcemia is noted, the drug should be immediately discontinued until normocalcemia ensues (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase should be determined periodically.

Patients with normal or only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to Rocaltrol doses of 0.25 mcg every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis respond to doses between 0.5 and 1 mcg/day.

Oral Rocaltrol may normalize plasma-ionized calcium in some uremic patients, yet fail to suppress parathyroid hyperfunction. In these individuals with autonomous parathyroid hyper-function, oral Rocaltrol may be useful to maintain normocalcemia, but has not been shown to be adequate treatment for hyperparathyroidism.

### Citrate dose for continuous hemofiltration: effect on calcium and magnesium balance, parathormone and vitamin D status, a randomized controlled trial [^a9ed473b]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Regional citrate anticoagulation may cause a negative calcium balance, systemic hypocalcemia and parathormone (PTH) activation but randomzed studies are not available. Aim was to determine the effect of citrate dose on calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) balance, PTH and Vitamin D.

Methods

Single center prospective randomized study. Patients, requiring continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with citrate, randomized to low dose citrate (2.5mmol/L) vs. high dose (4.5mmol/L) for 24h, targeting post-filter ionized calcium (pfiCa) of 0.325–0.4mmol/L vs. 0.2–0.275mmol/L, using the Prismaflex® algorithm with 100% postfilter calcium replacement. Extra physician-ordered Ca and Mg supplementation was performed aiming at systemic iCa > 1.0mmol/L. Arterial blood, effluent and post-filter aliquots were taken for balance calculations (area under the curve), intact (i), oxidized (ox) and non-oxidized (nox) PTH, 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D (25D) and 1,25-dihydroxy-Vitamin D (1,25D).

Results

35 patients were analyzed, 17 to high, 18 to low citrate. Mean 24-h Ca balance was - 9.72mmol/d (standard error 1.70) in the high vs -1.18mmol/d (se 1.70)) (p = 0.002) in the low citrate group and 24-hMg-balance was -25.99 (se 2.10) mmol/d vs. -17.63 (se 2.10) mmol/d (p = 0.008) respectively. Physician-ordered Ca supplementation, higher in the high citrate group, resulted in a positive Ca-balance in both groups. iPTH, oxPTH or noxPTH were not different between groups. Over 24h, median PTH decreased from 222 (25th-75th percentile 140–384) to 162 (111–265) pg/ml (p = 0.002); oxPTH from 192 (124–353) to 154pg/ml (87–231), p = 0.002. NoxPTH did not change significantly. Mean 25 D (standard deviation), decreased from 36.5 (11.8) to 33.3 (11.2) nmol/l (p = 0.003), 1,25D rose from 40.9pg/ml (30.7) to 43.2 (30.7) pg/ml (p = 0.046), without differences between groups.

Conclusions

A higher citrate dose caused a more negative CVVH Ca balance than a lower dose, due to a higher effluent Calcium loss. Physician-ordered Ca supplementation, targeting a systemic iCa > 1.0mmol/L, higher in the high citrate group, resulted in a positive Ca-balance in both groups. iPTH and oxPTH declined, suggesting decreased oxidative stress, while noxPTH did not change. 25D decreased while 1,25-D rose. Mg balance was negative in both groups, more so in the high citrate group.

### Nutritional strategies for skeletal and cardiovascular health: hard bones, soft arteries, rather than vice versa [^9b17621c]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Food as the ideal source of calcium

The traditional focus in nutrition based on supplementation of single isolated nutrients may be especially misguided in the case of calcium and bone health. A diet supplemented with calcium as a mononutrient pill is not ideal for promoting bone health, and may instead accelerate arterial plaque growth and vascular calcification, and increase risk of MI. Food-based solutions place evidence-based emphasis on finding the admixture of foods that balance the acid–base status of the body, and that most favourably impact the body's calcium metabolism and bone health.

A plant-rich, grain-free diet alters the acid–base status so as to be slightly alkaline, which is conducive for bone health. However, plants are relatively poor sources of calcium compared to animal sources such as dairy products and animal bones. We suspect that milk, though an excellent source of bioavailable calcium, has potential adverse health effects for some individuals. Additionally, 65% of the world's population show some decrease in lactase activity during adulthood. Importantly, fermented dairy has been linked to favourable outcomes for bone health and mortality risk.

Benefits of consuming bones or bone meal

Ethnographic and anthropological studies indicate that adult human hunter-gatherers consumed most of their calcium in the form of bones from animals, such as small and large mammals, birds, fish and reptiles. Indeed through millions of years of evolution, we are genetically adapted to consume a large proportion of our dietary calcium from bones, where calcium is absorbed along with a matrix of nutrients including magnesium, phosphorus, strontium, zinc, iron, copper, collagen protein, aminoglycans and osteocalcin — all of which also support robust bone formation. Theoretically, including animal bones (sardines, salmon, soft chicken bones, bone broths, etc) may be an effective dietary strategy to ensure adequate calcium intake and to optimise long-term bone health.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^c7bf0e97]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction of urinary oxalate excretion in Ca‐Cit‐treated patients. The reduction of urinary oxalate might be related to the higher gastric solubility of Ca‐Cit that made available a greater amount of free calcium ions than CaCO 3. These free calcium cations, by forming calcium‐oxalate salts in the gastrointestinal tract, may have reduced oxalate intestinal absorption, thus reducing the concentration of oxalate absorbed and thus presented to the renal tubules. This noteworthy observation is relevant to the fact that urinary oxalate is one of the most important promoters of crystal growth, and the reduction in the excretion of this index might be important in reducing the risk of renal stone formation. Other factors, such as phosphorus, also may promote the nucleation of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. Nevertheless, in our study, serum and urinary phosphate levels did not differ between Ca‐Cit‐ and CaCO3‐treated patients.

Ca‐Cit was also associated with less constipation than CaCO 3. It is possible that the residual intestinal citrate forms complexes with magnesium to a greater extent than with CaCO 3. These magnesium complexes can have a laxative osmotic action that may explain our finding of an improvement of constipation in Ca‐Cit‐treated patients. An alternative explanation is that constipation was increased by CaCO 3 administration, whose dissolution, by forming CO 2, may be responsible for side effects such as flatulence, general gastrointestinal disorders, and notably, constipation.

However, this is not enough to improve overall QOL in these patients. SF‐36 and FACIT are validated but are not disease‐specific questionnaires, which may not be sensitive enough for QOL evaluation of HypoPT subjects. It is very likely that the high amount of calcium that is necessary to maintain normocalcemia in these patients completely abolished the possible advantages given by Ca‐Cit in other categories of patients who generally are prescribed lower doses of calcium. It is also possible that this short‐term study was not conducted long enough to see a difference in the QOL parameters.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^89d30c70]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The large number of randomised controlled trials that studied increased calcium intake and BMD and the consistency of the results across different populations in studies using higher or lower doses of calcium and in studies of dietary calcium sources or calcium supplements does not reveal any obvious gaps in the evidence. Any future trials conducted should have a strong rationale as to why the results are likely to differ from the large body of existing trial evidence. It is usually recommended that anti-resorptive agents are co-prescribed with calcium and vitamin D, although randomised controlled trials of such agents have shown reductions in risk of fractureand the expected increases in BMDwithout the co-administration of calcium and vitamin D. Randomised controlled trials clarifying the role of calcium and vitamin D in individuals using anti-resorptive agents might be valuable. In subgroup analyses, we stratified trials by thresholds of baseline dietary calcium intake (800 mg/day) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (50 nmol/L). The clinical consequences of low calcium intake or vitamin D status such as osteomalacia, however, probably occur only at much lower thresholds, and there might also be interactions between calcium intake and vitamin D status. Analyses of individual patient data would be valuable in exploring these issues further.

Conclusions

In summary, increasing calcium intake from dietary sources increases BMD by a similar amount to increases in BMD from calcium supplements. In each case, the increases are small (1–2%) and non-progressive, with little further effect on BMD after a year. Subgroup analyses do not suggest greater benefits of increasing calcium intake on BMD in any subpopulation based on clinically relevant baseline characteristics. The small effects on BMD are unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in fractures. Therefore, for most individuals concerned about their bone density, increasing calcium intake is unlikely to be beneficial.

### The role of calcium in osteoporosis drug therapy [^c1a54f45]. Journal of Women's Health (2005). Low credibility.

Great advances have been made in the field of osteoporosis treatment and prevention in recent years that have led to the availability of powerful new drugs. These drugs are viewed by patients and physicians as a major breakthrough in the management of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, this view has led many to ignore the importance of concurrent calcium supplementation to ensure the maximum benefit from these drugs, as evidenced by the recent decline in use of calcium supplements. As the majority of patients fail to consume the minimum recommended dietary intake of calcium, it is critical to recommend calcium supplements to raise total daily calcium intake to the levels needed to ensure maximum efficacy of osteoporosis treatments. Furthermore, osteoporosis drug labeling should be strengthened to encourage proper use of these drugs in combination with calcium supplements.

2.6 Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients to do the following:

Take ACTONEL at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day other than water, and before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins to maximize absorption and clinical benefit, [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Avoid the use of water with supplements, including mineral water, because they may have a higher concentration of calcium.
Swallow ACTONEL tablets whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 ounces). Avoid lying down for 30 minutes after taking the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Do not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
Do not eat or drink anything except plain water, or take other medications for at least 30 minutes after taking ACTONEL.

2.7 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate; and to take calcium supplements, antacids, magnesium-based supplements or laxatives, and iron preparations at a different time of the day as they interfere with the absorption of ACTONEL.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^f4046417]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the study

The strength of this meta-analysis is its comprehensive nature. We included 59 randomised controlled trials and assessed the effects of both dietary calcium sources and calcium supplements on BMD at five skeletal sites and at three time points. The size of the review permitted a comparison of the effects on BMD of different sources of calcium — dietary sources or supplements — and also the effects in important subgroups such as those defined by dose of calcium, use of co-administered vitamin D, and baseline clinical characteristics. The results are consistent with those from an earlier meta-analysis of 15 randomised controlled trials of calcium supplements, which reported an increase in BMD of 1.6–2.0% over two to four years.

An important limitation is that BMD is only a surrogate for the clinical outcome of fracture. We undertook the review, however, because many of the subgroup analyses in the dataset of trials with fracture as an endpoint have limited power, and a comparison between randomised controlled trials of dietary sources of calcium and calcium supplements with fracture as the endpoint is not possible because only two small randomised controlled trials of dietary sources of calcium reported fracture data. Another limitation is that in 60% of the meta-analyses, statistical heterogeneity between the studies was high (I 2 > 50%). This indicates substantial variability in the results of included trials, although this was often because of the presence of a small number of outlying results. Subgroup analyses generally did not substantially reduce or explain the heterogeneity. We used random effects meta-analyses that take heterogeneity into account, and their results should be interpreted as reflecting the average result across the group of trials.

### Phosphate and carbonate salts of calcium support robust bone building in osteoporosis [^b4e44cb9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium is an essential cotherapy in osteoporosis treatment. The relative effectiveness of various calcium salts for this purpose is uncertain. Many older women with osteoporosis have phosphorus intakes of < 70% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance.

Objective

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that calcium phosphate would better support anabolic bone building than would calcium carbonate.

Design

This study was a 12-mo, randomized, positive-comparator, 2-arm, single-blind clinical trial in 211 patients treated with teriparatide who consumed < 1000 mg phosphorus/d. Participants were randomly assigned to receive, in addition to teriparatide and 1000 IU cholecalciferol, 1800 mg calcium/d as either tricalcium phosphate or calcium carbonate. The primary endpoints were changes in lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral densities (BMDs); secondary endpoints were changes in bone resorption biomarkers and serum and urine calcium and phosphorus concentrations.

Results

In the combined group, the lumbar spine BMD increased by 7.2%, and total hip BMD increased by 2.1% (P < 0.01 for both). However, there was no significant difference between calcium-treatment groups, and there were no significant between-group differences in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations or in urine calcium concentrations. Bone resorption biomarkers increased in both groups, as expected with teriparatide, but the increases in the 2 calcium groups did not differ significantly.

Conclusions

Tricalcium phosphate and calcium carbonate appear to be approximately equally effective in supporting bone building with a potent anabolic agent; phosphate salt may be preferable in patients with restricted phosphorus intakes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00074711.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ee1859a7]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources slightly increased bone mineral density (BMD) (by 0.6–1.8%) over one to two years at all sites, except the forearm where there was no effect. Calcium supplements increased BMD to a similar degree at all sites and all time points (by 0.7–1.8%). In the randomised controlled trials of calcium supplements, the increases in BMD were present by one year, but there were no further subsequent increases. Thus the increases from baseline at both two and over two and half years at each site were similar to the increases at one year. The increases in BMD with dietary sources of calcium were similar to the increases with calcium supplements, except at the forearm, in both direct comparisons of the two interventions in multi-arm studies and in indirect comparisons of the two interventions through subgroup analyses. The increases in BMD were similar in trials of calcium monotherapy and CaD, consistent with a recent meta-analysis reporting that vitamin D monotherapy had no effect on BMD. There were no differences in changes in BMD in our subgroup analyses between trials with calcium doses of ≥ 1000 mg/day and < 1000 mg/day or doses of ≤ 500 mg/day and > 500 mg/day, and in populations with baseline dietary calcium intake of < 800 mg/day and ≥ 800 mg/day. Overall, the results suggest that increasing calcium intake, whether from dietary sources or by taking calcium supplements, provides a small non-progressive increase in BMD, without any ongoing reduction in rates of BMD loss beyond one year. The similar effect of increased dietary intake and supplements suggests that the non-calcium components of the dietary sources of calcium do not directly affect BMD.

### Calcium supplementation and bone mineral accretion in adolescent girls: an 18-mo randomized controlled trial with 2-y follow-up [^1a1ce6b6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A recent meta-analysis raised doubt as to whether calcium supplementation in children benefits spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD).

Objective

We used state-of-the-art measures of bone (fan-beam dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and 4 bone turnover markers) to determine whether girls with low habitual calcium intake benefited from supplementation with a soluble form of calcium (calcium citrate malate dissolved in a fruit drink).

Design

The trial was an 18-mo randomized trial of calcium supplementation (792 mg/d) with follow-up 2 y after supplement withdrawal. Subjects were 96 girls (mean age: 12 y) with low calcium intakes (mean: 636 mg/d). The main outcome measure was change in total-body, lumbar spine, and total hip bone mineral content (BMC) during supplementation and 2 y after supplement withdrawal. Changes in BMD and bone turnover markers were secondary outcome measures.

Results

The mean additional calcium intake in the supplemented group was 555 mg/d. Compared with the control group, the supplemented group showed significantly (P < 0.05) greater gains in BMC (except at the total hip site) over the 18-mo study. BMD change was significantly (P < 0.05) greater for all skeletal sites, and concentrations of bone resorption markers and parathyroid hormone were significantly (P < 0.01) lower in the supplemented group than in the control group after 18 mo. After 42 mo, gains in BMC and BMD and differences in bone resorption were no longer evident.

Conclusions

Calcium supplementation enhances bone mineral accrual in teenage girls, but the effect is short-lived. The likely mechanism for the effect of the calcium is suppression of bone turnover, which is reversed upon supplement withdrawal.

### Bone health management after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an expert panel opinion from the American society for transplantation and cellular therapy [^26e408b7]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) after HCT — key risk factors emphasize glucocorticoid exposure and comorbidities. Among approximately 5000 retrospectively studied adult HCT recipients, 87% had received previous high-dose glucocorticoid therapy and 25% had a pre-HCT fracture. Glucocorticoid exposure is one of the strongest risk factors for post-HCT bone loss, with high daily and cumulative doses relevant; the highest rate of BMD loss occurs within the first 3 to 6 months after starting glucocorticoids and continues to decline with persistent therapy. Additional post-transplantation risks include secondary hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease, renal wasting of calcium or magnesium, impaired liver function, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy, exposure to nonsteroidal immunosuppressive medications that may increase fracture risk, and iron overload that may increase the risk of osteoporosis.

### Risedronate sodium [^3ade4d4c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients to do the following:

Take risedronate sodium tablets at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day other than water, and before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins to maximize absorption and clinical benefit, [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Avoid the use of water with supplements, including mineral water, because they may have a higher concentration of calcium.
Swallow risedronate sodium tablets whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 ounces). Avoid lying down for 30 minutes after taking the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Do not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
Do not eat or drink anything except plain water, or take other medications for at least 30 minutes after taking risedronate sodium tablets.

2.7 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate; and to take calcium supplements, antacids, magnesium-based supplements or laxatives, and iron preparations at a different time of the day as they interfere with the absorption of risedronate sodium tablets.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^52efb0ac]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether increasing calcium intake from dietary sources affects bone mineral density (BMD) and, if so, whether the effects are similar to those of calcium supplements.

Design Random effects meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data sources Ovid Medline, Embase, Pubmed, and references from relevant systematic reviews. Initial searches were undertaken in July 2013 and updated in September 2014.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements (with or without vitamin D) in participants aged over 50 with BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, total body, or forearm as an outcome.

Results We identified 59 eligible randomised controlled trials: 15 studied dietary sources of calcium (n = 1533) and 51 studied calcium supplements (n = 12 257). Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources increased BMD by 0.6–1.0% at the total hip and total body at one year and by 0.7–1.8% at these sites and the lumbar spine and femoral neck at two years. There was no effect on BMD in the forearm. Calcium supplements increased BMD by 0.7–1.8% at all five skeletal sites at one, two, and over two and a half years, but the size of the increase in BMD at later time points was similar to the increase at one year. Increases in BMD were similar in trials of dietary sources of calcium and calcium supplements (except at the forearm), in trials of calcium monotherapy versus co-administered calcium and vitamin D, in trials with calcium doses of ≥ 1000 versus < 1000 mg/day and ≤ 500 versus > 500 mg/day, and in trials where the baseline dietary calcium intake was < 800 versus ≥ 800 mg/day.

Conclusions Increasing calcium intake from dietary sources or by taking calcium supplements produces small non-progressive increases in BMD, which are unlikely to lead to a clinically significant reduction in risk of fracture.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^1f80e612]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D supplementation — Across randomized controlled trials, combined calcium (500–1,200 mg/d) plus vitamin D (400–800 international units/d) was associated with decreased hip fracture risk (summary relative risk estimate 0.61; 95% CI 0.46–0.82) and reduced total fractures (summary relative risk estimate 0.86; 95% CI 0.75–0.98), and a more recent meta-analysis of six RCTs (49,282 participants) using calcium (1,000–1,200 mg/d) with vitamin D (400–800 international units/d) reported reduced hip fracture risk (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72–0.97) and a small decrease in any fracture (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.99); however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found no effect on total fracture incidence in an average-risk population (without vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture), noting high-risk patients were not included and that combined supplementation appears to be effective for them.

### Calcium: magnesium intake ratio and colorectal carcinogenesis, results from the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial [^13c6fdb1]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

It is possible that 2.5 may not serve as the optimal Ca:Mg ratio cut point to differentiate adequate vs. inadequate Ca:Mg ratios. It is also notable that the magnitudes of the inverse associations between calcium and distal CRC are weaker in the > 2.5 Ca:Mg ratio category than compared with the middle category (1.7–2.5). The Ca:Mg ratio strata of < 1.7 had too few observations to make explicit extrapolations. Nonetheless, the waning of the observed inverse association between calcium and distal CRC with increasing Ca:Mg ratio categories is also reflected in the positive beta estimate for the interaction term when calcium and Ca:Mg ratio were modelled as continuous variables (data not shown). Thus, our results suggest that the optimal Ca:Mg ratio may be located somewhere between 1.7 and 2.5.

In an earlier study, we reported that the dietary intake ratio of Ca:Mg modified the association between calcium, magnesium and prevalent colorectal adenoma. In a subsequent randomised clinical trial, calcium supplementation only reduced risk of metachronous colorectal adenoma when the baseline Ca:Mg ratio was < 2.63. We found that the Ca:Mg ratio modified the associations between intakes of calcium and magnesium and risk of oesophageal neoplasia. A case–control study conducted in Belgium reported that a high calcium intake with a low magnesium intake was associated with increased risk of bladder cancer. In studies conducted in East Asian populations with a low Ca:Mg intake ratio (a median around 1.7), the association between intakes of calcium and magnesium and several outcomes (total, cardiovascular and/or cancer mortalities) were modified by the Ca:Mg ratio, but not by calcium or magnesium intake alone. In a randomised trial, we found reducing Ca:Mg ratios to around 2.3 through magnesium supplementation optimised vitamin D status (i.e. increasing blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) when baseline 25(OH)D levels were lower, but decreasing 25(OH)D3 when baseline 25(OH)D were higher). Thus, the optimal balance between calcium and magnesium intake is a critical factor to consider in the investigation of associations between intakes of calcium and magnesium and cancer development.

### What is the optimal bone-preserving strategy for patients with Addison's disease? [^7cbcd949]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Addison's disease is associated with low bone mineral density and increased risk of hip fractures. Causes are multifactorial, contributed by underlying adrenocortical hormonal deficiency, associated autoimmune endocrinopathies, electrolyte disturbances and, in some patients, supraphysiologic glucocorticoid replacement. Recent realization of physiologic cortisol production rate has revised downwards glucocorticoid replacement dosages. Meanwhile, new research has emerged suggesting complex interplay between sodium and calcium homoeostasis under the influence of mineralocorticoid and parathyroid hormone that may impact bone health. As the prevalence of Addison's disease is rising, and osteoporosis and fractures are associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality, attention to bone preservation in Addison's disease is of clinical relevance and importance. We suggest an approach to bone health in Addison's disease integrating physiologic adrenocortical hormonal replacement with electrolyte and mineral homoeostasis optimization.

Fig 7 Random effects meta-analysis of effect of calcium supplements on percentage change in bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline in studies that lasted more than two and a half years

When we used Egger's regression model and visual inspection of funnel plots, data seemed skewed toward positive results with increased calcium intake from dietary sources or supplements in about half of analyses that included five or more studies. The asymmetry of the funnel plot was caused by more small-moderate sized studies reporting larger effects of calcium on BMD than expected, raising the possibility of publication bias. Seven multi-arm randomised controlled trials included a dietary source of calcium arm and a calcium supplement arm, which allowed a direct comparison of the interventions. There were no significant differences between groups in BMD at any site in any individual trial, and there were also no significant differences between groups in BMD at any site or any time point in the pooled analyses (table D, appendix 2). We also tested for differences between the results of the trials of dietary sources of calcium and the trials of calcium supplements by comparing the two groups in subgroup analyses (table 4). There were no differences between the groups at any time point at the lumbar spine, total hip, or total body. At the femoral neck, there were greater increases in BMD at one year in the calcium supplement trials than in the dietary calcium trials, but at two years we found the opposite — that is, greater changes with dietary calcium than with calcium supplements. At the forearm, there were increases in BMD in the calcium supplement trials but no effect in the trials of dietary sources of calcium.

### Mineral and bone disorders in conventional hemodialysis: challenges and solutions [^efbecf3c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the advent of cinacalcet and noncalcium-containing phosphate binders, controlling the progression of vascular calcification (VC) is still challenging. Recent reports demonstrate that carbamylation driven by high urea concentration aggravates VC, suggesting the importance of adequate dialysis in retarding its progression. Theoretically, other promising measures include the use of iron-based phosphate binders, vitamin K, and magnesium supplements, which should be investigated in future randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ideally with hard outcomes. While incidence of hip fracture in patients on dialysis is decreasing in the United States and Japan (possibly owing to better control of PTH levels by cinacalcet) it remains much higher than that in the general population. Many drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis, including bisphosphonate, raloxifene, denosumab, and teriparatide can, under specific conditions, increase bone mineral density (BMD), which is associated with a lower fracture rate. However, the efficacy of these drugs in reducing the fracture rate remains to be proven in hemodialysis (HD) patients, given their adverse effects such as severe hypocalcemia and resultant worsening of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Some clinical studies have shown that cinacalcet, lanthanum carbonate, and sevelamer reduce mortality in elderly patients on HD, suggesting the benefits of reducing PTH and serum phosphate levels. However, the target ranges of PTH and phosphate levels are based solely on observational studies. This is also the case when treating low PTH levels by decreasing vitamin D or calcium load. RCTs with hard clinical endpoints comparing different targets are necessary in the future.

### Conventional treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^a4b1a817]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism consists of oral calcium and either activated vitamin D or vitamin D supplements at varying doses. Although adjusting dosing of calcium and/or activated vitamin D or vitamin D itself, the serum calcium should be obtained weekly or monthly depending on the clinical situation. Calcium supplementation in hypoparathyroidism usually consists of calcium carbonate because it is 40% elemental calcium by weight. However, calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is indicated for patients with achlorhydria and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Many clinicians prefer to uptitrate the activated form of vitamin D to reduce the amount of calcium supplementation.

### Magnesium biology [^cd2231b1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Bone and liver have been demonstrated to act as major Mg 2+ stores in the body. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that osteoclast activity is increased upon decreased extracellular Mg 2+ concentrations. Moreover, recent data demonstrated that defects in liver Mg 2+ homeostasis directly affect serum Mg levels. Together these results point towards an involvement of bones and liver in the overall body Mg 2+ homeostasis, which is why there has been a long-running discussion around the ideal determination of whole-body Mg 2+ levels. Since only about 1%–2% of the whole-body Mg 2+ is present in serum, it has been suggested that soft tissues and bones can be depleted of Mg 2+, even if serum Mg 2+ is normal. However, the clinical relevance of these lower tissue Mg 2+ contents is unclear.

Consumption and supplementation of magnesium in health and disease

The daily recommended dietary allowance for Mg 2+ in adults is about 400 mg for males and 310 mg for females, which increases to 350 mg during pregnancy. According to a report from the European Food Safety Authority combining data from 13 dietary surveys conducted in the European Union, the average Mg 2+ intake in these studies ranged from 232 to 439 mg/day for adults, which suggests that the majority of the population ingests sufficient Mg 2+. Nevertheless, a trend towards the use of Mg 2+ supplementation can be observed in recent years. Many claim that Mg 2+ supplementation helps with sleep, muscle cramps and anxiety. Several meta-analyses and reviews conclude that there is not enough scientific evidence to prove that these claims are true in healthy individuals. However, Mg 2+ supplementation can be of therapeutic use in patients suffering from hypomagnesemia. In healthy individuals, increased ingestion of Mg 2+ poses little risk. In the case of increased ingestion, the intestinal absorption is decreased, while the renal excretion rate can increase up to 100% to balance Mg 2+ levels. Still, it should be noted that extremely high doses of Mg 2+ supplementation can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramping, but will resolve once the Mg 2+ has been digested.

### Magnesium deficit? overlooked cause of low vitamin D status? [^b61b2f99]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present study must be praised for bringing potential interactions between individual nutrients into the focus of interest. Because the intake of Mg is often inadequate and several other factors are also known to impair Mg supply (for example, diuretics use, diabetes mellitus, chronic alcohol consumption, stress factors), more attention should in future be paid to possible consequences of insufficient or deficient Mg supply in the general population. Further studies on the interactions between Mg supply and vitamin D status should include a more detailed assessment of individual Mg status (for example, by measuring biochemical parameters of Mg status or by adjusting statistical analysis for stress factors, diuretics use, alcohol consumption and concomitant diagnoses such as diabetes); a more detailed investigation of different components of the vitamin D-parathyroid hormone axis in general populations; clarification of the dose?response relationship; and the realization of randomized controlled trials to verify whether oral Mg is indeed able to improve vitamin D status and survival.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^685a1e34]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

2.1 Hypocalcemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation. Calcium

reinfusion is required during use of REGIOCIT and blood calcium concentrations (ionized and total) must be monitored.

2.3 Hypomagnesemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no magnesium. Use of the REGIOCIT solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses. Magnesium levels must be monitored as infusion of magnesium may be necessary.

2.4 Hypoglycemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no dextrose. Administration of REGIOCIT solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels must be monitored regularly.

2.5 Hypokalemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT.

2.6 Metabolic Alkalosis

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Metabolization of 1 mol of citrate generates 3 mol of bicarbonate. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance. If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) or change the composition of the CRRT solution.

2.7 Metabolic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis may occur if metabolic clearance of citrate by the liver or skeletal muscle is impaired. If citrate accumulation develops and/or metabolic acidosis develops or worsens during therapy with REGIOCIT solution, the infusion rate may need to be decreased or its administration stopped.

2.8 Use in Patients with Mild to Moderate Hepatic Impairment

Metabolism of citrate (to bicarbonate) may be impaired in patients with hepatic impairment, resulting in accumulation of citrate. If REGIOCIT solution is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid–base imbalance.

2.9 Hypoosmolarity/Hypotonicity

REGIOCIT solution is hypoosmolar/hypotonic relative to standard CRRT replacement fluids and should be used with caution in patients with traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or increased intracranial pressure.
