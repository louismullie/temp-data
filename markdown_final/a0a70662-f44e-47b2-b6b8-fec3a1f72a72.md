uti pregnancy amoxiliin allergy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a urinary tract infection during pregnancy in a patient with an amoxicillin allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the allergy phenotype and the likelihood of true penicillin allergy. Then, I should distinguish the infection type and severity because cystitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and pyelonephritis require different agents and routes. Next, I will integrate pregnancy-specific pharmacology and safety, including resistance patterns and trimester cautions. After that, I'll select empiric therapy based on allergy severity while acknowledging cross-reactivity evidence and exceptions. Then, I must outline culture-guided narrowing and test-of-cure. I will also consider suppressive prophylaxis for recurrence in pregnancy. Finally, I will incorporate an allergy delabeling plan to optimize future care and stewardship.

> Let me first confirm the nature of the reported "amoxicillin allergy", because most labeled penicillin allergies are not true allergies, and clarifying this dramatically expands safe options in pregnancy. I need to check the history and stratify severity as non-severe immediate or remote reactions versus severe IgE-mediated anaphylaxis versus severe delayed T-cell–mediated syndromes such as SJS/TEN or DRESS, since this dictates whether cephalosporins remain appropriate. ACOG and allergy literature emphasize that more than 90–95% of reported penicillin allergies are delabeled on testing and that antenatal evaluation is safe and should be encouraged to improve antibiotic stewardship and maternal–neonatal outcomes, which I should verify with institutional resources and counseling for this patient [^114FqJSb] [^1157TKDX] [^113pcugG] [^111SzC4K].

> Next, I should review the clinical syndrome because therapy diverges for asymptomatic bacteriuria, acute cystitis, and pyelonephritis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in pregnancy, asymptomatic bacteriuria warrants treatment to prevent pyelonephritis progression, whereas in nonpregnant adults it often does not. I need to ensure we classify correctly: cystitis typically lacks fever and flank pain, pyelonephritis features systemic signs and CVA tenderness, and ASB is bacteriuria without symptoms, but still requires treatment during pregnancy to reduce pyelonephritis risk and potential adverse obstetric outcomes [^1144U2MN] [^115xhQcK].

> I will now examine core pharmacologic principles specific to pregnancy and UTI. Wait, let me verify current resistance guidance: ACOG advises against empiric ampicillin or amoxicillin because of high E. coli resistance rates, and this is consistent with global data showing low ampicillin susceptibility, so even without an allergy I would avoid these empirically. Beta-lactams are generally preferred in pregnancy when effective because of established safety, but I should confirm trimester-specific cautions for nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX and favor avoiding them in the first trimester if alternatives exist. I also need to check that fosfomycin is restricted to uncomplicated cystitis due to susceptible E. coli or Enterococcus faecalis and is not appropriate for pyelonephritis because it lacks adequate renal parenchymal penetration. For pyelonephritis, agents must penetrate renal tissue, and initial IV therapy is standard before stepping down when improved [^116p68YB] [^116dkvj7] [^1148qjMZ] [^112ph6V3] [^11335mYn] [^115xhQcK].

> For patients with a non-severe amoxicillin or penicillin allergy, I should confirm cephalosporin safety given modern side-chain data. Let me consider cross-reactivity: cefazolin and most cephalosporins have distinct R1 side chains and show very low cross-reactivity with penicillins, supporting cephalosporin use in most penicillin-allergic patients unless there is a severe delayed hypersensitivity history. For acute cystitis or ASB, cephalexin for 5–7 days is a common, pregnancy-compatible choice, and cefuroxime is a reasonable oral alternative if local susceptibilities support it. For pyelonephritis, initial IV ceftriaxone daily or cefazolin in divided doses is appropriate, with step-down to an oral cephalosporin once afebrile and improving, tailoring to culture results and completing an adequate total duration per clinical response and guideline context [^114FqJSb] [^116p68YB] [^112YwALJ] [^116dkvj7].

> Now, for severe IgE-mediated allergy such as anaphylaxis, my first instinct is to avoid all beta-lactams. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the cephalosporin exception here: cefazolin and many cephalosporins are generally safe even in IgE-mediated penicillin allergy due to side-chain differences, except when there is a history of severe delayed reactions like SJS or DRESS, where all beta-lactams should be avoided. If the allergy history clearly indicates high-risk immediate anaphylaxis and cephalosporins are being deferred pending evaluation, non–beta-lactam options for cystitis or ASB include nitrofurantoin for 5–7 days, avoiding use in the first trimester if alternatives exist, or single-dose fosfomycin for susceptible organisms. For pyelonephritis in this scenario, I need to ensure renal tissue penetration and consider a non–beta-lactam parenteral regimen such as an aminoglycoside with careful renal monitoring, and I should consult infectious diseases early for complex resistance patterns or consideration of carbapenems if ESBL is suspected, while acknowledging pregnancy risks and benefits in shared decision-making [^114FqJSb] [^1148qjMZ] [^11335mYn] [^115xhQcK] [^115mkSfT].

> For severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions, I should confirm that all beta-lactams, including cephalosporins, are contraindicated. Let me reconsider documentation: the reaction phenotype must be captured precisely in the chart to prevent inadvertent re-exposure, and allergy consultation should be pursued for delabeling where appropriate or for desensitization only if absolutely necessary and no alternatives exist, which is rarely the case for UTIs in pregnancy given available non–beta-lactam options for lower tract disease [^114FqJSb] [^1157TKDX].

> Before locking in therapy, I need to ensure we obtain a urine culture at or before treatment initiation and plan to narrow when susceptibilities return. I should double-check that ACOG recommends a 5–7 day targeted course for acute cystitis in pregnancy and explicitly to avoid empiric amoxicillin or ampicillin. At 48–72 hours, I will reassess clinical response and culture data to streamline therapy. If the isolate is resistant to nitrofurantoin or other initial choices, I must switch accordingly. For ASB and in recurrent infection scenarios, a test-of-cure urine culture 1–2 weeks after therapy is prudent to ensure eradication during pregnancy, given the stakes of progression to pyelonephritis [^111HbnGX] [^116p68YB] [^1144U2MN] [^116dkvj7].

> If this patient has recurrent UTIs or after an episode of pyelonephritis, I need to consider suppressive prophylaxis for the remainder of pregnancy. Hold on, I should verify the evidence strength: ACOG acknowledges limited data but allows consideration of nightly suppressive regimens guided by prior susceptibilities. Common pregnancy-compatible options include low-dose nitrofurantoin or cephalexin if the allergy phenotype permits, with ongoing monitoring and periodic cultures as indicated, after discussing risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient to support stewardship and minimize resistance [^116dkvj7] [^115FCJ4a] [^114rAos1] [^114nRxTD].

> I should now incorporate an allergy delabeling strategy to optimize both current and future care. Let me first confirm feasibility and safety: antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation using skin testing followed by an oral challenge when negative is safe, highly effective at delabeling, and improves access to optimal beta-lactams; if not completed during pregnancy, postpartum testing should be arranged. The benefits include more effective and narrower-spectrum therapy in future pregnancies, reduced neonatal labs and maternal morbidity, and better stewardship across obstetric indications such as GBS prophylaxis and cesarean prophylaxis [^1157TKDX] [^113pcugG] [^111SzC4K] [^114FqJSb].

> Bringing this together into practical choices, let me outline explicit scenarios while keeping verification steps in mind. For acute cystitis or ASB with a non-severe amoxicillin allergy, I would start cephalexin for 5–7 days or consider cefuroxime if local patterns support it, obtaining a culture first and narrowing thereafter. For severe IgE-mediated allergy where cephalosporins are temporarily avoided pending evaluation, I would use nitrofurantoin for 5–7 days if not in the first trimester or a single 3 g dose of fosfomycin for susceptible organisms, and I would arrange prompt allergy consultation to reclaim beta-lactam options. For pyelonephritis with a non-severe allergy, I would initiate IV ceftriaxone, transition to an oral cephalosporin once improved, and complete an appropriate total course based on response; with a high-risk immediate allergy or severe delayed reaction, I would use a non–beta-lactam parenteral regimen with specialist input to ensure adequate renal tissue penetration and safety in pregnancy, then tailor to culture results as soon as possible [^116p68YB] [^11335mYn] [^114uJR9k] [^116dkvj7] [^115xhQcK].

> Finally, I need to ensure the overarching stewardship principles are explicit. Even in patients reporting amoxicillin allergy, cephalosporins are appropriate first-line agents for most pregnant individuals given minimal cross-reactivity except in severe delayed reactions, combined with superior alignment to resistance patterns compared with amoxicillin or ampicillin, which should be avoided for empiric therapy. Embedding allergy evaluation into routine obstetric care maximizes safe access to beta-lactams, improves outcomes, and reduces unnecessary broad-spectrum exposure for the mother–infant dyad [^114FqJSb] [^116p68YB] [^1157TKDX].

For pregnant patients with a **true amoxicillin allergy**, safe and effective options for uncomplicated cystitis include **nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days** [^116p68YB] (avoid at term) or **fosfomycin 3 g PO single dose** [^11335mYn]. **Cephalosporins** [^114FqJSb] (e.g. cephalexin 500 mg PO QID for 5–7 days) are appropriate when the allergy is non-severe because cross-reactivity is low. For severe IgE-mediated reactions, avoid all beta-lactams and use nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin. Always obtain a **urine culture** before starting antibiotics and adjust therapy based on sensitivities [^111HbnGX]. If pyelonephritis is suspected, hospitalize and treat with non-beta-lactam options (e.g. aztreonam or gentamicin) with close maternal–fetal monitoring [^115xhQcK] [^notfound].

---

## Recommended antibiotic alternatives

### First-line alternatives

**Nitrofurantoin** 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days is a first-line choice; avoid at term (≥ 38 weeks), during labor, or if G6PD deficiency is present [^116p68YB]. **Fosfomycin tromethamine** 3 g orally as a single dose is another first-line option [^112eW7ZK] effective for uncomplicated cystitis but not for pyelonephritis [^11335mYn].

---

### Second-line alternatives

**Cephalosporins** [^114FqJSb] such as cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for 5–7 days are appropriate in non-severe penicillin allergy given low cross-reactivity [^1141u2Qz]. **Aztreonam** 1–2 g IV every 8–12 hours is reserved for severe infections or when oral therapy is not feasible [^115xhQcK].

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Contraindicated due to fetal cartilage toxicity [^112mYXUQ].

- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: Avoid in the first trimester (neural tube defects) and near term (kernicterus) [^112uqGPw].

- **Aminoglycosides**: Avoid unless absolutely necessary due to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity risks.

---

## Diagnostic considerations

**Urine culture** should be obtained before initiating antibiotics to guide therapy and ensure appropriate antibiotic selection [^111HbnGX]. **Penicillin allergy testing** can be considered during pregnancy [^1157TKDX] to confirm or exclude true allergy, allowing safer antibiotic choices [^112bGYXM].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety

- **Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin**: Effective and safe for uncomplicated UTIs in pregnancy, with low risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [^116p68YB] [^11335mYn].

- **Cephalosporins**: Safe and effective in pregnancy, with minimal cross-reactivity in non-severe penicillin allergies [^114FqJSb].

- **Aztreonam**: Safe alternative for severe penicillin allergies, though typically reserved for more severe infections [^115xhQcK].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

**Test of cure** should be performed 1–2 weeks after completing therapy to ensure eradication of infection [^111HbnGX]. **Maternal and fetal monitoring** should include regular assessment for adverse reactions and fetal well-being throughout treatment [^115xhQcK].

### Cefazolin as the mainstay for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with a penicillin allergy in obstetrics and gynecology [^114FqJSb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Cefazolin is the most common antibiotic used for prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology. Among those with a penicillin allergy, alternative antibiotics are often chosen for prophylaxis, given fears of cross-reactivity between penicillin and cefazolin. Alternative antibiotics in this setting are associated with adverse sequelae, including surgical site infections, induction of bacterial resistance, higher costs to the healthcare system, and possible *Clostridium difficile* infection. Given the difference in R1 side chains between penicillin and cefazolin, cefazolin use is safe and should be recommended for patients with a penicillin allergy, including those who experience Immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions such as anaphylaxis. Cefazolin should only be avoided in those who experience a history of a severe, life-threatening delayed hypersensitivity reaction manifested as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Steven-Johnson Syndrome), hepatitis, nephritis, serum sickness, and hemolytic anemia in response to penicillin administration.

In addition, more than 90% of those with a documented penicillin allergy do not have true allergies on skin testing. Increased referral for penicillin allergy testing should be incorporated into routine obstetric care and preoperative assessment to reduce suboptimal antibiotic prophylaxis use. More education is needed among providers surrounding penicillin allergy assessment and cross-reactivity among penicillins and cephalosporins to optimize antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetrics and gynecology.

### Safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation: A systematic review [^1157TKDX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 8–13% of pregnant patients report a penicillin allergy. Penicillins and other beta-lactams are widely used in pregnancy, but they are often avoided in patients who report an allergy, resulting in suboptimal therapy, antimicrobial resistance, higher costs, and increased morbidity for both patients and neonates. True penicillin allergy is rare, and 95% of unverified penicillin allergies are delabeled upon evaluation. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is safe and recommended for pregnant patients, few undergo assessment. Research concerning antenatal penicillin allergy evaluation is accelerating, prompting a systematic review to summarize this growing body of evidence for obstetric providers.

A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed ahead-of-print and non-Medline, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted in collaboration with a medical information specialist. There were no restrictions on study language, date, or design.

All peer-reviewed studies involving pregnant individuals reporting unverified penicillin allergy and undergoing penicillin allergy evaluation with five or more participants were included in the review. Case reports, non-peer-reviewed sources, and studies focused on desensitization of verified penicillin-allergic patients were excluded.

Title and abstract reviews, full-text reviews, and data extraction were completed independently by two authors, with conflicts resolved by a third author. Studies were evaluated using validated quality assessment tools.

### Antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnancy [^111L1kt2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is a major public health challenge today. N. gonorrhoeae can be transmitted from the mother's genital tract to the newborn during birth, potentially leading to gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum as well as systemic neonatal infections. It can also cause endometritis and pelvic sepsis in the mother. This review updates and replaces an earlier Cochrane Review on antibiotics for treating this infectious condition.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical effectiveness and harms of antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnant women.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2017), LILACS database (1982 to April 5, 2017), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; April 5, 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (April 5, 2017), the ISRCTN Registry (April 5, 2017), and Epistemonikos (April 5, 2017). We also searched reference lists of all retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnancy. The antibiotics could have been used alone or in combination, administered parenterally, orally, or both, and compared with another antibiotic. We included RCTs regardless of their publication status (published, unpublished, published as an article, an abstract, or a letter), language, or country, and applied no limits on the length of follow-up. We excluded RCTs using a cluster- or cross-over design, or quasi-RCTs.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^113tLEJ9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Women who were pregnant in 2014 and had an outpatient claim for at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis filled at least one prescription for an antibiotic from an outpatient pharmacy within seven days of their UTI diagnosis, either before or during pregnancy. This data was sourced from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database, United States, 2013–2015.

UTIs in this context were defined by the presence of an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) diagnosis code of UTI (599.0) or acute cystitis (595.0 or 595.9) on at least one outpatient claim. It is noteworthy that the number and proportion sum for "any" antibiotic could be greater, as some women filled prescriptions for more than one type of antibiotic. Additionally, women could have experienced up to two UTIs during the 90 days before their last menstrual period (LMP) through the end of pregnancy.

- **Antibiotic timing**:
	- The first antibiotic prescription(s) filled from an outpatient pharmacy must occur within 7 days of UTI diagnosis.
	- **Trimester definition**: First trimester = 0–90 days after LMP; second trimester = 91–180 days after LMP; third trimester = 181 days after LMP until the end of pregnancy.

- **Medication types**:
	- Includes medications such as amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, typically used to treat genitourinary infections.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^115GiqJ8]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Use of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin has increased since guidelines began recommending them as first-line therapy for lower urinary tract infection (UTI). The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin in women with uncomplicated cystitis.

This was a multinational, open-label, analyst-blinded, randomized clinical trial including 513 nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older. Participants exhibited symptoms of lower UTI, such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness, had a positive urine dipstick result (with detection of nitrites or leukocyte esterase), and were not known to have colonization or previous infection with uropathogens resistant to the study antibiotics. Recruitment took place from October 2013 through April 2017 at hospital units and outpatient clinics in Geneva, Switzerland; Lodz, Poland; and Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral nitrofurantoin, 100 mg three times a day for 5 days (n = 255), or a single 3-g dose of oral fosfomycin (n = 258). They returned for clinical evaluation and urine culture collection 14 and 28 days after therapy completion.

The primary outcome was assessed as the clinical response in the 28 days following therapy completion, defined as clinical resolution (complete resolution of symptoms and signs of UTI without prior failure), failure (need for additional or change in antibiotic treatment due to UTI or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy), or indeterminate (persistence of symptoms without objective evidence of infection).

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: Population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance [^112C8G74]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Our study demonstrates high and concerning rates of antibiotic resistance to common antimicrobial agents for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pregnancy. The gram-negative uro-pathogens showed high resistance to ampicillin and azithromycin. More than 30% of E. coli isolates were not susceptible to common second and third-generation cephalosporins. Among the most common uro-pathogens, E. coli and staphylococcal species, there was only low-to-moderate susceptibility to cefixime, a traditionally potent oral third-generation cephalosporin. Similar high and concerning rates of antibiotic resistance were reported in the WHO Global Surveillance of Antimicrobials. National level data from South-East Asia shows that 16–68% of E. coli isolates and 34–81% of Klebsiella isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. This data emphasizes the urgency for antibiotic stewardship in LMIC, and the need to develop new effective antimicrobials that are safe for use during pregnancy.

There were several limitations to this study. We did not have the ability to speciate coagulase-negative staphylococcal species in our field laboratory. We presume the majority of these species were Staphylococcus saprophyticus; however, it is possible that some of these might have been Staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be considered a skin contaminant. Another challenge was the differentiation between skin contamination and true pathogens. The rates of S. aureus growth were high, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine what proportion of those should be attributed to true infections or contamination.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^114N98A4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

For acute pyelonephritis in pregnant patients, particularly regarding antibiotic therapy, the 2023 ACOG guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to guide management after treating pyelonephritis in pregnancy. It is advised to consider initiating suppressive therapy for the remainder of the pregnancy, as is done for recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs).

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^115mkSfT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Although 10–14 days of therapy is accepted for the treatment of pyelonephritis, particularly in pregnant women, new studies are challenging this duration of therapy. The treatment choice for pyelonephritis in pregnant women is limited. Antimicrobial drug resistance is rising at an alarming rate, with very few new treatment options for Gram-negative bacteria in both non-pregnant and pregnant individuals. The rise of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria is compounding the problem because antimicrobials such as cephalosporins, which have a good safety profile in pregnant women, are rendered ineffective.

Only four randomized control trials in pregnant women, including 90, 178, 179, and 101 women — 548 women in total — have assessed antimicrobial efficacy. These studies concluded that in non-bacteremic patients, oral cephalexin (500 mg every 6 hours) did not differ in efficacy and safety from intravenous (IV) cephalothin (1 g every 6 hours) treatment. One daily dose of IV ceftriaxone was as effective as multiple daily doses of cefazolin. No difference in clinical response was observed with IV ampicillin and gentamicin, IV cefazolin, or intramuscular ceftriaxone, whereas cefuroxime (750 mg every 8 hours IV) was more efficacious and better tolerated than cephradine (1 g every 6 hours IV).

A review article reported that two weeks of therapy seems acceptable for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in women, not specifically pregnant women; nevertheless, 10- to 14-day courses are suggested. Here, we report the incidence, risk factors, diagnosis, microbial pathogens, and antimicrobial susceptibilities.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^112ZAn3y]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Antibiotic treatment**: Antibiotics were prescribed on the same date of diagnosis for 85.7% of urinary tract infections (UTIs), ranging from 20.7% in children under 3 years to 89% in women aged 18 to 64 years. Only 17% of those who received antibiotics had a recorded urine test within 10 days of diagnosis, with a range from 9.1% for the under 3 year group to 30.6% for women aged 18 to 64 years.

Overall, the most common antibiotics initially prescribed were trimethoprim (56.8%) and nitrofurantoin (23.9%) (refer to Fig. 2). Cephalexin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in pregnant women (30.4%) and the second most commonly prescribed in children under 4 years (24.0% in those under 3 months and 5.6% in those aged 3 months to 3 years).

Multiple antibiotics were administered to 3,543 (0.8%) patients. Six percent of UTI episodes diagnosed in pregnant women (n = 62) were treated with trimethoprim. The proportion of UTIs treated with co-amoxiclav varied between 4.3% in children aged 4 to 15 years (n = 1,086) and 7.6% in men aged 18 to 64 years (n = 1,830). Chronic kidney disease (of stage ≥ 3) was diagnosed in 9.4% of episodes treated with nitrofurantoin in women and 15.0% of those in men, occurring in 0.6% of episodes in women and 1.9% in men with stage ≥ 4.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^115hPck2]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

A strength of our study was that we used routinely collected dispensing data from a majority of community pharmacies in the Netherlands, enabling us to follow nearly 250,000 female users of guideline-recommended antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs over 5 years. In the Netherlands, all antibiotics for UTI treatment are only available through prescription, and 90% of patients visit the same pharmacy. Consequently, the medication was almost completely covered by the database. Another strength is that, although we lacked the reason for prescribing, uncomplicated UTI is the only indication for nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim in the electronic GP prescription module. However, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim may also be used for UTI prophylaxis at different dosages and durations. In our study, only dispensings for women with a guideline-recommended dosage and duration were counted as recurring dispensings. This approach also excluded slightly different dosage regimens for pregnant women and other risk groups, such as those with diabetes comorbidity.

A limitation in our study was that women were coded within the community pharmacies and could not be monitored for dispensing from another pharmacy. We included only those women who still had any dispensing within the same pharmacy at follow-up after 5 years, which led to the exclusion of almost half of all women with a first dispensing in 2012. The youngest and oldest age groups were relatively more present among those women who could not be followed until the end.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^1148qjMZ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, pregnancies and UTI diagnoses were identified based on diagnosis and procedure codes; LMP dates, delivery dates, and UTI diagnoses were not validated. Thus, misclassification could have occurred with respect to the length of gestation, type of infection, the occurrence or timing of UTIs, and dispensing of antibiotics. Some women might have also had concomitant infections, potentially affecting the type of antibiotic prescribed.

Second, pregnancies might not have been recognized by the provider or the patient at the time of UTI diagnosis and treatment. Third, these data did not allow identification of clinically appropriate nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment that was based on urine culture or antibiotic testing. Fourth, the MarketScan Commercial Database is a convenience sample and is not generalizable to the U.S. population. Finally, antibiotic prescriptions paid for out-of-pocket were not included.

CDC's analysis of a large insurance claims database demonstrated that, in 2014, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were common treatments for women with UTIs during their first trimester of pregnancy. Improving antibiotic selection is an important aspect of antibiotic stewardship, and these antibiotics have potential risks associated with early pregnancy use, particularly during organogenesis. Given the recommendations to avoid these medications in early pregnancy if possible and the fact that nearly 50% of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, it is important.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^114EP4of]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women, specifically with respect to the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend considering culture-directed parenteral antibiotic therapy. This should be administered for as short a duration as reasonable, generally no longer than 7 days, in patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics.

### Urinary tract infections and antibiotic use in pregnancy - qualitative analysis of online forum content [^112EseNn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the standard treatment for asymptomatic and symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pregnancy. Their overuse, however, can contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and expose the fetus to drugs that might affect its development. Preventative behaviors are currently the best option to reduce incidences of UTIs and to avoid the use of antibiotics during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore women's experiences of UTIs in pregnancy to develop an understanding of their concerns and to optimize and encourage behaviors that facilitate appropriate use of antibiotics.

- **Methods**: An online pregnancy forum in the United Kingdom (UK) was used to collect data on women's discussions of UTIs. A total of 202 individual threads generated by 675 different usernames were selected for analysis. The data was organized using NVivo 11® software and then analyzed qualitatively using inductive thematic analysis.

- **Results**: Women's perceptions of UTIs and antibiotic use in pregnancy were driven by their prenatal attachment to the fetus. UTIs were thought to be common and high risk during pregnancy, which meant that antibiotics were viewed as essential in the presence of suspected symptoms. The dominant view about antibiotics was that their use was safe and of little concern during pregnancy. Women reported an emotional reaction to developing a UTI. They coped by seeking information about behavior change strategies to assist with recovery and through emotional support from the online forum.

- **Conclusions**: Women face dual risks when they experience UTIs; the risk of antimicrobial resistance and the risk of exposing the fetus to potentially harmful drugs.

### Antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in non-pregnant women [^115XhX28]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common health care problem. Recurrent UTI (RUTI) in healthy non-pregnant women is defined as three or more episodes of UTI during a twelve-month period. Long-term antibiotics have been proposed as a prevention strategy for RUTI.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy (during and after) and safety of prophylactic antibiotics used to prevent uncomplicated RUTI in adult non-pregnant women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1966-April 2004), EMBASE (1980-January 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), and reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Any published randomized controlled trial where antibiotics were used as prophylactic therapy in RUTI.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and the results were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: Nineteen studies involving 1,120 women were eligible for inclusion. Antibiotic versus antibiotic (10 trials, 430 women): During active prophylaxis, the rate range of microbiological recurrence per patient-year (MRPY) was 0 to 0.9 person-year in the antibiotic group versus 0.8 to 3.6 with placebo. The RR of having one microbiological recurrence (MR) was 0.21 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.34), favoring antibiotics, and the NNT was 1.85. For clinical recurrences per year (CRPY), the RR was 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.28), and the NNT was 1.85. The RR of having one MR after prophylaxis was 0.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^112sRKie]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Due to antibiotic resistance and contraindications that sometimes limit the use of first-line agents, there is room for new options in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). For the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, the results of two phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3, were published in February 2024. These nearly identical trials tested gepotidacin, an oral, first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits DNA replication by binding two different topoisomerases at a binding site distinct from fluoroquinolones.

Gepotidacin was compared with nitrofurantoin by randomizing female patients over the age of 12 years with uncomplicated UTIs to receive one of the two drugs for five days. The primary outcome was therapeutic success, which was a combination of clinical and microbiologic resolution at day 10–13. Gepotidacin was noninferior to nitrofurantoin in terms of the primary outcome in EAGLE-2, while it was superior to nitrofurantoin in EAGLE-3. Notably, these differences were driven mostly by higher rates of microbiologic failure in the nitrofurantoin groups, as clinical success rates were relatively similar between the two arms.

Gepotidacin has been submitted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review, and a decision regarding its approval is expected in 2025.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^112SsJ43]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Procedures

For participants assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis, the drug used was chosen based on previous urine culture results and individuals' history of allergy or intolerance. The options were nitrofurantoin (50 or 100 mg), trimethoprim (100 mg), or cefalexin (250 mg), administered orally once daily. Methenamine hippurate was prescribed as a twice-daily oral dose (1 g). Participants were allowed to switch between antibiotic drugs or between treatment strategies; however, the need to adhere to the allocated intervention was emphasized. Participants experiencing symptomatic UTI episodes were advised to pursue discrete treatment courses of antibiotics in their usual way, typically via their general practitioner.

Follow-up assessments occurred every three months until month 18. At each visit, participants were asked about the occurrence of any UTIs, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Information on UTI episodes was verified, where necessary, from healthcare records. Blood samples were collected to monitor kidney and liver function in all participants. Urine samples were submitted to the central laboratory at baseline, at scheduled three-monthly visits, and at the time of UTI episodes. Optional perineal swabs were submitted at baseline and at six-monthly routine visits. Participants completed symptom questionnaires every three months and at the time of symptomatic UTIs.

### SPL drug information for ampicillin [^112XxHs3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ampicillin PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Ampicillin is classified in FDA pregnancy category B. Animal data reveal no teratogenic effects. While ampicillin should be used with caution in pregnancy, penicillins are usually considered safe during pregnancy when clearly needed. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and the benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. The drug ampicillin PO is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^112ph6V3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin, and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment of pregnant women are available. However, the estimate is similar to a previous report involving approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, and two-thirds (66.6%) reported receiving antibiotic treatment, which is similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

The estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the three months before the last menstrual period are similar to estimates from previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study that examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999 also supports these findings.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^115GwfrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that can result in significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combinations of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to determine, from the best available evidence from randomized control trials, which agent is most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. This is in terms of cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: All trials were considered where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Eight studies were included, recruiting a total of 905 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons, there were no significant differences between studied treatments with regard to cure rates, reinfection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^1144U2MN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms associated with a urinary infection and occurs in 2% to 15% of pregnancies. If left untreated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 4 November 2018, and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening. Trials using a cluster-RCT design and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, as were trials published in abstract or letter form, but cross-over studies were not.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 15 studies, involving over 2000 women. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment may reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: Population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance [^1137dSuK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) in pregnancy are a large and under-emphasized risk factor for pregnancy morbidity and adverse birth outcomes in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. UTI may present in pregnancy with symptoms of acute cystitis or pyelonephritis, or may be more insidious in women with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Screening and treatment for ASB by urine culture is recommended for all women at least once in early pregnancy in high-income countries, as advised by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Canadian Task Force on Preventive Care, and National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom (UK). In low-income countries, screening and treatment of UTI or ASB is challenging due to the costs and logistics of performing urine culture. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided context-specific antenatal care recommendations for screening and treatment of ASB in LMIC, suggesting urine culture in settings with capacity, or mid-stream urine Gram stain, and treatment of ASB.

There is a paucity of population-based data on the prevalence and etiology of UTI in pregnancy in low-middle income countries. A recent review indicated that the global prevalence of UTI and/or ASB in pregnancy ranged from 3% to 35% across five continents in countries with preterm birth rates greater than 10%. Women carry a higher risk of UTI than men, and pregnancy increases the risk of ascending infection due to the weight of the fetus and dilation of the ureters and renal pelvis. Before urine culture became the standard of care in the US during the 1960s, pyelonephritis was a significant concern.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^112mYXUQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

While antibiotics are vital in the eradication of UTIs, antimicrobial resistance due to their use is a global health threat. Antimicrobial resistance means that bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment and cause serious or life-threatening infections. The use of antibiotics is strongly associated with the increasing emergence of resistant bacteria and the subsequent redundancy of antibiotics, meaning previously effective antibiotics are losing their efficacy.

Unlike the general population, the choice of safe antibiotics in pregnancy is limited due to teratogenic potential. For example, quinolones should be avoided in pregnancy because of the risk of joint malformations in the fetus. Antibiotics becoming ineffective due to antimicrobial resistance is a particular concern in pregnancy, as it further limits the range of drugs available to treat infections safely. An example of this in practice is the replacement of trimethoprim with nitrofurantoin as the first-line antibiotic to treat UTIs due to an increase in resistance from its widespread use in the UK.

Use of antibiotics can also result in the carriage of resistant bacteria by individuals for several months to a year after completing a course of antibiotics. These resistant bacteria can transfer to close physical contacts and may colonize and infect subsequent hosts. This is especially concerning in pregnancy, as women can pass on resistant bacteria to the neonate during birth, a time when they are most vulnerable to infection. An example of resistance specific to obstetric practice is the increase in ampicillin-resistant strains.

### Prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors for urinary tract infections in pregnant women attending ANC in some integrated health centers in the Buea Health District [^116dbUHG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most frequent infections after respiratory tract infections that affect humans, with over 150 million cases per year. The anatomy of the female urinary tract predisposes them to UTIs more than men. Moreover, physiological and hormonal changes during pregnancy put pregnant women at risk of UTIs. Untreated UTIs in pregnancy can be detrimental to both the mother and child, causing preterm labor, low birth weight, and pyelonephritis. The situation is worrisome because the infection can be asymptomatic. This study investigated the prevalence and risk factors for UTIs, the diagnostic potential of dipstick analyses, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens from pregnant women attending ANC in some Integrated Health Centers (IHCs) in the Buea Health District (BHD).

- **Methods**: A structured questionnaire was administered to consenting pregnant women at participating IHCs to collect data on demographic characteristics, risk factors, and symptoms of UTI. Urine samples were collected for dipstick analysis and culture. Antibiograms were performed on the isolates using the disc diffusion method. A bivariate analysis was conducted to investigate the association of the risk factors with UTI. Chi-square (χ²) tests and odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to compare statistics and test for associations at a significant level of p ≤ 0.05.

- **Results**: Of the 287 participants recruited, 89 (31%) were positive for UTI. Among the 150 women with no symptoms, 43 (28.7%) tested positive for UTI. E. coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen.

### The relationship of prenatal antibiotic exposure and infant antibiotic administration with childhood allergies: A systematic review [^113DB7Cj]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The majority of studies examined or adjusted for other influential factors in the relationship between prenatal antibiotics usage and childhood asthma. Potential confounders generally considered were maternal and/or familial asthma, infant gender, maternal age, ethnicity, education, smoking during pregnancy, parity, and birth weight. Relevant potential confounders often not taken into account were delivery mode, maternal infections, breastfeeding, and postnatal child antibiotic usage.

- **Confounding by indication and by other factors**: Confounding by indication, such as by maternal respiratory infections, was addressed somewhat in four studies by additional examination of the types of antibiotics generally used for different infections, such as respiratory and urinary tract infections. Two studies found that antibiotics used to treat maternal respiratory infections had a stronger effect than antibiotics used to treat maternal urinary tract infections, although the effects of both types of antibiotics were still significant. Metsala et al. (2014) found the strongest association for antibiotics treating both respiratory diseases and urinary tract infections, but no significant effect for antibiotics only treating urinary tract infections. These studies suggested that there may have been at least some confounding by maternal respiratory tract infections. Stensballe et al. (2013) found the opposite result, with maternal antibiotics used to treat non-respiratory diseases having a significant and stronger effect than mothers using any types of antibiotics, suggesting a causal role of an.

### Safety and tolerability of pivmecillinam during more than four decades of clinical experience: A systematic review [^116Y6BbM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

In April 2024, pivmecillinam became the first antibiotic in approximately 20 years to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI). It has been used elsewhere — mainly in Europe and Canada — for over 40 years, and key guidelines recommend pivmecillinam as a first-line treatment for uUTIs. Pivmecillinam is an oral prodrug of mecillinam, an amidinopenicillin antibiotic that binds exclusively to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)-2 in enteric bacteria. Mecillinam acts synergistically with other beta-lactams that bind to PBP1a/PBP1b and/or PBP3 in gram-negative bacteria and, when used in combination, may also have the potential to constrain the evolution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. In Europe, oral pivmecillinam is also indicated for the treatment of salmonellosis and recommended in certain regions for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis; peak serum levels of mecillinam are reached approximately 1 hour post-dose and the serum half-life is 1.2 hours.

There is a need for new antibiotic options for uUTI in the United States. The rate of development and approval of new antibiotics has decreased steadily since the 1980s due to economic and regulatory obstacles. The proportion of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria is increasing in community and healthcare settings, such that the value of commonly used agents such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, and fluoroquinolones is being eroded. Treatment choices for uUTI are also influenced by safety considerations, including gastrointestinal concerns.

### Three versus five days of pivmecillinam for community-acquired uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial [^111oy7RC]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The study protocol was previously published. During the trial, several amendments were made: the study period was extended to 30 months due to slow participant accrual; and the control urine sample arrival timeframes were redefined. Participants were able to secure their first urine sample from 7 to 21 days and the second from 15 to 42 days post-inclusion, respectively. The study concluded in November 2017 when the study medication expired.

- **Study design and population**: This multicenter, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical phase IV trial was conducted from May 12, 2015, to November 30, 2017, at nine general practice clinics in Denmark. Females aged 18–70 years, presenting with symptoms of dysuria, frequency (pollakiuria), and/or urgency, were screened according to study criteria and invited to participate based on clinical symptoms. Follow-up ended one month after the last participant was included. Participants provided written consent before inclusion. Common symptoms of UTI (dysuria, frequency, or urgency) were assessed based on a validated questionnaire. Each symptom was scored from 0 to 3 (none, mild, moderate, or severe), requiring a cumulative score of ≥ 2 points for participation. The presence of these inclusion symptoms and absence of vaginal symptoms was estimated to have a 90% positive predictive value for uncomplicated UTI, with no clear diagnostic value for urine dipstick or culture. Exclusion criteria included allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics.

### Safety and outcomes of penicillin allergy evaluation in pregnant women [^113pcugG]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy in pregnancy is associated with increased morbidity and the use of less effective antibiotics. Penicillin allergy evaluation in pregnancy is now recommended as per obstetrical guidelines but remains infrequent.

- **Objective**: We studied pregnant women who underwent penicillin allergy evaluation in an allergy clinic to assess the effectiveness and safety of penicillin skin testing (PST) and incremental drug challenge (IDC) in pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Index drug reactions, PST, and IDC results were reviewed. Antibiotic use, pregnancy outcomes, and pregnancy complications were compared with a control cohort of pregnant women with penicillin allergy who did not undergo allergy evaluation before delivery.

- **Results**: Penicillin allergy was evaluated in 136 women. Culprit drugs included penicillin (37%), amoxicillin (30%), and unknown (20%). Index reactions occurred more than 5 years ago in 91%, and these reactions were cutaneous or unknown in 92%. Of the 133 patients who underwent skin testing, 131 (99%) had negative or equivocal results and proceeded to incremental challenge. All 131 women passed penicillin IDC. Of the 69 women who ultimately used intrapartum beta-lactam antibiotics, all but one patient tolerated them. Women who underwent penicillin allergy evaluation did not have an increased risk of cesarean delivery or other pregnancy complications when compared to women without penicillin allergy evaluation.

- **Conclusion**: PST and IDC can be safely conducted in pregnant women. When evaluated as low risk, most women tolerate IDC and can receive penicillin.

### Antibiotic choice for group B streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws (deviation from routine clinical care) compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with a documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin, unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis.

Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines. There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin-allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice, and impact on newborn infants born to GBS positive mothers.

Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic. As such, in August 2019 (notably after our study data was collected), the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact on neonates.

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^112uqGPw]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in about 8% of pregnant women, and untreated UTIs can have serious consequences, including pyelonephritis, preterm labor, low birth weight, and sepsis. Pregnant women are typically screened for UTIs during early pregnancy, and those with bacteriuria are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic stewardship is critical to improving patient safety and combating antibiotic resistance. Because of the potential risk for birth defects, including anencephaly, heart defects, and orofacial clefts associated with the use of sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin during pregnancy, a 2011 committee opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed in the first trimester of pregnancy only when other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate.

To assess the effects of these recommendations, the CDC analyzed the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database to examine antibiotic prescriptions filled by pregnant women with UTIs. Among 482,917 pregnancies in 2014, 7.2% of women had an outpatient UTI diagnosis during the 90 days before the date of the last menstrual period (LMP) or during pregnancy. Among pregnant women with UTIs, the most frequently prescribed antibiotics during the first trimester were nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, cephalexin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Given the potential risks associated with the use of some of these antibiotics in early pregnancy and the potential for unrecognized pregnancy, women's health care providers should exercise caution.

### Comparison of single-dose and multiple-dose antibiotics for lower urinary tract infection in pregnancy [^112YwALJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy of fosfomycin trometamol, cefuroxime axetil, and amoxicillin clavulanate antibiotics, and to assess the difference in patient compliance, in the treatment of urinary tract infections during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Between September 2007 and May 2008, 90 out of 324 pregnant women with complaints of lower urinary tract infection, who were followed at the outpatient clinic or referred to the emergency department of Vakif Gureba Education and Research Hospital, were enrolled in a prospective study. Patients were randomized into three equal groups for treatment with single-dose fosfomycin trometamol, or 5-day courses of amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. After follow-up, study data were obtained for 28, 27, and 29 patients, respectively.

- **Results**: The treatment groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographics, clinical success rate, microbiological cure rate, or adverse effects. Significantly higher drug compliance was observed in the fosfomycin trometamol group than in the other two groups (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with a single dose of fosfomycin trometamol was as effective for UTI as the standard course of treatment with amoxicillin clavulanate or cefuroxime axetil. Fosfomycin trometamol may be a preferable treatment for UTI because of its simpler use and better rates of compliance.

### Single-dose antibiotic therapy for urinary infections during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112eW7ZK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

During pregnancy, urinary infections are an important cause of maternofetal morbidity and mortality and may lead to several complications.

- **Objective**: To verify whether the use of antibiotic therapy in a single dose, when compared with multiple doses in lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy, is effective in obtaining microbiologic cure.

- **Search strategy**: Online databases were searched. Keywords used were "single-drug dose", "antibiotic", "fosfomycin", "amoxicillin", "trimethoprim", "pregnancy", and "urinary tract infection".

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials, the population was pregnant women, microbiologic cure was attained, and one of the treatment groups received single-dose antibiotic therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Preselected studies have been independently read by pairs, and data were extracted according to a predetermined sheet. The Cochrane tool was used for the risk of bias.

- **Main results**: A total of 1063 women from nine studies were included. The primary outcome was the microbiologic cure attested by urine culture. When compared with the multiple-day use of antibiotics, the single-dose treatment has shown statistically similar results in reaching culture cure (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.73–1.44).

- **Conclusion**: The study has shown that the use of single-dose treatment for lower tract urinary infections during pregnancy can be recommended, especially using fosfomycin.

- **Systematic review registration**: This review has not been registered.

### Diagnostic and treatment difficulties of pyelonephritis in pregnancy in resource-limited settings [^116dkvj7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

As expected, E. coli was the most commonly isolated urinary pathogen, accounting for 87.5% of acute pyelonephritis and confirming similar rates from previous reports in pregnancy. Ampicillin, previously the drug of choice for E. coli antepartum pyelonephritis due to its efficacy, cost, and safety for the mother and fetus, has been rendered ineffective by global resistance. With a rate of ampicillin susceptibility for E. coli of only 14% on the Thai–Burmese border, it is considered an unacceptable choice for febrile urinary tract infections (UTI) in pregnancy. Similar low rates of susceptibility to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid have been reported across most of Europe and the United States.

The low rates of susceptibility to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, contrasted with high rates of susceptibility to ceftriaxone, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin in this study, likely result from antimicrobial prescribing patterns in the camp, which have been unchanged for 20 years. Since 1986, the refugee camps on the Thai–Burma border have employed oral ampicillin or amoxicillin for outpatient UTIs and intravenous ampicillin with gentamicin for hospitalized patients. The latest guidelines include revisions in recommended regimens for urinary tract pathogens, founded primarily on the evidence presented here.

More than 10 years ago, Biedenbach and colleagues reported high antimicrobial resistance in Thailand among commonly encountered pathogens, with an ESBL production rate of 15.7% for E. coli and 45.6% for K. pneumoniae.

### Urinary tract infections and antibiotic use in pregnancy - qualitative analysis of online forum content [^114ijrZ5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

A few women expressed reluctance and questioned the use of antibiotics in pregnancy for the treatment of UTIs. The reasons varied from concerns about teratogenicity, effects on long-term immunity, or personally experiencing antibiotic side effects. For example, Liza was fearful about the effects on the fetus, stating, "I'm petrified that taking amoxicillin will harm baby". Another website user was concerned about longer-term effects such as the development of allergies in the child.

One participant commented, "Personally, I would be wary of it because there is a link between taking antibiotics in late-stage pregnancy and the baby having eczema and allergies. I took antibiotics in late pregnancy, and my daughter has multiple food allergies and eczema" (Tania).

In spite of these concerns, which were expressed by only a small proportion of women, most considered antibiotics to be generally safe. As one participant noted, "Antibiotics are one of the few things they are really sure about giving to pregnant women, precisely because we get infections" (Tula).

The majority of women compared the risks of a UTI with the risks of using antibiotics and viewed antibiotics as the safest option for normal progression of their pregnancy. They drew on their personal experiences of using antibiotics or viewed a prescription as proof that antibiotics were not dangerous. As Carey suggested, "Doc wouldn't prescribe if dangerous. It's more dangerous to leave a UTI, as at its worst it can cause kidney issues and miscarriage". This view also meant that some women thought that it was better to take antibiotics "just in case".

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^111SzC4K]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Balancing drug allergy with antibiotic stewardship presents a challenging dynamic for obstetricians. Antibiotics are administered to 30–74% of women during pregnancy for a wide variety of indications. The most commonly used antibiotics include penicillin and other beta-lactams, clindamycin and other macrolides, and aminoglycosides.

Pregnant women with a self-reported penicillin allergy typically receive alternative antibiotics that are broader spectrum, such as cefazolin, clindamycin, and vancomycin, which increases the risk for antibiotic resistance and maternal morbidity. In the general population, self-reported penicillin allergy occurs in 10% of patients; however, when tested, fewer than 2% have a proven (or true) allergic reaction. Penicillin allergy also decreases over time, with up to 80% of patients with a confirmed penicillin allergy losing sensitization 10 years later.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology encourages the consideration of allergy testing in women who self-report a penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergy can be confirmed through skin testing, but there are limited data to inform allergy testing in pregnancy. Two studies using skin testing with 27 and 56 pregnant women reported that only 3% and 7% of women, respectively, had a true penicillin allergy, and none experienced anaphylaxis. Neither of these studies in pregnant women included a graded oral challenge, which is important because oral drug challenge is the gold standard for determining true drug allergy.

Our aim was to estimate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of outpatient penicillin allergy testing in this population.

### Antibiotic choice for Group B streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114o89TR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy data were collected through EMR query via the Northwestern University Electronic Data Warehouse, combined with manual chart review and pharmacy antibiotic medication administration records. The exposure of interest was a maternal penicillin allergy documented at the time of admission during their delivery hospitalization encounter. It is standard institutional procedure that a patient's allergy history is obtained, reviewed, and documented in the electronic medical chart at the time of admission for delivery hospitalization.

Individuals were considered to have a documented penicillin allergy if they reported an allergy to any penicillin-class drug, including penicillin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin, dicloxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, or piperacillin-tazobactam. Details and severity of historic allergic reactions were not reliably documented in the medical record. It is notable that during the study period, it was rare for patients to undergo formal penicillin allergy verification testing during pregnancy at our institution, making it unlikely that the documented penicillin allergy was confirmed to be a true allergy in most cases.

Demographic and clinical data collected included maternal age, race and ethnicity, parity, and gestational age at delivery. The presence of a documented maternal cephalosporin allergy was also collected. Patients were considered to have a documented cephalosporin allergy if there was a documented allergy to any generation of cephalosporin available in the records.

### Urinary tract infections and antibiotic use in pregnancy - qualitative analysis of online forum content [^111iwEA9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Pregnancy can increase the susceptibility of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women because of physiological changes. The vast majority of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK are for UTIs, which suggests a high prevalence. Evidence from studies shows that asymptomatic infection alone can affect 2–12% of women. The management of UTIs in pregnancy involves a short course of antibiotics, whether or not the infection is symptomatic. Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is diagnosed and treated through routine screening during the first trimester, which contrasts with non-pregnant women where asymptomatic infections are not treated with antibiotics. ASB is treated in pregnancy because studies have shown that bacterial colonization of the urinary tract in pregnancy can cause adverse health outcomes, such as risks of kidney infection, intra-uterine growth retardation, and pre-term birth. However, the authors of a recent randomized control trial have questioned the benefit of routine screening for ASB in the first trimester of pregnancy. Kazemier et al. (2015) found no association between ASB and growth retardation or pre-term birth, and although an association was observed between ASB and kidney infection, the absolute risk was found to be low.

Excessive and unnecessary use of antibiotics is strongly associated with a rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is the ability of bacteria to survive in spite of antibiotic treatment, leading to life-threatening infections. There is evidence from the UK and internationally which indicates similar patterns.

### Bicillin L-A [^1146ZB3D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing Bicillin L-A in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Care should be taken to avoid intravenous or intra-arterial administration, or injection into or near major peripheral nerves or blood vessels, since such injection may produce neurovascular damage. Prolonged use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken. Bicillin L-A contains approximately 0.11 mEq of sodium per 600,000 units of penicillin G (approximately 2.59 mg of sodium per 600,000 units of penicillin G).

- **Information for patients**: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Bicillin L-A, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold).

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy in a rural population of Bangladesh: Population-based prevalence, risk factors, etiology, and antibiotic resistance [^117UC6Z2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

The MIST treatment algorithm for positive urine cultures is shown in an additional file as Figure S1. UTI was treated in pregnant women with high burden growth (> 10⁵ CFU/mL of a uro-pathogen) and among women with intermediate growth who had UTI symptoms, as per ACOG recommendations. From January to October 2012, the first-line antibiotic treatment was cefixime 400 mg orally once daily for 3 days. After observing that only two-thirds of E. coli were susceptible to cefixime, the first-line treatment was then changed to nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. All symptomatic women were also referred to the sub-district hospital for further evaluation and management.

A test of cure was obtained one week after antibiotic completion for all pregnant women with positive cultures. If the second urine culture remained positive, the supervising field physician prescribed an antibiotic based on the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern. Persistent UTI after twice-repeated treatment was referred to Sylhet Osmani Medical College Hospital for further evaluation and management.

- **Data analysis**: Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the distribution of uro-pathogens and antibiotic sensitivity patterns. For the risk factor analysis, the primary outcome was UTI requiring antibiotic treatment, as defined in a referenced table. We included a number of socio-demographic characteristics, nutrition, behavior, and reproductive history variables as potential risk factors. Socio-demographic characteristics included household wealth, household size, religion, and woman's age.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: A 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^1132XuuX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A panel of international experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^113UXyyY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK. Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to UTIs because of physiological changes. The growing uterus can result in urinary retention, predisposing the woman to infection. In addition, hormonal fluctuations relax the ureteral muscle and cause accumulation of urine in the bladder, which also increases the chance of developing a UTI.

Treatment of UTIs is recommended in pregnancy if bacteria are detected in the urine, even if there are no accompanying symptoms, i.e. in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). Both ASB and symptomatic UTIs in pregnancy are risk factors for the development of pyelonephritis, which can result in severe maternal morbidity. It is estimated that 20–30% of women with bacteriuria in the first trimester go on to develop pyelonephritis in later trimesters. Therefore, although ASB on its own is not treated in the general population, guidelines published by the European Urological Association (EAU) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommend screening and treating bacteriuria with or without symptoms. The management strategy according to these guidelines is to use a short course of antibiotics.

### One-day compared with 7-day nitrofurantoin for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy: A randomized controlled trial [^114uJR9k]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). High credibility.

To evaluate whether a 1-day nitrofurantoin regimen is as effective as a 7-day regimen in eradicating asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial was conducted in antenatal clinics in Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Argentina. Pregnant women seeking antenatal care between March 2004 and March 2007 who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. Those who consented were randomly allocated to receive either a 1-day or a 7-day course of 100 mg capsules of nitrofurantoin, which was taken twice daily. The primary outcome was bacteriologic cure on day 14 of treatment.

A total of 1,248 out of 24,430 eligible women had asymptomatic bacteriuria, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.1%. Of these 1,248 women, 778 were successfully recruited. 386 women were randomly allocated to the 1-day regimen, and 392 to the 7-day regimen. Escherichia coli was the most common potentially pathogenic bacteria detected, with its prevalence approaching 50%. Bacteriologic cure rates at treatment day 14 were 75.7% for the 1-day regimen and 86.2% for the 7-day regimen. The cure rate difference was -10.5% (95% confidence interval: -16.1% to -4.9%). Mean birth weight and mean gestational age at delivery were significantly lower in the 1-day regimen group. Although there were fewer adverse effects in the 1-day regimen group, the differences were not statistically significant.

A 1-day regimen of nitrofurantoin is significantly less effective than a 7-day regimen in achieving bacteriologic cure for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy.

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection? — results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^114oECXX]. BMC Medicine (2010). High credibility.

- **Methods - Study design and population**: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled equivalence trial, conducted between July 2007 and April 2008. Twenty-nine of 169 (18%) invited general practitioners (GPs) in Lower Saxony, Germany, agreed to screen and enroll eligible patients for a six-month period. All adult women (> 18 years) suspected to have uncomplicated UTI due to typical symptoms (dysuria and/or frequency) and not having any exclusion criteria were asked for informed consent to be enrolled successively.

Exclusion criteria were comparable with other UTI trials and included: any signs indicating complicated UTI (e.g. fever, back pain); any conditions that may lead to complicated infections (e.g. pregnancy, diabetes, renal diseases, urinary tract abnormalities or past urinary surgery, urine catheterization, immunosuppressive therapy, other serious diseases, cancer); UTI within the last two weeks; use of antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; history of gastrointestinal ulcers; epilepsy; allergies or other contraindications for trial drugs; participation in other clinical trials; inability to understand the trial information or to give informed consent. Dipstick results were not required for inclusion.

### Prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and associated risk factors for urinary tract infections in pregnant women attending ANC in some integrated health centers in the Buea Health District [^114wYaAg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most frequent infections after respiratory tract infections, affecting over 150 million people annually. The anatomy of the female urinary tract predisposes women to UTIs more than men. Moreover, physiological and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase the risk of UTIs in pregnant women. Untreated UTIs during pregnancy can be detrimental to both the mother and child, causing preterm labor, low birth weight, and pyelonephritis. The situation is concerning because the infection can be asymptomatic. This study investigated the prevalence and risk factors for UTIs, the diagnostic potential of dipstick analyses, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens in pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) in some integrated health centers (IHCs) in the Buea Health District (BHD).

- **Methods**: A structured questionnaire was administered to consenting pregnant women at participating IHCs to collect data on demographic characteristics, risk factors, and symptoms of UTIs. Urine samples were collected for dipstick analysis and culture. Antibiograms were performed on the isolates using the disc diffusion method. A bivariate analysis was conducted to investigate the association of the risk factors with UTIs. The chi-square (χ²) test and odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to compare statistics and test for associations at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05.

- **Results**: Of the 287 participants recruited, 89 (31%) tested positive for UTIs. Among the 150 women with no symptoms, 43 (28.7%) were positive for UTIs. Escherichia coli was the most frequent uropathogen identified.

### Amoxicillin [^112MhCtR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Use in specific populations**: Modify dose in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (≤ 3 months).

- **Pregnancy**: Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

- **Labor and delivery**: Oral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether the use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.

- **Nursing mothers**: Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of amoxicillin capsules should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (≤ 3 months) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Geriatric use**: An analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin capsules was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects.

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^111HVDs8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Consequently, inpatients reporting penicillin allergies often receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

- **Objective**: To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergies.

- **Methods**: A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergies. The guideline employed a standard 2-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

- **Results**: Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after the guideline implementation compared to before (median 14.5, interquartile range 13–16.25, vs 2, interquartile range 1–3.25, P < .5) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses decreased alternative antimicrobial therapy after the test dose. This included reductions in the use of vancomycin (68.3% vs 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs 1.1%, P = 0.004), and fluoroquinolones (15.3% vs 3.3%, P < .001).

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^115FCJ4a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women, particularly pregnant patients, the ACOG 2023 guidelines highlight insufficient evidence to guide management following an rUTI in pregnancy. It is recommended to consider initiating antimicrobial urinary suppression for the remainder of the pregnancy after treating an acute infection, preferably using a lower single daily dose of an antibacterial drug to which the isolated bacterium was susceptible.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^112bGYXM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The potential benefits of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women with a suspected allergy include adherence to guideline-directed antibiotic therapy in the setting of group B streptococcus prophylaxis or cesarean delivery infection prophylaxis and a reduction in exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Penicillin allergy testing to document those who truly require alternative treatments supports antibiotic stewardship to mitigate emerging drug resistance. Penicillin allergy testing should ideally occur preconception or at the time of the initial allergy reaction. Obstetricians can also use preconception encounters as well as postpartum visits to counsel women regarding the benefits of penicillin allergy testing.

Recent publications, as well as the latest Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, advocate for the consideration of penicillin allergy testing in pregnancy. Given the low incidence of anaphylaxis, this study highlights the ability to perform allergy testing in the outpatient setting. In light of the potential to improve antibiotic stewardship and the demonstrated acceptability and feasibility of testing, women with a reported penicillin allergy can undergo allergy testing in pregnancy.
