## Question

A 28-year-old woman has just delivered a healthy baby vaginally at term. Thirty minutes after delivery, she develops heavy vaginal bleeding. Her uterus is palpably soft and enlarged. Initial management includes uterine massage and administration of oxytocin, followed by additional uterotonics (misoprostol and ergometrine), but the bleeding persists. The attending team performs a rapid assessment and finds no evidence of vaginal or cervical lacerations. Bedside ultrasound does not show retained products of conception, and there are no signs of uterine rupture. Blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg and pulse is 120 bpm.

According to FIGO guidelines, what is the next recommended intervention to improve survival in this patient, and what key steps must be taken before proceeding?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next recommended intervention to improve survival in a patient with refractory postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony, and what key steps must be taken before proceeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding other causes of bleeding. Then, I should verify whether first-line uterotonics and tranexamic acid have been given appropriately. Next, I will consider temporizing mechanical measures while preparing for definitive therapy. After that, I need to decide between uterine balloon tamponade and surgical options, aligning with FIGO and WHO guidance. Finally, I should outline pre-procedure checks, team activation, and contingency planning, including when to escalate to hysterectomy if tamponade fails [^77ccc44d] [^8e4cf259] [^a0cbcd73].

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and etiology. The patient has heavy vaginal bleeding 30 minutes after vaginal delivery with a soft, enlarged uterus and hemodynamic instability, which strongly suggests uterine atony as the cause, accounting for roughly 70–80% of postpartum hemorrhage, and the absence of lacerations or retained products supports this diagnosis [^a86bcfd7] [^a9e16f41]. I should double-check that retained placenta and uterine rupture have been reasonably excluded, because those would change management; ultrasound reportedly shows no retained products and there are no signs of rupture, which aligns with proceeding for atony-directed therapy [^8e4cf259].

> Wait, let me verify that first-line medical therapy has been optimized. FIGO recommends IV oxytocin as first-line uterotonic, with escalation to additional agents such as IM ergometrine or misoprostol if bleeding persists; however, repeated doses of misoprostol after prior prophylaxis carry uncertain safety, so I need to be cautious about cumulative dosing and consider alternatives if already given [^a3bba557] [^d0900f57] [^f1938e10]. I should confirm whether tranexamic acid has been administered, because early TXA within 3 hours of birth reduces death due to bleeding; if not, I should give 1 g IV over 10 minutes now and repeat once if bleeding continues or restarts within 24 hours [^3fd73f21] [^d3e0750c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery yet. Before definitive operative steps, FIGO advises temporizing mechanical measures for atony, including bimanual uterine compression and external aortic compression, which can reduce bleeding while preparing for definitive therapy; I should ensure these are being done now [^7b8566f8] [^3fd73f21]. I also need to ensure aggressive resuscitation is underway: two large-bore IV lines, isotonic crystalloids, oxygen, continuous vital sign monitoring, and early blood product preparation, because coagulopathy and shock compound mortality in refractory PPH [^3a1138fd] [^f2b04736].

> Next, I should review the recommended definitive next step. FIGO explicitly recommends uterine balloon tamponade to improve survival in refractory PPH due to uterine atony after ruling out retained products and rupture, and WHO endorses UBT when first-line uterotonics and TXA fail, provided trained personnel and rapid surgical backup are available; success rates around 85–95% are reported, with near-100% survival when placed before advanced shock, so I should proceed with UBT now [^8e4cf259] [^a0cbcd73] [^e4302d85]. Let me consider alternatives briefly: uterine artery embolization is effective but requires interventional radiology and is not immediately available in many settings, and surgical compression sutures or hysterectomy are appropriate if tamponade fails or is unavailable, so UBT remains the next best step here [^c0af4a09] [^77ccc44d].

> I need to ensure key steps are completed before inserting the balloon. First, I should confirm exclusion of retained placental tissue and uterine rupture, because tamponade will not address those etiologies and may worsen outcomes if the cause is missed; ultrasound has already helped here, but I should double-check the placenta and cavity manually if needed [^8e4cf259]. Second, I should empty the bladder to improve visualization and uterine position. Third, I should activate the hemorrhage team, call anesthesia, and ensure blood products are being typed and crossed, because tamponade buys time but does not replace definitive hemorrhage control and resuscitation [^b6c50a0d]. Finally, I should verify that the operator is trained in UBT placement to minimize misplacement and complications, as emphasized by WHO [^a0cbcd73].

> Let me think about the procedure itself and immediate follow-up. I should insert the balloon per manufacturer instructions, typically transcervically into the uterine cavity, and inflate with sterile fluid until bleeding slows or a predetermined volume is reached, while monitoring for tolerance and displacement; if bleeding does not abate after correct placement, I should reassess for alternative sources or coagulopathy and be ready to escalate surgically [^e4302d85]. I should confirm placement with ultrasound if available and maintain close observation of vital signs and pad saturation; if bleeding persists beyond about 30–60 minutes or the patient deteriorates, I should proceed to surgical options such as compression sutures, uterine artery ligation, or hysterectomy, recognizing that early escalation improves survival in refractory cases [^77ccc44d] [^b9e17c01].

> But wait, what if tamponade is not available or fails? In that scenario, I should escalate promptly to surgical management, starting with less invasive options like compression sutures (e.g. B-Lynch) if the team is skilled, and moving to uterine artery ligation or internal iliac artery ligation if needed; hysterectomy is the definitive life-saving intervention if all else fails and should not be delayed once the patient is unstable or coagulopathy emerges [^77ccc44d] [^4a0cbf8e] [^923b5d65]. I should double-check that the team is prepared for massive transfusion and damage-control principles, because delays in operative control and transfusion are major contributors to mortality in PPH [^b6c50a0d].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis of refractory atonic PPH, ensure uterotonics and tranexamic acid have been given, apply temporizing compressive measures, and proceed to uterine balloon tamponade as the next recommended intervention to improve survival, having excluded retained products and rupture and ensured appropriate resuscitation and team activation; if tamponade is unavailable or fails, I should escalate without delay to surgical control, including hysterectomy when indicated [^8e4cf259] [^a0cbcd73] [^77ccc44d].

---

The next recommended intervention is **uterine balloon tamponade** [^8e4cf259] to control bleeding from uterine atony, as it is the first-line mechanical therapy when uterotonics fail and no retained products or rupture are present [^a0cbcd73]. Before proceeding, **exclude retained placenta and uterine rupture** [^8e4cf259] with ultrasound and clinical assessment, ensure two large-bore IV lines are in place, and activate the hemorrhage team. If balloon tamponade is unavailable or fails, escalate to **compression sutures or hysterectomy** [^77ccc44d] without delay.

---

## Indications for uterine balloon tamponade

Uterine balloon tamponade is indicated for **refractory PPH due to uterine atony** [^8e4cf259] when uterotonics fail and other causes have been excluded. FIGO recommends UBT as an effective, nonsurgical intervention that can improve survival in this setting [^8e4cf259].

---

## Prerequisites before proceeding with uterine balloon tamponade

Before inserting a uterine balloon tamponade device, the following steps must be taken:

- **Exclude retained products of conception**: Perform bedside ultrasound to confirm no retained placental tissue [^8e4cf259].

- **Exclude uterine rupture**: Clinical assessment and ultrasound to rule out uterine rupture [^8e4cf259].

- **Establish adequate intravenous access**: Ensure two large-bore IV lines for fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion [^b6c50a0d].

- **Activate the hemorrhage team**: Mobilize a multidisciplinary team including obstetrics, anesthesia, nursing, and blood bank [^3a1138fd].

- **Prepare for escalation**: Ensure readiness for surgical interventions if balloon tamponade fails [^a0cbcd73].

---

## Procedure for uterine balloon tamponade

The procedure involves the following steps:

- **Device selection**: Use a commercially available balloon device (e.g. Bakri balloon) or a condom catheter if unavailable [^e4302d85].

- **Insertion**: Insert the balloon into the uterine cavity, ensuring it is positioned correctly [^e4302d85].

- **Inflation**: Inflate the balloon with sterile saline until bleeding ceases, typically 250–500 mL, but adjust based on uterine size and response [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor vital signs, bleeding, and uterine tone [^a0cbcd73].

- **Removal**: Deflate and remove the balloon after 12–24 hours, typically once bleeding has been controlled for several hours [^notfound].

---

## Alternative interventions if balloon tamponade is unavailable or fails

If uterine balloon tamponade is unavailable or fails to control bleeding, **escalate to surgical interventions**:

- **Uterine compression sutures**: B-Lynch or similar techniques [^4a0cbf8e].

- **Uterine artery ligation**: Rapid control of bleeding [^4a0cbf8e].

- **Hysterectomy**: Definitive treatment for refractory PPH [^77ccc44d].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Prerequisites** |
|-|-|-|
| Uterine balloon tamponade | Refractory PPH due to uterine atony after failed uterotonics | - Exclude retained products <br/> - Exclude uterine rupture <br/> - Adequate IV access <br/> - Activate hemorrhage team |
| Compression sutures or hysterectomy | Failure of balloon tamponade or unavailability | - Immediate surgical readiness <br/> - Multidisciplinary team |

---

Uterine balloon tamponade is the **next recommended intervention** for refractory PPH due to uterine atony after failed uterotonics, provided retained products and uterine rupture are excluded and appropriate resuscitation measures are in place [^8e4cf259]. If tamponade fails, escalate promptly to surgical options to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality [^77ccc44d].

5 GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF PPH

WHO and other global organizations have updated and published several evidence‐informed recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH.

Giouleka et al.published a descriptive review of guidelines on PPH evaluation from the following bodies: the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada; the Network for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Hemostasis and Thrombosis (in collaboration with FIGO); the European Board and College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology; the European Society of Anaesthesiology; and WHO.

Establishing evidence‐based guidelines, particularly those adapted to LMICs, will be beneficial. Despite intense efforts to implement these recommendations, PPH remains the leading cause of maternal complications and death worldwide.

Gallos et al.identified several key challenges contributing to this failure: PPH is often undetected or detected too late, interventions are used inconsistently or delayed, and overall implementation is poor. In a large, randomized trial of prophylaxis for PPH, only 53% of the participants who developed PPH were diagnosed and treated with a uterotonic drug.

In many institutions worldwide, blood loss at birth is assessed visually — a method widely recognized as inaccurate and prone to underestimating blood loss.PPH is a time‐critical condition, and delays in the use of lifesaving interventions can lead to death or severe morbidity.

The first steps have been taken to address the challenges mentioned earlier. A modified Delphi‐based international expert consensus on strategies for optimizing early detection and obstetric first response management of PPH at cesarean birth was published in 2024. The key points from the expert consensus should be integrated into all recommendations:
The definition of PPH is the same regardless of the mode of delivery;
"Quantitative blood loss measurement, complemented by monitoring the woman's hemodynamic status", is the first intervention in early detection of PPH;
The first response when PPH is diagnosed (defined as blood loss of at least 500 mL with continued bleeding or clinical signs of hemodynamic instability, whichever occurs first) is the "immediate administration of uterotonics and tranexamic acid for the first response following the cause‐specific responses".

Clinical Question What is the most effective medical therapy for preventing postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery. Evidence-Based Answer. Oxytocin plus misoprostol is more effective than oxytocin alone in reducing postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery. However, this combination causes more nausea and vomiting than oxytocin alone. Patients delivered by vaginal birth or cesarean section. The medication was administered prophylactically by a systemic route: sublingually, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, rectally, orally, via intravenous bolus, or intravenous infusion; the timing of administration varied. These interventions were compared with other uterotonics, placebo, or no treatment.

A subsequent multicenter randomized trial in England compared the effectiveness of intramuscular oxytocin, carbetocin, and Syntometrine in the prevention of primary postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery. 2 Researchers enrolled 5, 929 normotensive pregnant women older than 18 years who were beyond 24 weeks' gestation with a singleton pregnancy and were in early labor from six maternity units across England. Patients were randomized to 10 IU of oxytocin, 100 mcg of carbetocin, or 5 IU per 500 mcg of Syntometrine, all administered intramuscularly after placental expulsion. 3 Researchers randomized patients to receive carbetocin, 100 mcg intramuscularly, or oxytocin, 10 IU intramuscularly, immediately after delivery of the infant. The two primary outcomes were the rate of blood loss of at least 500 mL or the need for additional uterotonic agents and a rate of blood loss of at least 1, 000 mL.

Recommendations From Others In 2012, the World Health Organization advised using uterotonics in the third stage of labor to prevent postpartum hemorrhage and specifically recommended oxytocin, 10 IU administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 5 In 2017, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that all obstetric care facilities have guidelines for the routine use of uterotonics, noting that oxytocin is "the most effective medication with the fewest adverse effects.

6 REVIEW OF GUIDELINES AROUND THE WORLD

Guidelines are defined as systematically developed statements that assist practitioners to take decisions about appropriate health care in specific clinical circumstances. Over the past decades, many national and international PPH guidelines have been developed and become part of obstetric clinical practice around the world. PPH guidelines usually address similar topics (e.g. diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PPH) but may differ in their recommendations. These differences are because most of the recommendations are based on observational studies, clinical judgment, and expert opinion. There are few randomized controlled trials available to produce strong recommendations for the management of PPH due to the emergency of the condition that hinders this type of study. In the absence of randomized trials, guidelines gather the best available evidence. In addition, population characteristics, cultural aspects, resources availability, as well as frequency and timing of updates may influence the guidelines' contents and justify some disparities.

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) is actively contributing to the global effort to reduce maternal death and disability around the world. Its mission statement reflects a commitment to promoting health, human rights, and well‐being of all women, especially those at the most significant risk of death and disability associated with childbearing. FIGO provides evidence‐based interventions that can reduce the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality when applied with informed consent.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) continues to be the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in most countries around the world. Despite multiple collaborative efforts at all levels, there is still a lack of implementation or adherence to the recommendations for management of PPH when faced with this obstetric emergency. In part, this delay in implementation lies in the lack of information from current evidence and a lack of unification of the multiple guidelines for diagnosis and strategies to control bleeding. To provide clear and practical tools to approach this obstetric emergency, especially for low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), the FIGO Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee (SMNH), supported by a group of experts worldwide, developed this updated review. It aims to provide multiple alternatives for the diagnosis and management of PPH tailored to the resources available at the institutional, local, or regional level. This document reflects the best available evidence, drawn from scientific literature and expert opinion, on the prevention and treatment of PPH in low‐resource settings. FIGO believes that the greatest impediment in the adoption of a given strategy is the absence of an effective implementation tool.

6.2 Guidelines that address the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage

PPH guidelines frequently recommend a multidisciplinary approach for reaching effective early control of bleeding. Treatment should be directed to the specific cause of PPH (uterine atony, genital trauma, retained placenta, and/or coagulopathy) and therapeutic steps should move from the less invasive method to the more complex and radical approach. A set of initial measures also seems to be consensual in most guidelines and consist of maintenance of two large IV lines, supplementation of oxygen, strict monitoring of women, crystalloids infusion, and measures to avoid hypothermia and evaluate the PPH cause.,

If atony is the etiology, most guidelines suggest performing temporary mechanical measures, such as uterine massage or uterine bimanual compression, with concurrent pharmacological treatment. Uterotonics are considered the first‐line treatment for uterine atony. Intravenous oxytocin is usually the preferred drug and route of administration, but its dosage varies widely. When oxytocin fails to control PPH, guidelines recommend the use of an additional drug, such as ergot alkaloids, injectable prostaglandins, or misoprostol. SOGC mentions carbetocin as a uterotonic available for treatment, and the German/Austrian/Swiss guidelines highlight that the use of carbetocin to treat PPH is currently not sufficiently investigated(Table 6).

TABLE 6
Summary of pharmacological treatment from high‐quality guidelines around the world

Since publication of the World Maternal Antifibrolytic (WOMAN) trial, tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug, has been incorporated into PPH guidelines around the world. WHO has updated this topic and recommends the use of TXA, as soon as possible, within the first 3 h from birth, at a dose of 1 g intravenously, regardless of the route of birth. However, some guidelines do not cite itor do not add it in a definitive manner because their last update occurred before the WOMAN trial results. Another drug that has been discussed in many guidelines is recombinant activated factor VII for massive PPH; however, there is no consensus about its use.

3 BACKGROUND

3.1 Introduction

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is an obstetric emergency complicating 1%–10% of all deliveries. It continues to be the leading obstetric cause of maternal death. In 2015, it was reported to be responsible for more than 80 000 maternal deaths worldwide. Its distribution varies across regions, with the highest prevalence of 5.1%–25.7% reported in Africa, followed by North America at 4.3%–13% and Asia at 1.9%–8%. The incidence of PPH has also been on the rise, increasing from 5.1%–6.2% in Canada between 2003 and 2010, and from 2.9%–3.2% in the USA between 2010 and 2014.

3.2 Past FIGO recommendations for PPH

FIGO has made several recommendations in the past 20 years for the management and treatment of PPH (Table 1). This document will update the recommendations and discuss new approaches.

Regarding medical management for postpartum hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to uterotonics, FIGO 2022 guidelines recommend to administer IM ergometrine, oxytocin-ergometrine fixed-dose combination, or a prostaglandin drug (including sublingual misoprostol, 800 mcg) if IV oxytocin is unavailable or if the bleeding does not respond to oxytocin.

2.2 FIGO recommendations for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage

Intravenous oxytocin alone is the recommended first‐line uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.
If intravenous oxytocin is unavailable, or if the bleeding does not respond to oxytocin, the use of intramuscular ergometrine, oxytocin–ergometrine fixed dose, or a prostaglandin drug (including sublingual misoprostol, 800 μg) is recommended.
There is no evidence about the safety and efficacy of an additional 800‐μg dose of misoprostol for treatment of PPH when given to women who have already received 600 μg of prophylactic misoprostol orally.
The use of isotonic crystalloids is recommended in preference to the use of colloids for the initial intravenous fluid resuscitation of women with PPH.
Early use of intravenous tranexamic acid as soon as PPH is diagnosed but within 3 h of birth in addition to standard care is recommended for women with clinically diagnosed PPH following vaginal birth or cesarean delivery.
Administration of 1 g (100 mg/ml) tranexamic acid intravenously at 1 ml/min (i.e. administered over 10 min), with a second dose of 1 g intravenously if bleeding continues after 30 min, or if bleeding restarts within 24 h of completing the first dose. Reducing maternal deaths due to bleeding through scaling up of tranexamic acid for PPH treatment could have a positive impact on health equity and improve outcomes among disadvantaged women, especially in LMICs.
Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH.
The use of bimanual uterine compression or external aortic compression for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.
If women do not respond to treatment using uterotonics, or if uterotonics are unavailable, the use of uterine balloon tamponade is recommended as an effective nonsurgical technique that can potentially improve survival in women with PPH due to uterine atony after ruling out retained products of conception or uterine rupture as a contributing factor.
Use of the nonpneumatic antishock garment is recommended as a temporizing measure until appropriate care is available.
The use of uterine packing is not recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal birth.
Uterine artery embolization can be another conservative management measure for PPH if technical conditions and skilled human resources are available for its use.
If bleeding does not stop despite treatment using uterotonics and other available conservative interventions (e.g. uterine massage, balloon tamponade), the use of surgical interventions is recommended. Surgical interventions include the use of compression suture techniques, uterine and hypogastric artery ligation, and hysterectomy.
The priority is to stop the bleeding before the patient develops coagulation problems and organ damage from under‐perfusion. Conservative approaches should be tried first, rapidly moving to more invasive procedures if these do not work.

8.1 Administration of TXA

Administration of TXA is recommended as soon as the diagnosis of PPH is made if the diagnosis is made within 3 h of delivery. When more than 3 h has elapsed since delivery, there is no clear evidence of benefit from TXA administration. TXA for PPH treatment is given 1 g IV over 10 min within 3 h of vaginal or cesarean delivery. One gram (10 mL of a 100 mg/ml solution) is infused over 10–20 min because infusion > 1 ml/min can cause hypotension. If bleeding continues after 30 min or stops and restarts within 24 h after the first dose, a second dose of 1 g may be given. The antifibrinolytic effect lasts up to 7–8 h in the serum. The concentration in breast milk is approximately one hundredth of the serum peak concentration, so it is unlikely to have antifibrinolytic effects in the infant. The WOMAN trial found that administration of TXA within 3 h of delivery to women with established PPH decreases maternal mortality secondary to bleeding and reduces the need for laparotomy to control hemorrhage.
TXA, as a management strategy, in addition to uterotonics reduced the risk of PPH in randomized trials. Its use is effective in high‐risk clinical settings (e.g. delivery of patients who refuse blood products, patients with a significant risk for PPH such as placenta accreta or placenta previa or previous PPH). Usually, 1 g TXA intravenously is recommended within 10 min after vaginal delivery in addition to oxytocin, cord traction, and uterine massage. A Cochrane review of antifibrinolytic agents used for the treatment for PPH identified three eligible trials, two of which compared intravenous TXA with placebo or standard care (the WOMAN trial and a French trial). A meta‐analysis of 20 172 women from the WOMAN trial and the French trial (152 women with PPH received high‐dose TXA, a loading dose of 4 g over 1 h followed by an infusion of 1 g over 6 h) showed that TXA reduces the risk of death due to bleeding (RR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.00), with early treatment being more effective. WHO updated its recommendation on the early use of TXA for the treatment of PPH (within 3 h of birth) with intravenous TXA using the same dosing regimen as in the WOMAN trial: a fixed dose of 1 g in 10 mL (100 mg/ml) intravenously at a rate of 1 ml/min. A second 1 g intravenous dose should be administered if bleeding continues after 30 min or restarts within 24 h of the first dose.
TXA should be given to all women with clinically estimated blood loss of more than 500 mL after vaginal birth or 1000 mL after cesarean delivery, or any blood loss that is sufficient to compromise hemodynamic stability, regardless of the cause of hemorrhage. TXA forms a reversible complex that displaces plasminogen from fibrin resulting in inhibition of fibrinolysis and inhibition of the proteolytic activity of plasmin. TXA is recommended for PPH management. It is given concomitantly with other drugs and procedures for control of bleeding. An antifibrinolytic drug is useful because hyperfibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion are common in the early stages of major postpartum bleeding. Delay in treatment, even if short, reduces the benefit of TXA administration. The WOMAN trial found that TXA reduced death due to bleeding in women with PPH by 20%–30% and was not associated with an increase in adverse effects. It also reduced the incidence of laparotomy to control bleeding by 36% but did not reduce hysterectomy rates. However, the decision to perform hysterectomy was sometimes made at the same time as randomization, so some hysterectomies were performed before or concurrently with administration of TXA.

Most guidelines for managing and preventing PPH focus on interventions during labor, delivery, or the postpartum period. However, the prevalence of anemia during pregnancy — estimated at approximately 40% — is a significant risk factor for PPH. In addition, anemia due to menstrual disorders or other causes before pregnancy, as well as interventions to treat anemia before conception, should also be considered. The incidence of anemia varies across regions and is linked to socioeconomic status. Correcting anemia through a multisectoral approach — including education, screening, access to healthy food, and iron supplementation — is essential for improving outcomes. Such efforts can help reduce maternal mortality from PPH, particularly in LMICs.

CALL TO ACTION: Recommendations and clinical guidelines on the management of PPH should be based on high‐quality, evidence‐based research or the consensus of international experts and updated regularly. Recommendations for managing anemia preconceptionally should be included due to its significance as a risk factor for PPH.

2 GRADING OF EVIDENCE AND STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATIONS

The strength of recommendations and quality of evidence for the foregoing recommendations were rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE, 2011) approach. Recommendations for which we are confident that the benefits/desirable effects outweigh the risks/undesirable effects or that the risks/undesirable effects outweigh the benefits/desirable effects were rated as strong (strong recommendation for and against an intervention, respectively). A strong recommendation implies that most patients will benefit from the recommended intervention, and the quality of evidence is higher.

Recommendations for which the benefits/desirable effects probably outweigh the risks/undesirable effects or the risks/undesirable effects probably outweigh the benefits/desirable effects were rated as conditional (conditional recommendation for and against an intervention, respectively). Conditional recommendations are those for which the balance between benefits/desirable effects and risks/undesirable effects is small/uncertain, and the quality of evidence is lower. For interventions that are conditionally recommended, different choices/options will be appropriate for different categories of patients, and maternity staff should support each patient in reaching a management decision that is both beneficial and consistent with the patient's values and preferences.

For recommendations that are based on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Cochrane and non‐Cochrane) of RCTs, the quality of evidence was rated as high, while evidence from observational studies (cross‐sectional, cohort, and case–control studies) or systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Cochrane and non‐Cochrane) of observational studies were rated as low quality. Quality of evidence from RCTs or systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Cochrane and non‐Cochrane) of RCTs with a high risk of bias and high level of heterogeneity was also rated as low.

6.1 Guidelines that address the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage

Active management of third stage of labor is frequently discussed in guidelines. There is consensus that all women should receive uterotonics after delivery as it has proven to reduce PPH rates. Oxytocin has been cited as the drug of choice by most guidelines, but its dosages and route of administration vary largely, especially when considering mode of delivery. In 2012, FIGO established recommendations for the prevention of PPHand in 2018 WHO updated its recommendation for pharmacological PPH prevention and reinforced the use of oxytocin (10 IU intramuscularly or intravenously) as the drug of choice.WHO also recommends the use of carbetocin (if cost‐effective), ergot alkaloids (alone or combined if there are no contraindications), or oral misoprostol in settings where oxytocin is not available or its quality cannot be guaranteed. Misoprostol is also recommended when the use of other injectable uterotonics is not possible due to unavailability or contraindication to use such as hypertension in the context of ergometrine. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) has updated its publication and reinforced the use of carbetocin as a first‐line uterotonic for prevention at cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery with one risk factor. The German/Austrian/Swiss guideline mentions that prophylaxis during cesarean delivery can consist of administering either oxytocin or carbetocin. Other prophylactic strategies have been proposed in guidelines, but many had no great consensus or no clear benefits. Table 5 summarizes various PPH prevention strategies described by different societies worldwide.

FIGO recommends use of oxytocin (10 IM/IV) for prevention of PPH for all births as a first‐line uterotonic agent.

If oxytocin is not available or its quality is in doubt, other options include carbetocin, misoprostol, or ergot alkaloids.
Controlled cord traction is recommended for vaginal births in settings where skilled birth attendants are available.
Early cord clamping (< 1 min after birth) is not recommended unless the neonate needs immediate resuscitation.
Postpartum assessment of uterine tonus is recommended for all women.

In light of the updated recommendations, WHO is urging international agencies and donors, as well as professional associations, clinicians and national health systems stakeholders to reassess their national health policies and protocols on PPH prevention. Stakeholders will need to consider contextual factors (such as the availability of quality-certified medicines, and the availability and training of skilled health personnel) to determine which uterotonic option should be used (see figure 1).

Summary of postpartum hemorrhage mechanical, surgical, and radiological treatment from high‐quality guidelines around the world

Embolization is also cited as a conservative therapeutic strategy; however, it is most often indicated in places where specialized equipment and professionals are available in a timely manner. Therefore, these conditions may limit its use in acute bleedings.

If bleeding is severe, especially in low‐resource settings, some guidelines recommend the use of temporizing measures such as aortic compression and, more recently, the nonpneumatic antishock garment (NASG), to reduce blood loss until appropriate care is available or while awaiting transfer to a higher‐level facility. NASG has been recommended by WHO and FIGO for postpartum women with severe hemorrhage showing signs of shock or hemodynamic instability at all levels of care, especially at the primary healthcare level or if transport to a higher facility is necessary.

Regarding hysterectomy, it is usually recommended when other procedures have failed to control massive bleeding or when they were not indicated. Guidelines highlight that hysterectomy should be performed "sooner rather than later", before the patient develops coagulopathy. Recently, damage control surgery (intra‐abdominal or pelvic packing) has been mentioned in some PPH guidelines as an approach for critically ill patients with persistent bleeding after hysterectomy.

Finally, many guidelines also address statements for the management of genital tract trauma (especially uterine inversion and uterine rupture), coagulopathy disorders, and retained placenta in obstetric patients. Because of the high maternal morbidity and mortality related to the placenta accreta spectrum and its relation to the high rates of cesarean deliveries in many countries around the world, FIGO and other medical societies have specific guidelines for the placenta accreta spectrum.,

FIGO recommends the preparedness of obstetric care teams for the management of PPH according to the updated guidelines established locally, regionally, or globally.

These guidelines should include medical and nonmedical treatment options according to the degree of development of each country or region.

5 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In FIGO's guideline document on prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage in low‐resource settings, 8 FIGO calls professional associations to action — to work toward incorporation of recommendations into current guidelines, competencies, and curricula, and ensure that current best‐evidence regimens are adopted. FIGO reinforces this call to action and asks MAs without guidelines to initiate dialogue with the Ministry of Health to create new guidelines, and for MAs with guidelines that do not reflect new best evidence to advocate for timely revisions. Further, regional and international societies should prioritize clinical updates and dissemination of new guidance and practice to a range of provider cadres. Given the global shortage of specialist clinicians in low‐resource settings, there is a need to create a pathway to better guidance, mentoring, and information sharing of the best clinical evidence within an environment of task sharing. Thus, rather than look at guidelines for PPH management by cadre, what is needed is more explicit discussion of task sharing within guidelines for different cadres of healthcare providers.

It is hoped that the findings presented here can be used in collaboration with partners to offer assistance to countries that do not have guidelines or are revising national guidelines to ensure that they are comprehensive, evidence‐based, and appropriate for their setting. These findings can also be used with partners to offer assistance to countries that do not have misoprostol listed on their EMLs. They could also be useful for discussion with partners when revising international guidelines to raise issues of conformity, dissemination, and implementation. They will also be used to guide FIGO's work disseminating evidence on misoprostol and other promising technologies for the management of PPH in the future.

9.2 Uterine balloon tamponade

Despite active management of the third stage of labor, 2%–7% of women experience postpartum blood loss of more than 500 ml. Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) is both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. If bleeding does not stop after its insertion, then it is better to review the etiology of PPH. Placement of a UBT device should be considered early when emergency measures for management of PPH are initiated. It should be performed by competent healthcare providers who are trained in its insertion to avoid complications that can arise from misplacement. Perineal, vaginal, and cervical tears and ruptured uterus must be excluded, and the placenta carefully assessed for completeness to rule out retained fragments of the placenta. First‐line emergency interventions for atonic PPH include uterine massage, initiation of large intravenous access, emptying the uterus and bladder, and administration of oxytocin and TXA (first response bundle). If the uterus fails to contract, ergometrine or misoprostol should be administered, bimanual uterine or aortic compression should be initiated, a UBT placed, and the NASG applied (response to refractory PPH bundle). These two sets of approaches have recently been defined as the "PPH bundle".

Observational studies have reported UBT success rates between 83% and 95% overall with nearly 100% survival among women with uncontrolled hemorrhage when a UBT device was placed before the onset of advanced shock. The integration of UBT into PPH clinical pathways in high‐income countries has been shown to avert hysterectomy and significantly reduce the need for PPH‐related invasive procedures such as artery ligation, uterine compression sutures, and arterial embolization.,

A 2020 systematic review and meta‐analysis showed an overall pooled success rate of 85.9% (95% CI, 83.9–87.9%) for the treatment of PPH, with higher pooled success rates corresponding to PPH due to uterine atony and placenta previa, and lower pooled success rates for PPH due to placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) and retained products of conception. A safety trial in Kenya and Sierra Leone on a uniquely designed condom uterine tamponade device (ESM‐UBT) demonstrated no increased risk of infections or perineal injuries, and success rates of condom UBT devices appear to be comparable to those of Bakri balloons. Available UBT devices and specific considerations are described below.

THE 2021 WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION UTERINE BALLOON TAMPONADE RECOMMENDATION

At the outset, it is important to clarify exactly what the new guidelines state. The WHO Guideline Development Group has developed a context-specific recommendation, stating that:

Uterine balloon tamponade is recommended for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony after vaginal birth in women who do not respond to standard first-line treatment, provided the following conditions are met:
Immediate recourse to surgical intervention and access to blood products is possible if needed.
A primary postpartum haemorrhage first-line treatment protocol (including the use of uterotonics, tranexamic acid, intravenous fluids) is available and routinely implemented.
Other causes of postpartum haemorrhage (retained placental tissue, trauma) can be reasonably excluded.
The procedure is performed by health personnel who are trained and skilled in the management of postpartum haemorrhage, including the use of uterine balloon tamponade.
Maternal condition can be regularly and adequately monitored for prompt identification of any signs of deterioration.

Create the necessary conditions to encourage improvements in clinical care

This is an opportunity to ensure that health facilities have copies of updated, evidence-based PPH prevention and treatment protocols, job aids and decision-support tools available for immediate use in labour, delivery and postpartum areas. Any facility where women give birth requires access to a functioning supply chain, in order to ensure 24/7 availability of uterotonics for PPH prevention, as well as the necessary medicines and equipment to provide emergency obstetric care should PPH occur. Skilled heath personnel require competency-based in-service training, as well as ongoing supportive supervision to ensure their PPH prevention and management skills are up to date.

Health facilities and clinicians can also take this opportunity to review their PPH prevention, treatment and case fatality reduction targets, and ensure that a data-driven approach is being taken to drive improvements in care at the time of childbirth. Quality improvement activities need to engage all key stakeholders, including clinicians, programme management and quality improvement staff. Criterion-based audits of clinical records can be used to assess the effectiveness of prevention and management of PPH at a health facility level.

1.1 Getting policy into practice for prevention and treatment ofin low‐resource countries

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) "Improving access to essential medicines to reduce PPH morbidity and mortality (IAP)" project (2021–2022) supported eight SSA countries to update their EML in line with WHO PPH recommendations for the use of uterotonics including TXA and HSC. Under the IAP, FIGO — in partnership with the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) — developed a generic PPH care pathway (PCP) incorporating the WHO PPH guidance. Subsequently, IAP partnered with national member societies and associations to update their protocols/guidelines for PPH prevention and treatment, and developed and disseminated job aids for health facility‐based maternal care providers. A description of engagement key stakeholders under the IAP is given in Box 1.

Box 1
Country engagement to develop context‐specific PPH guidance

The FIGO/ICM generic PPH protocol and clinical pathway included key definitions, early identification of risk, estimation of blood loss, choice of uterotonics, prevention and treatment at various levels of care, effective multidisciplinary teamwork, communication, and referral, which can inform a systematic approach to developing policy for PPH management in health facilities.

FIGO and ICM were supported by national obstetrics and gynecology societies and midwives' associations to engage with ministries of health and establish PPH Expert Working Groups (EWGs) in each country. The focal persons from each professional society/association met virtually every 1–2 weeks with the international coordination team to plan for in‐country activities. Two virtual/hybrid, multistakeholder workshops with the identified PPH EWG were facilitated. The objective of the first workshop was to raise awareness of the WHO PPH recommendations, discuss, and appraise current national PPH guidelines and protocols, and develop a plan to adapt the FIGO generic PPH protocol and clinical pathway to meet the needs of the country. Digital feedback forms were developed, and comments were collected during and two weeks following the workshop. These comments included suggestions to contextualize the FIGO/ICM generic PCP, and the perceived challenges with the implementation of the WHO PPH recommendations.

Techniques for management of postpartum hemorrhage — Management "should use a multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach that involves maintaining hemodynamic stability while simultaneously identifying and treating the cause of blood loss". Options include "administration of uterotonics or pharmacologic agents, tamponade of the uterus (eg, intrauterine balloons), surgical techniques to control the bleeding (eg, the B-Lynch procedure), embolization of pelvic arteries or, ultimately, hysterectomy". "Generally, less invasive methods should be tried initially if possible; however, if unsuccessful, more invasive measures may be required". Algorithm-based programs "have been used more widely at individual hospitals and in health systems", employ "a multidisciplinary (eg, obstetrics, nursing, anesthesia, transfusion medicine), multifaceted, stepwise approach", and are "aimed at treating cases early and consistently", though "evidence regarding maternal outcomes, such as severe maternal morbidity or intensive care unit admission, is inconsistent".

### Clinical guidelines-the challenges and opportunities: what we have learned from the case of misoprostol for postpartum hemorrhage [^d47c7246]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To establish whether national guidelines for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) reflect new scientific evidence on misoprostol, and determine the challenges faced in their implementation.

Methods

A web‐based survey was sent by email to 130 national societies of obstetrics and gynecology (FIGO Member Associations) in 2016. The survey, composed of 18 questions, covered national guidelines on PPH with particular reference to misoprostol, the creation of national guidelines, and challenges to implementation.

Results

Completed surveys were received from 69 societies, for a 53% response rate. The key findings were that many countries lacked comprehensive, up‐to‐date, evidence‐based national guidelines providing guidance on misoprostol use; recommended regimens were very different in the national guidelines as well as between international and regional guidelines that are most often used as referencing documents; and there are a variety of challenges to implementation of guidelines.

Conclusion

There is a need, especially in countries with high maternal mortality, to establish mechanisms that ensure the existence of up‐to‐date, comprehensive, evidence‐based guidelines on PPH. This can be difficult given conflicting guidance at the international level. Regional and international societies should prioritize clinical updates and ensure their dissemination and implementation.

Medical management — uterotonic therapy for uterine atony is specified. Uterotonic agents should be the first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage caused by uterine atony. The specific agent is at the provider's discretion because none has been shown to have greater efficacy than others; common agents include oxytocin, methylergonovine, 15-methyl prostaglandin F2α, and misoprostol. When bleeding persists and there are no contraindications, multiple uterotonics are commonly used and should be used in rapid succession; if uterotonics fail to control hemorrhage, prompt escalation to tamponade or surgical techniques and escalation of care and personnel are indicated.

4 POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE BUNDLE CARE

Multimodal strategies have been implemented in high‐income countries to control pathologies with high mortality rates such as PPH. These initiatives that involve multiple intervention points and actors have been called "bundles" or intervention packages, which consist of the implementation of a group of interventions as well as multidisciplinary programs that standardize and comprehensively address the management of pathologies. Bundles represent a selection of existing guidelines and recommendations in a form that aids systematic implementation and a consistency of practice.

The California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) Working Group on obstetrical hemorrhage developed the Improving the Health Care Response to Obstetric Bleeding Toolkit in 2010 to help obstetric providers, clinical staff, hospitals, and healthcare organizations develop methods within their facility for timely recognition and an organized and rapid response to bleeding. In March 2015, version 2.0 was updated with the latest evidence‐based changes.

In 2015, work groups of the National Partnership for Maternal Safety — within the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health Care that represents all major women's healthcare professional organizations in the USA — developed an obstetric hemorrhage safety bundle. The goal of the partnership was the adoption of the safety bundle by every birthing facility. This consensus bundle is organized into four action domains: readiness; recognition and prevention; response; and reporting and systems learning. There are 13 key elements within these four action domains (Table 3).

In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) carried out a technical consultation among international maternal health experts to evaluate the development of care bundles for PPH. A total of 730 articles were reviewed and 430 were used for the construction of the theoretical framework of the process. The consultation led to a definition of two care bundles, which are summarized in Table 4.

### Uterotonic agents for first-line treatment of postpartum haemorrhage: a network meta-analysis [^6e0a65ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more after birth, is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all women giving birth should receive a prophylactic uterotonic agent. Despite the routine administration of a uterotonic agent for prevention, PPH remains a common complication causing one-quarter of all maternal deaths globally. When prevention fails and PPH occurs, further administration of uterotonic agents as 'first-line' treatment is recommended. However, there is uncertainty about which uterotonic agent is best for the 'first-line' treatment of PPH.

Objectives

To identify the most effective uterotonic agent(s) with the least side-effects for PPH treatment, and generate a meaningful ranking among all available agents according to their relative effectiveness and side-effect profile.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (5 May 2020), and the reference lists of all retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised trials comparing the effectiveness and safety of uterotonic agents with other uterotonic agents for the treatment of PPH were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed each trial for risk of bias. Our primary outcomes were additional blood loss of 500 mL or more after recruitment to the trial until cessation of active bleeding and the composite outcome of maternal death or severe morbidity. Secondary outcomes included blood loss-related outcomes, morbidity outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and indirect comparisons, where possible, but due to the limited number of included studies, we were unable to conduct the planned network meta-analysis. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Seven trials, involving 3738 women in 10 countries, were included in this review. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Randomised women gave birth vaginally, except in one small trial, where women gave birth either vaginally or by caesarean section. Across the seven trials (14 trial arms) the following agents were used: six trial arms used oxytocin alone; four trial arms used misoprostol plus oxytocin; three trial arms used misoprostol; one trial arm used Syntometrine® (oxytocin and ergometrine fixed-dose combination) plus oxytocin infusion. Pairwise meta-analysis of two trials (1787 participants), suggests that misoprostol, as first-line treatment uterotonic agent, probably increases the risk of blood transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 2.14, moderate-certainty) compared with oxytocin. Low-certainty evidence suggests that misoprostol administration may increase the incidence of additional blood loss of 1000 mL or more (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.00 to 6.64). The data comparing misoprostol with oxytocin is imprecise, with a wide range of treatment effects for the additional blood loss of 500 mL or more (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.02, low-certainty), maternal death or severe morbidity (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.72, low-certainty, based on one study n = 809 participants, as the second study had zero events), and the use of additional uterotonics (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.94, low-certainty). The risk of side-effects may be increased with the use of misoprostol compared with oxytocin: vomiting (2 trials, 1787 participants, RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.47, high-certainty) and fever (2 trials, 1787 participants, RR 3.43, 95% CI 0.65 to 18.18, low-certainty). According to pairwise meta-analysis of four trials (1881 participants) generating high-certainty evidence, misoprostol plus oxytocin makes little or no difference to the use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05) and to blood transfusion (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17) compared with oxytocin. We cannot rule out an important benefit of using the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination over oxytocin alone, for additional blood loss of 500 mL or more (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.06, moderate-certainty). We also cannot rule out important benefits or harms for additional blood loss of 1000 mL or more (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.34, moderate-certainty, 3 trials, 1814 participants, one study reported zero events), and maternal mortality or severe morbidity (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.39, moderate-certainty). Misoprostol plus oxytocin increases the incidence of fever (4 trials, 1866 participants, RR 3.07, 95% CI 2.62 to 3.61, high-certainty), and vomiting (2 trials, 1482 participants, RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.95, high-certainty) compared with oxytocin alone. For all outcomes of interest, the available evidence on the misoprostol versus Syntometrine® plus oxytocin combination was of very low-certainty and these effects remain unclear. Although network meta-analysis was not performed, we were able to compare the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination with misoprostol alone through the common comparator of oxytocin. This indirect comparison suggests that the misoprostol plus oxytocin combination probably reduces the risk of blood transfusion (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.99, moderate-certainty) and may reduce the risk of additional blood loss of 1000 mL or more (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89, low-certainty) compared with misoprostol alone. The combination makes little or no difference to vomiting (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.59, high-certainty) compared with misoprostol alone. Misoprostol plus oxytocin compared to misoprostol alone are compatible with a wide range of treatment effects for additional blood loss of 500 mL or more (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.26, low-certainty), maternal mortality or severe morbidity (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.07 to 4.24, low-certainty), use of additional uterotonics (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.73, low-certainty), and fever (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.17 to 4.77, low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that oxytocin used as first-line treatment of PPH probably is more effective than misoprostol with less side-effects. Adding misoprostol to the conventional treatment of oxytocin probably makes little or no difference to effectiveness outcomes, and is also associated with more side-effects. The evidence for most uterotonic agents used as first-line treatment of PPH is limited, with no evidence found for commonly used agents, such as injectable prostaglandins, ergometrine, and Syntometrine®.

Obstetric hemorrhage is often a sudden, life-threatening event. Successful management hinges on both preoperative preparation if hemorrhage is anticipated as well as knowledge of interventions. Uterine-sparing techniques, such as aggressive and early use of uterotonics, balloon tamponade, uterine compression sutures, arterial ligation, and selective arterial embolization, may be used to control hemorrhage. If these techniques are not adequate, the decision must be made to proceed with hysterectomy. The type of hysterectomy (subtotal vs. total) must be individualized to each patient. Hemostatic agents may be particularly useful in patients who have excessive blood loss from raw tissue surfaces.

### Postpartum hemorrhage care bundles to improve adherence to guidelines: a WHO technical consultation [^f16f008e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

In response to these concerns, the panel considered the following points: (1) that the interventions from the first response bundle should be removed from the refractory bundle (uterotonics, crystalloids, and TXA); (2) that new evidence would continue to arise about all interventions in the bundles, and thus all interventions would be reconsidered by the WHO for inclusion in their future recommendations 26; and (3) that the initial, agreed‐upon assumption had been to define refractory hemorrhage as bleeding that is resistant to first response measures and is accompanied by worsening maternal condition. Some experts proposed creating a refractory PPH care package with all recommended interventions, but allowing for adaptation dependent on local conditions, as an alternative to the response to refractory PPH care bundle; however, this idea was not accepted by most experts.

The panel's final decision was to support the refractory bundle summarized in Box 1, comprising two manual compressive measures (aortic or bimanual uterine compression) and two devices, IBT and NASG, acknowledging that care providers may not implement the full bundle if the hemorrhage stops after one or some of the interventions. The primary rationale for keeping these interventions in a bundle was, first, that the "care package" approach has been recommended by WHO since 2012; and second, the rationale for proposing a bundle approach was to improve strategies for compliance with best practices.

Box 1
Final care bundles for postpartum hemorrhage.

The original aim was that the PPH bundles would apply to both vaginal and cesarean delivery; however, additional discussions made it clear that post‐cesarean bleeding might require a modified approach for the following reasons: uterine massage may not be effective for these women; uterotonics and IV fluids are likely to be already in place, making these two components of the first response bundle redundant for most patients; and the early detection of PPH is likely to use different strategies as compared with vaginal delivery. Therefore, the opinion of the group was that a modified bundle that addresses the unique circumstances and needs of post‐cesarean bleeding should be developed and evaluated.

The panel additionally advised that the two bundles are not meant to reflect comprehensive clinical care and that best clinical practices must be observed (Supplementary File S5). Lastly, the expert panel agreed that the bundle development process had focused on current WHO recommended interventions. These PPH bundles are "living bundles" and will be re‐examined as new evidence emerges during the process of updating WHO recommendations and guidelines. 26

9.3 Uterine artery embolization

Since the first report of the successful use of uterine artery embolization (UAE) for the treatment of PPH in 1979, success rates have been frequently reported at 90%. However, unlike the medical and surgical treatments for PPH, no randomized controlled trials regarding its effectiveness have been conducted. The decision to perform uterine artery embolization in patients with persistent uterine bleeding should be made in consultation with an interventional radiologist. Although embolization may be considered as the technique of choice for managing PPH by some authors, certain practical issues must be considered.

Uterine artery embolization has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various causes of PPH including placenta accreta: Both UAE and uterine artery ligation have reported success rates of greater than 90% with low complication rates. If both techniques are available, embolization is the preferred first choice as it obviates laparotomy. Ligation can be attempted subsequently if embolization is unsuccessful. In contrast, after an unsuccessful uterine artery ligation, embolization may be extremely difficult or even impossible, leaving hysterectomy as the only remaining option. Some cases may require hysterectomy because of failure of embolization. UAE has shown to be effective in controlling secondary bleeding and the placenta was found to gradually decrease in size in all patients. UAE plays an important role in managing these patients because it is effective at reducing uteroplacental blood flow to further induce thrombosis of the intervillous space and to achieve necrosis of the retained placental tissue. Selective UAE is effective in the control of PPH, thus avoiding hysterectomy.

Availability of resources to perform the procedure: A radiologist trained in embolization techniques is a prerequisite, as is the appropriate equipment for vascular intervention. Digital road‐mapping may be required, and the possible complexity means that this procedure can only be performed in a fully equipped X‐ray department. The interventional radiologist inserts sheaths into both femoral arteries to deploy a deflated occlusion balloon into each of the internal iliac arteries. The sheaths are removed, and the deflated balloons remain in place until after delivery. After the patient has undergone a cesarean delivery, the interventional radiologist will inflate the balloons if needed based on the amount of bleeding. If inflating the balloons is postponed, the balloons may remain in place for up to a few days until the patient's providers are certain she will not begin to bleed again; the balloons can then be removed.

3 ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PPH ROADMAP

Since its launch, the PPH Roadmap has catalyzed progress across four strategic areas: research, norms and standards, implementation, and advocacy. One of the major achievements in research and evidence translation has been the publication and guideline uptake of EMOTIVE trial findings.WHO promptly issued new recommendations on the PPH treatment bundle — largely informed by EMOTIVE trial findings — and on the use of objective blood loss assessment within six months of publication of the trial results. Several countries including Nigeria, Ethiopia, Rwanda, India, Bangladesh, and Kenya have adopted the PPH treatment bundle into national policies, training programmes, and networks of care, marking an important step in translating evidence into practice.

Momentum is also building around other research priorities. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating alternative routes of TXA administration and the use of heat‐stable carbetocin for PPH treatment, both of which could improve access to first‐response PPH treatment in resource‐limited settings. Nearly all research priorities outlined in the innovation track of the Roadmap are now either underway or completed.

In line with the key objectives of the norms and standards strategic area, WHO, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) have jointly developed a consolidated suite of evidence‐based recommendations and complementary tools to support country‐level implementation. This harmonized guidance and tools, to be formally launched on the first World PPH Day, provide a critical foundation for standardized care worldwide, and represents a unique model for collaboration among international guideline developers.

Country‐level implementation illustrates how system‐wide improvements can reduce PPH mortality. In Kenya, uterotonic stock monitoring has been integrated into supply chain systems. In Bangladesh, digital decision‐support tools for midwives now embed PPH algorithms to enable early recognition and standardized response. Pilot programs in Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana, Malawi, Nepal, Pakistan, Sierra Leonne, Ethiopia and India demonstrate how integrated approaches — linking reliable supply chains, midwife training, and community engagement — can significantly lower PPH‐related mortality.

3.3 Definition of postpartum hemorrhage

The lack of consistency in the definition of PPH has been a major limitation to the ability to compare prevalence in different studies (Table 2). Classically, it was defined as quantified bleeding of more than 500 mL for vaginal deliveries and more than 1000 mL for cesarean deliveries, occurring within the first 24 h of delivery. However, this definition did not focus on clinical signs and symptoms of hemorrhage, and thus prevented early detection in many cases. Therefore, in 2017, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) changed the definition to blood loss of more than or equal to 1000 ml, or blood loss that was accompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia occurring within 24 h after birth, regardless of the mode of delivery. In contrast, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines PPH according to the volume of blood lost: minor (between 500 and 1000 ml) and major (> 1000 ml). However, the volume of estimated blood loss remains unreliable in many cases, and therefore much attention should be directed to the general clinical status of the patient instead. Several tools for assessment of blood loss have been used as accurate estimation will directly influence the diagnosis and management of PPH. Many groups cite visual estimation as part of blood loss assessment, but as it has high potential to underestimate hemorrhage, use of additional tools for more objective estimation, such as gravimetric measurement, direct blood collection techniques, and evaluation of clinical parameters, have been proposed. Recently, some guidelines have incorporated the shock index, and obstetric early warning systems into their recommendations to evaluate bleeding.

3.4 Etiologies/risk factors

While there exist several identifiable risk factors for PPH, most cases occur unexpectedly. An easy way to remember the most common etiologies is to remember the four T's:
Tone: uterine atony (accounts for 70% of PPH cases).
Trauma: genital tract trauma.
Tissue: retained products of conception.
Thrombin: coagulopathy.

Uterine atony can be anticipated after prolonged labor particularly with the use of oxytocin, in pregnancies complicated with chorioamnionitis, high parity, general anesthesia, and other factors that lead to uterine overdistension such as multiple fetal gestation, polyhydramnios, and fetal macrosomia. Trauma accounts for 15%–20% of cases, and is mostly attributed to perineal or cervical lacerations, perineal hematomas, episiotomies, or uterine rupture. These occur in the setting of precipitous uncontrolled deliveries or operative vaginal deliveries. Retained products of conception can increase the risk of PPH by 3.5 times. Risk factors include succenturiate placenta and previous instrumentation. Coagulation problems can be divided into inherited, such as von Willebrand diseases, hemophilia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and acquired, such as the use of anticoagulant therapyand the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy after placental abruption, pre‐eclampsia with severe features, intrauterine fetal demise, sepsis, or amniotic fluid embolism. Other etiologies include uterine inversion and abnormal placentation.

### Postpartum hemorrhage today: ICM / FIGO initiative 2004–2006 [^c01df804]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the main cause of maternal mortality. Yet, even though solutions have been identified, governments and donor countries have been slow to implement programs to contain the problem. While poverty and low educational level remain the underlying cause of PPH, the current literature suggests that active management of the third stage of labor can prevent it. The International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) are attempting to address the chronic PPH crisis by educating their members on best practices and on troubleshooting where resources are inadequate. Some studies found oxytocin to be preferable to misoprostol in settings where active management is the norm. However, secondary clinical effects may prove more troublesome with oxytocin than with misoprostol, and misoprostol may prove to be more practical and equally effective in low-resource settings. Two new interventions are also proposed, the anti-shock garment and the balloon tamponade.

### Clinical guidelines-the challenges and opportunities: what we have learned from the case of misoprostol for postpartum hemorrhage [^aefbce08]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The survey showed that while many MAs reported using WHO and/or FIGO guidelines as key referral documents, only approximately half then recommended the same regimen. While adaptations of international guidelines are acknowledged to be needed to make them locally appropriate and better able to meet the specific needs of each country and health service, WHO notes that: "Modifications to the recommendations, where necessary, should be limited to weak recommendations and justifications for any changes made in an explicit and transparent manner". 6 Given that modifications have been made to strong recommendations (i.e. those based on high‐quality evidence), and alternatives recommended are based on limited data and may be pharmacokinetically inferior, 17 further work is needed to examine how international guidelines are used and what additional information determines the regimen that is selected nationally.

Differences between recommendations in international and regional guidelines may create an additional challenge for countries looking for external guidance when developing their own national protocols/guidelines. Additionally, it is interesting to note that some countries or regions tend to place closer attention and allegiance to specific external recommendations than others. For example, anecdotal evidence suggests MAs in Latin America look to FLASOG for guidance and many MAs in Africa look to the RCOG for guidance. This can be problematic as the RCOG guidelines do not look at African countries when formulating their recommendations, but to their own members — obstetricians and gynecologists in the UK. Therefore, low‐resource countries that are heavily reliant on guidelines from high‐resource countries may not be making the best recommendations for their particular country. They may instead focus on reinforcing higher technologies that may not be the most feasible or sustainable in lower‐resource settings. The RCOG and other high‐resource country guidelines may not need to include misoprostol at all owing to the common usage of oxytocin and the absence of barriers that would mean referencing alternatives. Obviously, the resource setting should determine the recommendation, which is why WHO suggests countries adapt international guidelines to their specific context. When we notified the RCOG of the high proportion of MAs using RCOG guidelines, we received the following response: "In their 2016 updated guidelines, RCOG removed misoprostol for prophylaxis as evidence suggested it was no better, and possibly not quite as good as, the current well‐established prophylaxis with syntocinon. The RCOG accepts, however, that misoprostol has an important role to play in settings where oxytocin is not readily available".

Table 1
Responders by FIGO region

Figure 1
Existence and content of guidelines by region.

Regimens and conditions under which misoprostol was recommended varied greatly in national guidelines on PPH management. Eight different regimens were noted for prevention and 13 for treatment (Table 2). Conditions under which misoprostol is recommended for prevention of PPH included: for every delivery in any facility, for "high‐risk" deliveries, for deliveries outside facilities, when oxytocin is not available, and when an unskilled birth attendant is present at the delivery; some guidelines did not specify conditions for use. The same conditions were given in the case of misoprostol for treatment of PPH, with the additional condition "after failure of first line treatment with other agents".

Table 2
Regimens and conditions recommended for misoprostol use (multiple responses possible)

In response to the question about which international, regional, or other guidelines were used as principle referencing materials when drafting national guidelines, the most frequently cited were the WHO's recommendations for the prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, from 2012, 6 followed by FIGO's guidelines for prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage in low‐resource settings, from 2012, 8 and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on postpartum hemorrhage, prevention and management, from 2009. 9 There is variation between the recommendations provided in these documents (Table 3), and national guidelines did not always resemble those that they had used for guidance. For example, for prevention of PPH, only 15 of the 46 responders (33%) who used WHO and/or FIGO guidelines as reference documents actually recommend the same regimen as WHO/FIGO (600 μg given orally), and two of these also listed alternative regimens. Similarly, for treatment of PPH, only 15 of the 46 responders (33%) who used WHO/FIGO guidelines as reference documents actually recommend the same regimen as WHO/FIGO (800 μg given sublingually), and five of these also listed alternative regimens.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

A web‐based survey was developed and sent by email to 130 FIGO Member Associations (MAs) on February 5, 2016. Consent was requested in the email and at the start of the survey. Three email reminders were sent (February 15, February 29, and March 7) before the survey was closed on March 21, 2016. The survey comprised 18 questions, with both single response and multiple response questions. The broad question areas covered were: national guidelines on PPH and their content with regard to misoprostol, the creation of national guidelines, challenges to their implementation, and the inclusion of misoprostol on national EMLs. Data were imported into Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) where basic analysis was conducted.

We decided to ask questions specifically about misoprostol for three reasons. Firstly, misoprostol may be more practical in the absence of oxytocin owing to the reasons noted above, making it an important component of an integrated package of PPH interventions, especially in low‐resource and community settings. Secondly, misoprostol — a relatively new drug supported by new science — can be used as an indicator for how quickly guidelines respond to the latest evidence on PPH management. Both FIGO and WHO produced guidelines for prevention and treatment of PPH in 2012 (in 2017 FIGO produced an updated misoprostol only recommended dosage chart, but no changes were made to the recommended dosages for use of misoprostol for PPH management); therefore, misoprostol can serve as an interesting point of comparison for both international and national recommendations. Furthermore, in 2011 and 2015, misoprostol was included in the WHO EML for use in PPH prevention and management, respectively. Thirdly, since FIGO has been involved in disseminating information on misoprostol, it was felt that the survey would provide information to improve or redirect its work.

9.1.7 Contraindications

Currently, there are no absolute medical contraindications for NASG use. Cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities such as heart failure, severe mitral stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension are considered relative contraindications in nonobstetric patients. Although in severe hemorrhage, benefits are thought to outweigh any potential harm.

BOX 7
FIGO recommends that all healthcare facilities have the NASG as an effective nonsurgical device that can be used as a temporary measure to recover hemodynamic stability for the management and transfer of a patient to a high level of care.

### Implementation strategies for WHO guidelines to prevent, detect, and treat postpartum hemorrhage [^23c44687]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Despite World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for preventing, detecting, and treating postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), effective implementation has lagged.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of implementation strategies used to promote adherence to WHO clinical guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registries, along with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 25 April 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster, pragmatic, and stepped-wedge designs, and non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs), including interrupted time series (ITS) studies, controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and follow-up (cohort) studies containing concurrent controls that focused on or described implementation strategies of WHO guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH. Participants were birth attendants and people giving birth in a hospital or healthcare facility. We excluded studies that did not implement a WHO PPH recommendation, had no comparator group, or did not report clinical/implementation outcomes.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were: adherence to WHO-recommended guidelines for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment; PPH ≥ 500 mL; PPH ≥ 1000 mL; additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth; blood transfusions; maternal death; severe morbidities (major surgery; admission to intensive care unit [ICU]); and adverse effects (variable and related to the clinical intervention) during hospitalization for birth. Our important outcomes were: breastfeeding at discharge; implementation outcomes such as acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of the implementation strategy; and health professional outcomes such as knowledge and skill.

Risk Of Bias

We used the RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools to assess risk of bias in RCTs and NRSIs, respectively.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently selected studies, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias and trustworthiness. Due to the nature of the data, we reported relevant results for each comparison and outcome but did not attempt quantitative synthesis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 13 studies (9 cluster-RCTs and 4 NRSIs) with a total of 1,027,273 births and more than 4373 birth attendants. The included studies were conducted in 17 different countries. Most trials were conducted in resource-limited settings. None of the included studies reported data on the use of additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth or adverse effects.

Synthesis Of Results

Single-component implementation strategies versus usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment We do not know if single-component implementation strategies have any effect on adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, PPH ≥ 500 mL, PPH ≥ 1000 mL, or blood transfusion (very low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests that single-component implementation strategies may have little to no effect on maternal death (86,788 births, 3 trials); may increase severe morbidity related to ICU admission (26,985 births, 1 trial); and may reduce severe morbidity related to surgical outcomes (26,985 births, 1 trial). No trials in this comparison measured the effect on adherence to WHO treatment guidelines. Multicomponent implementation strategies versus usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies have any effect on adherence to WHO PPH treatment recommendations, PPH ≥ 500 mL, blood transfusion, or severe morbidity relating to surgical outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Multicomponent implementation strategies may have little to no effect on maternal death (274,008 births, 2 trials; low-certainty evidence) compared to usual care. No trials in this comparison measured the effect on adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, PPH ≥ 1000 mL, or severe morbidity (outcomes related to ICU admission). Multicomponent implementation strategies versus enhanced usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment Low-certainty evidence suggests that multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations (14,718 births, 2 trials) and adherence to WHO PPH treatment recommendations (356,913 births, 2 trials) compared to enhanced usual care. Multicomponent implementation strategies probably have little to no effect on maternal death (224,850 births, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), severe morbidity related to ICU admission (224,850 births, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), and surgical morbidity (210,132 births, 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to enhanced usual care. We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies affect PPH ≥ 500 mL, PPH ≥ 1000 mL, or blood transfusion (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to WHO PPH prevention and treatment recommendations, but they probably result in little to no difference in ICU admissions, surgical morbidity, or maternal death. The majority of available evidence is of low to very low certainty, thus we cannot draw any robust conclusions on the effects of implementation strategies for WHO guidelines to prevent, detect, and treat PPH. While all included studies used the implementation strategy of 'train and educate', the effects seem to be limited when used as a single strategy. Additional research using pragmatic, hybrid effectiveness-implementation study designs that measure implementation outcomes simultaneously alongside clinical outcomes would be beneficial to understand contextual factors, barriers, and facilitators that affect implementation.

### Implementation strategies for WHO guidelines to prevent, detect, and treat postpartum hemorrhage [^25385b72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Despite World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for preventing, detecting, and treating postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), effective implementation has lagged.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of implementation strategies used to promote adherence to WHO clinical guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registries, along with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 25 April 2024.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster, pragmatic, and stepped‐wedge designs, and non‐randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs), including interrupted time series (ITS) studies, controlled before‐after (CBA) studies, and follow‐up (cohort) studies containing concurrent controls that focused on or described implementation strategies of WHO guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH. Participants were birth attendants and people giving birth in a hospital or healthcare facility. We excluded studies that did not implement a WHO PPH recommendation, had no comparator group, or did not report clinical/implementation outcomes.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were: adherence to WHO‐recommended guidelines for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment; PPH ≥ 500 mL; PPH ≥ 1000 mL; additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth; blood transfusions; maternal death; severe morbidities (major surgery; admission to intensive care unit [ICU]); and adverse effects (variable and related to the clinical intervention) during hospitalization for birth.

Our important outcomes were: breastfeeding at discharge; implementation outcomes such as acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of the implementation strategy; and health professional outcomes such as knowledge and skill.

Risk of bias

We used the RoB 2 and ROBINS‐I tools to assess risk of bias in RCTs and NRSIs, respectively.

Synthesis methods

Two review authors independently selected studies, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias and trustworthiness. Due to the nature of the data, we reported relevant results for each comparison and outcome but did not attempt quantitative synthesis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included studies

We included 13 studies (9 cluster‐RCTs and 4 NRSIs) with a total of 1,027,273 births and more than 4373 birth attendants. The included studies were conducted in 17 different countries. Most trials were conducted in resource‐limited settings. None of the included studies reported data on the use of additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth or adverse effects.

### Promptness of oxytocin administration for first-line treatment of postpartum hemorrhage: a national vignette-based study among midwives [^afc7224d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading obstetric emergency, causing 25% of maternal deaths worldwide and accounting for up to 75% of severe maternal morbidity. Most of these deaths could be avoided through the use of prophylactic uterotonics during the third stage of labor and by timely and appropriate management. Confidential enquiries of maternal deaths in several countries have identified deficiencies in care, compared to guidelines, in 90% of cases. A systematic review of rigorous evaluations concluded that explicit guidelines improve clinical practices, when introduced in a context of such assessments. Confidential enquiries into maternal deaths in the United Kingdom have demonstrated that wide variations in management lead to higher levels of morbidity.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of uterotonics to prevent PPH during the third stage of labor for all births. Oxytocin given prophylactically in the third stage of labor is effective in reducing PPH and is therefore considered a component of active management of the third stage of labor. For this reason, prophylactic oxytocin injection is routinely recommended internationally and is part of the French guidelines. This prevention aims to prevent the uterine atony that is responsible for 70–80% of PPHs and remains their single most common cause.

Nonetheless, guidelines about PPH management are not consistent or standardized. Uterotonic drugs are the primary treatment when prevention fails and excessive bleeding occurs. Based on moderate quality evidence, the WHO recommends oxytocin as the first-line uterotonic drug for PPH treatment, including for women who have already received it for PPH prophylaxis. Sometimes however, guidelines prescribe a two-stage administration, alone or combined with another uterotonic if necessary, and sometimes without a defined temporal sequence of administration. These recommendations, which also vary for doses, routes of administration, and regimens for the administration of oxytocin treatment, are mainly based on expert consensus. All guidelines agree, however, that oxytocin should be used prophylactically during the third stage of labor and therapeutically immediately after PPH is diagnosed, for the timing of its administration can affect the volume of maternal blood loss. A French population-based cohort study confirmed that the risk of morbidity rises when initial care is delayed. In particular, the delay of oxytocin administration was associated with higher rates of severe PPH. In addition, several studies treat prompt oxytocin administration (< 15 min) as a criterion of quality care.

### Practice bulletin no. 183: postpartum hemorrhage [^a9e16f41]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Postpartum hemorrhage — differential diagnosis and initial management require that the obstetric care provider first identify the source of bleeding and determine the cause, with timing distinctions that primary postpartum hemorrhage occurs within the first 24 hours of birth whereas secondary postpartum hemorrhage is defined as excessive bleeding that occurs more than 24 hours after delivery and up to 12 weeks postpartum. When evaluating a patient who is bleeding, it may be helpful to consider "the 4 Ts" mnemonic device — tone, trauma, tissue, and thrombin; abnormal uterine tone (uterine atony) is estimated to cause 70–80% of postpartum hemorrhage and usually should be suspected first, with recommended interventions including uterine massage, bimanual compression, and uterotonic drugs. Retention of placental tissue can be readily diagnosed with manual examination or bedside ultrasonography of the uterine cavity and is addressed with manual removal or uterine curettage, and thrombin highlights evaluation of coagulation status with correction using replacement of clotting factors, fibrinogen, or other factor replacement sources. Box 1 lists primary etiologies (uterine atony, lacerations, retained placenta, abnormally adherent placenta [accreta], defects of coagulation, uterine inversion) and secondary etiologies (subinvolution of the placental site, retained products of conception, infection, inherited coagulation defects [eg, factor deficiency such as von Willebrand]).

Regarding preventative measures for postpartum hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to prophylactic uterotonics, WHO 2018 guidelines recommend to administer other injectable uterotonics (if appropriate, ergometrine/methylergometrine, or the fixed drug combination of oxytocin and ergometrine) or oral misoprostol (600 mcg) if oxytocin is unavailable.

Hemostatic suturing technique as a second‐line strategy for control of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony is an effortless, fast, and conservative surgical procedure. It can be performed satisfactorily after a cesarean delivery or after a vaginal delivery. Complications related to its application have been identified but there are no reports of deaths related to compression sutures. Complications can include uterine synechia or ischemia, uterine necrosis, intrauterine infection, and strangulation of the intestinal loop and abdominal omentum when nonabsorbable stitches are used, but nonabsorbable sutures can be used if other types of sutures are not available.

While most births are uncomplicated, obstetricians are often faced with PPH at the time of vaginal or cesarean delivery. If initial management with fundal massage, manual uterine compression, or uterotonics (oxytocin, misoprostol, methergine, or carboprost tromethamine) does not adequately reduce bleeding, placement of compression sutures can be done to slow bleeding and stabilize the patient, avoid hysterectomy, and ultimately reduce maternal morbidity or death. The three most used compression suture techniques for PPH are B‐Lynch, Hayman, and Pereira. Other compression sutures are cited in the literature, such as Cho, Ouahba, Hackethal, and Massuba. If a Bakri balloon is available, the obstetrician can combine any of these three compression sutures with the placement of the balloon to tamponade bleeding. In some instances, expedient placement of an O'Leary stitch for temporary devascularization of the uterine arteries can decrease bleeding and allow additional time for placement of the compression sutures. As with the conduct of cesarean delivery, specific practical issues have to be considered. First, the obstetrician should be well versed in sterile pelvic vascular operative techniques, as placement of sutures will occur at the time of cesarean delivery or with laparotomy following vaginal delivery and PPH. Second, since time is critical to reducing maternal blood loss, an operative team with the technical skills for additional anesthesia, administration of blood products, and surgical assistance is crucial to the success of surgical management. Three commonly used compression sutures are described below and existing data are summarized on the effectiveness of each compression technique.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for termination of pregnancy, more specifically with respect to management of post-abortion bleeding, SFP 2024 guidelines recommend to administer uterotonics immediately if massage alone fails, with methylergonovine maleate and misoprostol as appropriate first-line treatments.

### Postpartum hemorrhage care bundles to improve adherence to guidelines: a WHO technical consultation [^9bfd0256]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel agreed that the response to refractory PPH bundle was intended to treat critically ill women who continued to bleed despite first response measures and whose condition was worsening or deteriorating. However, this restricted definition may generate uncertainties for clinicians about how to treat women with refractory PPH whose condition remains initially stable. On the one hand, the bundle approach might be clinically less useful if a large proportion of women with refractory PPH are ineligible for bundle application. On the other hand, if all bundled interventions are given to all women with refractory PPH (as the bundle literature demands), there might be the potential to "overtreat" some women. It is acknowledged that many care providers will stop implementing other bundle components if the initial intervention works; however, that approach, even if clinically logical, would contradict the accepted definition of a "care bundle", in which all interventions should be administered. If not all interventions are administered, the response to refractory PPH "bundle" would be more similar to a care package, where a clinical algorithm is used to define which interventions to apply and when to stop. 28 Many of the experts were more concerned about undertreatment and delayed recognition of PPH than about the risk of overtreatment of women with severe refractory PPH. Experts raised the issue of the impossibility of a single front‐line worker being able to perform all of the bundle interventions if they were applying either of the manual compression measures. In addition, some experts stated that it was possible that the clinical conditions of women experiencing refractory PPH might be too variable, progressive, and conditional, thereby requiring an incremental, more tailored, individualized approach rather than a care bundle approach.

The development and implementation of the bundles should not prevent care providers from making a thorough assessment of the etiology of PPH before intervening. We note that, although both TXA and the NASG can be effective for non‐atonic obstetric hemorrhage etiologies, these bundles are recommended for uterine atony. Although the proposed care bundles are based on rigorously developed evidence‐based recommendations, they have yet to be tested and evaluated as a strategy to improve clinical care for PPH.

For the first response PPH bundle, the next phase is the development of an implementation strategy, culminating in a model for use at the facility level in LMICs. This strategy must include training on use of the bundles; support for health systems' processes of communication, teamwork, and cooperation; packaging bundles with non‐commodity components; and supportive supervision, monitoring, and evaluation.

### Practice bulletin no. 183: postpartum hemorrhage [^034903ad]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhage caused by a ruptured uterus — etiologies and operative management are summarized as follows: Uterine rupture can occur at the site of a previous cesarean delivery or other surgical procedure that involves the uterine wall, from intrauterine manipulation or trauma, from congenital malformation, or spontaneously in abnormal labor, and surgical repair is required with approach tailored to reconstruct the uterus if possible; rupture of a previous cesarean delivery scar often can be managed by revision of the edges of the prior incision followed by primary closure. In addition to the myometrial disruption, consideration should be given to neighboring structures, hysterectomy may be necessary in a life-threatening situation, and supportive care with intravenous fluids, uterotonic medications, and blood transfusion will depend on blood loss and hemodynamic status.

### Maternal haemorrhage [^92871309]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Maternal haemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable maternal death worldwide and encompasses antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum bleeding. This review highlights factors that predispose to severe bleeding, its management, and the most recent treatment and guidelines. Advances in obstetric care have provided physicians with the diagnostic tools to detect, anticipate, and prevent severe life-threatening maternal haemorrhage in most patients who have had prenatal care. In an optimal setting, patients at high risk for haemorrhage are referred to tertiary care centres where multidisciplinary teams are prepared to care for and deal with known potential complications. However, even with the best prenatal care, unexpected haemorrhage occurs. The first step in management is stabilization of haemodynamic status, which involves securing large bore i.v. access, invasive monitoring, and aggressive fluid management and transfusion therapy. Care for the patient with maternal bleeding should follow an algorithm that goes through a rapid and successive sequence of medical and surgical approaches to stem bleeding and decrease morbidity and mortality. With the addition of potent uterotonic agents and the advent of minimally invasive interventional radiological techniques such as angiographic embolization and arterial ligation, definitive yet conservative management is now possible in an attempt to avoid hysterectomy in patients with severe peripartum bleeding. If these interventions are inadequate to control the bleeding, the decision to proceed to hysterectomy must be made expeditiously. Recombinant factor VIIa is a relatively new treatment that could prove useful for severe coagulopathy and intractable bleeding.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion [^533a3a88]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Abortion-related hemorrhage — secondary treatment and antifibrinolytic use — When bleeding is excessive or refractory to massage and uterotonics, the clinician should move quickly to secondary treatment measures, and the following measures should be instituted without delay: placement of additional intravenous lines, fluid resuscitation, and laboratory assessment (including hemoglobin, coagulation parameters, and cross-match). In suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), administration of fibrinogen concentrate is an acceptable first step even without laboratory evidence, and transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate can also be initiated without laboratory evidence of DIC. Tranexamic acid (TXA) inhibits fibrinolysis and stabilizes blood clots; while the guideline does not find sufficient evidence to recommend for or against TXA in abortion hemorrhage, given postpartum data, we suggest it as a safe and effective agent for prophylaxis and treatment for hemorrhage at the time of abortion (GRADE 2C). TXA is commonly administered intravenously as 1000 mg either 30 minutes before the procedure, and it can also be administered intramuscularly.

### FIGO and the international confederation of midwives endorse WHO guidelines on prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage [^16c5c8b8]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Out of approximately 135 million annual births globally, 45 million are in Africa and 41 million are in South Asia. Each year, about two‐thirds of the world's births occur in settings with unacceptably high maternal and neonatal mortality, and where the risk of death due to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is highest. PPH occurs in about 3%–5% of births, with large regional variation. Approximately 25% of the annual 300 000 maternal deaths are related to complications of PPH.

The FIGO PPH Technical Working Group (TWG), which includes members of the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), recognizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, where midwives, obstetricians, and other healthcare providers work closely together to support women, newborns, and families to have a positive birth experience. Healthcare providers need to be available in sufficient numbers, to have received a quality education, to be appropriately regulated, and to have access to continuing professional development. They also need to work in enabling environments and have access to appropriate and effective medicines and up‐to‐date guidelines.

The FIGO PPH TWG actively supports activities for healthcare system and provider strengthening, to ensure that women, newborns, and families receive quality care throughout the childbirth continuum.

The availability of evidence‐based guidelines can contribute to women, newborns, and families receiving quality care from their healthcare provider. Access to the latest evidence can assist healthcare providers in deciding which care pathway is the most appropriate and can save lives while providing a positive birth experience.

Recognizing that adoption of World Health Organization (WHO) PPH guidelines will need support and that guideline implementation can best be led by national healthcare professionals, the FIGO PPH TWG and ICM consulted with their respective member obstetric and gynecologist societies and midwives' associations. There was consensus that collaborating on joint statements for PPH prevention and treatment would help to reflect the valuable contribution of both professions to improve the quality of care provided to women, newborns, and families.

### FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^4a0cbf8e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on the available literature, the success rate of compression sutures in achieving hemostasis is 76%–100%. To date, no randomized controlled trials or controlled studies have compared the efficacy of the different compression sutures. In the three original studies for B‐Lynch, Hayman, and Pereira, success rates were reported as 100% (5/5 for B‐Lynch, 3/3 for Hayman, and 7/7 for Pereira). In a systematic review, the overall success rate of compression sutures was reported as 91.7%. Given the broad use of compression sutures and the impact on maternal morbidity and mortality, it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of different compression techniques will be conducted. However, an observational study comparing the effectiveness of different compression sutures on estimated blood loss and measures of maternal morbidity is an obvious next step to move the literature forward.

BOX 10
FIGO recommends compression sutures as one of the options to control PPH when medical and nonsurgical treatment modalities fail.

10.2 Uterine artery ligation

Uterine artery ligation has been described for the control of PPH since 1960; it is considered a simple, fast‐performing techniqueand one of the most popular fertility‐preserving surgical techniques. It is an effective management strategy for bleeding control with success rates of 42% and 88% described.,

The recent evidence on the effectiveness of uterine artery ligation to control bleeding in PPH is centered on case reports, mainly associated with other techniques and with the use of tranexamic acid. The success rates for the procedure are higher depending on the time of the intervention from the beginning of the bleeding, the presence of coagulopathy, and the expertise of the surgeons. The latest Cochrane systematic review of mechanical and surgical interventions for treating primary PPH found no controlled clinical trials evaluating its effectiveness for uterine artery ligation.

BOX 11
FIGO recommends uterine artery ligation as one of the options to rapidly control PPH when medical, nonsurgical approaches, and compression sutures fail.
