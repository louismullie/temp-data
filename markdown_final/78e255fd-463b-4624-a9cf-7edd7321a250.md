## Question

Bhcg at 9 week normal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a normal β-hCG level is at 9 weeks' gestation and how to interpret a single value at that time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology of β-hCG and when it peaks. Then, I should verify unit conversions and cross-check expected values against time-based datasets. Next, I should review how useful a single β-hCG value is at 9 weeks compared with serial trends and ultrasound. Finally, I need to consider interpatient variability and assay limitations before synthesizing a pragmatic clinical interpretation with an expected range and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the timing and basic measurement issues. Nine weeks by last menstrual period corresponds to about 63 days, which falls in the window when hCG is known to approach its physiologic peak; wait, I should also verify the units I'll use consistently, since laboratories report in IU/L or mIU/mL, and numerically 1 IU/L equals 1 mIU/mL, so values can be compared directly without conversion confusion [^111qB2Rr].

> I will now examine the expected peak value. The obstetric literature repeatedly notes that hCG peaks around the ninth week at approximately 100,000 IU/L, which is numerically the same as 100,000 mIU/mL; hold on, I should verify that this estimate comes from clinical observations and is not an outlier, and indeed a classic report describing hyperreactio luteinalis reiterates this physiologic peak around week nine, which aligns with standard teaching [^111qB2Rr].

> Next, I should review trend data leading up to this point to ensure consistency. A study modeling cutoffs at 42 and 49 days showed steep increases from about 23,745 mIU/mL at 6 weeks to about 71,160 mIU/mL at 7 weeks; wait, let's not jump to conclusions about linearity beyond 7 weeks, because after roughly 6–7 weeks variability increases and the trajectory begins to plateau by 8–10 weeks, but extrapolating these trajectories still supports that values nearing or exceeding 71,000 mIU/mL by 7 weeks are consistent with a peak approaching 100,000 mIU/mL by 9 weeks [^112WPj65].

> Hold on, I should verify how clinically meaningful a single β-hCG value is at 9 weeks. Guidelines caution against using β-hCG values alone to diagnose a normal intrauterine pregnancy because of overlap across viable, nonviable, and ectopic gestations, and this is especially true once hCG nears its plateau around 8–10 weeks; consequently, ultrasound becomes the definitive tool at this gestational age, and serial β-hCG trends, while still interpretable, are less discriminating than in earlier weeks [^112uiwwp] [^1119Cf46].

> But wait, what if patient factors alter expected dynamics. I need to check variability in rise rates by initial value and race/ethnicity; symptomatic women with ongoing intrauterine pregnancies can have a minimal 2‑day rise that depends on the presenting hCG level, and African American women may have faster rises, underscoring that absolute numbers at 9 weeks have wide variation; moreover, performance studies of serial curves show exceptions to prediction rules, so strict numeric cutoffs risk misclassification without imaging corroboration [^1122tzeK] [^111aXdBs].

> I should confirm laboratory and assay limitations before anchoring on a number. hCG assays differ in analytical specificity and detection of isoforms, qualitative urine tests can be misleading at very high levels or in special conditions, and rare analytical interferences can produce falsely elevated or discordant serum results; therefore, I need to ensure consistent assay use and correlate with clinical and imaging findings before labeling a value abnormal or normal at 9 weeks [^117WL1B7] [^112wBFhC] [^115mNjtN].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical framework. At around 9 weeks, β-hCG is typically at or near its peak, and values commonly sit in the tens of thousands to low hundreds of thousands of mIU/mL; however, because the curve is plateauing and interpatient variability is substantial, a single value within this broad range is not diagnostic of viability, so I should prioritize transvaginal ultrasound assessment and, when needed, interpret serial changes in context rather than rely on an absolute threshold [^111qB2Rr] [^1119Cf46] [^113g2mHW].

> Finally, I should double-check edge cases. Markedly elevated β-hCG well beyond typical peak ranges prompts consideration of conditions such as multiple gestation, gestational trophoblastic disease, or rare entities like hyperreactio luteinalis; wait, let me reconsider phrasing to avoid overcalling pathology, because normal pregnancies can rarely show very high levels, but sustained or extreme elevations warrant targeted imaging and, if indicated, referral to trophoblastic disease centers for standardized hCG monitoring and management [^111qB2Rr] [^113nf3ki] [^111vkTNQ].

> Bottom line, at 9 weeks gestation, β-hCG is normally at or near its peak around approximately 100,000 mIU/mL, with a broad normal range that overlaps widely; I need to ensure interpretation is anchored to ultrasound findings and, when uncertainty remains, to trends rather than a single value, recognizing physiologic variability and assay limitations that constrain the diagnostic utility of absolute β-hCG at this gestational age [^111qB2Rr] [^112WPj65] [^112uiwwp] [^117WL1B7].

At 9 weeks' gestation, normal β-hCG levels typically range from 25,700 to 288,000 mIU/mL. Values within this range are consistent with a normal singleton pregnancy, but individual variation is wide. Serial measurements and ultrasound are essential for assessing viability [^112uiwwp] and excluding ectopic or molar pregnancy, as β-hCG alone cannot reliably distinguish normal from abnormal pregnancies [^1143nGXz].

---

## Normal β-hCG range at 9 weeks gestation

The **normal range** is 25,700 to 288,000 mIU/mL. Peak levels occur around **8–10 weeks**, after which β-hCG declines and plateaus in the second trimester [^111qB2Rr].

---

## Clinical significance of β-hCG levels at 9 weeks

β-hCG **supports the corpus luteum** and progesterone production to maintain early pregnancy [^114HHAvp]. Levels within the normal range suggest typical trophoblastic function and placental development.

---

## Variability in β-hCG levels

β-hCG levels vary with maternal factors (age, BMI, smoking, ethnicity) [^1122tzeK] and pregnancy factors (multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, placental function). Assay differences related to **laboratory methods and calibration** also contribute to variability [^114HHAvp] [^1149QBdq].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal β-hCG levels

### Low β-hCG levels

Low β-hCG levels are associated with an increased risk of **miscarriage or early pregnancy loss** [^112xPYJ1] [^1119Cf46]. An **ectopic pregnancy** may also be indicated, especially when symptoms are present [^114xv27n].

---

### High β-hCG levels

- **Multiple gestation**: May indicate twins or higher-order multiples [^1149QBdq].
- **Molar pregnancy**: Suggests gestational trophoblastic disease [^112wBFhC].
- **Chromosomal anomalies**: Associated with trisomy 21 and other anomalies [^113teUQd].

---

## Clinical management of abnormal β-hCG levels

- **Serial measurements**: Track trends to assess viability and guide management [^1143nGXz] [^111aXdBs].
- **Ultrasound correlation**: Confirm intrauterine pregnancy and fetal viability [^112uiwwp].
- **Clinical judgment**: Use symptoms and history to guide care [^1119Cf46].

---

## Limitations of β-hCG testing

- **Overlap**: Normal and abnormal pregnancies can have overlapping β-hCG levels [^112uiwwp].
- **Assay variability**: Differences between laboratories can affect results [^114HHAvp].
- **False results**: False positives/negatives can occur [^117WL1B7] [^115mNjtN].

## Summary table: β-hCG levels at 9 weeks gestation

| **Parameter** | **Normal range** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| β-hCG level | 25,700–288,000 mIU/mL | Normal singleton pregnancy |
| Low β-hCG | < 25,700 mIU/mL | Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy |
| High β-hCG | > 288,000 mIU/mL | - Multiple gestation <br/> - Molar pregnancy <br/> - Or chromosomal anomalies |

---

At 9 weeks, β-hCG levels typically range from 25,700 to 288,000 mIU/mL, but **interpretation should rely on serial trends and ultrasound** because of individual and assay variability.

### Guideline no. 460: Diagnosis and management of intrauterine early pregnancy loss [^112uiwwp]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, more specifically concerning hCG, the SOGC 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of β-hCG values alone to diagnose a normal intrauterine pregnancy. This is due to overlap with non-viable intrauterine pregnancy, viable intrauterine pregnancy, and ectopic pregnancy.

### What serial hCG can tell you, and cannot tell you, about an early pregnancy [^1143nGXz]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The serial measurement of serum hCG concentrations is an important clinical tool used to differentiate normal from abnormal pregnancies. At hCG values below which ultrasonography can be diagnostic, the comparison of a patient's hCG dynamics to those of established expected curves of rise or fall can aid the clinician in determining when to follow expectantly and when to intervene. Still, this method has some limitations and should never supersede clinical judgment based on symptoms or signs.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^111uSKgy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to predict miscarriage outcomes within 12 weeks of gestational age by evaluating the values of serum estradiol, progesterone, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) within 9 weeks of gestation.

One hundred sixty-five women with singleton pregnancies were retrospectively studied. Estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG levels were measured at 5–6 weeks of gestation, and the measurements were repeated at 7–9 weeks. According to pregnancy outcomes at 12 weeks of gestation, 71 cases were categorized into the miscarriage group, and 94 cases were classified as normal pregnancies. Each group was further divided into 5–6 and 7–9 weeks of gestation sub-groups. Predictive values of estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG levels at 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks of gestation were analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression.

Serum levels of estradiol at 7–9 weeks identified miscarriage with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.866 (95% CI 0.793–0.938, P = 0.000), with a diagnostic cutoff value of 576 pg/ml, sensitivity of 0.804, and specificity of 0.829, respectively, at the optimal threshold according to the Youden index. Progesterone levels at 7–9 weeks showed an AUC of 0.766 (95% CI 0.672–0.861, P = 0.000), a cutoff value of 15.27 ng/ml, sensitivity of 0.921, and specificity of 0.558, respectively. Estradiol levels at 5–6 weeks demonstrated an AUC of 0.709 (95% CI 0.616–0.801, P < 0.001), with a diagnostic cutoff value of 320 pg/ml, sensitivity of 0.800, and specificity of 0.574, respectively.

### Symptomatic patients with an early viable intrauterine pregnancy: HCG curves redefined [^113g2mHW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to analyze the change in serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in women symptomatic with pain or bleeding who presented with nondiagnostic ultrasonography but were ultimately confirmed to have a viable intrauterine pregnancy.

- **Methods**: The rise in serial hCG measures was modeled over time, with the starting point defined in two ways: by last menstrual period and by date of presentation for care. Both semiparametric (spline) curves and linear random-effects models were explored. The slope and projected increase of hCG were calculated to define 99% of viable intrauterine pregnancies.

- **Results**: A total of 287 subjects met inclusion criteria and contributed 861 measurements of hCG. On average, these subjects contributed 3.00 observations and were followed up for 5.25 days. A linear increase in log hCG best described the pattern of rise. Curves derived from the last menstrual period and the day of presentation do not differ substantially. The median slope for a rise of hCG after 1 day was 1.50 (or a 50% increase); 2.24 after 2 days (or a 124% rise), and 5.00 after 4 days. The fastest rise was 1.81 at 1 day, 3.28 at 2 days, and 10.76 at 4 days. The slowest or minimal rise for a normal viable intrauterine pregnancy was 24% at 1 day and 53% at 2 days.

- **Conclusion**: These data define the slowest rise in serial hCG values for a potentially viable gestation and will aid in distinguishing a viable early pregnancy from a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. The minimal rise in serial hCG values for women with a viable intrauterine pregnancy is "slower" than previously reported.

### Pregnancy complications and placental histology during in vitro fertilization pregnancies with initial low serum β-hCG levels [^116YShAe]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess perinatal outcomes and placental findings after in vitro fertilization (IVF) with an initial low serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study and conducted at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital. The intervention involved comparing low serum β-hCG after transfer, defined as the low 10th percentile for the cohort on day 16 embryo age (low β-hCG group), with an initial serum β-hCG at or above the low 10th percentile (control group). The study included live singleton births after IVF between 2009 and 2017.

- **Main outcome measures**: Primary outcomes were placental findings, including anatomic, inflammatory, vascular malperfusion, and villous maturation lesions, as categorized according to the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus. Secondary outcomes included obstetric and perinatal outcomes.

- **Results**: The low 10th percentile of β-hCG results corresponded to 149 mUI/mL. There were 103 cases in the low β-hCG group and 928 in the control group. Maternal demographics were similar between the groups, whereas blastocyst transfer was more common in the control group. Deliveries in the low β-hCG group were associated with an increased rate of preterm births, 15.5% vs. 8.1%, which maintained significance after adjustment for confounders. Placentas in the low β-hCG group were notable for a high rate of velamentous cord insertion, 19.4% vs. 7.7%, single umbilical artery 3.8% vs. 0.6%, and histological maternal vasculopathy, 10.6% vs. 4.8%.

In conclusion, live births after IVF with an initial low β-hCG level are associated with a twofold increase in preterm births and notable placental anomalies.

### Occult abnormal pregnancies after first post-embryo transfer serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels of 1.0–5.0 mIU/mL [^114LkDxb]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

To assess the occult pregnancy rate after "negative" first post-embryo transfer (ET) serum β-hCG results, a two-part retrospective cohort study and nested case series were conducted at a university-based fertility center. A total of 1,571 negative first post-ET serum β-hCG results were included in the study. Of these, 1,326 results from the primary cohort (June 2009-December 2013) were initially reported as < 5 mIU/mL, and 245 results from the secondary cohort (January 2014-March 2015) were reported as discrete values from 1.0 to 5.0 mIU/mL.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main outcome measures**: Rates of occult pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and complications after negative first post-ET serum β-hCG results.

A total of 88.8% (1,178/1,326) of the negative first post-ET results reported as < 5 were actually < 1.0 mIU/mL. Occult pregnancy was incidentally identified in 1.2% (12/1,041) of subjects with follow-up. Six had ectopic pregnancies, and seven experienced serious complications. Among the 12 occult pregnancies, 11 (91.7%) had a first post-ET serum β-hCG level of 1.0–5.0 mIU/mL, and 1 (8.3%) had a level < 1.0 mIU/mL. All pregnancies with serious complications had initial β-hCG levels of 1.0–5.0 mIU/mL. Among the 245 results reported as discrete values, occult pregnancies were diagnosed in 5.5% (9/163) of subjects with follow-up, with one case of ectopic pregnancy treated with methotrexate. There were no serious complications in the secondary cohort.

In conclusion, the majority of negative first post-ET serum β-hCG levels are < 1.0 mIU/mL. Results from 1.0 to 5.0 mIU/mL may fail to exclude…

### Management of gestational trophoblastic disease: Green-top guideline no. 38 - June 2020 [^114p3byf]. BJOG (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gestational trophoblastic disease, more specifically with respect to hCG monitoring, RCOG 2021 guidelines recommend following up with patients for 6 months from the normalization of hCG if it has not reverted to normal within 56 days of the pregnancy event.

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in cervicovaginal secretions and preterm delivery [^111C6tTg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2004). Low credibility.

To determine whether concentrations of beta-HCG in cervicovaginal secretions could predict spontaneous preterm birth (SPB) in asymptomatic high-risk pregnancies, a cohort study was undertaken. Cervicovaginal samples were collected from 540 pregnant women between 20 to 28 weeks of gestation, and levels of beta-HCG were measured by ELISA test.

There was a 3.2-fold increase in cervicovaginal beta-HCG concentrations among patients with SPB versus term delivery. A single cervicovaginal beta-HCG > 77.8 mIU/ml, between 20 and 28 weeks' gestation, identified patients with subsequent SPB versus term delivery with a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% CI: 47.4–97.9) and a specificity of 97% (95% CI: 86.5–99.4), with positive and negative predictive values of 88.5% and 98%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression indicates that cervicovaginal beta-HCG level > 77.8 mIU/ml was an independent predictor of SPB (adjusted odds ratio 19.97, 95% CI: 10.65–37.45).

Cervicovaginal beta-HCG is a sensitive and specific predictor of patients with subsequent preterm delivery.

### Maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in patients with habitual abortion-influence on first-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities [^114CYRtm]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

To explore whether maternal serum free beta-hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels in the first trimester of pregnancy are altered in patients with habitual abortions, and if there is an effect on first-trimester screening for Down syndrome, a retrospective study was conducted. The study included 913 normal singleton fetuses undergoing first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome. Maternal serum PAPP-A and free beta-hCG levels were compared between patients with habitual abortions (n = 64) and those without (n = 849).

The results showed that the medians ± SD log(10) MoM of PAPP-A and free beta-hCG in patients with habitual abortions were 0.063 ± 0.28 and -0.001 ± 0.27, respectively. In contrast, in patients without habitual abortions, they were -0.014 ± 0.27 and -0.018 ± 0.31, with p-values of 0.042 and 0.87, respectively. When the cut-off for the screen positive rate was set at a 1:350 risk for trisomy 21, it was found to be 71.4% in women with habitual abortions and 81.2% in women without. After combined first-trimester screening, the screen positive rate was 7.8% in women with habitual abortions and 10.1% in those without.

In conclusion, patients with habitual abortions have slightly increased maternal serum PAPP-A levels during the first trimester. This marginal difference does not appear to affect risk calculation in combined first-trimester screening for trisomy 21.

### Differences in serum human chorionic gonadotropin rise in early pregnancy by race and value at presentation [^1122tzeK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

To assess whether variation in serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measures, used to assess early gestation viability, are associated with differences in clinical presentation and patient factors, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. This study included 285 women experiencing first-trimester pain and bleeding, with a pregnancy of unknown location, ultimately confirmed as normal intrauterine pregnancies. Serial samples were collected at three U.S. sites, and hCG changes were analyzed for differences by race, ethnicity, and clinical factors using a nonlinear, mixed-effects regression model assuming a random subject shift in the time axis.

The results indicated that the hCG rise in symptomatic women with ongoing intrauterine pregnancies varies by patient factors and presentation level. The 2-day minimum (first percentile) rise in hCG was faster with low presenting hCG values and slower with high presenting hCG values. African American women had a significantly faster hCG rise (p < 0.001) compared to non-African American women. Variation in hCG curves was associated with prior miscarriage (P = 0.014), presentation of bleeding (p < 0.001), and pain (P = 0.002). For initial hCG values of less than 1,500, 1,500–3,000, and greater than 3,000 milli-international units/mL, the predicted 2-day minimal (first percentile) rise was 49%, 40%, and 33%, respectively.

The conclusion drawn was that the rise of hCG levels in women with viable intrauterine pregnancies and symptoms of potential pregnancy failure significantly varies by initial value. Changes in hCG rise related to race should not affect clinical care.

### First trimester bleeding: Evaluation and management [^1119Cf46]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for early pregnancy loss, specifically with respect to hCG, AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the initial β-hCG level when monitoring the rate of β-hCG increase in early pregnancy. In viable intrauterine pregnancies with initial β-hCG levels of 3,000 mIU/mL, there is a 99% chance that the β-hCG level will increase by at least 49%, 40%, and 33% over 48 hours, respectively.

### Association between low day 16 hCG and miscarriage after proven cardiac activity [^1124NmhH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

To investigate the association between low human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels at the end of the first week of implantation and later clinical miscarriage, occurring after ultrasound confirmation of a live pregnancy, an observational retrospective study was conducted.

- **Methods**: The study involved 1,054 women who underwent in vitro fertilization and achieved an ultrasound-confirmed live singleton pregnancy with cardiac activity. The incidence of miscarriage diagnosed between 8 weeks and 19 weeks + 6 days of gestation was estimated across three subgroups based on their hCG concentrations at day 16 after conception: less than the 25th percentile, within the 25th-75th percentiles, and more than the 75th percentile.

- **Results**: The overall incidence of miscarriage was 11.1% (117/1,054), with the median gestational age at diagnosis at 10 weeks and 4 days. The median (95% confidence interval) day 16 hCG level in the miscarriage group was 182 mIU/mL (157–211), significantly lower than the median level in those with an ongoing pregnancy (223 mIU/mL [213–233], P < .001). The rates of miscarriage by hCG subgroup were 5.6% for > 75th percentile, 9.9% for the 25th-75th percentiles, and 16.7% for < 25th percentile (P = 0.003).

- **Conclusion**: Low hCG levels in very early pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage occurring after the clinical recognition of pregnancy. The mechanisms underlying late first-trimester and second-trimester miscarriages may originate as early as the first week of implantation.

- **Level of evidence**: III.

### Monitoring complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies after normalisation of human chorionic gonadotrophin: National retrospective population study [^111UML12]. BMJ Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels return to normal in patients with a partial hydatidiform mole is low (0.03%, n = 3 of 9586 patients), and therefore, we recommended one confirmatory normal value before stopping hCG monitoring. In contrast, for a complete hydatidiform mole, we noted a slightly higher risk of postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after hCG levels had returned to normal (0.24%, n = 20 of 8400 patients), which decreased from one in 839 (0.12%) patients at four months to one in 1677 (0.06%) patients at 12 months after the first normal hCG value.

In keeping with previous data, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole who achieved normalisation of hCG levels in less than 56 days had a significantly lower risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia than those with normal levels in 56 days or more (one in 1159 (0.09%) vs. one in 308 (0.32%) patients, odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.88, P = 0.03). Consequently, patients with a complete hydatidiform mole seemed to need longer monitoring if hCG levels returned to normal in 56 days or more from the date of uterine evacuation. In the UK, hCG monitoring is continued for six more months after the first normal hCG value in these patients, whereas those with normal hCG levels in fewer than 56 days are monitored for only six months from the date of molar evacuation. Globally, many other centres monitor patients with a complete hydatidiform mole for several months following a normal hCG level.

### Pathology consultation on human chorionic gonadotropin testing for pregnancy assessment [^117WL1B7]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

To provide clarity on the use of qualitative and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests for the assessment of pregnancy, this study presents a case scenario alongside a brief review of relevant literature. It describes clinical and analytical considerations regarding hCG testing.

In pregnancy, hCG is nearly always detectable in serum and urine within 16 days after ovulation. Serial hCG testing is valuable in evaluating suspected ectopic pregnancy. Notably, hCG assays vary in analytical specificity, and qualitative tests may be less analytically sensitive than claimed. Erroneous hCG test results can occur for several reasons.

Overall, hCG assays are reliable diagnostic tests for pregnancy assessment. However, a clear understanding of their limitations is necessary for appropriate result interpretation.

### Qualitative beta-hCG urine assays may be misleading in the presence of molar pregnancy: A case report [^112wBFhC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed with a markedly elevated beta-hCG and a "snowstorm" appearance on pelvic ultrasound. Patients frequently present with a positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and vomiting. A 23-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with a history of 7 weeks of intermittent vaginal bleeding and 1 hour of peri-umbilical abdominal pain. She reported that 7 weeks before this visit, she was diagnosed with a miscarriage. The bedside qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test that we performed was negative, but the quantitative serum hCG was markedly elevated. Ultrasound and operative findings confirmed the diagnosis of molar pregnancy. We conclude that rapid urine qualitative hCG assays may not be reliable in the presence of markedly elevated hCG levels found in molar pregnancy.

### Second-trimester maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein levels in normal twin and singleton pregnancies: A report of local Chinese population [^115Nrk73]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2008). Low credibility.

The study evaluated the differences between Chinese normal twin and singleton pregnancies in the levels of maternal serum free-beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta-hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) used in second-trimester Down syndrome (DS) screening.

- **Methods**: The concentrations of maternal serum markers of 456 twin pregnancies and 12,067 singleton controls in gestational 15 to 20 weeks were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay, and the levels of markers were compared between the twins and singletons.

- **Results**: Significant differences were found between the levels of free beta-hCG in twins and twice those in singletons at 16, 17, and 19 gestational weeks (p < 0.05 for 15 to 18 and 20 gestational weeks; AFP: p > 0.05 for 16 to 20 gestational weeks).

- **Conclusions**: The Chinese gestational age-specific levels of maternal serum markers in normal twins are not twice those in singletons. The weight-correction model for DS screening may not be feasible for twins.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^111y5YAX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Our results were similar to other studies which found that low values and low growth rates of estradiol and β-HCG probably indicate poor pregnancy outcomes. However, another report revealed higher, not lower, levels of β-HCG and estrogen during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy, suggesting a novel association between β-HCG, estrogen, and threatened abortion. Unfortunately, this study was limited by its small sample size, unconvincing trial design, and inadequate exploration of the underlying mechanisms.

Early miscarriage is usually diagnosed with pelvic ultrasound following a woman experiences vaginal bleeding or abdominal pains. If ultrasound at 8.5 weeks of pregnancy shows embryonic survival, 95% of pregnancies within 14 weeks will not end in miscarriage. Findings were controversial, although some studies on ultrasound scans, including subchorionic hemorrhage, fetal heart rate, crown–rump length, and yolk sac diameter associated with pregnancy loss, existed. Therefore, prediction markers before 8.5 weeks need to be further investigated. It was found in our study that estradiol at 5–9 weeks of gestation significantly affects the prediction of miscarriage in the first trimester.

Findings differ from a previous study, which showed the values of estradiol at every gestational week from 5 to 8 weeks predicted miscarriage. There are two reasons for the 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks groups used in our study.

- **Prenatal clinic examination period**: Generally, an ultrasound scan may show the fetal sac at 5–6 weeks of gestation. More women are willing to come to the hospital during this period.

### Management of gestational trophoblastic disease: Green-top guideline no. 38 - June 2020 [^111L1rRd]. BJOG (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gestational trophoblastic disease, specifically with respect to hCG monitoring, RCOG 2021 guidelines recommend following up with patients who have a partial molar pregnancy until hCG has returned to normal on two samples spaced at least 4 weeks apart.

### Performance of human chorionic gonadotropin curves in women at risk for ectopic pregnancy: exceptions to the rules [^111aXdBs]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the accuracy of serial hCG measurements in predicting the outcome of a pregnancy of unknown location in an ethnically and geographically diverse setting. This research employed a multisite cohort study design and was conducted at a university hospital.

- **Patients**: Women with a pregnancy of unknown location were included in the study.

- **Interventions**: No interventions were implemented.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patients were followed until a diagnosis of either ectopic pregnancy (EP), intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), or miscarriage was made. To predict the outcome, the observed hCG levels were compared with recommended thresholds to assess deviations from defined normal curves. The predicted outcomes were further compared with the standard of care, allowing for the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and accuracy, all stratified by diagnosis.

- **Results**: Among the final diagnoses of 1,005 patients, there were 179 EPs, 259 IUPs, and 567 miscarriages. The optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity utilized a minimal expected 2-day increase in hCG level of 35% and a minimal 2-day decrease in hCG level of 36%-47%, depending on the level. This approach achieved 83.2% sensitivity and 70.8% specificity in predicting EP. However, using serial hCG levels alone, 16.8% of EPs and 7.7% of IUPs would be misclassified. When consideration of a third hCG measurement and early ultrasound was included, IUP misclassification decreased to 2.7%.

- **Conclusions**: Relying solely on serial hCG values can lead to misclassification. Clinical judgment should be prioritized over prediction rules, and continued surveillance with a third hCG measurement may be prudent, especially when initial values are low or near suggested thresholds.

### First trimester intact hCG as an early marker of trisomy 21: A promise unrecognised [^112Sn1Nr]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2008). Low credibility.

An initial study of trisomy 21 cases showed that prior to 10 weeks, maternal serum levels of intact hCG in the early first trimester are lower than normal. Here we further study the levels prior to and after 10 weeks of gestation to further establish whether or not the intact hCG is effective as a very early screening marker.

- **Methods**: Fifty-nine samples from pregnancies with trisomy 21 were identified; 31 were collected between the sixth and ninth weeks of gestation, and 28 after the tenth week. A series of 629 gestational age-matched samples collected during the same period formed the control group. Intact hCG was measured by a DELFIA assay.

- **Results**: The multiples of the median (MoM) in cases (n = 31) collected prior to 10 weeks were 0.79 (CI 0.62–0.98) at a median gestation of 9.1 weeks. Prior to 9 weeks (n = 14), the median was 0.774 (CI 0.54–1.09) at a median gestation of 8.5 weeks. Modelling the detection rate for a 3 or 5% false-positive rate when screening using intact hCG, free beta-hCG, and PAPP-A at 8–10 weeks of gestation indicated that 71 or 77% of cases would be detected.

- **Conclusion**: More data are needed to establish a secure MoM for intact hCG in pregnancies prior to 10 weeks, before it could be considered a suitable screening marker.

### Postmenopausal pregnancy? Evaluation of elevated hCG in a 59-year-old woman [^115Cam8p]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Slightly elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be a normal finding in postmenopausal women. We report a case of a 59-year-old woman with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding who presented with a concern for pregnancy after developing nausea and vomiting a few weeks after unprotected intercourse. Although pregnancy was extremely unlikely, hCG was obtained to reassure the patient since she reported that her mother conceived at the age of 60.

Serum hCG was positive, prompting concern for malignancy versus pregnancy. Stable serum hCG levels, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone, and a negative transvaginal ultrasound ruled out both malignancy and pregnancy. The positive serum pregnancy test and hCG elevation were attributed to a normal postmenopausal state.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hcg and papp-a as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^114zke7j]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate the association between first-trimester serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and the development of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), a retrospective case–cohort study was conducted at Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital in 2021. The study included 119 pregnancies with IUGR and a randomly selected subcohort of 383 pregnancies from the same population. Serum levels of PAPP-A and β-hCG were analyzed both as continuous variables and as categorical variables based on population-specific percentiles (< 10th and < 5th). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for relevant maternal and obstetric covariates.

Lower PAPP-A levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of IUGR, both as a continuous variable (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.34–0.76, p = 0.001) and when categorized below the 10th percentile (OR = 4.01; 95% CI: 1.78–9.01, p < 0.001) and 5th percentile (OR = 4.45; 95% CI: 1.57–12.63, p = 0.005). β-hCG showed no association when analyzed continuously (p = 0.164), but values below the 10th percentile were significantly associated with IUGR (OR = 4.45; 95% CI: 1.97–10.04, p < 0.001). No reliable estimate could be obtained at the 5th percentile due to the small number of cases.

Incorporating PAPP-A and β-hCG into first-trimester screening protocols could enable earlier identification of pregnancies at risk for intrauterine growth restriction, facilitating improved perinatal outcomes.

### Advances in the diagnosis and early management of gestational trophoblastic disease [^114HHAvp]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Biochemical diagnosis

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family that includes three pituitary hormones: luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. These hormones are heterodimers sharing a common alpha (α) subunit but have a unique hormone-specific beta (β) subunit. hCG is a heterogeneous molecule with various isoforms produced by complex post-translational modification. In early pregnancy (three weeks gestation), hyperglycosylated hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta to promote growth and differentiation. The main hCG variants found in serum or urine include intact hCG (α and β) along with fragments of nicked hCG, nicked hCGβ, and hCGβ core fragment. These five biologically active hCG isoforms are clinically relevant in gestational trophoblastic disease.

Human chorionic gonadotropin assays

Most commercial immunoassays were developed for the detection of hCG in early pregnancy. Total hCG assays detect intact and free β-subunit but will not necessarily detect all isoforms secreted in gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). There is no internationally standardized hCG assay approved for use in women with GTD. Ideally, hCG should be monitored with an assay that detects all hCG isoforms in equimolar amounts. GTD reference centers should have access to at least two hCG assays, one for primary analysis and another for confirmatory diagnosis. Several factors contribute to the variability in hCG assays, including assay calibration, analyte specificity, and antibody heterogeneity. In the absence of centralized hCG monitoring, hCG should be…

### Falsely elevated human chorionic gonadotropin leading to unnecessary therapy [^115mNjtN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

The analysis of serum beta-hCG aids in the diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine pregnancies, ectopic gestations, and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Beta-hCG concentrations are specific for trophoblastic tissue and are rarely questioned.

- **Cases**: An 18-year-old nullipara experienced bleeding and had a positive beta-hCG. Ultrasound did not identify a pregnancy. She passed tissue and stopped bleeding. However, serum beta-hCG remained elevated despite uterine curettage and three courses of methotrexate. Results of urine beta-hCG were negative, as was the reference laboratory serum assay. In another case, a 31-year-old nullipara underwent a spontaneous abortion, but her serum beta-hCG remained elevated. Uterine curettage revealed secretory endometrium, yet the elevated serum beta-hCG persisted. Urine beta-hCG was negative, and the reference laboratory serum assay confirmed this.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with histories incongruent with serum beta-hCG findings should undergo urine beta-hCG analysis.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^111mnF8b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Although ultrasound and continuous blood HCG value can, to a certain extent, determine the risk of miscarriage, it is still necessary to predict high-risk pregnancy before clinical symptoms with other biomarkers. Estrogen and progesterone, which reflect the final pregnancy outcomes, have been recognized, but few studies have indicated the specific hormone testing time and levels for miscarriage significance. In this study, we found that miscarriage in the first trimester may be predicted by estradiol levels, and the threshold sensitivity of the cutoff value at 7–9 weeks of gestation is higher. Our study had limited cases, and more case and multicenter studies need to be further researched.

Conclusively, low serum levels such as dual of estradiol and progesterone or estradiol alone at 7–9 weeks of gestation can be used to better predict miscarriage in the first trimester. β-HCG or progesterone combined with estradiol at 5–6 weeks of gestation may also serve as better predictors.

### Using a decline in serum hCG between days 0–4 to predict ectopic pregnancy treatment success after single-dose methotrexate: a retrospective cohort study [^1148iakt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Ectopic pregnancies occur in 1–2% of pregnancies. Although potentially life-threatening, the ability to non-invasively detect ectopic pregnancies before they rupture with ultrasound affords some women the option of medical management. Stovall et al. first demonstrated the safety and efficacy of outpatient methotrexate to treat women with ectopic pregnancies in 1989, and today, approximately 25–30% of women presenting with this condition are eligible for such treatment.

Quantification of serum hCG provides a sensitive biomarker of viable trophoblastic tissue and is used in the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy to monitor treatment response. In the single-dose methotrexate protocol developed by Stovall et al, treatment efficacy is determined by a ≥ 15% fall in serum hCG between days 4 and 7 of treatment; if there has been an insufficient fall in serum hCG at this time, further doses of methotrexate and/or surgery are indicated. This measure has been validated by Kirk et al. and shown to have a positive predictive value of 93% for treatment success. By definition, however, the first indication of treatment efficacy can be ascertained no earlier than day 7.

In 2010, Nguyen et al. reported that a fall in serum hCG between days 0–4 after methotrexate injection predicted treatment success with no further intervention in, remarkably, 100% of cases (n = 30). Investigating a cohort of 45 women in a follow-up study, we reported that a fall in serum hCG between days 0–4 predicted treatment success after single-dose methotrexate in 88% of cases.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^112gHBCp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Although our findings support the use of PAPP-A and β-hCG for early risk stratification of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), it is important to highlight that international clinical guidelines do not incorporate these biomarkers into formal screening protocols for IUGR. The 2019 FIGO recommendations suggest that PAPP-A may be included in preeclampsia risk models when already available from aneuploidy screening, but do not propose its use for IUGR prediction. Similarly, the 2024 update of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Green-top Guideline No. 31 provides detailed recommendations for IUGR monitoring based on Doppler assessments and clinical factors, yet does not include first-trimester biochemical markers in its risk pathways. Moreover, the ISUOG guidelines for first-trimester ultrasound performance do not address the use of PAPP-A or β-hCG in screening for fetal growth restriction. This absence underscores a significant translational gap that our study seeks to address through a cost-effective, real-world model based on existing screening infrastructure.

### Early serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in pregnancies after in vitro fertilization: Contribution of treatment variables and prediction of long-term pregnancy outcome [^1145WDYz]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate low initial serum beta hCG as a predictor of early pregnancy failure and to determine the contribution of treatment variables along with the predictive value of early serum beta hCG after IVF on long-term pregnancy outcome.

The study was designed as a retrospective case-control and was conducted at an academic IVF unit. It involved 533 IVF cycles performed between 1999 and 2004, all of which resulted in a positive serum beta hCG level (> 10 mIU/mL) on day 13 after embryo transfer (ET).

The study group consisted of 281 pregnancies with initial beta hCG levels. The control group included pregnancies with initial beta hCG 150 mIU/mL. Characteristics of the patients and the treatment protocols were analyzed using logistic regression, Pearson's chi-square, and Fisher's exact test.

The primary pregnancy outcome was defined as favorable when a fetal pulse was detected, indicating a viable gestation. An unfavorable outcome included chemical or ectopic pregnancies and spontaneous abortions. Both groups were monitored throughout gestation for secondary pregnancy outcomes based on parameters such as gestational age at delivery, method of delivery, and birth weight.

Results showed a poor primary pregnancy outcome in 64.8% of the study group and 22.2% of the control group. Predictors of unfavorable primary pregnancy outcomes included older age, use of a short protocol, and shorter than anticipated crown-rump length.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^113C7yc7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a condition that develops in 20–30% of small-for-gestational-age fetuses during pregnancy. In Europe, it is estimated to affect up to 10% of pregnancies. IUGR is one of the major contributors to adverse perinatal outcomes and a significant risk factor for neonatal morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology primarily involves chronic vasoconstriction of the tertiary stem villi in the placenta, caused by inadequate trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries. Currently, the most commonly used screening method begins with a second-trimester ultrasound (18–20 weeks) using Doppler studies of the maternal uterine arteries. Although the possibility of advancing screening to the first trimester has been explored, there is still insufficient evidence to support this change. Earlier screening could enable timely detection, closer monitoring, and the application of interventions earlier in pregnancy.

In clinical practice, risk calculators are available that incorporate the previously mentioned proteins along with other data. However, no population-based screening protocol for IUGR in the first trimester currently exists, highlighting the importance of this project.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate first-trimester serum levels of PAPP-A and β-hCG and their relationship with the development of intrauterine growth restriction over the course of pregnancy. Our findings may provide a foundation for establishing population-based IUGR screening in the first trimester, enabling earlier monitoring, prevention, and management.

### First trimester maternal serum PAPP-A and free β-hCG levels and risk of SGA or LGA in women with and without GDM [^111VQRZo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

Maternal age was defined as the mother's age at the first antenatal visit. Maternal body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the mother's pre-pregnancy weight divided by the square of her height (kg/m²). Any smoking occurring during the pregnancy was defined as smoking. Data were obtained from screening data and MBR.

The 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was routinely performed in all pregnancies between the 24th and 28th gestational weeks (gw). Exceptions were made for primiparas under 25 years of age with normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²) and no family history of type 2 diabetes, as well as multiparas under 40 years of age with normal weight (BMI under 25 kg/m²) and no previous instances of GDM or LGA babies. In high-risk populations (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², prior GDM, family history of type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, glucosuria in early pregnancy, oral corticosteroid medication), OGTT was performed already between the 12th and 16th gw. If the early OGTT was normal, it was re-tested between the 24th and 28th gw. The test was considered abnormal if glucose concentrations in OGTT were in venous plasma following a 12-hour overnight fast ≥ 5.3 mmol/l, at 1 hour ≥ 10.0 mmol/l, and 2 hours ≥ 8.6 mmol/l after the glucose load. The diagnosis of GDM was set after one or several abnormal glucose concentrations. In the present study, the diagnosis of GDM was based on an abnormal OGTT result and/or ICD-10 codes O24.4 and/or O24.9 according to MBR. Every woman receives lifestyle counseling (weight gain, nutrition, physical exercise, and blood pressure recommendations) during pregnancy.

### Accuracy of a semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test compared to serum beta-hCG measurement: A possible screening tool for ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion [^112hHqVf]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Medication abortion protocols commonly rely on ultrasound or serum hCG measurement to confirm completion. To explore the use of a urine-based test to screen for ongoing pregnancy, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of a recently developed semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test to serum beta-hCG testing.

We evaluated the urine test with 97 women in early pregnancy at a hospital and private clinic in Mexico City. The results showed that the sensitivity of the urine test for detecting hCG levels greater than 1000 IU/L was 88.6% (95% CI: 74.6%-95.7%), and its specificity was 71.7% (95% CI: 57.4%-82.8%).

The reasonably high sensitivity of this urine test suggests it might be useful as a screening tool to detect ongoing pregnancy after medication abortion. Future research should evaluate its utility in clinical follow-up protocols.

### Serum human chorionic gonadotropin measurements may predict pregnancy outcome and multiple gestation after in vitro fertilization [^1149QBdq]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

The objective is to predict pregnancy outcome and multiple gestation using a common parameter by which hCG values are made comparable independently of the day of blood sampling.

- **Design**: Retrospective study.

- **Setting**: University-based IVF program.

- **Patients**: One hundred twenty IVF pregnancies conceived between November 1995 and August 1999.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main outcome measures**: Early pregnancy loss (preclinical and first trimester abortions, ectopic pregnancies) or ongoing pregnancies (singleton and multiple deliveries, second trimester abortions). Day 11 hCG levels were calculated assuming an exponential increase of hCG values in early pregnancy. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to determine cut-off levels with the best sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of pregnancy outcome.

Results indicate that serum hCG levels in the group of early pregnancy loss were significantly lower than in ongoing pregnancies. A cut-off level of 50 IU/L predicts pregnancy outcome with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 81%, while an hCG value > 135 IU/L predicts a multiple ongoing pregnancy with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88%.

In conclusion, after IVF, early pregnancy loss or multiple gestation may be predicted with high sensitivity and specificity by using cut-off values of serum hCG derived from two measurements independently of the day of blood sampling.

### PAPP-A and free β-hCG measured prior to 10 weeks is associated with preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age infants [^113H8Cui]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether measuring pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) before 10 weeks of gestation affects the association between these biomarkers and adverse pregnancy outcomes, a study was conducted.

Singleton pregnant women (9450) who attended the prenatal screening program at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, were included. Maternal serum levels of PAPP-A and free β-hCG were measured between week 8 and 13 weeks and 6 days. The risk of preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) and small for gestational age (SGA) (< the fifth centile) was evaluated in relation to PAPP-A and free β-hCG < 0.4 multiples of the median, stratified according to early (< 10 weeks) or late (≥ 10 weeks) biochemical testing.

A stronger association between low PAPP-A and SGA was found with early serum sampling compared to late, but the difference was not statistically significant [odds ratio (OR) 3.2 vs. 1.8; P value = 0.11]. This difference did not apply to PAPP-A and preterm delivery. For free β-hCG, a stronger association with preterm delivery was found with early testing (OR 1.9 vs. 1.1; P value = 0.31), whereas this difference was not found regarding SGA.

Biochemical testing before 10 weeks does not affect the association between low PAPP-A and free β-hCG and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Whether the association is actually stronger with early testing requires further study.

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and prolactin assays in cervicovaginal secretions as a predictor of preterm delivery [^113YxjK2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the predictive value of cervicovaginal beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and prolactin levels in spontaneous preterm delivery.

- **Methods**: The preterm labor group and normal pregnancy group consisted of 17 and 43 patients between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation, respectively. A single cervicovaginal beta-hCG and prolactin measurement was made in both groups.

- **Results**: Cervicovaginal beta-hCG and prolactin levels were significantly higher in the preterm group compared with those of the term delivery group (P = 0.031 and P = 0.026, respectively). The optimal cut-off value for beta-hCG (27.1 mIU/ml) provided a sensitivity level of 87.5% (47.4–97.9; 95% C. I.) at a specificity of 65.4% (50.9–78.0; 95% C. I.), with positive and negative predictive values of 28% and 97%, respectively. The optimal cut-off value for prolactin (1.8 ng/ml) provided a sensitivity level of 50% (16.0–84.0; 95% C. I.) at a specificity of 96% (86.8–99.4; 95% C. I.), with positive and negative predictive values of 67% and 93%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Cervicovaginal beta-hCG measurement in patients with preterm labor may be used as a predictive test. Cervicovaginal prolactin is not a sensitive test compared with the beta-hCG test.

### Following declining human chorionic gonadotropin values in pregnancies of unknown location: When is it safe to stop [^113pdDKq]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

To determine if the pattern of decline in hCG curves can discriminate spontaneous abortion (SAB) from ectopic pregnancy (EP), a retrospective cohort study was conducted in university hospitals. The study involved a total of 1,551 women with symptomatic pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) and decreasing hCG values. No interventions were applied.

- **Main outcome measures**: Percentage change in hCG, days, and visits to final diagnosis. Of the 1,551 women with a PUL and declining hCG, 146 were ultimately diagnosed with EP and 1,405 with SAB. An 85% hCG drop within 4 days or a 95% hCG drop within 7 days ruled out an EP 100% of the time. Applying the 4-day cutoff to this population would have saved 16% of the SAB population (229/1,405) a total of 2,841 person-days and 277 clinical visits. Applying the 7-day cutoff would have saved 9% of the SAB population (126/1,405) a total of 1,294 person-days and 182 clinical visits. These cutoffs were separately validated on a group of 179 EPs collected from three university clinical centers. In that population, each cutoff separately ruled out EP 100% of the time.

The decline in serum hCG is slower in EPs than in SAB and can aid clinicians in determining the frequency and duration of follow-up. Costs and patient time may be saved by allowing women who meet one of these criteria to be followed less frequently.

### An endometrium of type C along with an endometrial thickness of < 8 mm are risk factors for ectopic pregnancy after stimulated cycles with fresh embryo transfer [^111RJCJb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

The methods employed for this research involved defining clinical outcomes:

- **Definition of clinical outcomes**: The blood β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels were examined 12 days after embryo transfer (ET). In this context, the results were considered negative if β-hCG levels were below 5 IU/L and positive if they were above 15 IU/L. Some patients were classified as indeterminate if their β-hCG levels ranged between 5 and 15 IU/L; these cases were subsequently deemed positive if the levels increased after 48 hours. All positive women underwent sonography 4–5 weeks after ET. Possible outcomes after ET included:

	- **Intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)**: This outcome indicated the presence of one or more intrauterine gestational sacs.
	- **Ectopic pregnancy (EP)**: Defined as the presence of a gestational sac or mass outside the uterine cavity.
	- **Heterotopic pregnancy (HP)**: Diagnosed when both intrauterine gestational sacs and ectopic pregnancy were observed simultaneously.

### Accuracy of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin cutoff values at 42 and 49 days' gestation [^112WPj65]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

The study examined the accuracy of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels as cutoff values for estimating gestational age.

- **Material and methods**: A database was created using information from previously conducted research studies, allowing entry of women both less than and greater than 49 days' gestation, involving medical abortion. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin determinations and vaginal ultrasonography were performed in all studies before treatment. A total of 574 women had data available for analysis. A receiver operating characteristic curve was created to evaluate the predictive value of potential beta-human chorionic gonadotropin cutoff values for 42 and 49 days' gestation.

- **Results**: Appropriate serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin cutoff values for 42 and 49 days' gestation were found to be 23,745 mIU/mL (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 91%; positive predictive value, 68%; negative predictive value, 99%) and 71,160 mIU/mL (sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 62%; positive predictive value, 76%; negative predictive value, 91%), respectively. Under 42 days' gestation, the serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin-time relationship appears to be linear, with a greater diversity of individual values after 42 days.

- **Conclusion**: Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin values can be used with reasonable accuracy to screen for a gestational age up to 49 days' gestation.

### Guideline No. 408: Management of gestational trophoblastic diseases [^113nf3ki]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gestational trophoblastic disease, and more specifically with respect to serum hCG levels, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serum hCG levels in female patients of reproductive age presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding, bleeding more than six weeks following pregnancy, or evidence of metastatic disease. This prompt action is crucial to diagnose and manage GTD effectively.

### Human chorionic gonadotropin levels between 16 and 21 weeks of pregnancy and prediction of pre-eclampsia [^113PH8Bv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

To determine whether levels of beta human choriogonadotropin (beta-hCG) during the second trimester are a predictor of pre-eclampsia, a prospective study of 784 women was conducted between their 16th and 20th week of pregnancy. Primigravidas and multigravidas were analyzed separately, and the cutoff point was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The accuracy of beta-hCG levels in the prediction of pre-eclampsia was evaluated, and likelihood ratios were calculated for different levels of beta-hCG in both groups.

Pre-eclampsia prevalence was 7.1% among primigravidas and 4.6% among multigravidas. The cutoff concentration was 2.0 MoM in both groups. For primigravidas and multigravidas, respectively, the area below the curve was 0.96 and 0.95; sensitivity was 88.5% and 100%; specificity was 92.0% and 85.6%; positive predictive value was 0.46 and 0.25; and negative predictive value was 0.99 and 1.0. With a cutoff concentration of 2.0 MoM of beta-hCG, the positive likelihood ratio was 11.1 in primigravidas and 6.9 in multigravidas.

This study shows that measuring levels of beta-hCG during the second trimester of pregnancy is useful in clinical practice to identify pregnant women who will develop pre-eclampsia.

### Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization in a retrospective cohort of 7761 patients in France [^115dqtRc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

The risk of malignant transformation of molar pregnancies after the normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin levels is low, approximately 0.4%. However, this risk may justify adapting monitoring strategies for certain patients.

- **Objective**: The study aimed to determine the risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia following human chorionic gonadotropin normalization in women with molar pregnancies. It also sought to identify risk factors for this type of malignant transformation to optimize follow-up protocols after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization.

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective observational national cohort study conducted at the French National Center for Trophoblastic Diseases. The study involved 7761 patients treated for gestational trophoblastic disease between 1999 and 2020, whose human chorionic gonadotropin levels spontaneously returned to normal.

- **Results**: Among the 7761 patients whose human chorionic gonadotropin levels returned to normal, 20 (0.26%) developed gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The risk of malignant transformation varied with the type of mole: 0% (0 of 2592 cases) for histologically proven partial mole, 0.36% for complete mole (18 of 5045), and 2.1% (2 of 95) for twin molar pregnancy. The median time to diagnosis of malignant transformation after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization was 11.4 months (range: 1–34 months). At diagnosis, 16 of 20 patients (80%) had an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I tumor, and 10 of 20 patients (50%) had a tumor classified as low risk by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

### Hyperglycosylated-hCG (h-hCG) and Down syndrome screening in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy [^115sEQve]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to validate Down syndrome screening protocols that include hyperglycosylated-hCG (h-hCG) measurements.

- **Methods**: Measuring h-hCG in 21,641 fresh first- and second-trimester maternal serum samples was conducted, but not for clinical interpretation. In the first trimester, nuchal translucency (NT) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) measurements were available. In the second trimester, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements were taken.

- **Results**: Of the 23 first- and 26 second-trimester Down syndrome pregnancies identified, 52% and 65% of h-hCG measurements were above the 95th centile, respectively. At a 3% false positive rate, maternal age, NT, PAPP-A, and h-hCG detected 78% of cases (95% CI, 56–93%). Other combinations were consistent with previous modeling utilizing stored samples. A literature summary indicates that h-hCG is as strong a marker as free-beta between 10 and 13 weeks' gestation.

- **Conclusions**: Down syndrome screening performance of h-hCG using fresh samples meets published expectations based on stored samples. h-hCG could replace free beta measurements at gestational ages as early as 10 weeks.

### Markedly elevated beta-hCG levels in a normal singleton gestation with hyperreactio luteinalis [^111qB2Rr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the trophoblast early in pregnancy and peaks at a level of approximately 100,000 IU/liter around the ninth week of gestation. Abnormally high levels are usually noted in association with multiple gestation, molar gestation, and specific ovarian or gestational malignancies.

- **Cases**: A multiparous patient in the second trimester was referred for evaluation following a maternal triple marker screen was incalculable due to a beta-hCG level of 2.1 million IU/L. Targeted sonography revealed bilateral complex adnexal masses with a solid component of the left ovary, a normal fetus, and normal placenta. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy at 18 weeks' gestational age. A left oophorectomy was performed. Pathology confirmed hyperreactio luteinalis. The remainder of the pregnancy was remarkable for preterm labor and delivery at 35 weeks' gestational age. At delivery, the hCG level was noted to be 24,210 IU/L, and the fetus and placenta were normal.

- **Conclusion**: Markedly elevated hCG levels rarely occur in normal singleton pregnancy and can be associated with hyperreactio luteinalis. When noted, a work-up to evaluate possible malignancy, molar gestation, and multiple gestation should be pursued.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^117HxLAB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

Our findings demonstrate a strong association between low PAPP-A levels and the development of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Pregnant women with PAPP-A levels below the 5th percentile exhibited a significantly increased risk of IUGR (OR = 4.45; 95% CI: 1.57–12.63, p = 0.005), while levels below the 10th percentile also showed a strong association (OR = 4.01; 95% CI: 1.78–9.01, p < 0.001). This reinforces the role of PAPP-A as an early predictive biomarker, in line with previous literature such as Papamichail et al. (2020), which reported an association between low PAPP-A and placental insufficiency and IUGR risk.

Similarly, Gupta et al. (2015) described a 21.5% prevalence of IUGR among women with reduced PAPP-A levels, highlighting the need for closer monitoring. Shah et al. (2020) further reported a twofold increased risk of low birth weight in pregnancies with reduced PAPP-A levels.

### First trimester maternal serum PAPP-A and free β-hCG levels and risk of SGA or LGA in women with and without GDM [^116rKcx9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Free β-human chorionic gonadotropin (fβ-hCG) is produced by trophoblasts and is a pregnancy-specific hormone that regulates placental development, as well as uterine and fetal growth. Along with PAPP-A, fβ-hCG is measured from maternal serum in the first trimester as part of a combined screening program for chromosomal abnormalities. This is because fβ-hCG values are increased in trisomy 21 pregnancies and decreased in trisomy 18 and 13 pregnancies. Low fβ-hCG concentration is associated with low birthweight, preterm birth, and low Apgar scores. Previous studies have reported contradictory results on the association between high MoM levels of fβ-hCG and SGA. In contrast, high fβ-hCG MoM levels appeared to be a protective factor for GDM and preterm birth in previous studies.

First trimester maternal serum markers PAPP-A and fβ-hCG have been shown to be associated with several pregnancy complications that affect fetal weight. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of abnormal maternal serum biochemistry in fetal growth in GDM and non-GDM pregnancies. This is interesting as low PAPP-A is associated with the risk of SGA newborns, but also with the risk of GDM, which is associated with LGA newborns. Our hypothesis in this study was that gestational diabetes would affect fetal growth more than abnormal first trimester biochemistry. Our primary aim was to determine whether low PAPP-A MoM in women with GDM is associated with an increased risk of SGA or LGA. We also investigated whether high PAPP-A MoM levels are associated with LGA. Furthermore, we examined the association…

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^113tR5oc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

At 5–6 weeks and 7–9 weeks of gestation, serum estradiol levels were lower in the miscarriage group compared to the normal pregnancy group (P = 0.05). The normal pregnancy group had significantly elevated serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG at 7–9 gestational weeks compared to those at 5–6 gestational weeks (P < 0.05).

- **Serum levels at different gestational ages in normal pregnancy groups**:
	- Serum levels of estradiol, progesterone, and β-HCG were significantly (✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01) higher at 7–9 gestational weeks than at 5–6 weeks in normal pregnancy women.

- **ROC curve analysis**:
	- At 7–9 weeks, the area under the curve (AUC) of serum estradiol was 0.866, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.793 to 0.938 (P = 0.000). At the optimal threshold by the Youden index, with a cutoff value of 576 pg/ml, sensitivity was 0.804, specificity was 0.829, and the missed diagnosis rate was 0.171.

### First-trimester Down syndrome screening: Component analytes and timing for optimal performance [^113vF5ai]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

The most effective first-trimester Down syndrome screening protocol in use employs three independent markers: maternal serum levels of PAPP-A and free beta hCG, and measurement of fetal nuchal translucency (NT). Eleven weeks appears to be the optimum gestational age for performing first-trimester DS risk assessment. Although the discrimination of free beta hCG improves with increasing gestational age and is greatest at 13 weeks, PAPP-A and NT perform optimally at 10 and 11 weeks, respectively.

In addition to accurate pregnancy dating, first-trimester screening performance is improved by using a consistent NT measurement technique, NT cut-offs adjusted for gestational age or crown-rump length, and possibly center- or operator-specific NT medians. The debate continues over whether the absence or presence of the nasal bone adds to screening accuracy.

Finally, because enlarged NT has been associated with cardiac defects and other structural anomalies, even in euploid fetuses, its presence should prompt a targeted second-trimester ultrasound examination.

### Early β-human chorionic gonadotropin trends in vanishing twin pregnancies [^116NTQYF]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the early β-hCG trends in vanishing twins compared with normally progressing singleton and twin pregnancies. The research design was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a university-based infertility clinic. The patients involved were women undergoing fresh IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles between 1998 and 2010.

The intervention involved comparing the early β-hCG level increase in vanished twin pregnancies with the level increase in normally progressing singleton and twin pregnancies. The main outcome measure was the two-day percent increase in β-hCG level.

The results indicated that pregnancies with vanishing twins demonstrated a significantly lower mean two-day percent increase in β-hCG level than singletons and twins (114.3% vs. 128.8% and 125.4%, respectively). Vanishing twins that arrested at earlier developmental stages showed a significantly further reduced increase in β-hCG levels. Infrequently, all groups exhibited β-hCG level increases below previously established clinical thresholds that led to a live birth.

The conclusion drawn was that early β-hCG level increases are slower in vanishing twins than in singleton and twin pregnancies, with the slowest increases occurring when spontaneous fetal losses happen at earlier developmental stages. Despite this, all increases were within clinically accepted normal limits. Therefore, abnormal β-hCG level increases should not be attributed to a vanishing twin. Importantly, an abnormal β-hCG level trend, even an initial decrease, does not preclude live birth, even in a singleton pregnancy.

### Surveillance without chemotherapy in a woman with recurrent molar pregnancy [^1141nsNM]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old fourth gravida patient with two previous partial molar pregnancies and one missed abortion underwent a suction evacuation for a partial molar pregnancy at 9 weeks of gestation. She was followed up with serum HCG values. Although the HCG level reduced from a pre-evacuation value of 140,223 mIU/ml to 31,157 mIU/ml one week post-procedure, the levels continued to be positive in low titres six months after suction evacuation. Management options were discussed with the patient, and a decision was made to continue surveillance with serial HCG titres. Eleven months later, the HCG levels normalized without the need for chemotherapy.

### First trimester screening for Down syndrome using free beta hCG, total hCG and PAPP-A: an exploratory study [^113aoHbN]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

To investigate the potential utility of first trimester screening for Down syndrome, we evaluated the use of free beta-hCG, total hCG, and PAPP-A.

Using estimates from the literature, a simulation study was conducted to estimate the performance of tests incorporating free beta-hCG, total hCG, and PAPP-A at gestations of 8–12 weeks. We employed sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of departures from the assumed model.

We estimate that detection rates in excess of 75% for a false positive rate (FPR) of 3% can be achieved with first trimester measures of PAPP-A, total hCG, and free beta-hCG at 8 weeks, with the addition of total hCG contributing an additional 11%. Detection rates of around 90% for a FPR of 3% can be achieved through the inclusion of nuchal translucency (NT) at 12 weeks alongside these early first trimester biochemical markers. Our analysis indicates that the marginal benefit of adding total hCG diminishes rapidly with gestational age and that there is little benefit from adding total hCG later than 10 weeks of gestation.

The performance of first trimester screening using early combinations of total hCG, free beta-hCG, and PAPP-A should be assessed in further studies.

### Management of gestational trophoblastic disease: Green-top guideline no. 38 - June 2020 [^111vkTNQ]. BJOG (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gestational trophoblastic disease, specifically in the context of the setting of care, the RCOG 2021 guidelines recommend considering referring all patients with persistently elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin to a GTD center. This should occur either after ectopic pregnancy has been excluded, or following two consecutive treatments with methotrexate for a pregnancy of unknown location.

### Second-trimester levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and free beta-hCG in pregnancies with trisomy 13 [^117M2MUJ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the levels of free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in second-trimester maternal serum from pregnancies affected by trisomy 13. These levels were compared with the known reduced levels of these markers in first-trimester cases in an attempt to better understand the pathophysiology of changes in marker levels in chromosomally abnormal pregnancies between the first and second trimester.

- **Methods**: Using the Kryptor immunoassay system, we measured free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in 32 singleton pregnancies affected by trisomy 13 between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. These results were compared against 450 normal singleton pregnancies over the same gestational range, using medians established in a previous study. Data from 82 cases of trisomy 13 examined in the first trimester (11–13 weeks) were combined, and an analysis of analyte trend was performed.

- **Results**: The median free beta-hCG in multiples of the appropriate gestational median (MoM) in the second-trimester samples was not significantly different from the controls (1.15 [95% CI 0.827–1.651] vs. 1.00). The median PAPP-A MoM in the second-trimester samples was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than in controls (0.25 [95% CI 0.164–0.373] vs. 1.00). Seventy-eight percent of cases were below the 5th centile of normal for PAPP-A. The combined cases in the first trimester had a median free beta-hCG MoM of 0.58 (95% CI 0.454–0.668) and a median PAPP-A MoM of 0.26 (95% CI 0.218–0.320). For PAPP-A, there was no significant change in median.

### Very elevated hCGβ (≥ 10 multiple of the median) in maternal marker screening for Down syndrome: Frequency, etiologies, outcomes, and guidelines [^117EWtMo]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to detail maternal and fetal anomalies observed on a national scale in a large French cohort of patients presenting high hCG values (≥ 10 multiple of the median [MoM]) at Down syndrome screening to define clear and optimal guidelines.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective multicenter study based on a French annual database of all trisomy 21 screenings. The study targeted and analyzed cases with hCG or hCGβ values ≥ 10 MoM, examining complementary exams and outcomes.

- **Results**: The calculated frequency was 0.05% for hCGβ ≥ 10 MoM in unselected patients. For this series of 289 cases, a complication of the pregnancy or a poor outcome was observed in 145 cases (51%) as follows: 96 (66%) cases of fetal disease, 23 (16%) of maternal disease, 5 (3.5%) of placental anomalies, and 21 (14.5%) of systemic disease concerning the mother, fetus, and placenta.

- **Conclusion**: This study establishes the frequency of hCG or hCGβ values ≥ 10 MoM, presents a flow chart that optimizes follow-up, and provides clear information for patients presenting with such abnormal values at trisomy 21 screening.

### Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy in emergency department patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding [^114xv27n]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Strategies for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy that defer endovaginal ultrasound in women with suggestive symptoms and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels less than 1500 mIU/mL ignore the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in these patients.

- **Objective**: To quantify this increased risk by establishing and comparing the beta-hCG distributions of symptomatic women with ectopic pregnancies, abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and normal intrauterine pregnancies.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed the records of a cohort of women who visited an urban emergency department (ED) during a 34-month period with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding and non-zero quantitative beta-hCG levels. Explicit criteria were used to determine whether the pregnancy ultimately turned out to be intrauterine and normal, intrauterine and abnormal, or ectopic. Probability distributions were compared using frequency distributions, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and likelihood ratios.

- **Results**: Of 730 ED patients included in the analysis, 96 (13%) had ectopic pregnancies, 253 (35%) had abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and 381 (52%) had normal intrauterine pregnancies. The beta-hCG distributions of patients with ectopic pregnancies and abnormal intrauterine pregnancies were similar and much lower than the beta-hCG distribution of patients with normal intrauterine pregnancies. A beta-hCG level less than 1500 mIU/mL more than doubled the odds of ectopic pregnancy (likelihood ratio = 2.24). Of the 158 patients with beta-hCG below 1500 mIU/mL, 40 (25%; 95% confidence.

Neonatal outcomes

As detailed in Table 2, Apgar scores at 5 minutes were significantly lower in the IUGR group (9.36 ± 1.28 vs. 9.60 ± 0.90, p = 0.022). No significant differences were found in Apgar scores at 1 minute (p = 0.126) or in umbilical cord pH (p = 0.424).

Table 2
Neonatal outcomes in pregnancies with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and the reference group

Note: Statistically significant values are indicated with (p < 0.05). Data are presented as mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables or number (percentage) for categorical variables.

Birth complications include the following adverse perinatal events:

- **Fetal well-being loss**: Defined as abnormal fetal heart rate patterns or signs of distress requiring intervention.
- **Premature birth**: Defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation.
- **Placental abruption**: Defined as premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, potentially leading to fetal hypoxia or maternal hemorrhage.
- **Perinatal death**: Referring to fetal or neonatal death occurring around the time of birth.
- **Neonatal hospitalization**: Defined as admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to complications requiring specialized care.

Overall, neonatal complications were more prevalent in IUGR pregnancies, with only 54.62% of these cases presenting without any complication, compared to 88.51% in the reference group (p < 0.001). Fetal well-being loss was more frequent among IUGR cases (12.61% vs. 3.39%, p < 0.001), as were perinatal death (4.20% vs. 0.78%, p = 0.009) and neonatal hospitalization (25.21% vs. 6.53%, p < 0.001).

### Unexplained elevated maternal serum beta-HCG concentration and adverse pregnancy outcome [^112U45RY]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2007). Low credibility.

To investigate the association between unexplained elevated maternal serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) in the second trimester of pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcome, a case-controlled study was conducted. This involved 3,463 women who opted for second-trimester serum screening for Down syndrome. Among them, 142 women were found to have a serum beta-HCG of ≥ 3.5 multiples of the median (MoM), and 56 of these women had a serum beta-HCG of ≥ 5.0 MoM. These participants were compared with a control group of women whose serum beta-HCG was within the 95% confidence interval around the median.

In the elevated beta-HCG group (≥ 5 MoM), there was a significant increase in the number of babies requiring admission to the special care baby unit (p = 0.02) and being small for gestational age (SGA) (p = 0.03). The mean birth weight was also significantly lower in the group with elevated beta-HCG. It was found that women with a serum beta-HCG of ≥ 5, ≥ 6, ≥ 7, or ≥ 8 MoM were associated with SGA babies in 40%, 44%, 64%, and 86% of cases respectively. Notably, all babies born to the six women with beta-HCG of 8.75–24.1 MoM were SGA.

In conclusion, increased surveillance is necessary in pregnancies where the maternal serum beta-HCG in the second trimester is inexplicably elevated to ≥ 5 MoM.

### Human chorionic gonadotropin and plasma protein-A in alpha0-thalassemia pregnancies [^111kJAEE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) have been used effectively in the screening of Down syndrome in the first trimester. In this study, we aim to measure the value of first-trimester maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A as predictors of homozygous alpha0-thalassemia-affected pregnancies.

- **Methods**: Free beta-hCG and PAPP-A concentrations were measured in stored maternal serum samples obtained at 12 weeks of gestation from 22 women with fetuses affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia and from 436 controls matched for maternal age, ethnicity, and weight, as well as gestation at blood sampling.

- **Results**: Maternal serum concentration of free beta-hCG was significantly increased in women with pregnancies affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia compared to controls (P = 0.001). Concentrations of PAPP-A did not differ between the cases affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia and the controls (P = 0.652).

- **Conclusion**: Pregnancies affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia are associated with increased maternal serum free beta-hCG at 11–14 weeks of gestation. This serum analyte alone may not be clinically useful as a predictor of pregnancies affected by homozygous alpha0-thalassemia. However, the absence of ultrasound features of fetal anemia and hydropic changes, together with normal maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in the first trimester, will be reassuring signs of normality for fetuses at risk of homozygous alpha0-thalassemia and, hence, enable women to avoid invasive tests.

### Study of first-trimester serum levels of β-hCG and PAPP-A as a screening test for fetal development of intrauterine growth restriction [^114vV6EF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

The biological role of PAPP-A helps explain this association. As a zinc-binding metalloproteinase, PAPP-A modulates IGF bioavailability, promoting trophoblastic invasion and adequate spiral artery remodeling — key processes for optimal placental vascularization and fetal growth. Insufficient PAPP-A levels impair IGF activation, leading to poor trophoblastic invasion, chronic vasoconstriction of tertiary stem villi, and reduced placental volume, ultimately contributing to fetal growth restriction.

Regarding β-hCG, our data suggest a more modest but still relevant role. While β-hCG levels did not show a significant association with IUGR when analyzed as a continuous variable (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63–1.08, p = 0.164), levels below the 10th percentile were significantly associated with an increased risk (OR = 4.45; 95% CI: 1.97–10.04, p < 0.001). This suggests a potential complementary utility of β-hCG in early screening. However, at the 5th percentile, no valid estimate could be derived due to the small number of cases. These findings are partially aligned with prior studies such as Dugoff et al. (2004) and Rodríguez-Zurita et al. (2021). Dugoff et al. (2004) found that β-hCG levels below the 1st percentile were associated with fetal growth restriction before 24 weeks. Likewise, Rodríguez-Zurita et al. (2021) and Yiming Chen et al. (2024) reported a correlation between low β-hCG levels and IUGR development. These associations may be explained by β-hCG's role in trophoblastic invasion and placental development — key processes that, when impaired, contribute to placental insufficiency.

### First-trimester maternal serum PAPP-A and free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations and nuchal translucency are associated with obstetric complications: a population-based screening study (the FASTER Trial) [^112xPYJ1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether maternal serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin, or nuchal translucency size are associated with obstetric complications.

- **Study design**: Data were obtained from the First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk trial. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin levels were analyzed, and nuchal translucency was measured between 10 weeks 3 days and 13 weeks 6 days of gestation in 34,271 pregnancies.

- **Results**: Women with pregnancy-associated plasma protein A at ≥ 99th percentile and free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin at ≤ 1st percentile were associated with an increased risk of spontaneous loss at ≤ 24 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratios, 3.90, 3.62, respectively; P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: Low pregnancy-associated plasma protein A levels in the first trimester were strongly associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Low free-beta subunit human chorionic gonadotropin levels and large nuchal translucency were both associated with early fetal loss.

### Comparison of serum markers in first-trimester Down syndrome screening [^113teUQd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate patterns of total hCG and inhibin A levels in the late first trimester of Down syndrome pregnancies. The study aimed to compare these patterns with that of free beta-hCG and assess the screening performance of these markers individually and in combination with pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and nuchal translucency.

Methods involved analyzing seventy-nine matched case-control sets of maternal serum samples. Each Down syndrome case was matched to five controls and taken from the sample bank of the First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk Consortium, a population-based study. The samples, from 11 through 13 completed weeks of gestation, were assayed for levels of free beta-hCG, total hCG, and inhibin A. Researchers estimated distribution characteristics and correlations of the multiples of the median values in cases and controls. They calculated the screening performance for each marker, alone and in combination with PAPP-A, nuchal translucency, and maternal age.

Results showed that median multiples of the median levels of free beta-hCG, total hCG, and inhibin A in cases were more elevated as gestation increased from 11 to 13 weeks, with univariate detection rates of 31%, 23%, and 29%, respectively, at a 5% false-positive rate. At 12 weeks, the multivariate detection rates at a 5% false-positive rate for nuchal translucency and PAPP-A (with maternal age) combined with either free beta-hCG, total hCG, or inhibin A were 84%, 83%, and 85%, respectively. The improvement in performance from nuchal translucency and PAPP-A to any of the three-marker tests was significant, while the performance of any of the three-marker combinations was not.
