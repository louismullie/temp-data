## Question

Can I administer an 8 mg dose of Zofran to someone who is 8 weeks pregnant?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an 8 mg dose of Zofran (ondansetron) can be administered at 8 weeks' gestation and under what conditions it would be appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the teratogenic window and baseline fetal risk at 8 weeks. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ACOG, RCOG, SOGC) recommend about when ondansetron is appropriate in early pregnancy. Next, I will review the human safety data, especially oral clefts and cardiac defects. After that, I need to confirm dosing regimens in pregnancy and whether 8 mg fits standard practice. Then, I must balance maternal risks of untreated severe NVP/HG versus theoretical fetal risks. I should also check contraindications, drug interactions, and monitoring needs. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, conditional recommendation grounded in shared decision-making and obstetric oversight, with dosing specifics and monitoring steps supported by the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and timing. At 8 weeks gestation, the patient is in the first trimester during organogenesis, a sensitive period for potential teratogenic effects; notably, the palate forms between weeks 6 and 9, which is relevant to the signal for orofacial clefts seen in some ondansetron studies, so I need to be especially precise about risk framing here [^112gHHMz] [^1135ZsjY].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations so I don't jump to conclusions. ACOG positions ondansetron as a second- or third-line agent, to be used only if clearly needed for significant nausea and vomiting of pregnancy after failure of first-line options such as pyridoxine with or without doxylamine and antihistamines, and it explicitly discourages routine first-line use in early first trimester, which means I need to ensure safer agents have been tried first before endorsing ondansetron at 8 weeks [^114Jf5uj]. RCOG 2024 advises that ondansetron can be considered when first-line antiemetics are ineffective and emphasizes reassuring patients about the very small absolute increase in the risk of orofacial clefting while balancing against the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum, which supports conditional use with counseling in this timeframe [^1114UojN].

> Now, I will examine the human safety data and quantify risk. Large epidemiologic datasets show no increase in overall major congenital malformations with first-trimester ondansetron exposure, but there is a small, inconsistent signal for specific defects: a modest increase in orofacial clefts of about 3 per 10,000 births in the JAMA Medicaid cohort and mixed findings for cardiac defects, including septal defects in some analyses; given methodological limitations like confounding by indication and exposure misclassification, I should present these as low absolute, uncertain risks rather than definitive harms [^115acDb1] [^112wEXW2] [^1135ZsjY] [^116qLMHb]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across sources; the FDA labeling also summarizes these data as inconsistent and not conclusive, which aligns with a cautious but permissive stance when benefits are compelling [^1135ZsjY] [^116qLMHb].

> I need to check dosing next to ensure the requested 8 mg makes clinical sense in pregnancy. Evidence-based regimens for NVP/HG include oral 8 mg twice daily, or oral 4 mg three times daily, and for inpatient use 8 mg IV every 12 hours over 15 minutes; so an 8 mg dose is within standard practice, but I should clarify route and frequency rather than a one-time standalone dose unless that is the intended IV schedule [^111wemaX] [^111rrSzC] [^1123fwP7]. Wait, I should confirm hepatic considerations; in severe hepatic impairment the maximum is 8 mg per day, so if the patient has Child-Pugh C I must cap the total daily dose accordingly [^1122LTzd] [^1161PSCw].

> Let me weigh risks of untreated disease against medication risks so I don't underappreciate maternal harm. Severe NVP/HG at 8 weeks can cause dehydration, electrolyte derangements, weight loss, need for hospitalization, rare complications like Wernicke's encephalopathy, and even pregnancy termination due to symptom burden, which are immediate and clinically significant risks that often outweigh the very small and unconfirmed fetal risks attributed to ondansetron when first-line therapy has failed [^1114UojN] [^116Nq5bv]. I should double-check medication-specific maternal risks too; ondansetron carries a known risk of QT prolongation and torsades in susceptible patients, which necessitates attention to electrolytes and co-administered QT-prolonging agents [^111BFkMa] [^113yQTAc].

> I will now examine contraindications, interactions, and precautions to ensure safe use. Concomitant apomorphine is contraindicated due to profound hypotension and loss of consciousness, so I must exclude that combination explicitly before prescribing [^116wpcDi]. I should confirm absence of congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias, significant heart failure, or concurrent QT-prolonging drugs and correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia to mitigate arrhythmic risk; I also need to watch for serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic agents, which, while rare, has been reported in pregnancy with antiemetic polypharmacy, so a medication reconciliation is essential [^111BFkMa] [^113yQTAc] [^114tGFgv]. Let me not forget hepatic impairment dosing caps and common adverse effects such as constipation, which is frequent in pregnancy and may need anticipatory management [^1122LTzd] [^1161PSCw] [^113B1ECF].

> Hold on, I should verify a practical decision framework so the recommendation is actionable. Ondansetron at 8 weeks is conditionally appropriate if the diagnosis is moderate-to-severe NVP or hyperemesis gravidarum with significant functional compromise, first-line agents like pyridoxine with or without doxylamine and antihistamines have been tried and were ineffective or not tolerated, the patient receives balanced counseling on the very small and uncertain fetal risks versus the substantial maternal and fetal risks of untreated disease, no contraindications are present after medication and cardiac risk review, and the plan is documented using shared decision-making with obstetric oversight, which aligns with ACOG and RCOG guidance [^114Jf5uj] [^1114UojN].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up so safety is optimized. If cardiac risk factors or QT-prolonging drugs are present, a baseline ECG and electrolyte assessment with correction of abnormalities are prudent prior to or during therapy; counsel about and proactively treat constipation, and ensure the standard mid-trimester fetal anatomic survey includes attention to craniofacial and cardiac structures, with consideration of additional targeted imaging if concerns arise or if shared decision-making favors enhanced surveillance given the small, theoretical risk signal [^111BFkMa] [^113B1ECF] [^115YTdii] [^1114UojN].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, an 8 mg dose of ondansetron can be administered at 8 weeks' gestation, but only under specific conditions: it should be used for significant NVP or hyperemesis gravidarum after failure or intolerance of first-line therapies, with informed, shared decision-making, screening for contraindications and interactions, and appropriate maternal-fetal monitoring; suitable regimens include 8 mg orally twice daily, 4 mg orally three times daily, or 8 mg IV every 12 hours, with hepatic dose adjustment if needed, and the absolute fetal risks appear very small and unconfirmed compared with the immediate risks of untreated disease [^111wemaX] [^111rrSzC] [^1123fwP7] [^114Jf5uj] [^115acDb1] [^112wEXW2].

---

In select cases, ondansetron (Zofran) 8 mg **may be used at 8 weeks' gestation** when **first-line therapies fail** [^113ZnDMK] and symptoms are severe; use the **lowest effective dose** and limit the duration of therapy [^1114UojN]. There is a **small absolute risk** of orofacial clefts [^115acDb1] with first-trimester exposure, with no clear increase in overall major malformations [^112wEXW2]; weigh this against the risks of untreated hyperemesis gravidarum [^1114UojN]. Avoid in patients with **congenital long QT syndrome** [^113yQTAc], or those on QT-prolonging drugs [^111BFkMa], and monitor for serotonin syndrome if combined with serotonergic agents [^113yQTAc] [^114tGFgv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACOG and SOGC recommend ondansetron as adjunctive therapy [^113ZnDMK] for severe **nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP)** or **hyperemesis gravidarum (HG)** when first-line antiemetics fail [^113nKxGj]. RCOG 2024 states that ondansetron is **safe in pregnancy** and should not be discouraged if first-line antiemetics are ineffective; patients should be reassured that the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with first-trimester use is **very small** and must be balanced against the risks of poorly managed HG [^1114UojN].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

### Fetal risks

- **Orofacial clefts**: A small absolute risk increase (about 3 per 10,000) [^1114UojN] with first-trimester exposure [^115acDb1].

- **Cardiac malformations**: Data are inconsistent [^116qLMHb]; some studies suggest a small increase in cardiac septal defects, but overall major malformations are not clearly increased [^114Jfo5B].

- **Overall malformations**: No clear increase in aggregate major congenital malformations [^112wEXW2].

---

### Maternal risks

- **QT prolongation**: Use caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those taking other QT-prolonging medications [^111BFkMa]; avoid in congenital long QT syndrome [^113yQTAc].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Rare but serious; monitor when combined with serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, methylene blue) [^113yQTAc] [^114tGFgv].

- **Common side effects**: Constipation, diarrhea, headache [^113B1ECF].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

Standard dosing is **4 mg orally every 8 hours** [^111rrSzC]; **8 mg orally every 12 hours** is also used [^111wemaX]. Using the **lowest effective dose** — the minimal effective dose for the shortest duration — helps reduce fetal risk [^1114UojN].

---

## Alternative treatments

First-line options include **doxylamine-pyridoxine** [^113ZnDMK], antihistamines (meclizine, dimenhydrinate), metoclopramide, and promethazine, and **non-pharmacologic** measures include dietary modifications, ginger, and acupressure [^114vo1ry] [^111NGFuu].

---

## Clinical decision-making

Shared decision-making should include discussion of **risks and benefits** with the patient, considering symptom severity and response to first-line therapies [^1114UojN]. Monitoring should include maternal **ECG and electrolytes** when risk factors for **QT prolongation** are present [^111BFkMa], with consideration of fetal ultrasound follow-up if use is prolonged in the first trimester [^115YTdii].

---

Ondansetron 8 mg **may be used at 8 weeks' gestation when first-line therapies fail** [^113ZnDMK], with a small absolute risk of orofacial clefts [^115acDb1] and no clear increase in overall major malformations [^112wEXW2]. Use the **lowest effective dose**, monitor for QT prolongation [^113yQTAc] and serotonin syndrome [^114tGFgv], and consider alternatives first.

Regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum. Ondansetron hydrochloride IV is classified as category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus being observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran):

- **Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with hypersensitivity to selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists.

- **Mask symptoms of ileus, gastric distension**: Use caution in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or after abdominal surgery.

- **Myocardial infarction**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia.

- **Prolonged QT interval**: Use caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications. Obtain ECG monitoring. Avoid using ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially in patients with the concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. These include SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^114Jfo5B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ondansetron exposure in utero has not been associated with overall major congenital malformations in aggregate analyses. One large retrospective cohort study examined 1,970 women who received a prescription for ondansetron during pregnancy and reported no association between ondansetron exposure and major congenital malformations, miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, infants of low birth weight, or infants small for gestational age.

Two large retrospective cohort studies and one case-control study have assessed ondansetron exposure in the first trimester and the risk of cardiovascular defects with inconsistent findings. Relative risks (RR) ranged from 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.10) to 1.62 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.54). A subset analysis in one of the cohort studies observed that ondansetron was specifically associated with cardiac septal defects (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.28); however, this association was not confirmed in other studies.

Several studies have assessed ondansetron and the risk of oral clefts with inconsistent findings. A retrospective cohort study of 1.8 million pregnancies in the U.S. Medicaid Database showed an increased risk of oral clefts among 88,467 pregnancies in which oral ondansetron was prescribed in the first trimester (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48), but no such association was reported with intravenous ondansetron in 23,866 pregnancies (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.43). In the subgroup of women who received both forms of administration, the RR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.93). Two case-control studies, using data from birth defects surveillance programs, reported conflicting results.

Regarding the medical management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, particularly in relation to antiemetics, the RCOG 2024 guidelines recommend recognizing that ondansetron is safe for use during pregnancy. It is advised not to discourage the use of ondansetron if first-line antiemetics prove ineffective. It is important to reassure patients about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with the use of ondansetron in the first trimester while balancing this with the risks associated with poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).

### The teratogenicity of drugs for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: perceived versus true risk [^113Zgcdt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Women and healthcare providers commonly overestimate the teratogenic risk of medications in pregnancy. With regard to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, this overestimation leads to an underutilization of pharmacologic therapy. In some circumstances, pregnancy termination has been elected when safe and effective alternatives for nausea have not been attempted. The misperception of teratogenic risk is partly the result of how safety data are presented. An awareness of this can lead to more balanced educational materials for patients and physicians. To facilitate rational use of medicinal and non-medicinal therapy for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, we have developed an algorithm based on a recent systematic review of safety and efficacy in managing the problem. The hierarchical use of medication is based on the strength of evidence of fetal safety.

In a double-blind, U.S. trial involving 336 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing either methotrexate or doxorubicin, ondansetron 8 mg administered twice a day was as effective as ondansetron 8 mg administered three times a day in preventing nausea and vomiting. It should be noted that ondansetron 8 mg taken three times daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Treatment response was assessed based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. Table 8 provides details of the dosage regimens studied and the results of this trial.

- **Re-treatment**: In single-arm trials, 148 patients undergoing cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy were re-treated with ondansetron 8 mg three times daily during subsequent chemotherapy. This accounted for a total of 396 re-treatment courses, where no emetic episodes occurred in 314 (79%) of the re-treatment courses, and only 1 to 2 emetic episodes were observed in 43 (11%) of the courses.

- **Pediatric trials**: Three open-label, single-arm, non-U.S. trials were conducted with 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer. They received various cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens. The initial dose of ondansetron injection ranged from 0.04 to 0.87 mg per kg (total dose between 2.16 mg and 12 mg), followed by oral doses of ondansetron ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In these trials, 58% of the 170 evaluable patients had a complete response, experiencing no emetic episodes on Day 1. In two trials, the response rates to ondansetron 4 mg three times daily were…

### Ondansetron use in pregnancy and birth defects: A systematic review [^1177WAcC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

To examine the risk of birth defects in children born to women who used ondansetron early in pregnancy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or hyperemesis gravidarum, researchers conducted a systematic review.

- **Data sources**: The databases used included PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, Journals@Ovid Fulltext, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar.

- **Methods of study selection**: Studies were included if they were written in English, included a comparison group of patients not exposed to ondansetron, and provided original research, human data, exposure to ondansetron during the first trimester, and data on structural birth defects as an outcome.

- **Tabulation, integration, and results**: A total of 423 records were identified. After accounting for duplicates and including only relevant articles, eight records met the criteria for review. Data from the various studies were conflicting. The three largest studies showed no increased risk of birth defects as a whole: 36 malformations in 1,233 exposed compared with 141 malformations in 4,932 unexposed; 58 in 1,248 exposed compared with 31,357 in 895,770 unexposed; and 38 in 1,349 exposed compared with 43,620 in 1,500,085 unexposed. The odds ratios (ORs) were 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–1.82), 1.3 (95% CI 1.0–1.7), and 0.95 (95% CI 0.72–1.26), respectively. However, two studies indicated a slightly increased risk of cardiac defects specifically, with ORs of 2.0 (95% CI 1.3–3.1) and 1.62 (95% CI 1.04–2.14), a finding not consistently replicated in other studies. The most consistent association (if any) appears to be a small increase in the incidence of cardiac defects.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^1135ZsjY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy - **Risk summary**: Published epidemiological studies on the association between ondansetron use and major birth defects have reported inconsistent findings. These studies possess important methodological limitations that preclude conclusions about the safety of ondansetron use in pregnancy [see Data]. Available postmarketing data have not identified a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of harm to the fetus when ondansetron was administered intravenously during organogenesis at approximately 3.6 and 2.9 times the maximum recommended human intravenous dose of 0.15 mg/kg given three times a day, based on body surface area (BSA), respectively [see Data].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, miscarriages, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Data**:

- **Human data**: Available data on ondansetron use in pregnant women from several published epidemiological studies preclude an assessment of a drug-associated risk of adverse fetal outcomes. This is due to important methodological limitations, including the uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription actually took the medication, the concomitant use of other medications or treatments, recall bias, and other unadjusted confounders.

### Getting through the day: A pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^1126uY4p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

This study provides much-needed information regarding women's experiences with anti-nausea medication during pregnancy. Our study and prior studies have shown that many women want and need symptom relief to function at home and work. Women in our study had a wide range of perceptions about the potential risks of these medications. This heterogeneity may be partly due to the lack of rigorous evidence about whether these medications are safe in pregnancy. There is no meaningful information about risks available from randomized trials, and there is ongoing debate about the quality and findings of prior observational (epidemiologic) studies.

Some women in our study expressed a desire for greater information about risks and benefits of anti-nausea medication use during pregnancy, including outcomes in diverse populations such as women from different racial and ethnic groups. Future research is needed to clarify the potential risks and effectiveness of widely used anti-nausea medications, including ondansetron, as was highlighted by a recent Cochrane systematic review. More broadly, research is needed to find safe options for managing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, and this research needs to include women with diverse backgrounds and characteristics.

Our research also sheds light on how women interpret evidence and what kinds of information they find meaningful and compelling. Future qualitative research is needed to understand the ways in which women utilize knowledge and weigh evidence in their decision-making. Such research could help clinicians better understandpatients' perspectives and improve communication strategies.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1,064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: a retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^116Nq5bv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common pregnancy complaints, affecting nearly 70% of pregnant women to some degree, from mild to severe. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is the most severe form of pregnancy sickness, which inhibits normal fluid and/or food intake and strongly limits activities of daily living. A global meta-analysis and a large UK population study found a prevalence of HG of 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively.

Secondary to persisting nausea and vomiting, HG can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and metabolic disturbances, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. In addition to maternal risks of anemia, hypertension, coagulopathy, and preeclampsia, HG is associated with low fetal birth weight and preterm birth. HG sufferers report symptoms that can be nearly unbearable, illustrated by the findings that half of the HG patients in a large UK survey considered terminating the pregnancy, and one in four experienced occasional suicidal ideation. Additionally, there is a considerable risk of recurrent HG in future pregnancies, and many who have had HG are reluctant to become pregnant again.

First-line antiemetics for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP)/HG have traditionally included antihistamines (meclizine, promethazine, and cyclizine) and dopamine antagonists (prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine), as these have reassuring evidence of safety in pregnancy. None of these has been demonstrated as significantly better in reducing NVP. If moderate NVP symptoms persist despite complementary treatment, guidelines generally recommend these.

### Ondansetron for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and the risk of specific birth defects [^1154t3iE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

To use data from two large studies of birth defects, the objective was to describe time trends in ondansetron use for the treatment of first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and to investigate associations, either previously reported or undescribed, between first-trimester ondansetron use and major birth defects.

- **Methods**: We used data from two case-control studies, the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (1997–2011) and the Slone Birth Defects Study (1997–2014). The prevalence of ondansetron use for the treatment of first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy among control patients was calculated in 2-year intervals. Using women with untreated first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as the reference, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between first-trimester ondansetron use for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and specific birth defects. A secondary exposure group of other prescription antiemetics was used to address confounding by indication.

- **Results**: In the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and Slone Birth Defects Study, respectively, 6,751 and 5,873 control mothers and 14,667 and 8,533 case mothers who reported first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were included in the analysis. Among women in the control group, ondansetron exposure increased from less than 1% before 2000 to 13% in 2013–2014. Ondansetron use was not associated with an increased risk for most of the 51 defect groups analyzed. Modest increases in risk were observed for cleft palate (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.3).

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: What does the gastroenterologist need to know [^1164cbRP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 L of water or drinks containing glucose, salt, and potassium is recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

Concerning the pharmacological treatment, antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine, and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al. evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery, or small-for-gestational-age infants. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects.

### Ondansetron pharmacokinetics in pregnant women and neonates: Towards a new treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome [^111p8jPC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is the drug of choice to prevent nausea in women undergoing cesarean surgery and can be used to prevent neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The pharmacokinetics of ondansetron have not been characterized in pregnant women or in newborns. A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to analyze plasma samples obtained from 20 nonpregnant and 40 pregnant women following a single administration of 4 or 8 mg ondansetron, from umbilical cord blood at delivery, and from neonates after birth.

The analysis indicates that ondansetron disposition is not affected by pregnancy (P > 0.05) but is influenced by dose (P < 0.05), and is characterized by rapid transplacental transfer and longer elimination half-life in neonates compared to their mothers. A dosing regimen for prevention of NAS was designed based on the model. The regimen involves IV administration of 4 mg to the mothers shortly before cord clamping or oral administration of 0.07 mg/kg (or equivalently 0.04 mg/kg IV) to neonates.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, the efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m², was confirmed.

- **Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the U.S. in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8 mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting. Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. The results of this trial are summarized in Table 7.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113TGAQt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received intravenous doses of ondansetron up to 10 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. With the exception of short periods of maternal weight loss and a slight increase in the incidence of early uterine deaths at the high dose level in rabbits, there were no significant effects of ondansetron on the maternal animals or the development of the offspring. At doses of 10 mg/kg/day in rats and 4 mg/kg/day in rabbits, the maternal exposure margin was approximately 3.6 and 2.9 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg given three times a day, respectively, based on body surface area (BSA).

No intravenous pre-and post-natal developmental toxicity study was performed with ondansetron. In an oral pre-and post-natal development study, pregnant rats received oral doses of ondansetron up to 15 mg/kg/day from Day 17 of pregnancy to litter Day 21. With the exception of a slight reduction in maternal body weight gain, there were no effects upon the pregnant rats and the pre-and post-natal development of their offspring, including the reproductive performance of the mated F1 generation.

- **Lactation**:

	- **Risk summary**: It is not known whether ondansetron is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of ondansetron on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. However, it has been demonstrated that ondansetron is present in the milk of rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk.

### Treatment of severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with subcutaneous medications [^111NUnrp]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We examined treatment outcomes in women with severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) receiving outpatient nursing support and either subcutaneous metoclopramide or subcutaneous ondansetron via a microinfusion pump. Among women receiving outpatient nursing services, we identified those diagnosed with severe NVP having a Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score greater than 12 at enrollment and prescribed either metoclopramide (N = 355) or ondansetron (N = 521) by their physician.

Maternal characteristics, response to treatment, and start versus stop values were compared between the medication groups. Allocation to each group was based on an intention-to-treat protocol. Maternal characteristics were similar between the groups. Days to reduction in PUQE score levels were similar (median 2 days for metoclopramide; 3 days for ondansetron; P = 0.206). Alteration from metoclopramide to ondansetron (31.8%) was more frequent than alteration from ondansetron to metoclopramide (4.4%; P < 0.001).

Improvement of NVP symptoms and reduced need for hospitalization were noted with both medications. Treatment with either metoclopramide or ondansetron resulted in significant improvement of NVP symptoms, with half of the women showing a reduction from severe symptoms to moderate or mild symptoms within 3 days of treatment initiation. Alteration in treatment was significantly greater in patients initially prescribed metoclopramide.

### Prescribing guidelines for ENT medications during pregnancy [^116dRU9t]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Profound physiological changes occur during pregnancy, which can alter the pharmacodynamics of drugs administered to pregnant women. Almost 85% of women take at least one prescription medication during pregnancy. Nearly every drug given to a mother crosses the placenta, and fetal drug levels can reach 50 to 100% of maternal serum concentrations. Given that many otolaryngologic conditions are associated with pregnancy, it is essential for otolaryngologists caring for pregnant patients to know which drugs are safe. Avoiding unnecessary prescriptions ensures the best care for the pregnant patient while protecting the unborn child. This article discusses the relative safety and efficacy of various drugs frequently prescribed for pregnant women by otolaryngologists.

### Acog practice bulletin no. 189 summary: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114Jf5uj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is advised to use it only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines recommend reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum. Ondansetron hydrochloride PO is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This medication has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran):

- **Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with hypersensitivity to selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists.

- **Mask symptoms of ileus, gastric distension**: Exercise caution in patients experiencing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or those who have undergone abdominal surgery.

- **Myocardial infarction**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia.

- **Prolonged QT interval**: Exercise caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those taking other QT-prolonging medications. Obtain ECG monitoring and avoid using ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been linked to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially in patients using concomitant serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue.

### Ondansetron in pregnancy and risk of adverse fetal outcomes [^112wEXW2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is frequently used to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but the safety of this drug for the fetus has not been well studied.

- **Methods**: We investigated the risk of adverse fetal outcomes associated with ondansetron administered during pregnancy. From a historical cohort of 608,385 pregnancies in Denmark, women who were exposed to ondansetron and those who were not exposed were included, in a 1:4 ratio, in propensity-score-matched analyses of spontaneous abortion (1,849 exposed women vs. 7,396 unexposed women), stillbirth (1,915 vs. 7,660), any major birth defect (1,233 vs. 4,932), preterm delivery (1,792 vs. 7,168), and birth of infants at low birth weight and small for gestational age (1,784 vs. 7,136). In addition, estimates were adjusted for hospitalization for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (as a proxy for severity) and the use of other antiemetics.

- **Results**: Receipt of ondansetron was not associated with a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion, which occurred in 1.1% of exposed women and 3.7% of unexposed women during gestational weeks 7 to 12 (hazard ratio: 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27 to 0.91) and in 1.0% and 2.1%, respectively, during weeks 13 to 22 (hazard ratio: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.29 to 1.21). Ondansetron also conferred no significantly increased risk of stillbirth (0.3% for exposed women and 0.4% for unexposed women; hazard ratio: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.10 to 1.73), any major birth defect (2.9% and 2.9%, respectively; prevalence odds ratio: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.82), preterm delivery (6.2% and 5.2%; prevalence odds).

### Getting through the day: A pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^112sLqpz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

While participants were selected into our focus group because they had all filled a prescription for anti-nausea medication, their pathways to getting a prescription varied. Women who participated in our study described experiencing nausea during their first trimester, during which time prenatal visits with providers occur less frequently than later in pregnancy. We learned that decision-making about taking anti-nausea medication began before being given a prescription as women made choices about scheduling early appointments to discuss nausea or ask for help in dealing with nausea.

Several women visited a provider in the first trimester for nausea and vomiting and were offered a prescription. Some women requested a prescription as a result of the severity of their symptoms and/or recommendations from friends and family members. Providers often initially recommended non-prescription treatment options such as over-the-counter vitamin B12 (pyridoxine) with or without doxylamine. Then, they provided a prescription for medication if the initial treatment approach did not provide relief, in keeping with clinical guidelines. The prescription medication women most often talked about using was ondansetron (brand name Zofran).

- **Participant experiences**:
	- **Focus Group 2, Participant 8**: I asked my doctor [for the medication]. Back then, I was just worried all the time how my baby was going to survive because I lost 15 pounds in a month.
	- **Focus Group 2, Participant 6**: I didn't even know to ask for the medicine until my friend who's a doctor and his wife had had twins.

### Ondansetron use in pregnancy [^11341ihX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy to stop progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. Nausea and vomiting and hyperemesis gravidarum typically occur during the first trimester, the sensitive time for exposure to teratogens because organogenesis is occurring in the embryo. An efficacious treatment used widely across the United States for both nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum is ondansetron. Recent studies have provided conflicting findings on the safety of ondansetron during pregnancy. There are numerous limitations in the literature on ondansetron safety, including exposure to the medication not being limited to sensitive windows of organogenesis, a lack of information on dosing and compliance, and the common use of self-reports of exposure. Additionally, there is an inadequate accounting for other factors that may explain the relationship between ondansetron exposure and adverse outcomes, and a lack of biologic plausibility by which ondansetron might cause harm. It is the authors' opinion that data do not support a reluctance to treat women with ondansetron in clinical practice.

### Ondansetron or droperidol for prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting after intrathecal morphine [^111dzc3G]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

There is a controversy regarding the best drug for prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving intrathecal morphine. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and tolerability of droperidol compared with ondansetron for the prevention of morphine-induced nausea and vomiting.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 120 women undergoing Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal morphine 0.1 mg received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg (n = 40), droperidol 1.25 mg (n = 40), or saline (n = 40) immediately after umbilical-cord clamping. Nausea and vomiting were graded according to intensity at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours.

- **Results**: Nausea or vomiting occurred in 14 patients (35%) in the placebo group, 4 (10%) in the ondansetron group, and 10 (25%) in the droperidol group; the difference between ondansetron and placebo was statistically significant (P = 0.007). Eleven of the 14 placebo patients (27.5%) vomited, compared with none of the 4 ondansetron patients (vs. placebo, P = 0.0004) and 5 of the droperidol patients (vs. placebo, P = 0.18). Three of the 14 placebo patients (7.5%) were nauseous, compared with 4 (10%) receiving ondansetron and 5 (12.5%) receiving droperidol.

- **Conclusions**: Ondansetron was effective in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving intrathecal morphine for Caesarean section.

### Serotonin syndrome after treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^114tGFgv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy often require pharmacotherapy for symptom management. Serotonin syndrome is a rare clinical entity that can be precipitated by the medications used to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

- **Case**: A 35-year-old pregnant individual with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum in an earlier pregnancy, requiring prolonged hospitalization, presented with nausea and vomiting at 7 weeks of gestation. She was incidentally found to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection when she was universally screened at the time of admission. She required pharmacotherapy, including prochlorperazine and ondansetron for treatment of nausea, as well as sumatriptan for migraine. She developed acute spasticity, autonomic dysfunction, and a temperature rise, precipitated by antiemetic therapy, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The syndrome resolved with supportive care and benzodiazepines.

- **Conclusion**: Serotonin syndrome is a serious clinical entity that can be provoked by the pharmacotherapy given to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This medical emergency requires early recognition and prompt management.

### Evidence-based view of safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) [^111CKyjg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Our goal was to review the safety and effectiveness of available antiemetics for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. We performed a quantitative and qualitative overview of observational controlled studies for drug safety in pregnancy and randomized controlled trials for drug effectiveness for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

All of the following are safe and effective for the treatment of varying degrees of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: Bendectin/Diclectin (doxylamine, pyridoxine, dicyclomine), antihistamine (H(1)) blockers, and phenothiazines. However, the magnitude of effect, particularly for phenothiazines, is in question and may differ among individual agents. Pyridoxine and vitamin B(12) are safe and may be effective. Metoclopramide, droperidol, and ondansetron may be effective, but safety data are insufficient to recommend them as first-line agents. Corticosteroids may not be as beneficial as first thought, and there may be a small teratogenic risk. The relative effectiveness of various agents is largely unknown.

In conclusion, many medications, particularly H(1)-antagonists and phenothiazines, are safe and effective for the treatment of varying degrees of NVP.

### Comparing the efficacy of prophylactic metoclopramide, ondansetron, and placebo in cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia [^115pBton]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare the relative efficacy of prophylactic metoclopramide, ondansetron, and placebo in nonemergent cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia intraoperatively and for the first 24-hour period after delivery. The setting for the study was an inpatient obstetric unit at a university hospital center, including 164 nonemergent cesarean section patients.

- **Intervention**: At the time of umbilical cord clamping, patients received intravenously (IV) either 4 mg ondansetron (Group O), 10 mg metoclopramide (Group M), or 10 mL normal saline (Group P).

- **Measurements and main results**: Episodes and severity of nausea and vomiting, rescue antiemetic requirement, patient satisfaction, and side effects were recorded. The frequency of intraoperative nausea was 24%, 43%, and 57% for Group O, Group M, and Group P, respectively (p < 0.03). The frequency of nausea for the 24-hour study period was 26%, 51%, and 71% for Groups O, M, and P, respectively (p < 0.03). The frequency of intraoperative and postoperative vomiting was similar between Group O and Group M but significantly higher in Group P (p < 0.05). Overall patient satisfaction was highest in Group O compared with Groups P and M (p < 0.05). Maximum analog sedation score was higher in Group M compared to Groups O and P (p < 0.05).

In conclusion, in cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia, prophylactic ondansetron, 4 mg IV, is more efficacious and has a higher patient satisfaction than metoclopramide, 10 mg IV, or placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^112Fdeks]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting**: In two randomized, double-blind monotherapy trials, a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron was superior to a relevant historical placebo control in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/m². Steroid administration was excluded from these clinical trials. More than 90% of patients receiving a cisplatin dose greater than or equal to 50 mg/m² in the historical-placebo comparator experienced vomiting in the absence of antiemetic therapy.

The first trial compared oral doses of ondansetron: 24 mg as a single dose, 8 mg every 8 hours for two doses, and 32 mg as a single dose in 357 adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m². The first or single dose was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. A total of 66% of patients in the ondansetron 24 mg once-a-day group, 55% in the ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group, and 55% in the ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group completed the 24-hour trial period with zero emetic episodes and no rescue antiemetic medications, meeting the primary endpoint of efficacy. Each of the three treatment groups was statistically significantly superior to a historical placebo control.

### Association of maternal first-trimester ondansetron use with cardiac malformations and oral clefts in offspring [^115acDb1]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in addressing the limited and conflicting evidence regarding the fetal safety of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist commonly prescribed for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

The objective was to evaluate the association between ondansetron exposure during pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations. This retrospective cohort study was nested in the 2000–2013 nationwide Medicaid Analytic eXtract. It included 1,816,414 pregnancies contributed by 1,502,895 women enrolled in Medicaid from three months before the last menstrual period through at least one month after delivery. Infants were enrolled in Medicaid for at least three months post-birth. The final follow-up date was December 31, 2013. Analyses were conducted between November 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018. Propensity score stratification was utilized to control for treatment indication and other confounders.

The exposure of interest was ondansetron dispensing during the first trimester, which is the period of organogenesis. The primary outcomes were cardiac malformations and oral clefts diagnosed during the first 90 days after delivery. Secondary outcomes included congenital malformations overall and subgroups of cardiac malformations and oral clefts.

Results showed that among 1,816,414 pregnancies (mean age of mothers, 24.3 [5.8] years), 88,467 (4.9%) were exposed to ondansetron during the first trimester. In total, 14,577 of 1,727,947 unexposed and 835 of 88,467 exposed infants were diagnosed with a cardiac malformation, resulting in an absolute risk of 84.4 (95% CI, 83.0 to 85.7) and 94.4 (95% CI, 88.0).

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Ne1WE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

The dose-dependent effect of ondansetron on shivering was explored by Powell et al, who found it was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in shivering; however, this effect was not observed in pooled data. For instance, the incidence of shivering was 10% in individuals weighing approximately 52 kg using a low dose of ondansetron (4 mg), whereas Powell et al. reported an 8% incidence in individuals weighing about 76 kg with a high dose (8 mg). We speculate that the varying weights of subjects might obscure the dose-dependent effect.

Compared to other drugs, ondansetron lacks a hemodynamic effect in the treatment and prevention of postanesthesia shivering (PAS), significantly contributing to its safety profile. Hence, the finding of no significant difference in bradycardia between ondansetron and a placebo group is acceptable despite a limited sample size. Additionally, two recent studies demonstrated that ondansetron is safe for use in pregnant women and fetuses.

Apart from the primary outcome of PAS and the side effect of bradycardia, other side effects were mentioned but were not suitable for quantitative analysis. Among these, no significant risk of convulsion, myoclonus, rash, pruritus, headache, pain, hypotension, sedation, nausea, or vomiting was indicated.

Ondansetron exposure in utero has not been associated with overall major congenital malformations in aggregate analyses. One large retrospective cohort study examined 1,970 women who received a prescription for ondansetron during pregnancy and reported no association between ondansetron exposure and major congenital malformations, miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, infants of low birth weight, or infants small for gestational age.

Two large retrospective cohort studies and one case-control study have assessed ondansetron exposure in the first trimester and risk of cardiovascular defects with inconsistent findings. Relative risks (RR) ranged from 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.10) to 1.62 (95% CI 1.04, 2.54). A subset analysis in one of the cohort studies observed that ondansetron was specifically associated with cardiac septal defects (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.19, 3.28); however, this association was not confirmed in other studies.

Several studies have assessed ondansetron and the risk of oral clefts with inconsistent findings. A retrospective cohort study of 1.8 million pregnancies in the U.S. Medicaid Database showed an increased risk of oral clefts among 88,467 pregnancies in which oral ondansetron was prescribed in the first trimester (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03, 1.48), but no such association was reported with intravenous ondansetron in 23,866 pregnancies (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.63, 1.43). In the subgroup of women who received both forms of administration, the RR was 1.07 (95% CI 0.59, 1.93). Two case-control studies, using data from birth defects surveillance programs, reported conflicting results.

Risk summary

Published epidemiological studies on the association between ondansetron use and major birth defects have reported inconsistent findings and have important methodological limitations that preclude conclusions about the safety of ondansetron use in pregnancy (see Data). Available postmarketing data have not identified a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of harm to the fetus when ondansetron was administered during organogenesis at approximately 6 and 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA), respectively (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, miscarriages, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Data**: Available data on ondansetron use in pregnant women from several published epidemiological studies preclude an assessment of a drug-associated risk of adverse fetal outcomes. Important methodological limitations include the uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription actually took the medication, the concomitant use of other medications or treatments, recall bias, and other unadjusted confounders.

### Therapy insight: Drugs for gastrointestinal disorders in pregnant women [^115aPZyE]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The management and treatment of gastrointestinal ailments in pregnant women require special attention and expertise, as the safety of the mother, fetus, and neonate remains the primary focus. Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are common, as is symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Peptic ulcer disease occurs less frequently and with fewer complications. Gastroenterologists and obstetricians should be familiar with safe treatment options for these conditions because they can profoundly impair the quality of life of pregnant women.

During pregnancy, constipation can develop de novo, or chronic constipation can increase in severity. Given the array of therapies for constipation, physicians must apprise themselves of drugs that are safe for both mother and fetus. Management of acute, self-limited diarrhea should focus on supportive therapy, dietary changes, and maintenance of hydration. Treatment of chronic diarrhea should be considered in the context of therapy for the underlying disorder.

Inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome present a unique therapeutic challenge — to control the disease while minimizing toxicity to the fetus and mother. Initiation and alteration of medical therapy for gastrointestinal disorders during pregnancy must be undertaken after discussion with the patient's obstetrician.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^115jXL5z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Low credibility.

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, characterized by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure, acupuncture, antihistamines, corticosteroids, corticotrophins, diazepam, dietary interventions other than ginger, domperidone, ginger, and metoclopramide.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^111S3j1D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron have been established in pediatric patients aged 4 years and older for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Use of ondansetron in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of ondansetron in adults, with additional data from three open-label, uncontrolled, non-US trials in 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or non-cisplatin regimens [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Additional information on the use of ondansetron in pediatric patients may be found in the Ondansetron Injection prescribing information.

The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron have not been established in pediatric patients for:

- **Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy**
- **Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy**
- **Prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting**

Of the total number of subjects enrolled in cancer chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting in U.S. and foreign-controlled clinical trials, for which there were subgroup analyses, 938 (19%) were aged 65 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years of age and older and younger subjects. A reduction in clearance and an increase in elimination half-life were seen in patients older than 75 years compared with younger patients.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^112gHHMz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Ondansetron exposure in utero has not been associated with overall major congenital malformations in aggregate analyses. One large retrospective cohort study examined 1,970 women who received a prescription for ondansetron during pregnancy and reported no association between ondansetron exposure and major congenital malformations, miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, infants of low birth weight, or infants small for gestational age. Important methodological limitations with these studies include the uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription actually took the medication, the concomitant use of other medications or treatments, and other unadjusted confounders that may account for the study findings.

A case-control study evaluating associations between several common non-cardiac malformations and multiple antiemetic drugs reported an association between maternal use of ondansetron and isolated cleft palate (reported adjusted OR = 2.37 [95% CI (1.18, 4.76)]). However, this association could be a chance finding, given the large number of drug-birth defect comparisons in this study. It is unknown whether ondansetron exposure in utero in the cases of cleft palate occurred during the time of palate formation (the palate is formed between the 6th and 9th weeks of pregnancy) or whether mothers of infants with cleft palate used other medications or had other risk factors for cleft palate in the offspring. In addition, no cases of isolated cleft palate were identified in the aforementioned two large retrospective cohort studies. At this time, there is no clear evidence.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^1154hqWY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Another agent which has been examined sufficiently for its compatibility with pregnancy and its potency against nausea and vomiting is metoclopramide. In utero exposure to metoclopramide during the first trimester was not associated with significantly increased risks of major congenital malformations, low birth weight (LBW), pre-term delivery, or perinatal death. Additionally, a very large study comparing pregnancy outcomes between exposed and unexposed mothers found no link between exposure and 20 individual major congenital malformation categories, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth.

Despite the unanimity regarding metoclopramide's safety during pregnancy, there are some serious issues concerning maternal side effects. Although comparable to ondansetron, metoclopramide is associated with an increased frequency of drowsiness and dry mouth. More importantly, prolonged administration — beyond 12 weeks — is correlated with the development of irreversible tardive dyskinesia (FDA black box warning), especially in females.

### Major congenital malformation risk after first trimester gestational exposure to oral or intravenous ondansetron [^115YTdii]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is a 5-HT₃ receptor antagonist that has been approved for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. It has also been studied in the treatment of many neuropsychiatric and medical conditions. The drug is commonly used off-label to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). Ondansetron crosses the placental barrier, and concerns have been expressed that using ondansetron for NVP/HG during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) in the offspring.

In this context, findings from a meta-analysis of six cohort and two case-control studies, along with the results of subsequently published cohort (n = 3) and case-control (n = 1) studies, suggest that a signal exists to associate early gestational exposure to ondansetron with an increased risk of heart defects and orofacial defects. Arguments both for and against confounding by indication have been proposed to explain these findings.

Nevertheless, even if ondansetron is causally implicated in MCM risk, the absolute increase in risk, such as for orofacial clefts (by 0.03%) and ventricular septal defect (by 0.3%), is small. These small risks should be balanced against the risks associated with inadequately treated NVP/HG, and decision-making must be shared between clinician and patient. Repeated fetal scanning during the second trimester can help in the early detection of malformations, if present.

- **Efficacy analysis**: Investigated using an "all-patients-treated" approach.

- **Median assessment**: Undefined because at least 50% of the patients were rescued or experienced more than five emetic episodes.

- **Visual analog scale assessment of nausea**: Ranged from 0 (no nausea) to 100 (nausea as bad as it can be).

- **Visual analog scale assessment of satisfaction**: Ranged from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 100 (totally satisfied).

Ondansetron injection (0.15 mg/kg x 3 doses) was compared with metoclopramide (2 mg/kg x 6 doses) in a single-blind trial with 307 patients receiving cisplatin doses ≥ 100 mg/m², with or without additional chemotherapeutic agents. The first dose of ondansetron or metoclopramide was administered 30 minutes prior to cisplatin infusion. Two subsequent doses of ondansetron were given 4 and 8 hours later, whereas five additional doses of metoclopramide were provided 2, 4, 7, 10, and 13 hours later. Cisplatin was infused over a period of 3 hours or less. Vomiting and retching episodes were recorded over a 24-hour period following the cisplatin administration. The results of this trial were summarized in Table 8.

### Over-the-counter medications in pregnancy [^111NGFuu]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

High-quality research on the safety and effectiveness of over-the-counter medications in pregnancy is limited. Physicians should explore nonpharmacologic treatments before recommending medication. For nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), H1 antihistamines, and ginger are safe and effective. Physicians can recommend calcium carbonate, H2 antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Osmotic laxatives, fiber preparations, and probiotics are safe and effective treatments for constipation.

Many over-the-counter topical medications are safe in pregnancy due to low systemic absorption, but topical retinoids, such as adapalene, should be avoided. Hypertonic saline nasal rinse and antihistamines are safe, beneficial options for treating pregnancy-induced rhinitis, and intranasal corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit for chronic allergic rhinitis. The safety of acetaminophen for the treatment of headaches and low back pain during pregnancy has come into question with recent studies; therefore, judicious use is advised.

Physicians should screen all pregnant patients for their risk of developing preeclampsia and initiate low-dose aspirin from 12 weeks' gestation until delivery for those at increased risk. Data are limited on the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements during pregnancy.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: A cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^1122Bqyk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

During the 2-month study period in each country, a total of 9,113 women were included in the study. Respondents who were residents of Europe — Western (n = 3,201), Northern (n = 2,820), Eastern (n = 2,342) — constituted the largest proportion of the total study population, followed by North America (n = 533) and Australia (n = 217).

At the time of completing the questionnaire, 4,938 (54.2%) of the women were pregnant and 4,175 (45.8%) had given birth during the previous year. Among the pregnant respondents, 1,067 (21.6%), 1,656 (33.5%), and 2,214 (44.8%) were in the first, second, and third trimester of their pregnancy, respectively, and 182 (3.7%) were less than 6 weeks pregnant. A total of 1,913 (45.8%) of the mothers had an infant less than 24 weeks of age.

Among the respondents, 6,701 (73.5%) had experienced nausea during pregnancy; 1,828 (27.3%) used some form of treatment against nausea and 4,873 (72.7%) did not. Conventional medicines against nausea were used by 1,201 (17.9%) of the women and herbal medicines by 556 (8.3%).

Both the prevalence of nausea and its treatment varied by country and region. The prevalence of nausea ranged from 62.0% in Russia to 84.5% in Iceland. The proportion of respondents treated among those who suffered from nausea ranged from 10.4% in Finland to 53.2% in France. The next highest proportions were in Switzerland (48.9%), Canada (48.0%), and Australia (48.0%). In 11 countries, the treatment rates were below 30%. Among the regions, Australia (48.0%) and North America (41.2%) had the highest rates.

### Treating morning sickness in the United States — changes in prescribing are needed [^1168D1QG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Presently, 97.7% of prescriptions for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in the United States are with medications not labeled for use in pregnancy, not indicated for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, and not classified as safe in pregnancy by the Food and Drug Administration. The use of ondansetron for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy has increased from 50,000 monthly prescriptions in 2008 to 110,000 at the end of 2013, despite unresolved issues regarding fetal safety and Food and Drug Administration warnings about serious dysrhythmias. In April 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine specifically for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy symptoms. Now that a safe and effective drug is available in the United States, there is no reason for women to be exposed to a drug of unproven maternal and fetal safety.

### Ondansetron compared with doxylamine and pyridoxine for treatment of nausea in pregnancy: A randomized controlled trial [^1119gszu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). High credibility.

To evaluate whether ondansetron or the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine was superior for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, a double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Women experiencing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy were assigned to receive either 4 mg of ondansetron plus a placebo tablet or 25 mg pyridoxine plus 12.5 mg of doxylamine for 5 days. The primary outcome measured was an improvement in nausea as reported on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included a reduction in vomiting on the VAS and the proportion of patients reporting sedation or constipation while undergoing either treatment regimen.

Thirty-six women were randomized into two groups — 18 receiving ondansetron and 18 receiving pyridoxine and doxylamine. Of these, 13 women (72%) in the ondansetron group and 17 women (94%) in the pyridoxine and doxylamine group completed the follow-up. No significant differences were found between the groups concerning demographic characteristics or baseline nausea. Patients treated with ondansetron showed a more considerable improvement in baseline nausea compared to those using pyridoxine and doxylamine over the 5-day treatment period (median VAS score decreased by 51 mm [interquartile range 37–64] compared to 20 mm [8–51]; p = 0.019). Additionally, women using ondansetron reported less vomiting (median VAS decreased by 41 [interquartile range 17–57] compared to 17 [-4 to 38]; p = 0.049). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding sedation or constipation.

In conclusion, our investigation demonstrated that ondansetron is superior to the combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine in treating nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

### Pharmacogenetic predictors of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy severity and response to antiemetic therapy: a pilot study [^114jJncF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80% of all pregnant women. Although NVP is most common during the first trimester of pregnancy, as many as 20% of pregnant women are affected beyond 12 weeks of gestation and throughout the day (versus isolated to the morning hours). Of the women affected, 1 to 3% experience a severe form of NVP called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which includes weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. In mild cases, NVP causes discomfort and inconvenience; however, HG can pose significant risks to the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus — often necessitating hospitalization. Even milder cases of NVP can significantly impact a woman's quality of life and contribute to health care costs and time lost from work. Termination of otherwise wanted pregnancies has been reported in women suffering from severe, prolonged NVP. However, because NVP is rarely life-threatening, the goal of pharmacologic treatment is typically to improve the quality of life for affected pregnant women.

Several dopamine antagonist antiemetics commonly used in pregnancy also act as weak serotonin receptor antagonists. These include promethazine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide. Additionally, the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist ondansetron is often used as an antiemetic in pregnancy. These antiemetics have been studied extensively and all seem to be safe for use in pregnancy. However, the response to these medications in the treatment of NVP is highly variable.
