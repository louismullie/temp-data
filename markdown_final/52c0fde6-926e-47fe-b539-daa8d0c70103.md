## Question

Black diarrhea in 2 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a 2-year-old with black diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this black stool truly represents melena versus a benign discoloration. Then, I should verify the immediate stabilization priorities, especially dehydration and hemodynamic status. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis for a toddler with possible upper GI bleeding. After that, I need to outline targeted diagnostics, including when to test for H. pylori, STEC, and other pathogens. Finally, I will define management, including rehydration, when to transfuse, acid suppression, and indications for endoscopy, while double-checking medication safety in this age group and ensuring follow-up for complications like HUS and anemia [^114JmKZm] [^112Mr8D9].

> Let me first confirm the nature of the black stool, because I need to ensure we are not overcalling melena. Melena reflects oxidized hemoglobin from upper GI bleeding and is typically tarry and malodorous; however, black discoloration can also be dietary or medication-related, such as iron, bismuth, charcoal, or even ingested blood from foods like pork blood soup, so I should ask explicitly about supplements, medications, and recent meals before concluding melena [^116zMWmW]. Hold on, I should verify stool characteristics and, if uncertain, perform a fecal occult blood test to confirm the presence of blood before proceeding down an invasive pathway [^notfound].

> Next, I should review immediate stabilization, because dehydration and hemodynamic compromise are the most dangerous early complications. I need to check vital signs, perfusion, mental status, and quantify dehydration using clinical signs such as delayed capillary refill, sunken eyes, and skin turgor; in children, severe dehydration increases mortality risk and must be addressed urgently with isotonic crystalloids and oral rehydration as appropriate [^114JmKZm]. Wait, let me verify the rehydration plan: for mild to moderate dehydration, reduced-osmolarity ORS at 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours is recommended, with nasogastric ORS if oral intake is not tolerated; for severe dehydration, 20 mL/kg isotonic IV boluses are indicated until perfusion normalizes, and malnourished infants may benefit from smaller, more frequent boluses [^115oX9BJ] [^116JZifh].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis for true melena in a 2-year-old, keeping in mind that upper GI sources predominate. Peptic ulcer disease, including H. pylori-associated ulcers, is a key consideration in this age group, and I should ask about epigastric pain, NSAID exposure, and family history; if suspected, noninvasive H. pylori testing can be considered, recognizing that stool antigen or urea breath tests are preferred in children over serology, which is not recommended for acute diarrhea etiology [^112fcktm]. But wait, what if there is portal hypertension or varices? Although less common in toddlers, liver disease and variceal bleeding remain on the list, particularly with known chronic liver disease or umbilical vein catheterization history, so I should check for stigmata of chronic liver disease and splenomegaly [^notfound]. Mallory-Weiss tears can occur after forceful vomiting, and I should ask about recent emesis; swallowed blood from epistaxis or oral trauma can mimic melena, so I need to inspect the oropharynx and nose carefully before attributing the source to the GI tract [^notfound]. Finally, I should not forget ingestion of iron or bismuth as mimics, which I already noted above [^116zMWmW].

> Let me consider additional causes that, while less likely to cause frank melena, can present with bleeding and diarrhea in toddlers. Infectious colitis with dysentery typically causes bright red blood rather than black tarry stools, but severe mucosal injury can occasionally lead to darker blood if transit is slowed; Shigella, Campylobacter, and STEC are key pathogens, and I should tailor testing to the clinical picture and epidemiology [^114JmKZm]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought C. difficile could be a plausible cause here, but hold on, I should verify pediatric testing guidance; routine testing in children under 2 years is discouraged due to high colonization rates, so I should avoid C. difficile testing unless there is a compelling exposure history and other causes have been excluded, which tempers my initial impulse to order it reflexively [^116cehL1] [^1152Fry5]. I also need to keep Meckel's diverticulum and other small bowel lesions in mind if bleeding recurs or if imaging suggests a lead point, especially if hematochezia predominates later in the course [^notfound].

> Next, I should review targeted diagnostics, and I need to ensure I do not overtest while missing high-yield studies. Basic labs should include CBC to assess anemia and thrombocytopenia, electrolytes and renal function for dehydration-related derangements, coagulation studies if liver disease is suspected, and type and crossmatch if transfusion is anticipated; blood cultures are indicated if there are systemic signs or concern for enteric fever, particularly in infants under 3 months or immunocompromised hosts [^113qt2r5] [^116Yy3yK]. For stool testing, I should confirm blood with a fecal occult test and then, if infectious etiology is suspected, send bacterial cultures for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and test for STEC if there is bloody diarrhea or epidemiologic risk; I should avoid routine parasite testing in immunocompetent children with acute community-acquired diarrhea unless risks or persistence suggest otherwise [^114JmKZm] [^112iFnqa]. If H. pylori is suspected, stool antigen testing is reasonable; serology for diarrhea etiology is not recommended, so I should not order it reflexively [^112fcktm]. If bleeding persists or the source remains unclear, I should arrange pediatric GI consultation for upper endoscopy, which is both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic [^notfound].

> I should double-check indications for emergent endoscopy, because timing matters in ongoing upper GI bleeding. Active melena with hemodynamic instability, ongoing transfusion requirement, or suspected variceal bleeding warrants urgent endoscopy; in stable children with suspected peptic ulcer disease, semi-elective EGD within 24 hours is reasonable to confirm diagnosis and enable hemostasis and H. pylori-directed therapy [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating this with lower GI bleeding indications; colonoscopy is not first-line for melena unless there is evidence of a lower source or if upper endoscopy is unrevealing, so I need to align the scope choice with the presumed anatomy [^notfound].

> Now, I will outline management principles, starting with supportive care, because most children will improve with rehydration and careful monitoring. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is first-line for mild to moderate dehydration, with NG administration if oral intake fails; after rehydration, I should resume an age-appropriate diet promptly and continue breastfeeding if applicable, as this supports recovery and nutrition [^115oX9BJ] [^114vDXPN]. I need to ensure I avoid harmful medications; loperamide is contraindicated in children under 18 years with acute diarrhea, and antimotility agents should be avoided in inflammatory or bloody diarrhea due to risk of toxic megacolon, so I must not prescribe them here [^113DRoeK] [^114fuMUB]. If vomiting impedes ORS, ondansetron can be considered in children older than 4 years to facilitate oral rehydration, but I should confirm age and use the lowest effective dose [^117S7csM].

> For acid suppression, I should confirm the indication before prescribing. If peptic ulcer disease or H. pylori is suspected or confirmed, a proton pump inhibitor is appropriate, and if H. pylori is present, eradication therapy should follow pediatric regimens guided by local resistance patterns; if no ulcer disease is identified, routine PPI use is not indicated for melena alone, so I should avoid unnecessary acid suppression [^notfound]. Let me reconsider whether any other medications are appropriate; beyond rehydration and, when indicated, acid suppression and H. pylori therapy, most toddlers with melena do not require additional pharmacologic therapy unless a specific etiology is identified [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address transfusion thresholds and iron therapy thoughtfully. If hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL in a symptomatic child, or if there is ongoing bleeding with hemodynamic compromise, packed red cell transfusion is indicated; after stabilization, if iron deficiency is confirmed, age-appropriate iron supplementation should be initiated, and I should monitor the reticulocyte response and hemoglobin recovery [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing ongoing blood loss; serial CBCs and clinical reassessment for recurrent melena are essential to detect rebleeding early [^notfound].

> Next, I should review follow-up and complications, and I must not forget HUS surveillance after any STEC-associated diarrheal illness. Even if the initial presentation is melena rather than classic dysentery, if STEC is confirmed or strongly suspected, I should monitor renal function, platelets, and hemoglobin for approximately 2 weeks to detect hemolytic uremic syndrome, which carries significant morbidity and mortality in young children [^114JmKZm] [^112Mr8D9]. I should also arrange outpatient follow-up within 1–2 weeks to reassess for recurrent bleeding, anemia resolution, and growth trajectory, escalating to endoscopy if symptoms persist or recur despite initial management [^notfound].

> Finally, I should confirm discharge readiness criteria before sending the child home. Stable vital signs, adequate oral intake with successful ORS trial, no active bleeding for at least 24 hours, reliable caregivers, and clear return precautions for recurrent melena, vomiting, abdominal pain, or signs of dehydration are essential; I should also provide anticipatory guidance on diet resumption and medication administration, and ensure close primary care follow-up within 48–72 hours [^115oX9BJ] [^114vDXPN].

Black diarrhea in a 2-year-old is most often due to **upper gastrointestinal bleeding** (peptic ulcer, gastritis, esophagitis, varices) or **ingestion of iron/bismuth** (medications, supplements, or foods) [^116zMWmW]. It can also result from **swallowed blood** from epistaxis or oral trauma, or from Meckel's diverticulum [^notfound]. Immediate evaluation is required to distinguish true melena from dietary causes, assess for dehydration or anemia, and identify the bleeding source. Management includes **oral rehydration** [^115oX9BJ], **supportive care**, and **targeted therapy** based on the cause; avoid empiric antibiotics unless sepsis or specific pathogens are suspected [^115g8TM3].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Obtain a **detailed history**, including:

- **Onset and duration**: Acute vs. chronic.
- **Associated symptoms**: Abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, weight loss, pallor.
- **Dietary history**: Recent ingestion of iron supplements, bismuth-containing medications, or dark-colored foods [^116zMWmW].
- **Medication history**: NSAIDs, antibiotics, anticoagulants.
- **Family history**: Gastrointestinal bleeding disorders, inflammatory bowel disease.
- **Recent illnesses**: Respiratory infections, trauma, dental procedures.

---

### Physical examination

Assess **general appearance** for signs of illness, pallor, jaundice, and digital clubbing. Evaluate **vital signs** for tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. Perform an **abdominal examination** for distension, tenderness, masses, or organomegaly. Inspect the **oral cavity and nasopharynx** for bleeding or trauma, and perform a **rectal examination** for fissures, polyps, or masses.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia.
- **Basic metabolic panel**: Assess electrolyte disturbances, renal function.
- **Coagulation profile**: PT, aPTT, INR.
- **Stool studies**: Occult blood test, bacterial cultures, viral PCR, ova and parasites [^112iFnqa].
- **Helicobacter pylori testing**: Stool antigen test or urea breath test if indicated.

---

### Imaging studies

Ultrasound is the **first-line modality** to evaluate for structural abnormalities, such as Meckel's diverticulum, polyps, or intussusception [^117TMLgG]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or if a lower GI source is suspected, consider a **contrast enema**. Use **upper endoscopy** for persistent or severe upper GI bleeding.

---

## Management

### Supportive care

Supportive care focuses on **oral rehydration therapy** with reduced-osmolarity ORS for mild to moderate dehydration [^111KxZ6T]. Continue **age-appropriate feeding** — including breastfeeding or formula — throughout the illness [^114vDXPN]. Avoid **antimotility agents** such as loperamide in children [^113DRoeK].

---

### Specific therapies

- **Iron supplementation**: Discontinue if iron overdose is suspected.
- **Antibiotic therapy**: Indicated only if bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected (e.g. H. pylori, Shigella) [^115g8TM3].
- **Endoscopic therapy**: Hemostasis techniques (e.g. injection, cautery, clips) for active bleeding.
- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for structural abnormalities (e.g. Meckel's diverticulum, polyps) or uncontrolled bleeding.

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, the severity of bleeding, and the timeliness of intervention. Complications may include **anemia**, **hypovolemic shock**, **electrolyte disturbances**, and **growth impairment** [^114L4z5M].

---

## When to seek immediate medical attention

Seek immediate medical attention for **severe dehydration** (lethargy, sunken eyes, poor skin turgor), **persistent vomiting**, **signs of shock** (tachycardia, hypotension, cold extremities), **passage of large amounts of blood**, or **altered mental status**.

Background

Studies examining the etiology-specific effects of diarrheal disease on growth are limited and variable in their analytic methods, making comparisons difficult and priority setting based on these findings challenging. A study by Black et al (Black RE, Brown KH, Becker S. Effects of diarrhea associated with specific enteropathogens on the growth of children in rural Bangladesh. Pediatrics. 1984;33:1004–1009.) examined the association between Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-related disease and weight gain and linear growth in Bangladeshi children aged 0–5 years. We estimated similar associations in a 2002 cohort of 0- to 6-year-old children in the Peruvian Amazon.

Methods

Diarrheal surveillence was conducted using household visits 3 times per week. Anthropometry was collected monthly. Mixed-effect models were used to estimate the association between Shigella, ETEC and Campylobacter diarrhea and weight gain in a 2-month period and linear growth over a 9-month period. Diarrheal disease burdens and growth intervals were quantified so as to be as comparable as possible to the original report.

Results

Shigella- and ETEC-associated diarrhea were not associated with diminished weight gain, although the association between ETEC diarrhea and weight gain (-4.5 g/percent of days spent with ETEC, P = 0.098) was twice that of other etiologic agents, as well as similar in magnitude to the original report. Shigella-associated diarrhea was associated with decreased linear growth (0.055 cm less growth/percent days, P = 0.008), also similar to the original study.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that associations between enteropathogen-specific diarrheal episodes and growth, particularly Shigella, are comparable across geographic and epidemiological contexts.

### Diarrhea-associated mortality in children less than 5 years of age in the United States, 2005–2016 [^116pDToC]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Diarrheal disease morbidity decreased after the 2006 US introduction of rotavirus vaccine. We calculated diarrheal death rates for children who were < 5 years of age during 2005–2016. Death rates declined from 2.3/100,000 (2005–2006) to 1.7/100,000 (2014–2016). Declines were seen among 1- to 23-month olds, white and black children. Further exploration of the role of rotavirus vaccine in decreasing deaths among children is warranted.

### Toddler diarrhoea: is it a useful diagnostic label? [^117HYu8c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Toddler diarrhoea is a term coined many years ago to describe a young child who passes several loose stools a day but who is otherwise healthy with excellent growth and normal examination. It could be argued that it is not an appropriate diagnostic term as it potentially stops the clinician from thinking about the possible causes of loose stools in this clinical situation. This article, which follows a debate between the authors on the topic at the 2010 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Annual meeting, discusses the differential diagnoses of a young child presenting with the so-called toddler diarrhoea.

### The sanitation hygiene infant nutrition efficacy (SHINE) trial: rationale, design, and methods [^112cLNuE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Studies estimating the effect of diarrhea on linear growth have reached inconsistent conclusions. In a pooled analysis of 9 studies that together collected diarrhea and growth data on 1393 children, the odds of stunting at 24 months increased multiplicatively by 2.5% per episode of diarrhea, and 25% of all stunting among 24-month-old children was attributable to having 5 or more episodes of diarrhea in the first 2 years of life. In other studies, the observed effect of diarrhea on long-term linear growth was small or absent because children grew at higher-than-average "catch-up" growth rates between illness episodes. Most recently, an analysis of 7 longitudinal cohort studies of children aged < 2 years, conducted in 4 low-income countries, estimated that the average child's diarrhea burden (46 days with diarrhea between birth and 2 years) was associated with a 0.38-cm height deficit at 2 years of age. Because a change in LAZ of 1.0 at 2 years is equivalent to approximately 3 cm, their analysis suggests that the growth effect of reducing diarrhea during the first 2 years of life from the average burden currently experienced in low-income countries to zero is a statistically significant but clinically modest LAZ score of approximately 0.13, or about 7% (one-fifteenth) of the average height deficit of 2-year-old Asian and African children.

Like stunting, childhood anemia is a major public health problem in Africa and Asia and a primary cause of cognitive and behavioral developmental delay throughout childhood and adolescence. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease ranks iron deficiency anemia as the 15th leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life-years globally. Anemia becomes prevalent in the second half of infancy and peaks between 12 and 24 months of age, affecting well over half of all children in Africa and Asia. Iron deficiency causes about half of the anemia among children under 2. Accordingly, increasing iron intake by young children has been the focus of most research and public health programming, and, in randomized trials, iron supplements or iron-fortified foods reduce anemia in young children by about 37%–62%, leaving a substantial portion of child anemia unaddressed.

### A "rare" case of melena in a 3-year-old [^116zMWmW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Melena is a potential sign of life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, there are numerous substances ingested resulting in a stool appearance similar to melena. Examples of such substances include black licorice, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron supplements. We report a case of a well-appearing 3-year-old Vietnamese girl presenting to our emergency department after 2 episodes of "black, sticky" stool. The cause of her "melena" was determined after father revealed that she had ingested 2 bowls of pork blood soup during the preceding 12 hours. This case highlights the need for a careful dietary history and cultural considerations in children presenting with what may appear to be melena.

### Prolonged fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and joint pain in a 9-year-old boy [^113wm3pY]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

A 9-year-old African American boy was admitted to hospital with a 12-day history of fevers, diarrhea, abdominal pain and a 1-day history of joint pain. His abdominal pain and diarrhea resolved within the first few days of admission, but he continued with high-grade fevers and intermittent joint pain. The joints affected included the right first interphalangeal joint, right wrist, right elbow, and left knee joint. His initial laboratory tests revealed normal complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and C-reactive protein. Consequently, he developed fatigue, lower back pain, and bicytopenias. After 19 days of fevers, a multispecialty collaborative evaluation arrived at a final diagnosis and treatment plan. In this article, we discuss the child's hospital course and our clinical thought process. Written consent was obtained from the family.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^116cehL1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric diagnosis — neonates and infants ≤ 12 months: Because of high asymptomatic carriage, testing for CDI should never be routinely recommended for neonates or infants ≤ 12 months of age with diarrhea (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Children < 12 months of age should only be tested if they have evidence of pseudomembranous colitis or toxic megacolon, or if they have clinically significant diarrhea and other causes have been excluded; the rate of C. difficile colonization among asymptomatic infants can exceed 40%, and C. difficile toxin can still be detected in approximately 15% of 2-year-old infants.

### Chromobacterium violaceum: a case of diarrhea in Senegal [^111beXvN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old infant with diarrhea had heavy growth of Chromobacterium violaceum cultured from stool. This organism is restricted geographically between latitudes 35 degrees N and 35 degrees S. It can cause sepsis and various focal infections but is not a well-known cause of diarrhea.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^1152Fry5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for Clostridioides difficile infection, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (evaluation), IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend to do not test for C. difficile routinely in 1–2 years old pediatric patients with diarrhea unless other infectious or noninfectious causes have been excluded.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114jCXn1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Clostridium difficile epidemiology and testing considerations — In children, asymptomatic colonization is common and complicates interpretation, with a "high frequency (up to 70%) of asymptomatic colonization among healthy newborns", and rates that "gradually fall to adult levels… by about 2 years of age", making results in "an individual child < 2 years of age" uncertain. In hospitals, "C. difficile is more prevalent in diarrheal stools obtained > 72 hours after admission", and, because asymptomatic carriage is recognized, "patients without diarrhea should not be tested or treated". C. difficile "should be considered in patients with diarrhea occurring in hospitals".

### Olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanase) [^114DDKXc]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of PATANASE Nasal Spray has not been established for patients under 6 years of age. The safety of olopatadine nasal spray was evaluated in 3 vehicle-controlled 2-week studies in 870 patients 6 to 11 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Doses studied included 1 and 2 sprays per nostril twice daily. One of these studies evaluated the safety of PATANASE Nasal Spray at doses of 1 and 2 sprays per nostril twice daily in 1188 patients, of which, 298 patients were exposed to PATANASE 1 spray and 297 patients were exposed to vehicle 1 spray. In this study, the incidence of epistaxis with PATANASE Nasal Spray treatment was 5.7%, compared to 3.2% seen in adult and adolescent studies. This study also evaluated the effectiveness of PATANASE Nasal Spray in patients 6 through 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The safety of PATANASE Nasal Spray at a dose of 1 spray per nostril twice daily was evaluated in one 2-week vehicle-controlled study in 132 children ages 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis. In this trial, 66 patients (28 females and 38 males) were exposed to PATANASE Nasal Spray. The racial distribution of patients receiving PATANASE Nasal Spray was 66.7% white, 27.3% black, and 6.4% other. Two patients exposed to vehicle nasal spray discontinued due to an adverse reaction (1 patient with pneumonia and 1 patient with rhinitis) compared to no patients exposed to PATANASE Nasal Spray. The most common (greater than 1.0%) adverse events reported were diarrhea (9.1%), epistaxis (6.1%), rhinorrhea (4.5%), bitter taste (3.0%) and wheezing (3.0%). Diarrhea was reported less frequently (< 1%) in the 6 to 11 year old age group.

The incidence of epistaxis was higher in the pediatric population (5.7% in 6–11 year old patients and 6.1% in 2–5 year old patients) compared to the adult and adolescent population (3.2%).

### Just another case of diarrhea and vomiting? [^112zMFj2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic intussusception is a treatable cause of failure to thrive. It is an uncommon condition often diagnosed late. The presenting features differ from acute intussusception. Chronic intussusception presents with a varying combination of abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss/failure to thrive, diarrhea, and blood per rectum. An abdominal mass may or may not be palpable. The classic triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and blood per rectum is uncommon. The purpose of this report is to present a small series of 3 cases and review 19 previously reported cases of chronic intussusception. Considering the diagnosis of chronic intussusception in children who present with failure to thrive and recurrent nonspecific abdominal symptoms is emphasized.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^115T7tHT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnostics — outbreak and public health coordination: A broader set of bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents should be considered regardless of the presence of fever, bloody or mucoid stools, or other markers of more severe illness in the context of a possible outbreak of diarrheal illness. Selection of agents for testing should be based on a combination of host and epidemiologic risk factors and ideally in coordination with public health authorities.

### A 9-day-old with weight loss and diarrhea [^112S8PBk]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 9-day-old infant girl presented with diarrhea and weight loss of 19% since birth. She was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks' gestation to a mother positive for group B Streptococcus who received adequate intrapartum prophylaxis. The infant was formula-fed every 2 to 3 hours with no reported issues with feeding or swallowing. The infant had nonmucoid watery stools ∼5 to 15 times per day. Her family history was significant for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in several of her family members. Her initial vital signs and physical examination were normal. Laboratory data on hospital admission showed a normal complete blood cell count, but her chemistry analysis revealed significant hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Her hypernatremia was resistant to fluid management. In this article, we discuss the infant's hospital course, our clinical thought process, and how we arrived at our final diagnosis.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients and caregivers should be informed of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours.
Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of CAMPTOSAR.
Explain the significance of routine blood cell counts. Instruct patients to monitor their temperature frequently and immediately report any occurrence of fever or infection.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for 6 months after the final dose.
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of CAMPTOSAR.
Lactation
Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for at least 7 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Infertility
Advise females and males of reproductive potential that CAMPTOSAR may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia.

### Traveler's diarrhea in the pediatric population: etiology and impact [^111ZLscJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Children who travel are at risk of developing the same, well-known illnesses that affect adult travelers. The etiology, treatment, and actual risk of these illnesses are not well defined in children. The limited amount of data available forces clinicians to extrapolate appropriate treatment for children. Recommendations for children have not been standardized. The role and judicious use of antimicrobials in the treatment of pediatric traveler's diarrhea have evolved during recent decades and will be reviewed here. The past 2 decades have seen an unprecedented, sustained growth in travel. The epidemiology related to travel medicine has evolved to describe travelers and their illnesses more specifically. The development of the field of travel medicine has led to greater understanding and improved, targeted treatment of travel-related illnesses. Most of the data available today describe traveler's diarrhea in adults. Children traveling to distant destinations from their home country have not been well studied, yet treatment parameters exist in practice and will be reviewed here.

### Parent and clinician perspectives on diagnostic testing for children with diarrhea: a qualitative study [^116ef1eH]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

The sample of parents or guardians included 44 individuals who self-identified as the parent of a child seeking care for diarrhea. Forty parents (91%) were female and 4 (9%) were male, and median age was 34 years (range, 21–47 years). One parent (2%) identified as Asian; 2 (5%) as Black or African American; 15 (34%) as Hispanic or Latino; 22 (50%) as White, not Hispanic or Latino; and 4 (9%) had unknown or undisclosed race and ethnicity. Most parents spoke English as their primary language (40 [91%]) (Table). The sample of clinicians (n = 16) included 10 physicians (62%) and 6 nurse practitioners or physician associates (38%) with experience working at the 6 different health care locations. Eleven of the clinicians (69%) were female and 5 (31%) were male, with median age of 42 years (range, 29–59 years). Fourteen clinicians (88%) self-identified as White, not Hispanic or Latino and 2 (13%) had unknown or undisclosed race and ethnicity. The clinicians reported a median of 7 years (range, 2–25 years) of practice experience (Table).

### Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in a 9-year-old girl [^116xMG4x]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Cryptosporidiosis is reported in an otherwise healthy child. Her history was significant for playing in natural waters during a camping trip 1 week prior. Several days later, she began improving despite an incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Nitazoxanide was given once the diagnosis was established. Obtaining a thorough patient history, administering appropriate antibiotics, and counseling patients on preventive measures are critical steps in treating and managing the transmission of this parasite. The case emphasizes the value of stool ova and parasite examination for proper diagnosis of pediatric diarrheal illness in the emergency setting. In addition, the often overlooked diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is reviewed as an important cause of diarrheal illness in the immunocompetent pediatric population.

### Double trouble: ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^113Xdkk7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is important to distinguish that there are 2 related but distinct pathological conditions in our patient described above. Failure to realize this could yield an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and a poor patient outcome. Therefore, it was important to generate 2 separate differential diagnoses in this case, 1 for acute abdominal pain and 1 for chronic secretory diarrhea.

Regarding her abdominal pain the diagnoses in were considered (Table 1). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was less likely with a stable weight, normal ESR (of 3), normal albumin, normal hemoglobin, and no inflammatory cells in the stool. Transglutaminase IgA and IgG were both negative, reducing the likelihood for celiac disease. Appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and cholecystitis were ruled out with MRI on admission. Ovarian torsion was also unlikely as her ovaries were visualized and normal on the MRI. Urinalysis on admission was negative for hemoglobin and microscopy showed only 5 to 10 RBCs making nephrolithiasis possible, but less likely than other entities. Urine culture grew 10,000 colonies of E coli but patient denied dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, or flank pain, so unlikely to be urinary tract infection (UTI)/pyelonephritis. An abdominal X-ray was negative for small bowel obstruction. Peptic ulcer disease was less likely due to the location and episodic nature of her abdominal pain unrelated to timing of meals. Malignancy was less likely due to the acute nature of the pain and lack of weight changes, fevers, or mass/lymphadenopathy on MRI. Lipase and MRI were negative for acute pancreatitis. Intussusception was diagnosed via the abdominal ultrasound that captured the bowel telescoping.

Table 1.
Differential Diagnosis for Abdominal Pain for Preadolescent Female Patient.

Intussusception is defined as the slipping of a portion of bowel into the neighboring portion. This condition generally occurs in young children, and only 30% occur in individuals greater than 2 years of age. Risk factors for intussusception include young age, intestinal malformations, and any condition that leads to inflammation of the GI tract as identified in (Table 2). The rotavirus vaccine has also been associated with intussusception. In some cases, a pathologic lead point, which is an anatomic anomaly that predisposes the bowel to intussusception, is identified. Examples of pathologic lead points include Meckel's diverticulum, polyp, or tumor. In most cases of intussusception, no cause is discovered (idiopathic) and no lead point is identified.

### Parasitic infections in Swiss children: are we overtesting? [^111N5c4k]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Twelve percent of all tested patients in our cohort were under the age of 2 years and we only found negative stool results for them. The main diagnosis after those tests was functional toddler's diarrhea. The prevalence of this functional phenomenon was found to be 6% in the US. When a child daily passes painlessly 4 or more large, unformed stools for at least 4 weeks, it has an adequate caloric intake without failure to thrive and is at onset of symptoms between 6 and 60 months of age, the diagnosis of functional toddler's diarrhea can be made without further investigations according to the Rome IV Criteria for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Infants and Toddlers. Whilst there are lot of data proofing, that in developing countries parasites, such as Cryptosporidium are commonly causing episodes of diarrhea, especially in young children under the age of 5 years, the situation of enteric pathogens is different in Europe: Our findings are in line with a prospective study from Paris, where no parasites were detected in children under the age of 2 years.

In our cohort, the second most common indication in negative tested children for parasite infection was diarrhea. A disadvantage of this retrospective study is, that often the consistency and frequency of the stool is not specified, which is important to decide whether further diagnostic is indicated, as usually diarrhoeal illness has to be subdivided into three main categories, based on its clinical presentation: Acute watery, bloody or persistent diarrhea. According to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) and the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases, the incidence of acute diarrhea (defined as a decrease in the consistency of stools and/or an increase in the frequency of evacuations, more than 3 in 24 h) ranges from 0.5 to 2 episodes per child per year in children under 3 years in Europe with Rotavirus being the most frequent agent. The guidelines state that children presenting with acute gastroenteritis don't require routine etiological investigation, but microbiological tests may be considered in children with immune deficiencies.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — features linked to complications or severe disease: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults (strong, high). When the clinical or epidemiologic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from other STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli) in stool (strong, moderate); if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used (weak, moderate), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler (strong, moderate). Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections (strong, moderate). Supporting risk data include that volume depletion is a frequently identified risk factor for diarrhea-related deaths; dehydration at admission among children with postdiarrheal HUS is associated with an increased need for dialysis; intravenous fluid during the diarrhea phase of STEC infections reduces the risk of oligoanuric renal failure; and although most patients with laboratory-confirmed STEC who develop HUS have bloody diarrhea, approximately 10% do not; factors independently associated with increased risk of STEC O157 include abdominal tenderness and absence of fever at first medical evaluation, and approximately 65% will have a peripheral white blood cell count > 10000 cells/μL.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112iFnqa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Parasitic diarrhea diagnostics — during initial evaluation, including in immunocompetent children > 2 years old, bacterial and viral etiologies should be considered first if symptoms are less than 2 weeks, and in community-acquired diarrhea routine parasite testing is not indicated and usually should not be performed. When clinically indicated, ova and parasite (O&P) examination should be requested; historically 3 specimens collected over a 7–10 day period were recommended, but cost-effective options include obtaining a second specimen only if the first is negative and symptoms persist, with a third submitted only if the patient remains O&P negative and symptomatic. Targeted use of immunoassay testing or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) can serve as a screen, immunoassays for Giardia may be sensitive enough that only a single specimen is needed with additional samples considered when suspicion remains, and no data define the number of specimens needed when NAAT is performed. Specimen preservatives depend on intended testing and manufacturer recommendations, and it is imperative to consult the laboratory to ensure proper transport conditions.

Results

From January 2017 to December 2018, 29 502 children under 5 years of age hospitalised with diarrhoea were enrolled from 33 surveillance sites in 28 countries (online supplemental table 1 and figure 1). Using GBD incidence and population estimates, these 28 countries included 51.4% (299 119/582 295) of all estimated diarrhoeal deaths and 49.9% (337 863 737/677 362 399) of the estimated global under 5 population. Most enrolled children were less than 2 years of age (22716, 77.0%)(table 1). Most cases were accompanied by vomiting and dehydration, and almost all patients received some form of rehydration therapy in the hospital. Of 20 471 cases for which dehydration was present and the severity was estimated, 6681 (32.6%) had severe dehydration. Of 26 728 (90.6%) cases that could be classified by both duration and presence of blood, 24 616 (92.1%) presented with acute watery diarrhoea, 1728 (6.5%) with acute bloody diarrhoea and 384 (1.4%) with watery or bloody persistent diarrhoea.

Final Diagnosis

Our patient originally presented to our hospital with acute abdominal pain secondary to an acute small bowel to small bowel intussusception. However, she also had underlying chronic (over 4 weeks' duration) secretory diarrhea, caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. This parasitic bowel infection likely caused small bowel edema, which was the impetus for her to develop an intussusception of her bowel. The electrolyte and metabolic derangements were a result of chronic diarrhea and acute anorexia.

RESULTS

The analysis included 194 children less than 60 months of age, 98 children with and 96 without diarrhea. The median age was 10.5 months [interquartile range (IQR), 17] overall, 8 months (IQR, 7) for children with and 18 months (IQR, 21) for those without diarrhea (P < 0.0001); 103 children were female and 91 male (P = 0.57).

Of the children with diarrhea, 30 were 0–5 month old, 44 were 6–11 months old and 24 were 12–59 months old. Of them, 72% (70 of 97) showed also vomiting, 76% (71 of 94) fever and 59% (57 of 96) mucus in stools. Nineteen children complained abdominal pain and 5 had blood in stools. Likely diarrhea-caused dehydration was found in 57% (54 of 94) of children. Of children with diarrhea, 85% (79 of 93) had consulted before, 76% (71 of 94) had received some medication and 60% (52 of 87) also antibiotic treatment.

Acutely, he developed 5 days of fever as high as 39.4°C. He had a remote travel history to the Middle East. On physical examination, he was febrile and tachycardic, was thin but otherwise had a normal examination. His inflammatory markers were elevated: erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 93 mm/hour and his C-reactive protein was 25.4 mg/L. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 17,000 × 10(3)/µL with increased bands. His hemoglobin level was 8.8 g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume of 81 fl. Platelets were 556 × 10(3)/µL. A chest radiograph was concerning for a cavitary lung lesion and an abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in his spleen.

Table 2.
Predisposing Factors for Pediatric Intussusception.

The clinical presentation of intussusception usually reveals waxing and waning crampy abdominal pain associated with typical gastroenteritis symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. The abdominal pain occurs due to peristalsis at the intussuscepted segment that is transiently obstructed. Physical examination may reveal abdominal discomfort in any quadrant, typically without rebound tenderness. Although rarely found, the classic triad of symptoms is abdominal pain, palpable "sausage shaped" mass, and bloody ("currant jelly") stools. If the area is not actively peristalsing, the patient may be asymptomatic. Patients often present dehydrated due to anorexia secondary to pain and/or in shock due to bowel ischemia. Therefore, tachycardia, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, dry mucous membranes, and oliguria could be present in affected children.

Intussusception is diagnosed primarily using ultrasound. Intussusception can only be confirmed when the bowel is actively intussuscepted, although there have been improvements in identifying them due to an increase in point-of-care ultrasounds. Intussusception is classified based on location, which determines therapy. In a large bowel to large bowel intussusception, the mainstay of treatment is nonoperative reduction of the intussusception using air or contrast enemas. However, when the intussuscepted site is more proximal in the small bowel, bowel rest with supportive care is suggested, as it is too proximal for an enema to be effective and most resolve spontaneously. Rarely, the involved area of the small bowel requires surgical intervention if the intussusception does not resolve spontaneously with supportive care.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Before this study, we did a systematic review of epidemiological studies seeking to determine the causes and adverse sequelae of paediatric diarrhoea in low-income countries. We searched PubMed for new studies and review articles published between Jan 1, 1980, and Aug 31, 2018, using the search string ("diarrhea"[All Fields] OR "gastroenteritis"[All Fields]) AND ("pediatric"[All Fields] OR "child"[All Fields]) AND ("etiology"[All Fields] OR "growth faltering"[All Fields] OR "stunting"[All Fields]) AND ("developing countr"[All Fields] OR "low-income"[All Fields]). We included older reports, and articles identified in reference lists when appropriate. We identified methodologic limitations that led to knowledge gaps about the epidemiology of diarrhoeal disease among children living in developing countries. We then designed and did the Global Enterics Multicenter Study (GEMS) to elucidate the incidence, aetiology, and adverse clinical consequences of medically attended moderate-to-severe diarrhoea (MSD) among children younger than 5 years living in developing countries. However, GEMS left unanswered questions about whether the findings of GEMS were generalisable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhoea in patients presenting to health-care centres. Therefore, we updated our literature search and designed this study to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD.

Added value of this study

Using a rigorous study design and microbiological methods capable of detecting a broad array of pathogens across a diverse set of study sites with medium and high under-5 mortality, we showed that inclusion of LSD defines a far greater burden of disease without substantially altering the four most important aetiological pathogens involved — ie, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin, and Shigella spp. While children with LSD are less acutely ill than those with MSD, particularly with regard to dehydration, they have similar susceptibility to linear growth faltering following their diarrhoeal episode relative to their matched healthy controls.

Implications of all the available evidence

These findings expand the population of children experiencing adverse clinical and nutritional consequences of acute diarrhoeal illness in low-resource settings. Since MSD and LSD have similar aetiologies, mitigation of disease associated with a restricted number of aetiological agents can substantially reduce the diarrhoeal disease burden and its associated nutritional faltering.

### Gut microbiome composition in young Nicaraguan children during diarrhea episodes and recovery [^113a2aSS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding how the gut microbiota is affected by diarrhea episodes may help explain alterations in intestinal function among children in low-income settings. This study examined the composition of the gut microbiome of Nicaraguan children both during diarrhea episodes and while free of diarrhea for at least 2 months. Relative abundances of bacterial taxa, phylogenetic diversity, and species richness were determined by 16S amplicon sequencing and compared between paired diarrhea and recovery samples. A total of 66 stools were provided by 25 children enrolled in a 1-year cohort study of diarrhea etiologies. Children in our cohort had a mean age of 21.9 months; 64% were breast-fed, and 10% had received an antibiotic during the diarrhea episode. Overall, phylogenetic diversity and species richness did not differ significantly between diarrhea and recovery stools. However, of children who had a bacterial enteropathogen detected in any diarrhea stool, none experienced an increase in phylogenetic diversity in recovery, whereas of those in whom no bacterial enteropathogens were detected in their diarrhea stool(s), 59% experienced an increase in phylogenetic diversity in recovery (P = 0.008). This preliminary study suggests that recovery of the gut microbiota after a diarrhea episode may take longer time than previously thought and may be pathogen specific.

Evidence for oral rehydration solution (ORS) and solution osmolality — The safety and efficacy of ORS, in comparison to intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT), was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1811 patients aged < 18 years from high-income and low-income countries, with no important clinical differences in failure to hydrate, weight gain at discharge, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, duration of diarrhea, or total fluid intake at 6 or 24 hours between children receiving ORS and IVT; the model estimated that 4% of children treated with ORS would fail and require IVT, and historically standard WHO-ORS (osmolarity 311 mmol/L) was recommended, but in 2002 a hypotonic ORS with total osmolality < 250 mmol/L was recommended by the WHO and other advisory bodies as first-line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea of all causes.

### The global enteric multicenter study (GEMS) of diarrheal disease in infants and young children in developing countries: epidemiologic and clinical methods of the case / control study [^113Yjrnw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhea is a leading cause of illness and death among children aged < 5 years in developing countries. This paper describes the clinical and epidemiological methods used to conduct the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a 3-year, prospective, age-stratified, case/control study to estimate the population-based burden, microbiologic etiology, and adverse clinical consequences of acute moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among a censused population of children aged 0–59 months seeking care at health centers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Methods

GEMS was conducted at 7 field sites, each serving a population whose demography and healthcare utilization practices for childhood diarrhea were documented. We aimed to enroll 220 MSD cases per year from selected health centers serving each site in each of 3 age strata (0–11, 12–23, and 24–59 months), along with 1–3 matched community controls. Cases and controls supplied clinical, epidemiologic, and anthropometric data at enrollment and again approximately 60 days later, and provided enrollment stool specimens for identification and characterization of potential diarrheal pathogens. Verbal autopsy was performed if a child died. Analytic strategies will calculate the fraction of MSD attributable to each pathogen and the incidence, financial costs, nutritional consequences, and case fatality overall and by pathogen.

Conclusions

When completed, GEMS will provide estimates of the incidence, etiology, and outcomes of MSD among infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This information can guide development and implementation of public health interventions to diminish morbidity and mortality from diarrheal diseases.

Worldwide, diarrhea is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in children; however, there are few data on the burden of diarrheal disease in Haiti. We conducted a retrospective review of hospital discharge registries from 2010 to 2012 in the pediatric wards of four Haitian hospitals and recorded the number of all-cause hospitalizations and deaths as well as diarrheal hospitalizations and deaths by age (≤ 2 and 3–5 years) and epidemiological week. Diarrhea was associated with 3,582 (33.7%) of 10,621 hospitalizations and 62 (11.5%) of 540 in-hospital deaths in children ≤ 5 years old. Of these children, 88.5% and 96.8%, respectively, were among children ≤ 2 years old. The highest proportions of diarrhea-associated hospitalizations occurred from January to April. At four Haitian hospitals over a 3-year period, during which time a major epidemic of cholera occurred, diarrheal disease in children ≤ 5 years was a major contributor to pediatric hospitalizations and mortality.

### Sulfasalazine [^113AbP5X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers:

Sulfonamides, including sulfasalazine, are present in human milk (see Pregnancy, Clinical Considerations). Insignificant amounts of sulfasalazine have been found in milk, whereas levels of the active metabolite sulfapyridine in milk are about 30 to 60 percent of those in the maternal serum. Caution should be exercised when sulfasalazine is administered to a nursing mother.

There are reports with limited data of bloody stools or diarrhea in human milk fed infants of mothers taking sulfasalazine. In cases where the outcome was reported, bloody stools or diarrhea resolved in the infant after discontinuation of sulfasalazine in the mother or discontinuation of breastfeeding. Due to limited data, a causal relationship between sulfasalazine exposure and bloody stools or diarrhea cannot be confirmed or denied. Monitor human milk fed infants of mothers taking sulfasalazine for signs and symptoms of diarrhea and/or bloody stools.

Pediatric Use:

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.

### Large, segmental, circular vascular malformation of the small intestine (in a female toddler with hematochezia): unusual presentation in a child [^116fVqC6]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Both failure to thrive with chronic diarrhea as well as hematochezia are clinical alarm signs in children potentially warranting endoscopy. And while hematochezia has a great variety of causes, vascular malformations of the small intestine - as one of them - are uncommon in this age group. In particular, there are only very few reports on this disease in children younger than two years.

Although infants and children suffering from intestinal vascular malformations may present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea or vomiting, some cases are asymptomatic and thus remain hidden from the diagnostician's eye for quite some time. On the other hand, very few cases may lay a false trail for the clinician because of unaccompanied anemia. Early imaging using optimal technique is crucial for diagnosing these conditions, in the pediatric age group usually best performed by detailed ultrasound (US), potentially supplemented by MRI.

This is demonstrated by our report of a 19 months old female toddler who presented first with failure to thrive and signs of malabsorption and much later with abdominal pain and hematochezia as the clinical symptoms leading to the diagnosis of an unusual large, segmental, circumferential, low-flow vascular malformation of the ileum.

### Burden and aetiology of diarrhoeal disease in infants and young children in developing countries (the global enteric multicenter study, GEMS): a prospective, case-control study [^112MMAR8]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diarrhoeal diseases cause illness and death among children younger than 5 years in low-income countries. We designed the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) to identify the aetiology and population-based burden of paediatric diarrhoeal disease in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.

Methods

The GEMS is a 3-year, prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children aged 0–59 months residing in censused populations at four sites in Africa and three in Asia. We recruited children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea seeking care at health centres along with one to three randomly selected matched community control children without diarrhoea. From patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and controls, we obtained clinical and epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, and a faecal sample to identify enteropathogens at enrolment; one follow-up home visit was made about 60 days later to ascertain vital status, clinical outcome, and interval growth.

Findings

We enrolled 9439 children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and 13,129 control children without diarrhoea. By analysing adjusted population attributable fractions, most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (ST-ETEC; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella. Other pathogens were important in selected sites (eg, Aeromonas, Vibrio cholerae O1, Campylobacter jejuni). Odds of dying during follow-up were 8·5-fold higher in patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea than in controls (odd ratio 8·5, 95% CI 5·8–12·5, p < 0·0001); most deaths (167 [87·9%]) occurred during the first 2 years of life. Pathogens associated with increased risk of case death were ST-ETEC (hazard ratio [HR] 1·9; 0·99–3·5) and typical enteropathogenic E coli (HR 2·6; 1·6–4·1) in infants aged 0–11 months, and Cryptosporidium (HR 2·3; 1·3–4·3) in toddlers aged 12–23 months.

Interpretation

Interventions targeting five pathogens (rotavirus, Shigella, ST-ETEC, Cryptosporidium, typical enteropathogenic E coli) can substantially reduce the burden of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. New methods and accelerated implementation of existing interventions (rotavirus vaccine and zinc) are needed to prevent disease and improve outcomes.

### Etiology, presentation, and risk factors for diarrheal syndromes in 3 sub-saharan African countries after the introduction of rotavirus vaccines from the vaccine impact on diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study [^113d8UNF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Diarrheal disease is the third leading cause of mortality among children < 5 years of age globally, with 1 in 10 deaths attributed to diarrhea in 2019, and the greatest burden among children in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Although commonly described as a single entity, diarrheal disease comprises multiple clinical syndromes, each associated with different risk factors, causes, geographic distribution, pathophysiology, and sequelae. These include acute watery diarrhea (AWD) and bloody diarrhea (ie, dysentery), some cases of which progress to persistent diarrhea (PD). AWD is predominant in young children and characterized by frequent nonbloody loose or watery stools that can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Less common is bloody diarrhea, which historically has been associated with an increased risk of stunting, episodes of longer duration, and, in some settings, an increased risk of death compared with watery diarrhea (WD). Diarrheal episodes lasting ≥ 14 days, termed PD, are seen disproportionately among children in low- and middle-income countries and have been associated with more growth faltering and higher mortality rates.

During the past 3 decades, remarkable improvement has been observed in mortality rates associated with diarrheal disease in children < 5 years old, attributed to declines in risks, such as unsafe water and sanitation and stunting, in association with social and economic development in low- and middle-income countries, coupled with improvements in case management and rotavirus vaccine introduction. It is reasonable to expect that these ongoing shifts will result in changes in the etiology, manifestations, and outcomes of diarrhea in young children. However, progress has not been distributed equitably, in particular leaving areas of sub-Saharan Africa with a high prevalence of risk factors and poor outcomes. Therefore, it is important to update our understanding of diarrheal diseases in sub-Saharan Africa to inform initiatives for preventing disease and death associated with diarrhea.

The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study was an age-stratified, matched case-control study that examined the incidence, etiology, and adverse clinical outcomes of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among infants and young children after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine at 3 sites in sub-Saharan Africa. Herein we describe the features of WD and dysentery, and determinants for progression to and sequelae from PD in the VIDA study. We also examine temporal trends in PD, comparing the results with those from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a similarly designed study conducted at the same sites 1 decade earlier.

Dysentery is diagnosed clinically as the presence of gross blood in diarrheal stools. Dysentery stools can be quite scanty and composed mainly of mucus and blood (shown here). Bacillary dysentery is typically preceded by 18–24 hours of watery diarrhea, accompanied by high fever and toxemia, before the loose stools become scanty and bloody. Dysentery indicates substantial damage to the mucosa of the colon and terminal ileum.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Subjects

The safety of NUVESSA was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in subjects with bacterial vaginosis. A total of 321 non-pregnant females with a mean age of 33.4 years (range 18 to 67 years) received NUVESSA. Subjects were primarily Black/African American (58.3%) or White (39.3%). Subjects administered a single dose of NUVESSA at bedtime on the first day of the study.

There were no deaths or serious adverse reactions in this trial. Adverse reactions were reported by 19.0% of subjects treated with NUVESSA versus 16.1% of subjects treated with Vehicle Gel.

Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects receiving NUVESSA were: vulvovaginal candidiasis (5.6%), headache (2.2%), vulvovaginal pruritus (1.6%), nausea (1.6%), diarrhea (1.2%), and dysmenorrhea (1.2%). No subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.

Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects

The safety of NUVESSA was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label study evaluating the safety and tolerability of NUVESSA in 60 pediatric subjects between the ages of 12 and less than 18 years old all of whom were treated with a single dose of NUVESSA administered once at bedtime intravaginally. Most subjects in this study were either Black/African-American, non-Hispanic (47%) or Hispanic (35%).

Safety in pediatric female subjects aged 12 to less than 18 years old was comparable to adult women. No deaths occurred and no subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of pediatric subjects included: vulvovaginal discomfort (2%).

### Variation in childhood diarrheal morbidity and mortality in Africa, 2000–2015 [^115MaLBY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diarrheal diseases are the third leading cause of disease and death in children younger than 5 years of age in Africa and were responsible for an estimated 30 million cases of severe diarrhea (95% credible interval, 27 million to 33 million) and 330,000 deaths (95% credible interval, 270,000 to 380,000) in 2015. The development of targeted approaches to address this burden has been hampered by a paucity of comprehensive, fine-scale estimates of diarrhea-related disease and death among and within countries.

Methods

We produced annual estimates of the prevalence and incidence of diarrhea and diarrhea-related mortality with high geographic detail (5 km 2) across Africa from 2000 through 2015. Estimates were created with the use of Bayesian geostatistical techniques and were calibrated to the results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016.

Results

The results revealed geographic inequality with regard to diarrhea risk in Africa. Of the estimated 330,000 childhood deaths that were attributable to diarrhea in 2015, more than 50% occurred in 55 of the 782 first-level administrative subdivisions (e.g., states). In 2015, mortality rates among first-level administrative subdivisions in Nigeria differed by up to a factor of 6. The case fatality rates were highly varied at the national level across Africa, with the highest values observed in Benin, Lesotho, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

Conclusions

Our findings showed concentrated areas of diarrheal disease and diarrhea-related death in countries that had a consistently high burden as well as in countries that had considerable national-level reductions in diarrhea burden. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.).

Symptomatic relief — Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

### Risk factors for mortality among children younger than age 5 years with severe diarrhea in low-and middle-income countries: findings from the World Health Organization-coordinated global rotavirus and pediatric diarrhea surveillance networks [^111LLLR7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years of age globally. The burden of diarrheal mortality is concentrated in low-resource settings. Little is known about the risk factors for childhood death from diarrheal disease in low- and middle-income countries.

Methods

Data from the World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated Global Rotavirus and Pediatric Diarrhea Surveillance Networks, which are composed of active, sentinel, hospital-based surveillance sites, were analyzed to assess mortality in children < 5 years of age who were hospitalized with diarrhea between 2008 and 2018. Case fatality risks were calculated, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for mortality.

Results

This analysis comprises 234 781 cases, including 1219 deaths, across 57 countries. The overall case fatality risk was found to be 0.5%. Risk factors for death in the multivariable analysis included younger age (for < 6 months compared with older ages, odds ratio [OR] = 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 2.81–4.50), female sex (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06–1.81), presenting with persistent diarrhea (OR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.01–3.25), no vomiting (OR = 1.13; 95% CI, .98–1.30), severe dehydration (OR = 3.79; 95% CI, 3.01–4.83), and being negative for rotavirus on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (OR = 2.29; 95% CI, 1.92–2.74). Cases from the African Region had the highest odds of death compared with other WHO regions (OR = 130.62 comparing the African Region with the European Region; 95% CI, 55.72–422.73), whereas cases from the European Region had the lowest odds of death.

Conclusions

Our findings support known risk factors for childhood diarrheal mortality and highlight the need for interventions to address dehydration and rotavirus-negative diarrheal infections.

Diarrhea caused by G. lamblia in pediatric patients 1 through 11 years of age:

In a randomized, controlled trial conducted in Peru in 110 pediatric patients with diarrhea and with or without enteric symptoms (e.g., abdominal distention, right iliac fossa tenderness) caused by G. lamblia, a three-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide (100 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 24–47 months, 200 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 4 through 11 years) was compared to a five-day course of treatment with metronidazole (125 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 2 through 5 years, 250 mg BID in pediatric patients ages 6 through 11 years). Clinical response was evaluated 7 to 10 days following initiation of treatment with a 'well' response defined as 'no symptoms, no watery stools and no more than 2 soft stools with no hematochezia within the past 24 hours' or 'no symptoms and no unformed stools within the past 48 hours'.The following clinical cure rates were obtained:

CLINICAL SYNDROMES OF PEDIATRIC DIARRHEAL DISEASE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

As seen by clinical health providers at fixed healthcare facilities in developing countries, almost all cases of pediatric diarrheal illness can be conveniently characterized as falling into 1 of 5 clinical syndromes (Table 1). Approximately 80%–85% of patient episodes present as "simple gastroenteritis" with the subject passing loose or watery stool (often with mucus but not with blood), low-grade fever, occasional vomiting, anorexia, and apparent malaise (Figure 1). Approximately 5%–15% of children present with overt dysentery (gross blood in the diarrheic stools) (Figure 2), often accompanied by fever (sometimes high); many dysenteric patients appear clinically toxic. A small proportion of cases in older children present with profuse watery diarrhea, passing such voluminous "rice water" stools that even older children can rapidly become severely dehydrated (Figure 3). Another few percent of pediatric cases present with a history of apparent simple gastroenteritis that began 14 or more days previously but did not abate; this defines "persistent diarrhea", a syndrome that particularly can have adverse nutritional consequences. Finally, a few percent of children are brought by caretakers for care because of vomiting rather than diarrhea as the main complaint. Few reports have described expanded etiologic analyses in relation to these clinical syndromes.

The 5 Main Clinical Syndromes of Diarrheal Disease Seen Among Infants and Young Children Presenting to Health Centers and Hospitals in Developing Countries

Figure 1.
An infant who presented with diarrheal dehydration consequent to simple gastroenteritis that was not treated promptly or effectively. Loss of turgor of skin over the abdomen is visible as "tenting", following pinching. Simple gastroenteritis caused by many etiologic agents in young infants in developing countries can lead to dehydration. The fundamental reason is that per kilogram of body weight, the daily water and electrolyte requirements of young infants are substantially greater than those of older children. Thus, abnormal losses from diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, accompanied by inadequate fluid intake and lack of prompt and appropriate replacement (as with glucose/electrolyte oral rehydration solution), can lead to moderate and severe dehydration and death.

Risk factors

Risk factors examined in this analysis included clinical and sociodemographic factors. Factors included age (per date of birth reported by the primary caretaker and verified by the child's health card), sex, admission to hospital at presentation, presentation with fever (axillary temperature > 37.5 F), co-morbidities per final diagnosis indicated on medical records, LAZ at presentation calculated according to WHO standards, wasting (weight-for-length z -score [WLZ] < − 2 using WHO standards, using post-rehydration weight), dysentery (visible blood in stool observed by caregiver or health care provider at presentation), stunting (LAZ < − 2 using WHO standards), and duration of diarrhea (caregiver reported number of days the diarrhea has lasted at presentation). Anthropometric z -scores were calculated using WHO Stata macro code. Duration of diarrhea was ascertained by summing the duration of diarrhea during the 7 days prior to enrollment (children with diarrhea lasting longer than 7 days were excluded from participation) plus duration of diarrhea during the 14 days after enrollment. Diarrhea duration for the 14 days following enrollment was ascertained using a memory aid suitable for groups of all literacy levels, which the caregiver returned at the follow-up visit, as depicted elsewhere. Cessation of the enrollment episode was defined as two consecutive days in which diarrhea was not reported. Diarrhea was categorized as acute diarrhea (defined above), prolonged (> 7–13 days duration), or persistent (≥ 14 days duration). Sociodemographic characteristics were evaluated at enrollment and included access to improved water (caregiver report of the following: main source of drinking water for the household is piped into house or yard, public tap, tubewell, covered well, protected spring, rainwater, or borehole; is accessible within 15 min or less, roundtrip; and is available daily), access to improved defecation facility (caregiver report of access to the following: flush toilet, ventilated improved pit latrine with or without water seal, or pour flush toilet not shared with other households), caregiver handwashing (caregiver report of handwashing before eating, before handling child's food, after defecation, or after disposing of child's feces), and wealth quintile (quintile of a wealth effects score calculated from asset ownership information reported by caregiver at enrollment). Caretakers were shown pictures to aid in accurate identification of water and sanitation facilities.

### Micafungin [^116F77Em]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients

The safety of micafungin was assessed in 593 pediatric patients, 425 of whom were 4 months through 16 years of age and 168 of whom were 3 days to less than 4 months of age who received at least one dose of micafungin across 15 clinical trials.

Of the 425 pediatric patients, 4 months through 16 years of age enrolled in 11 clinical trials, 235 (55%) were male, 290 (68%) were white, with the following age distribution: 62 (15%) 4 months to < 2 years, 108 (25%) 2 to 5 years, 140 (33%) 6 to 11 years, and 115 (27%) 12 to 16 years of age. The mean treatment duration was 26.1 days. A total of 246 patients received at least one dose of micafungin ranging from 2 to 10 mg/kg. Overall, 388/425 (91%) patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 15% or more of micafungin-treated pediatric patients 4 months of age and older are: vomiting (32%), diarrhea (24%), pyrexia (24%), hypokalemia (22%), nausea (21%), mucosal inflammation (19%), thrombocytopenia (19%), abdominal pain (18%), and headache (15%), and hypertension (15%).

Table 2 presents the details of SAEs in 2- to 8-year-olds, ordered by deaths first (4, all unrelated), followed by unrelated (1) then related (17) SAEs. Age, sex, and days between vaccination and onset are shown. Boys and girls did not differ with respect to frequency or presentation of SAEs. The deaths were deemed unrelated based on the delay between vaccination and onset and/or the presence of another diagnosis. One death in a 3-year-old girl followed acute diarrhea and vomiting but detailed investigations confirmed that, though the death occurred the day after vaccination, the child expelled ascaris worms at the health center and the attending physician attributed cause of death to asphyxiation after vomiting. Similarly, a hospitalization for severe malaria in a 6-year-old boy occurred the night after vaccination but was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with death occurring 26 days later despite therapy. A case of severe abdominal pain in a 6-year-old girl that began 3 days after vaccination resulted in death 24 days later after multiple interactions with health centers. All 17 cases considered related to Ad26.ZEBOV began the evening or day after the vaccination. The 10 cases that included febrile convulsions with or without fever and/or diarrhea responded to appropriate therapy with hospital discharge within 2 days, as did the 7 cases with fever and/or diarrhea/vomiting, with the longest hospitalization lasting 4 days.

Table 2.
Serious Adverse Events After Ad26.ZEBOV Vaccination in Children Aged 2–8 Years

Due to concerns about the reported cases of febrile convulsions in young vaccinees, the decision was made to institute routine acetaminophen administration via 250-mg suppository at the time of vaccination and again 6 hours later at home. This policy was implemented after the holiday closure in December 2020. Thereafter, 2 cases of febrile convulsions occurred in young children, neither of whom received the second acetaminophen suppository in the home. The incidence of febrile seizures was 8 of 26 062 (0.031%) prior to initiation of routine acetaminophen and 2 of 15 897 (0.013%) after.

There were 4 SAEs in the 9–17 years age group (Table 3), all resulting in death 11–139 days after vaccination and none considered related to vaccine.

### The parental appraisal of the morbidity of diarrhea in infants and toddlers (PAMODI) survey [^117SwfYC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

This study analyzed parental perception of the impact of diarrhea on quality of life of their children. A standardized questionnaire was completed by 2023 parents in Germany with children with diarrhea who were younger than 2 years old. Parents stated the most worrying aspects of diarrhea. A health score was measured using a visual analogue scale (0 = worst health, 100 = best health). Clinical symptoms were quoted by 72% of parents as one of the most worrying dimensions, with duration/frequency of diarrhea and weight loss perceived most meaningful. Next were behavioral/physical symptoms (51%), with an inflamed bottom for mild disease and pain for severe cases being most meaningful. Parental concern is characterized by sympathy and anxiety for the child. The health score for the diarrheal episode was 54.6 for mild and 33.9 for severe cases. Parents perceive a high disease burden of diarrhea and clinically less meaningful aspects play a significant role.

Control Selection

For each child with MSD included in the study, we enrolled 1–3 control children without diarrhea from the DSS community (Figure 1) within 14 days of presentation of the index case. Sites tracked their ability to fill each age stratum on a fortnightly basis and followed an algorithm to determine the number of controls to enroll: 1:1 case:control matching if 7–9 cases were enrolled; 1:2 matching if 4–6 cases were enrolled, and 1:3 matching if ≤ 3 cases were enrolled. At least 4 children who met the matching criteria (Table 3) were randomly selected from the DSS database as potential controls. A field worker visited the home of selected children sequentially and explained all aspects of the study. If the parent/primary caretaker expressed interest and the child met eligibility criteria (Table 3), informed, written consent was obtained and arrangements were made to collect a stool sample, as described below. Reasons for not enrolling a selected child were documented (eg, refusal, not found at home after 3 attempts to contact, or failed to produce an adequate stool sample).

### Impact of rotavirus vaccine introduction in children less than 2 years of age presenting for medical care with diarrhea in rural matlab, Bangladesh [^116YmeMk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In the secondary analysis (Model 2), both to increase power and to include relevant health-care–seeking behaviors to estimate the baseline incidence, we restricted the analysis to those villages randomized as control-only during the CRT period, and assessed the impact of routine HRV use on diarrhea over time. The referent category combined the pre-vaccine time period and the CRT time period. These models showed a significant impact of routine HRV use on RV+ diarrhea rates in 0- to < 24-month-old children in ISA villages, but not in GSA villages. RV– diarrhea rates did not significantly change over time using this model. Notably, both models showed a decreasing trend in RV+ diarrhea in ISA villages during sustained HRV coverage. This analysis demonstrates the importance of using the appropriate baseline incidences and underlying trends in time-series analyses.

Despite the potential differences in health-care–seeking behavior over time, our results are similar to the RCT and CRT conducted in Matlab, Bangladesh, with the greatest impact of rotavirus vaccine on children 0 to < 12 months of age. To our knowledge, no other population-level impact analyses have been reported in Asia with rotavirus diarrhea as the outcome, though a study in the Philippines saw a 60% (95% CI 55–64%) reduction in all-cause diarrhea hospitalizations within 4 years after rotavirus vaccine introduction. Similar time-series analyses conducted 2–3 years after rotavirus introduction found a 49% (95% CI 32–63%) decrease in rotavirus diarrhea in < 5-year-old children in Ghana, a 54% (95% CI 33–69%) decrease in rotavirus diarrhea in < 1-year-old children in Malawi, a 33% (95% CI 25–41%) reduction in rotavirus diarrhea in < 5-year-old children in Botswana, and a 38% reduction in rotavirus positivity among children < 5 years old in Zambia. Long-term impacts were also observed in Ghana and Zambia. Importantly, in these studies, > 90% vaccine coverage for 1 or 2 doses of rotavirus vaccine were reported within 1 year of vaccine introduction. In our study, the maximum, 2-dose HRV coverage of 68% was attained in the ISA villages during the second year of routine use.

Peanut allergy clinical history and FPIES — For suspected IgE-mediated reactions after known or suspected peanut ingestion, symptoms "typically develop within minutes to up to about 2 hours" and rarely outside that window; in this context, "diagnostic testing in the patient with a reasonable pretest probability… can then be used to help determine the likelihood of a clinical allergy". Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) to peanut is a "non-IgE- but immune-mediated reaction" with delayed onset "typically 1–4 hours after ingestion", and, in rare cases, "bloody diarrhea may result at 6 to 12 hours", and "testing for the presence of IgE for peanut FPIES is not recommended".

### Diarrhea and your child… [^115UZRSB]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

When a child's bowel pattern changes suddenly to a loose and watery bowel movement and occurs more often than usual, he or she has diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common symptom of illness in young children. In the United States, children younger than 4 years may have diarrhea 1 or 2 times each year. Diarrhea can be acute or chronic. Here is information from the American Academy of Pediatrics about acute diarrhea, as well as how to manage the symptoms, and how to help reduce your child's chances of getting diarrhea. Most diarrhea in children is caused by viruses. Diarrhea can also be caused by bacteria, parasites, changes in diet, problems with the intestines, and the use of some medicines. Most of the time mild..
