## Question

A hospitalized patient has biopsy-confirmed Acanthamoeba infection, and the discharge summary lists the principal diagnosis as "acanthamoebiasis." Which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for a hospitalized patient with biopsy-confirmed Acanthamoeba infection, where the discharge summary lists the principal diagnosis as "acanthamoebiasis". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most specific ICD-10-CM code that maps to Acanthamoeba infection. Then, I should verify whether the clinical presentation is specified (e.g., keratitis, encephalitis, cutaneous, rhinosinusitis, or disseminated) and whether a more specific code exists. Next, I will check for any coding conventions or laterality/character requirements that might modify the code. Finally, I will confirm the default choice if the documentation does not specify the organ system involved and ensure the principal diagnosis logic aligns with inpatient coding rules.

> Let me first confirm the disease entity and coding target. "Acanthamoebiasis" refers to infection by Acanthamoeba species, which in ICD-10-CM is classified under parasitic diseases, and the most specific available code for Acanthamoeba infection is B60.1, which explicitly names Acanthamoeba as the organism [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether a more specific code exists based on clinical manifestation. ICD-10-CM does provide separate codes for Acanthamoeba keratitis (H16.82-) and for granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), so if the record specifies ocular involvement or CNS disease, I should preferentially use those manifestation-specific codes rather than B60.1. However, the user states the discharge summary lists only "acanthamoebiasis" without specifying site, so B60.1 remains the most accurate choice here [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify coding conventions that could affect the final code string. Some ICD-10-CM categories require a 7th character for laterality or other attributes, and if the code is not 6 characters, a placeholder "X" is used before the 7th character. B60.1 is a 5-character code, so if a 7th character were required, I would add "X" and then the applicable character; however, B60.1 does not require a 7th character, so no placeholder or extension is needed in this case [^5e1c6ada] [^3a864023].

> I need to ensure the principal diagnosis logic is correct for inpatient coding. The principal diagnosis should be the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for the admission; if "acanthamoebiasis" is the principal diagnosis and no organ-specific manifestation is documented, B60.1 is appropriate as the primary code. If a specific organ involvement is identified, I should code that manifestation first and use B60.1 as an additional code to capture the organism, but that is not the scenario described here [^46dfe7de].

> But wait, what if the documentation is incomplete and I suspect a more specific site was involved? I should double-check the record for any mention of keratitis, encephalitis, cutaneous lesions, rhinosinusitis, or disseminated disease; if none is found, I should not assume specificity and should stick with B60.1. If later documentation clarifies the site, the code can be amended accordingly, ideally before claim submission [^notfound].

> Final answer: Assign B60.1 as the ICD-10-CM code for "acanthamoebiasis" when no specific organ manifestation is documented, and no 7th character or placeholder is required for this code [^notfound].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for biopsy-confirmed Acanthamoeba infection is **B60.1** (Acanthamoeba infection). This code should be used as the principal diagnosis when acanthamoebiasis is the primary reason for admission. If the infection is localized to a specific site (e.g. brain, skin, sinuses), **additional codes** should be added to specify the organ involvement, but B60.1 remains the principal diagnosis for the organism.

## ICD-10-CM code for acanthamoeba infection

The ICD-10-CM code for Acanthamoeba infection is **B60.1**, defined as "Acanthamoeba infection" [^notfound]. This code encompasses infections caused by Acanthamoeba species, including granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, and disseminated infections [^5f938525].

---

## Clinical manifestations of acanthamoeba infection

Acanthamoeba species can cause **severe infections**, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^ebc3ab7f]. The primary clinical manifestations include:

- **Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE)**: A chronic, often fatal brain infection characterized by focal neurological deficits, seizures, and altered mental status [^5f938525].

- **Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis**: Skin lesions presenting as nodules, ulcers, or abscesses, often progressing to disseminated disease if untreated [^5f938525].

- **Disseminated infection**: Multi-organ involvement, including lungs, liver, and other organs, typically in immunocompromised patients [^5f938525].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation of acanthamoeba infection

Biopsy confirmation is a **critical diagnostic method** for Acanthamoeba infection, particularly in non-ocular forms such as GAE and cutaneous disease [^66096a45]. Histopathological examination of tissue samples can reveal characteristic trophozoites and cysts, and immunohistochemical staining or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can confirm the diagnosis [^66096a45].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding guidelines for principal diagnosis

According to ICD-10-CM coding guidelines, the **principal diagnosis** is defined as the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care [^46dfe7de]. In this case, biopsy-confirmed Acanthamoeba infection is the principal diagnosis, and the appropriate code is B60.1.

---

## Additional ICD-10-CM codes for specific manifestations

While B60.1 serves as the principal diagnosis, **additional codes** may be required to specify the anatomical site or clinical manifestation of the infection:

| **Clinical manifestation** | **Additional icd-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) | B60.1 (principal diagnosis) + G05.3 (Encephalitis and encephalomyelitis in diseases classified elsewhere) |
| Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis | B60.1 (principal diagnosis) + L95.8 (Other specified disorders of the skin and subcutaneous tissue) |
| Disseminated infection | B60.1 (principal diagnosis) + B60.1 (additional code for disseminated disease) |

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on **detailed clinical documentation**. Physicians should explicitly document the following:

- Confirmation of Acanthamoeba infection by biopsy or other diagnostic methods [^66096a45].

- Specific anatomical site or organ involvement (e.g. brain, skin, sinuses) [^5f938525].

- Clinical manifestations and severity of the infection [^5f938525].

---

## Impact of accurate coding on patient care and reimbursement

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding for Acanthamoeba infection has **significant implications**:

- **Patient care**: Ensures appropriate clinical management, including antimicrobial therapy and supportive care [^ebc3ab7f].

- **Reimbursement**: Facilitates accurate billing and reimbursement for hospital services rendered [^cd4941f1].

- **Public health**: Contributes to epidemiological surveillance and understanding of rare infectious diseases [^439852f4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for biopsy-confirmed Acanthamoeba infection is **B60.1** (Acanthamoeba infection). This code should be used as the principal diagnosis when acanthamoebiasis is the primary reason for admission. Additional codes may be necessary to specify the anatomical site or clinical manifestation of the infection. Accurate coding and detailed clinical documentation are essential for optimal patient care, reimbursement, and public health surveillance.

Diagnosis and Detection Early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis. The infection is usually diagnosed by an eye specialist based on symptoms, growth of the ameba from a scraping of the eye, and/or seeing the ameba by a process called confocal microscopy. Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis and disseminated infection are more difficult to diagnose and are often at advanced stages when they are diagnosed. Tests useful in the diagnosis of GAE include brain scans, biopsies, or spinal taps. In disseminated disease, biopsy of the involved sites can be useful in diagnosis.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Parasitic skin and soft tissue disease in immunosuppressed patients — Skin and soft tissue structures of immunosuppressed patients can rarely be affected by parasites including Strongyloides stercoralis, free-living ameba (Acanthamoeba species and Balamuthia species), Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease), and Sarcoptes scabiei (Norwegian scabies). A high index of suspicion, a careful medical history, and early skin biopsy are important for successful diagnosis and successful treatment.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

NOTE: A surveillance case definition is a set of uniform criteria used to define a disease for public health surveillance. Surveillance case definitions enable public health officials to classify and count cases consistently across reporting jurisdictions. Surveillance case definitions are not intended to be used by healthcare providers for making a clinical diagnosis or determining how to meet an individual patient's health needs. CSTE Position Statement 16-ID-12 Subtype Acanthamoebadisease Balamuthia mandrillarisdisease Naegleria fowlericausing primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Subtype Case Definition Clinical Criteria An infection presenting as meningoencephalitis or encephalitis, disseminated disease, or cutaneous disease. Acanthamoeba species granulomatous amebic encephalitis presents similarly to Balamuthia mandrillaris GAE with early personality and behavioral changes, depressed mental status, fever, photophobia, seizures, nonspecific cranial nerve dysfunction, and visual loss. Skin lesions and sinus disease may also be seen. Laboratory Criteria For Diagnosis Confirmatory laboratory evidence: Detection of Acanthamoeba spp. antigen or nucleic acid, such as immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction from a clinical specimen or culture. Case Classification Confirmed A case that meets the clinical criteria and confirmatory laboratory criteria for diagnosis. Comments Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris can cause clinically similar illnesses and might be difficult to differentiate using commonly available laboratory procedures. Definitive diagnosis by a reference laboratory might be required. Several species of Acanthamoeba are associated with infection. A negative test on cerebrospinal fluid does not rule out Acanthamoeba spp. infection because the organism is not commonly present in the CSF. Although it is unknown if Acanthamoeba spp. can be transmitted via organ transplantation, patients presenting with the above clinical criteria who have received a solid organ transplant should be further investigated to determine if the infection was transmitted through the transplanted organ. An investigation of the donor should be initiated through notification of the organ procurement organization and transplant center. Clinical Criteria An infection presenting as meningoencephalitis or encephalitis, disseminated disease, or cutaneous disease.

Granulomatous amebic encephalitis can include general symptoms and signs of encephalitis such as early personality and behavioral changes, depressed mental status, fever, photophobia, seizures, nonspecific cranial nerve dysfunction, and visual loss. Painless skin lesions appearing as plaques a few millimeters thick and one to several centimeters wide have been observed in some patients, especially patients outside the United States, preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms by 1 month to approximately 2 years. Laboratory Criteria For Diagnosis Confirmatory laboratory evidence: Detection of B. mandrillaris antigen or nucleic acid, such as immunohistochemistry or PCR from a clinical specimen or culture.

### Acanthamoeba: a rare primary cause of rhinosinusitis [^b3bb07e5]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Parasitic infections, especially Acanthamoeba, are rarely implicated as a specific cause of rhinosinusitis. It is a fatal disease found in the immunocompromised population, in particular in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Less than 10 cases of Acanthamebic rhinosinusitis have been reported in the literature, and only 1 has survived. This case report presents an Acanthamebic infection misdiagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal septum on a presumptive healthy, immunocompetent 35-year-old woman. She was later diagnosed with AIDS (AIDS) along with disseminated Acanthamoebiasis and became the second reported case surviving this deadly illness. This case report also discusses the difficulty in diagnosing this rare parasite, the pathogenesis, and the multidisciplinary treatment required to control and manage this uniformly fatal disease.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Isolated cutaneous acanthamoebiasis under prophylactic anticryptococcal treatment in an immunocompromised patient [^ca9448e5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acanthamoeba species are unicellular, microscopic protozoans that live ubiquitously and cause severe, and sometimes fatal, infections in immunocompromised patients. Infections are classically described in the eye or central nervous system (CNS). Extracerebral acanthamoebiasis, including skin manifestations, may occur in the setting of disseminated disease. Herein, we provide a rare case of cutaneous acanthamoebiasis lacking CNS and eye involvement and in the setting of long-term antifungal therapy for a concomitant disseminated cryptococcal infection.

### Updates on coding in dermatology [^85de3cbf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Correct coding is an important component of effective dermatology practice management. Over the past several years there have been updates to many commonly used codes within dermatology. This review highlights many of these updates, such as: the skin biopsy codes have been subdivided to reflect the different biopsy techniques. The definition of complex linear repairs has been updated and clarified. Outpatient and inpatient evaluation and management visits have new coding guidelines to determine level of care. Dermatopathology consultation codes have been updated and category III codes related to digital pathology have been created. Understanding the details and nuances of each of these categories of codes is vital to ensuring appropriate coding is performed.

### Disseminated acanthamebiasis in a renal transplant recipient with osteomyelitis and cutaneous lesions: case report and literature review [^23cba046]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Disseminated acanthamebiasis is a rare disease that occurs predominantly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but also in immunosuppressed transplant recipients. Few reports have focused on non-HIV-infected patients, in whom the disease is more likely to go unsuspected and undiagnosed before death. We describe a renal transplant recipient with Acanthamoeba infection and review the literature. The patient presented with osteomyelitis and widespread cutaneous lesions. No causative organism was identified before death, despite multiple biopsies with detailed histological analysis and culture. Disseminated Acanthamoeba infection was diagnosed after death, when cysts were observed in histological examination of sections of skin from autopsy, and trophozoites were found in retrospectively reviewed skin biopsy and surgical bone specimens. In any immunosuppressed patient, skin and/or bone lesions that fail to show improvement with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should raise the suspicion for disseminated acanthamebiasis. Early recognition and treatment may improve clinical outcomes.

### Disseminated acanthamoeba infection presenting with cutaneous lesions in an immunocompromised patient: a case report, review of histomorphologic findings, and potential diagnostic pitfalls [^3ef2a41d]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Free-living amoebas are exceedingly rare causes of cutaneous infections and present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We describe a case of disseminated acanthamoebiasis with cutaneous manifestations and summarize additional diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic highlights.

Methods

A 58-year-old man with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia had several weeks of progressive, painful ulcerations on the forehead, arms, abdomen, and thighs. A biopsy was performed for histopathologic evaluation.

Results

The biopsy specimen showed inflammatory infiltrate with abscess formation involving the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis. Scattered cells showed nuclei with a prominent central karyosome, dispersed chromatin, and either abundant foamy basophilic cytoplasm or two well-demarcated cytoplasmic walls. Acanthamoeba species was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue.

Conclusions

Cutaneous lesions from acanthamoebiasis are exceptionally rare but should be included in the differential diagnosis of necrotic cutaneous lesions in immunocompromised patients. Although infrequently encountered, pathologists need to be aware of the morphologic features of free-living amoebas. Immunohistochemical and molecular studies can confirm the diagnosis. Multiagent treatment regimens, when initiated empirically, have been more successful than single-agent regimens, but infections involving the central nervous system are almost universally fatal.

### Clinical signs of non-keratitis acanthamoeba infections… [^5f938525]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Acanthamoebais a kind of single-celled living organism that can cause rare but serious infections of different parts of the body.
- People with weakened immune systems are at increased risk of non-keratitis Acanthamoebainfections.
- Nasal or sinus rinsing with tap water that has not been boiled might increase the risk of Acanthamoebainfections. Disease presentation Acanthamoeba can enter the body through a cut or a wound or by breathing it into the nostrils and lungs. The ameba can then travel through the bloodstream to other parts of the body and cause serious infections, including: Acanthamoebarhinosinusitis, an infection of the nasal cavity and sinuses.
- Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, a type of skin infection that can appear as reddish nodules, skin ulcers, or other skin lesions
- Granulomatous amebic encephalitis, an infection of the brain
- Disseminated infection, which affects multiple parts of the body.

More about disseminated infection Disseminated infection typically begins in the brain, sinuses, or skin, then spreads to other parts of the body. GAE, cutaneous acanthamoebiasis, and Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis can all spread to cause disseminated infections. Rarely, invasive Acanthamoeba infections have been reported in the lungs or bone without another site of infection. More about GAE GAE, which is usually fatal, can be difficult to diagnose and is often at an advanced stage when it is identified. Symptoms of GAE include:

- Confusion or other changes in mental status
- Fever
- Seizures
- Focal neurological deficits or difficulty walking
- Impaired speech, vision, or hearing
- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting.

Risk factors People most at risk of non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections have weakened immune systems resulting from:

- HIV/AIDS
- Cancer
- History of solid organ or stem cell transplant
- Diabetes mellitus
- Lupus
- Other immunocompromising conditions While unusual, disseminated infection can also affect healthy children and adults. There are no reports of an Acanthamoeba infection spreading from one person to another except through organ transplantation. Acanthamoeba amebas have been found in many types of water, including in tap water. People who perform sinus or nasal rinsing with tap water that has not been boiled may be at increased risk of non-keratitis Acanthamoeba infections. There have been at least 10 cases of Acanthamoeba infections in the United States associated with nasal rinsing. If you rinse your sinuses or nasal passages, use boiled tap water, distilled water, or sterilized water.

Clinical assessment Brain imaging is usually abnormal for people with GAE. A magnetic resonance imaging might show lesions, even if computed tomography scans are normal. Findings on brain imaging have included brain lesions that are sometimes ring-enhancing or hemorrhagic. Some patients have only one lesion, while others have many. Lesions can occur in any part of the brain. Over time, lesions can increase in both size and number. Patients with cutaneous acanthamoebiasis often present with erythematous skin nodules. While some patients only have a single lesion, most have multiple lesions. The size of the nodules can be variable, ranging from < 1 centimeter to several centimeters in diameter. Lesions can present on the face, extremities, or trunk. Over time, the nodules can ulcerate and form eschars. Sometimes the lesions are painless, and sometimes they are painful.

### Concept coverage analysis of ophthalmic infections and trauma among the standardized medical terminologies SNOMED-CT, ICD-10-CM, and ICD-11 [^c4818c27]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

The gaps seen in coverage for Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and SNOMED-CT were significantly less than the levels of representation in ICD-10-CM and ICD-11, in which approximately 50% of the concepts identified in the BCSC related to ophthalmic infection and ophthalmic trauma did not have equal matches. Based on a qualitative review of the clinical concepts without equal matches, the lack of equal representation did not appear to correspond to specific disease etiologies or to vary substantially by anatomical regions. One main driver appeared to be mismatches in granularity. For example, the SNOMED included codes with specific infectious etiologies, such as "Acanthamoeba endophthalmitis," whereas ICD included "endophthalmitis" and "parasitic endophthalmitis," but not specifically "Acanthamoeba endophthalmitis."

Another potential factor contributing to the reduced levels of equal coverage is varying approaches to precoordination versus postcoordination of codes. With a precoordinated approach, concepts are prespecified and can be highly specific and granular; multiple logical concepts are combined into a single code before storage or message transmission. In contrast, postcoordination allows for making new concepts by adding modifiers to existing concepts, which means that concepts are kept as multiple attributes/codes and combined after storage or transmission of an instance. One straightforward example of postcoordination is laterality, where a single code or concept can be combined with modifiers of "right eye" or "left eye" instead of having 2 separate prespecified codes. This cuts down on the total number of codes that need to be maintained over time. Although laterality did not apply to our analysis since we did not incorporate laterality into any of the source concepts (see Tables S2 and S3), some concepts may not have had an equivalent match during our analysis if a terminology was designed with a postcoordination approach in mind. This is particularly salient for ICD-11, where reliance on postcoordination has been promoted as a strategy for reducing the need for revision. In general, ICD-11 codes were less granular than ICD-10 and tended to describe classes/categories of conditions rather than specific conditions.

### A method for inferring medical diagnoses from patient similarities [^d961ba80]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In order to apply our method in a scenario that mimics the admission of new patients, we split the hospitalizations into training and validation subsets. For the ISR data, we used the available admission date to select hospitalizations that spanned the first year of our data (July 2010 to June 2011) as our training set and validated on hospitalizations occurring in the subsequent 211 days, totaling 999 hospitalizations. For the USA data, we split the data into train and test sets (two thirds and a third, respectively) using the available sequential ordering of their admission dates. As with the cross-validation scheme, we masked similarities between hospitalizations of the same patient. We computed the precision of our predictions by counting the number of patients for which the top predicted discharge code was the same as one of its true diagnoses. Similarly, we also computed the performance when testing whether the true discharge code of a patient appeared in the top two predictions, top three and up to the top ten predictions per patient.

In order to identify ICD codes that are significantly correctly predicted, we compared the number of correct predictions for each ICD code against a background of 10 5 randomly shuffled patient-diagnosis associations sets.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^46dfe7de]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

The ability of the O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify true injury cases is unknown. Furthermore, per the ICD-10-CM guidelines for Coding and Reporting, codes from Chapter 15, PCP (O00-O9A) 'have sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other chapters may be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes to further specify conditions'.Specifically, O9A.2 'should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury, poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or under-dosing code, and then the additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing'. Similarly, O9A.3-O9A.4 should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate codes to identify any associated current injury due to physical abuse or sexual abuse. However, it has not been studied how often and why the O9A.2-O9A.5 are listed as a secondary diagnosis, and what percentage of injuries complicating pregnancy-related outcomes are potentially missed when the definition for injury hospitalisations captures only principal diagnoses of O9A.2-O9A.5.

ICD-10-CM coding of inpatient and emergency department discharge data follows guidelines for assigning a principal diagnosis. In inpatient data, the principal diagnosis is defined as 'that condition established after study to be the chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care'. This definition does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services, including emergency department visits. In outpatient settings, the first-listed diagnosis represents 'the code for the diagnosis, condition, problem or other reason for the encounter/visit shown in the medical record as chiefly responsible for the service provided. In some cases the first-listed diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the physician'.

This analysis evaluates the ability of O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify injuries in inpatient and emergency department discharge claims from one healthcare facility in Kentucky, looking additionally at the codes' positive predictive value (PPV) when used as a principal diagnosis within inpatient data, as a secondary diagnosis within inpatient data, and in any position within emergency department data.

Table 1
Estimated positive predictive values (PPVs) for ICD-10-CM codes O9A

Among the 43 inpatient cases with a principal diagnosis in the range O9A.2-O9A.4, 39 were confirmed as injuries and 38 were confirmed as injuries complicating PCP. Therefore, the estimated PPV for an inpatient principal diagnosis O9A.2-O9A.4 to capture an injury was 90.7% (95% CI 82.0% to 99.4%) and to capture an injury PCP was 88.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 98.4%). Of the 30 inpatient cases with a secondary diagnosis in the range O9A.2-O9A.4, six were confirmed as injuries and seven were confirmed as injuries complicating PCP (note: there was one complicated encounter that required adjudication and was determined as an encounter not involving care for an injury but involving care for pregnancy complications due to a previous injury/assault). Therefore, the estimated PPV for an inpatient secondary diagnosis O9A.2-O9A.4 to capture an injury was 20.0% (95% CI 4.8% to 35.2%) and to capture an injury complicating PCP was 23.3% (95% CI 7.3% to 39.4%).

### Clinical testing and diagnosis for non-keratitis acanthamoeba… [^66096a45]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Acanthamoebainfections often are misdiagnosed as other illnesses.
- Tests are available to diagnose Acanthamoebainfections.
- CDC can help with testing for Acanthamoebainfections. Testing and diagnosis Acanthamoeba can cause a serious brain infection called granulomatous amebic encephalitis. GAE can be confused with other neurologic diseases and conditions, even noninfectious ones like stroke. Tests useful in the diagnosis of GAE include brain scans, biopsies, or spinal taps. Disseminated Acanthamoeba infection can affect many organs in the body. GAE and other infections caused by Acanthamoeba, including cutaneous acanthamoebaiasis and Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis, can spread to cause disseminated infections. GAE and disseminated infection can be difficult to diagnose and are often at advanced stages when identified. GAE often is diagnosed after someone dies.

For all disease presentations, biopsy of the sites involved such as the brain, skin, or sinuses is most helpful in making a diagnosis. Tests that can help confirm a diagnosis of. Acanthamoeba infection:

- Immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence staining use specific antibodies against Acanthamoebato detect the ameba.
- A polymerase chain reaction molecular assay can detect AcanthamoebaDNA in tissue. CDC offers diagnostic assistance and testing for Acanthamoeba to physicians and scientists through DPDx and the Free-living and Intestinal Amebas laboratory. Morphology experts at DPDx can evaluate microscopic images, while the scientists at the FLIA laboratory provide diagnostic assistance using molecular and immunofluorescence assays.

We included data from patients with a first diagnosis of each infection in the IBM ® MarketScan ® Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and in the MarketScan ® Multi-State Medicaid Database (IBM ® Watson Health, Ann Arbor, MI) between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2019 using the online tool, Truven Health MarketScan Treatment Pathways. For 2013 through 2019, the MarketScan ® Commercial Claims and Encounters Database includes approximately 88 million individuals with employer-sponsored private health insurance; the MarketScan ® Multi-State Medicaid Database includes 17 million Medicaid-covered individuals. Note that these individuals may not have been included in the databases during the entire study period.

We defined each infection using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes between January 1, 2013 and September 30, 2015, and ICD-10-CM codes between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 (Table 1). We excluded rule-out diagnoses (i.e. claims with the selected ICD diagnosis codes that the database administrators determined to be for laboratory tests only). For each infection, we defined standard-of-care (SOC) prescription drugs based on expert opinion or clinical trials when available (Table 1). –

- Free-living amebae infections Acanthamoebakeratitis Balamuthia mandrillarisdisease Naegleria fowlericausing primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Clinical Description The genus Acanthamoeba includes several species of opportunistic free-living amebae that might invade the brain through the blood, probably from a primary infection in the skin or sinuses. Once in the brain, the amebae cause granulomatous amebic encephalitis.

Initial symptoms of Acanthamoeba GAE might include headache, photophobia, and stiff neck accompanied by positive Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. Other symptoms might include nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, muscle aches, weight loss, mental-state abnormalities, lethargy, dizziness, loss of balance, cranial nerve palsies, other visual disturbances, hemiparesis, seizures, and coma. Once the disease progresses to neurologic infection, it is generally fatal within weeks or months. However, a few patients have survived this infection. Laboratory Criteria For Diagnosis Laboratory-confirmed Acanthamoeba spp. infections are defined as the detection of Acanthamoeba spp.
- Organisms in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens, OR
- Nucleic acid in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens, OR
- Antigen in CSF, biopsy, or tissue specimens.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Microsporidia and acanthamoeba: the role of emerging corneal pathogens [^aec937e4]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Parasitic organisms are increasingly recognized as human corneal pathogens. A notable increase in both well-defined Acanthamoeba keratitis and a more dramatic increase in reported cases of Microsporidia keratitis have suggested significant outbreaks of parasitic keratitis around the world. Historical and contemporary baselines as well as a familiar associated clinical presentation reinforce the significant outbreak of Acanthamoeba keratitis in the United States. The remarkable rise in cases of Microsporidia keratitis, however, lacks these established baselines and, further, describes a disease that is inconsistent with previous definitions of disease. While a well-defined, abrupt increase strongly suggests temporally related risk factors, most likely environmental, involved in the Acanthamoeba outbreak, the rise in Microsporidia keratitis suggests that increased awareness and improved diagnostic acumen are a significant factor in case ascertainment. Regardless, recent evidence indicates that both parasitic diseases are likely underreported in various forms of infectious keratitis, which may have unrecognized but significant implications in the pathogenesis of both primary protozoal and polymicrobial keratitis. Further understanding of the incidence and interaction of these organisms with current therapeutic regimens and more commonly recognized pathogens should significantly improve diagnosis and alter clinical outcomes.

Table 1
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and ICD-10-CM codes, and standard-of-care (SOC) prescription drugs by infection

For each infection, we included patients covered by private insurance or Medicaid only. We excluded patients potentially covered by Medicare, including those enrolled in employer-sponsored Medicare supplemental plans (private insurance sample) or those 65 years or older at the first diagnosis (Medicaid sample) (Figure 1). We excluded patients if they were not enrolled continuously in private insurance or Medicaid from 30 days before and for 90 days after the first diagnosis. We excluded hospitalized patients and those with multiple parasitic infections because of the complexity of determining the SOC. We estimated treatment rates as follows: we classified patients as treated with SOC prescription drugs if they had insurance drug claims for at least one indicated SOC prescription drug (Table 1) between 30 days before and up to 90 days after their first diagnosis. We did not consider treatment with non-SOC prescription drugs. We defined the treatment rate for each infection as the number of patients treated with at least one indicated SOC drug divided by the total number of patients diagnosed for a given infection. For each infection, we compared treatment rates among those who had private insurance with treatment rates for those with Medicaid by using odds ratios. We also compared treatment rates for the 10 parasitic infections and treatment rates for two common infections after subdividing by insurance type (private insurance and Medicaid) using odds ratios. Odds ratios for opisthorchiasis were not estimated because of zero count cells.

### Notes from the field: acanthamoeba keratitis cases-Iowa, 2002–2017 [^87097304]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Acanthamoeba is a ubiquitous protozoan that feeds on bacteria and yeast. Because of its ability to encyst in extreme environmental conditions, the organism is difficult to kill. Contact lens wearers exposed to any water source are at highest risk for developing Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a severe corneal infection that can result in painful blindness. Variable findings when patients seek treatment contribute to the underdiagnosis of AK, and the amoeba's resistance to killing makes AK a challenging infection to treat for ophthalmologists. The incidence of Acanthamoeba keratitis in the United States is estimated to be one to two new cases per 1 million contact lens wearers annually; approximately 16.7% of U.S. adults wear contact lenses. Among the estimated 2.42 million Iowa residents aged ≥ 18 years, including an expected 404,267 adult contact lens wearers (16.7%), 0.4–0.8 new AK cases per year would be expected in Iowa. However, the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics (UIHC), the only tertiary care center in Iowa, diagnosed 15 new AK cases in 2015, 14 of which were adults. Because of this apparent excess in occurrent cases, a retrospective investigation was performed to ascertain AK cases evaluated at UIHC during a 16-year period.

"Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field;" if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters." For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality;" if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available." A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)."

Treatment Groups

When cultured, out of 227 patients (30.6%), there were no signs of growth for any organisms. In the case of 341 patients (46.0%), positive bacterial cultures were observed, while 156 patients (21.0%) exhibited fungal infections. A smaller portion, 10 patients (1.3%), showed positive cultures for viruses, and 7 patients (0.9%) had parasitic infections, all of which were caused by Acanthamoeba species. Table 5 compares clinical characteristics among patients with different culture results. For patients with negative and positive cultures, no statistically significant differences were observed in age at presentation, number of surgical treatments, LOS, and BCVA at presentation, with p-values of 0.086, 0.133, 0.955, and 0.698, respectively. Similarly, among patients with positive cultures, there were no statistically significant differences in these clinical characteristics, with p-values of 0.070, 0.630, 0.580, and 0.641, respectively. Table 6 presents a comparison of the direct MK treatment costs per patient in each cost category for inpatients, categorized by culture-proven causative organisms. There was no statistically significant difference (p-value 0.312) between the total direct treatment costs for patients with negative cultures (median US$9998.88, Q1–Q3 US$5580.95–21,660.23) and those with positive cultures (median US$10,836.74, Q1–Q3 US$5966.79–25,056.15). Regardless of whether the expenses were incurred as part of hospital services costs, medical professional services costs, investigation costs, operative treatment costs, or non-operative treatment costs (p-values 0.680, 0.984, 0.105, 0.604, and 0.263). Among culture-positive cases, there was no statistically significant difference in direct healthcare costs in each category. However, it's worth noting that cases of parasite infections among culture-positive patients resulted in the highest expenditure for inpatient care, primarily in terms of medical professional services and non-operative care, with each of these being statistically non-significant at p-values 0.918 and 0.344, respectively.

### Use of commercial claims data for evaluating trends in Lyme disease diagnoses, United States, 2010–2018 [^3aaee994]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Identification of Lyme Disease Diagnoses in MarketScan

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes are included in inpatient and outpatient healthcare encounter records in MarketScan; < 15 diagnosis codes are included in each inpatient record and < 4 diagnosis codes are included in each outpatient record. ICD-9-CM codes from the ICD, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), were used before October 2015; after this date, coding specialists were required to use codes from the ICD, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in the United States.

For this analysis, we defined an outpatient Lyme disease diagnosis as the first outpatient healthcare encounter record per calendar year with a diagnosis code for Lyme disease (ICD-9-CM code 088.81 or ICD-10-CM code A69.2x) and a prescription for > 7 days of treatment with an antimicrobial drug appropriate for Lyme disease and filled within + 30 days of the encounter date. This approach was highly similar to the previous effort by Nelson et al. but with the necessary addition of ICD-10-CM codes (Appendix). We defined an inpatient Lyme disease diagnosis as a hospitalization record that contained a principal diagnosis code for Lyme disease, or a principal diagnosis code of a documented objective clinical manifestation of Lyme disease or a tickborne disease transmitted by the same vector (e.g. babesiosis) and a secondary diagnosis code for Lyme disease in the same record (Appendix). We included 1 Lyme disease diagnosis per person per calendar year; we used the earliest date of service on which all criteria were met as proxy for illness onset date for analysis of seasonality.

Comparison of Lyme Disease Diagnoses in MarketScan with Cases Reported through Public Health Surveillance

Lyme disease cases are classified and reported by states according to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists surveillance case definition in effect during the year of report. For our analysis, we used confirmed and probable cases among those < 65 years of age reported to CDC during 2010–2018. We compared Lyme disease diagnoses as identified in MarketScan to those of cases reported through national public health surveillance with respect to incidence, seasonality, sex, age, and geographic distributions.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity," and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity." Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice." New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness," and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs." To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service," exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms."

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate that the entry of contaminated water or soil or insects into the eye and trauma are the major risk factors for Acanthamoeba keratitis. Confocal microscopy should play an important role in the diagnosis of these patients, an early and prompt diagnosis is associated with a good prognosis, and therapeutic keratoplasty is an effective therapy for treating AK. Our data reflect our meaningful clinical experience and represent a reference for Acanthamoeba keratitis.

### Diagnostic consistency between admission and discharge of pediatric cases in a tertiary teaching hospital in China [^f06a1caa]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

One major limitation in this study is that given a legally sensitive nature, we could not verify the rate of intentional miscoding, and thus the coders` adherence to coding ethics, as well as the medicolegal consequences of diagnostic discordance. Also, since we could not accurately categorize and present the observed coder-level errors due to multiple possibilities in many cases (Table 1), we cannot provide specific recommendations for improvement.

In summary, investigating diagnostic consistency by using the ICD system is objective, less labor-intensive, and less error-prone, but the accuracy of consistency rests on coding accuracy and consistency classification criteria. Interpretation of discordance could be problematic in infectious diseases for which pathogen identification is required for management, leading to mismatched codes. Contingent upon the nature of the clinical condition, a discordance between admission and discharge ICD-10 codes may indicate the presence of a potential diagnostic error, coding error, code manipulation, or the normal/typical diagnostic process with or without significant impact on clinical outcome. Therefore, the ICD code should not be used as a stand-alone assessment tool for diagnostic consistency but rather as a guide for further investigation of high-risk clinical conditions, for instance, following the Safer Dx Instrument with a 13-item checklist to identify the diagnostic problems for quality improvement.

### Acanthamoeba keratitis: are recent cases more severe? [^df3edf0b]. Cornea (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To identify a recent change in disease severity and visual outcomes of patients with Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) at Wills Eye Hospital (WEH).

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of all cases diagnosed with AK at WEH between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2015. Failure of treatment was defined as having a final best-corrected visual acuity worse than 20/100 and/or requiring keratoplasty. The patients were grouped into 2 outcome categories: successfully treated and those who failed treatment; and prognostic factors associated with failure status were evaluated. Additionally, patients who presented from 2009 to 2012 (labeled "first interval") were compared with those who presented more recently from 2013 to 2015 (labeled "second interval") to determine whether the treatment outcomes and patients' characteristics from the 2 intervals were different.

Results

Fifty-nine patients were diagnosed. The rate of treatment failure in the second interval was significantly higher than in the first interval (68% vs. 28%, P = 0.004). Compared with the patients in the first interval, those who presented in the second interval were significantly older, were treated with more corticosteroids before diagnosis, had more days from the symptom onset to initiation of AK treatment, and presented to WEH with poorer vision.

Conclusions

In recent years, the general profile of patients with AK has changed at WEH. Currently, we are treating older patients with more severe keratitis who are presenting later and with worse vision compared with our previous patients. At the same time, treatment outcomes have been poorer.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^3a864023]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct," "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field," and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters." For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned," and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available." When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1," "Left is always 2," and "Bilateral is always 3."

### The brief case: meningoencephalitis in a transplant recipient [^0199f292]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of free-living amebae is frequently delayed or even identified post-mortem. Clinically, Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia should be on the differential diagnoses of subacute presentations of meningoencephalitis, particularly for immunocompromised hosts. Culturing of free-living amebae is a diagnostic tool that is relatively affordable for microbiology laboratories but may depend upon invasive tissue sampling, and laboratory ability to grow amebae in described conditions. Acanthamoeba can be cultured from the brain and other tissue samples using specific conditions (that do not support the growth of more fastidious Balamuthia); for instance, monoxenic culture on non-nutrient agar seeded with a lawn of Escherichia coli, and then morphologically identified by microscopic examination. On light microscopy, Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia are easily distinguishable from Naegleria (Table 1). Compared to Naegleria, Acanthamoeba trophozoites are larger, have more numerous and spinier pseudopodia ("acanthopodia"), are less motile at room temperature, and cannot enter a flagellate stage. Acanthamoeba cysts can form in human tissue, unlike Naegleria cysts. Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia are nearly indistinguishable on light microscopy but electron microscopy can be used to identify that Acanthamoeba cysts have two-layered walls with pores, whereas Balamuthia cysts have three-layered walls without pores. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, or nucleic acid detection techniques can also be used to identify Acanthamoeba from tissue samples. Our patient did not have keratitis nor other mucocutaneous manifestations of the infection, which are more accessible than brain tissue for biopsy and could provide an earlier diagnosis.

### Cure of acanthamoeba cerebral abscess in a liver transplant patient [^9dfe41df]. Liver Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Acanthamoeba-related cerebral abscess and encephalitis are rare but usually fatal, being caused by free-living amoebic infections usually occurring in immunocompromised patients. In patients receiving transplants, a literature review showed that the infection is universally fatal. The diagnosis is often missed despite appropriate investigations including lumbar puncture, computerized tomography, and brain biopsy. We present the first reported liver transplant patient with Acanthamoeba cerebral abscess. The diagnosis was made in brain tissue removed at decompressive frontal lobectomy. He was successfully treated with a 3-month course of co-trimoxazole and rifampicin. There was no recurrence of the disease after 11 years of follow-up.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### ICD-10-CM codes for tuberculosis… [^11195dc1]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Health care providers can use International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification codes to distinguish between initial testing for latent tuberculosis infection and evaluation/screening for TB disease in medical records. International Classification of Diseases The International Classification of Diseases is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of mortality statistics. The World Health Organization owns and publishes the classification. In addition to the main ICD, WHO authorizes the U. S. government to develop a modification for classifying morbidity from inpatient and outpatient records, physician offices, and most National Center for Health Statistics surveys. This modification is known as the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification. ICD-CM codes improve data collection.

As CDC and health departments work with primary care providers to expand targeted testing and treatment for latent TB infection, it is important to better distinguish between initial testing for latent TB infection and evaluation/screening for TB disease in medical records. From 2017–2018, CDC worked with state and local TB programs and NCHS to develop new and modify existing ICD-CM codes, which will allow healthcare providers to improve clinical documentation related to latent TB infection and TB disease. ICD-CM codes are not primarily used for public health surveillance purposes. However, they provide a way to measure uptake of healthcare recommendations and guidelines, such as the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendation to screen for latent TB infection in populations at increased risk.

The codes improve the ability to collect and use data for evidence-based decision-making at both the patient and population levels, as well as monitor latent TB infection testing trends outside of health department settings. ICD-10-CM codes for TB The 2020 release of ICD-10-CM included the following new and/or modified codes related to TB. Please note that Clinical Modifications may not reflect changes to WHO's codes, for example, to modify wording. New ICD-10-CM codes: Z11. 7: "Encounter for testing for latent tuberculosis infection" Z86. 15: "Personal history of latent tuberculosis infection" Z22. 7: "Carrier of latent tuberculosis, " which includes a previous positive test for TB infection without evidence of disease, but excludes:

- "Nonspecific reaction to cell-mediated immunity measurement of gamma interferon antigen response without active tuberculosis", and
- "Nonspecific reaction to tuberculin skin test without active tuberculosis".
- "Nonspecific reaction to cell-mediated immunity measurement of gamma interferon antigen response without active tuberculosis",… Modified ICD-10-CM code: Z11. 1: "Encounter for screening for respiratory tuberculosis" now includes "Encounter for screening for active tuberculosis disease".

### Infections caused by free-living amoebae [^ebc3ab7f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba spp., and Balamuthia mandrillaris result in a variety of clinical manifestations in humans. These amoebae are found in water and soil worldwide. Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), which usually presents as a mass, while N. fowleri causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Acanthamoeba spp. can also cause keratitis, and both Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris can cause lesions in skin and respiratory mucosa. These amoebae can be difficult to diagnose clinically as these infections are rare and, if not suspected, can be misdiagnosed with other more common diseases. Microscopy continues to be the key first step in diagnosis, but the amoeba can be confused with macrophages or other infectious agents if an expert in infectious disease pathology or clinical microbiology is not consulted. Although molecular methods can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis, these are only available in referral centers. Treatment requires combination of antibiotics and antifungals and, even with prompt diagnosis and treatment, the mortality for neurological disease is extremely high.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Human acanthocephaliasis: a thorn in the side of parasite diagnostics [^ac740012]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acanthocephala is a phylum of parasitic pseudocoelomates that infect a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts and can cause zoonotic infections in humans. The zoologic literature is quite rich and diverse; however, the human-centric literature is sparse, with sporadic reports over the past 70years. Causal agents of acanthocephaliasis in humans are reviewed as well as their biology and life cycle. This review provides the first consolidated and summarized report of human cases of acanthocephaliasis based on English language publications, including epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and diagnosis and identification.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Epidemiology of hospitalized patients with babesiosis, United States, 2010–2016 [^f6da02e4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study uses 7 years of data (i.e. 2010–2016) from the NIS, the largest publicly available inpatient healthcare database in the United States. The NIS was developed as a federal–state–industry partnership by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Data before 2012 used a 20% stratified probability sample of hospitals rather than discharges. After a redesign in 2012, the NIS adopted a sampling design that uses a stratified probability sample of 20% of all HCUP participating hospital discharges for each calendar year. This sampling scheme is estimated to cover 90%–97% of the US population across the different years. The unit of analysis is a single hospitalization and not a specific patient; therefore, a single patient may be represented in multiple observations. Observations are self-weighted and calculated by strata, which are defined by census division (categorized as census region before 2012), bed size, location, teaching status, and hospital ownership.

The NIS provides de-identified discharge data without individual patient or hospital-level identifiers. These data include 1 primary or principal diagnosis code, up to 29 secondary diagnosis codes, and up to 15 procedure codes. The principal diagnosis is the primary reason for admission and is coded in the first diagnosis field. The number of diagnoses and associated data elements was increased from 15 to 25 in 2009 and from 25 to 30 beginning in 2014. We have captured this change in our analysis.

Demographic details extracted from the database were age, sex, and race. Hospital-level characteristics were location (urban vs rural), academic designation (teaching vs. nonteaching), and bed size. Hospitals were categorized as small, medium, or large according to the criteria defined by HCUP, which were based on region, urban–rural designation, and teaching status. Other variables included admission and discharge status, total charges, expected payment source, length of hospital stay, and hospital characteristics. The NIS database uses All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs), a validated inpatient classification system that is widely used in the United States to assess severity of illness and risk for death during hospitalization using multiple variables. The risk for death and severity of illness are ranked on a scale of 1 to 4, corresponding to mild, moderate, major, and extreme.

### Brain-eating amoebae: predilection sites in the brain and disease outcome [^2c77a584]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Acanthamoeba spp. and Balamuthia mandrillaris are causative agents of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), while Naegleria fowleri causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM is an acute infection that lasts a few days, while GAE is a chronic to subacute infection that can last up to several months. Here, we present a literature review of 86 case reports from 1968 to 2016, in order to explore the affinity of these amoebae for particular sites of the brain, diagnostic modalities, treatment options, and disease outcomes in a comparative manner.

### Hospital readmissions among adults living with and without HIV in the US: findings from the nationwide readmissions database [^132285b1]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of variables

The independent variable of interest was patient HIV status. PWH were identified using Clinical Classifications Software Refined v2022.1(CCSR) for ICD-10-CM code developed by HCUP. We used the CCSR code INF006 (equivalent to ICD-10-CM codes B20, B9735, O98711, O98712, O98713, O98719, O9872, O9873, Z21) to define PWH. If any hospitalizations for a given patient indicated HIV infection, no matter if it was an incident or chronic infection, we assumed this person had HIV for all hospitalizations. The remaining hospitalizations excluding PWH were considered PWoH.

We defined the primary reason for index admissions using the first ranked ICD-10-CM code. However, similar to a previous validation study, if the top-ranked ICD-10-CM code was HIV or chronic hepatitis C virus infection (ICD-10-CM code B182), then we assigned the next highest-ranked other diagnosis as the primary reason for the index admission. Consistent with multiple prior studies, we then used the CCSR to group the primary reason for index admission into clinically meaningful non-mutually exclusive categories. We also created a separate category of AIDS-defining illnesses according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the final list of ICD-10-CM codes to define this category was confirmed by three clinicians (Supplemental Table S1). We additionally created a separate category of non-AIDS-defining infections (i.e. infectious or parasitic diseases that were not AIDS-defining illnesses) and the ICD-10-CM codes are available upon request. Lastly, we excluded the code for AIDS-defining illness and non-AIDS-defining infections from all the other CCSR groups to allow these two categories to be mutually exclusive of the other categories.

### Opioid prescribing patterns for ulcerative keratitis [^f7238303]. Cornea (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to characterize rates of opioid prescription for different ulcerative keratitis types.

Methods

This cohort study included patients diagnosed with ulcerative keratitis according to the University of Michigan electronic health record data between September 1, 2014 and December 22, 2020. Ulcerative keratitis was categorized by etiologic type (bacterial, fungal, viral, acanthamoeba, inflammatory, polymicrobial, or unspecified) using rule-based data classification that accounted for billing diagnosis code, antimicrobial or antiinflammatory medications prescribed, laboratory results, and manual chart review. Opioid prescriptions were converted to morphine milligram equivalent and summed over 90 days from diagnosis. Opioid prescription rate and amount were compared between ulcerative keratitis types.

Results

Of 3322 patients with ulcerative keratitis, 173 (5.2%) were prescribed at least 1 opioid for pain management within 90 days of diagnosis. More patients with acanthamoeba (32.4%), fungal (21.1%), and polymicrobial (25.0%) keratitis were treated with opioids compared with bacterial (6.7%), unspecified (2.9%), or viral (1.8%) keratitis (all Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.05). For the 173 patients who were prescribed opioids, a total of 353 prescriptions were given within 90 days of diagnosis, with half given within the first week after diagnosis. The quantity of opioid prescribed within 90 days from diagnosis was not significantly different between ulcerative keratitis types (P = 0.6559). Morphine milligram equivalent units prescribed ranged from 97.5 for acanthamoeba keratitis to 112.5 for fungal keratitis.

Conclusions

The type of ulcerative keratitis may influence the opioid prescription rate. Providers can better serve patients needing opioids for pain management through improved characterization of pain and development of more tailored pain management regimens.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

### Estimation of undiagnosed naegleria fowleri primary amebic meningoencephalitis, United States [^7c16682b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Naegleria fowleri causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM); 0–8 laboratory confirmed cases per year are documented in the United States). PAM causes < 0.5% of diagnosed encephalitis deaths in the United States. Laboratory-confirmed PAM case-patients in the United States are a median age of 12 years and are identified primarily in southern states during July–September, and 79% are male. Many case-patients are identified postmortem; 4 known survivors have been reported in the United States. The signs and symptoms of PAM can be mistaken for other more common neuroinfections, such as bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis. Because more than half of neuroinfectious deaths are unspecified, clinical expertise and diagnostic testing availability are limited, and true PAM incidence is unknown, concern is reasonable that PAM cases might not be diagnosed. In this study, we estimate the magnitude of potentially undiagnosed cases of PAM by applying previously identified epidemiologic risk factors to unspecified neuroinfectious deaths.

We created a list of codes from the International Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10), for unspecified possible neuroinfectious deaths by using previously published data, ICD-10 codes from death certificates of known PAM case-patients, and expert opinion. We selected codes from any location on the death record, not strictly the primary or immediate cause of death. We chose to start in 1999 when death certificate data were first coded by using ICD-10 and ended in 2010, using the most updated data at the time of this analysis. Persons 2–22 years of age were included (± 10 years from the average age of 12 years), excluding infants and older adults, who are more susceptible to bacterial meningitis. We applied known risk factors for PAM: 1) geographic location, i.e. states that reported diagnosed cases as of 2010; 2) summer seasons; and 3) sex. Within this narrowed subset of unspecified neuroinfectious deaths, we reviewed associated ICD-10 codes and removed death records that had more definitive diagnoses.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^48de2a3f]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM terminology — urinary tract infection (UTI) coding options and suggested use include site-specific bladder codes N30.00 "Acute/active infection of the bladder without hematuria" and N30.01 "Acute/active infection of the bladder with hematuria," chronic codes N30.20 "Chronic infection of the bladder" and N30.21 "Chronic infection of the bladder with hematuria," and N30.90 "Recurrent bacterial infection of the bladder"; non-site-specific N39.0 is listed for "Acute/active infection of the urinary tract, site not specified (should not be used if site known)," for "Frequent infection of the urinary tract, site not specified; clinician should become alert for possible recurrent UTI diagnosis," and for "Recurrent infection of the urinary tract, site not specified (should not be used if site known)"; history coding uses Z87.440 for scenarios such as "History of infection of the bladder," "History of infection of the urinary tract, site not specified," and "History of frequent infections of the urinary tract, site not specified"; laboratory finding codes include R82.71 "+Urine culture, no UTI symptoms, patient not currently taking UTI antibiotics" and R82.79 "+Urine culture without information regarding patient symptom status"; additional infectious agent codes for active infection are B95.2 "Enterococcus," B96.1 "K. pneumoniae," B96.2 "E. coli," B96.4 "Proteus," and B96.5 "Pseudomonas," and the table notes the category prefixes where "N denotes 'Genitourinary System,' Z, 'Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services (similar to 'V-codes' in past coding terminology); R, 'Symptoms, Signs and Abnormal Clinical and Lab Findings'.

### Utility of investigation for suspected microbial keratitis: a diagnostic accuracy study [^f93c4b81]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The true disease status of a population with suspected microbial keratitis (MK) cannot be verified. There is not an accurate (gold) reference standard to confirm infection and inter-test comparisons of sensitivity and specificity therefore lead to bias with questionable estimates of test utility. We present an alternative method to report results.

Methods

We used a decision to treat as the definition for MK. We retrospectively compared the results of corneal culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as these are objective tests available for the three principal groups of pathogens. We then estimated the potential contribution of positive results, either alone or in combination, to support the working diagnosis.

Results

We included 2021 (77.4%) eyes with suspected bacterial keratitis, 365 (14.0%) with suspected acanthamoeba keratitis, and 226 (8.6%) with suspected fungal keratitis, all treated between July 2013 and December 2019. In these groups, there were 51.6% positive culture and 6.5% positive PCR results for bacteria, 19.0% and 40.5% for acanthamoeba, and 28.3% and 15.0% for fungi. Between groups the differences in the proportions of positive results from culture and PCR was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The added benefit of PCR to the result of culture in identifying a potential pathogen was 1.4% for bacteria (P = 0.6292), 24.4% for acanthamoeba (P = 0.0001), and 5.8% for fungi (P = 0.3853).

Conclusions

For suspected MK a comparison of the test positivity rate is an easily comprehensible outcome measure of test utility.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

Intravenous liposomal amphotericin B was discontinued and oral flucytosine was increased to 1500 mg daily. High-dose oral fluconazole 600 mg daily, intravenous pentamidine 165 mg daily, oral miltefosine 50 mg twice daily, and oral sulfadiazine 1500 mg every 6 hours were also added to the treatment regimen per infectious disease. Repeat lumbar puncture and brain magnetic resonance imaging did not show evidence of CNS disease; therefore, pentamidine was discontinued within 1 week. Miltefosine was continued for 6 weeks, until the cutaneous ulcerations healed (Fig 3). Investigation of the patient's underlying immunodeficiency revealed deficiencies in both B- and T-cell function (Table I) and she was given a diagnosis of combined variable immunodeficiency.

### Case report: management of acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^e387e336]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by free-living amoebae pose a significant public health threat owing to growing populations of immunocompromised hosts combined with diagnostic delays, treatment difficulties, and high case fatality rates. Nasopharyngeal infections caused by Acanthamoeba are rare and the optimal treatment is not well established. We report a case of Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who presented with headaches and chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to multiple courses of antibiotics. A diagnosis of Acanthamoeba rhinosinusitis was established through broad-range polymerase chain reaction testing on sinus tissue. The patient had a favorable response to treatment, which included surgical debridement, cessation of immunosuppressants, and a three-drug regimen consisting of miltefosine, fluconazole, and sulfadiazine.

### Survival of acanthamoeba cysts after desiccation for more than 20 years [^ac9d6252]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Acanthamoeba is a free-living ameba that is found throughout the world and that causes encephalitis, keratitis, and cutaneous infections in humans. It has two stages in its life cycle: a trophic stage and a resistant cyst stage. We describe here the ability of Acanthamoeba cysts to survive desiccation for more than 20 years.

### Perspectives on the incidence of acanthamoeba keratitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7cb32923]. Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Topic

To provide an overview on the incidence of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK).

Clinical Relevance

Although being a sight-threatening cause of infectious keratitis, a comprehensive assessment of the incidence of AK is lacking.

Methods

Incidence of AK was computed as the number of eyes with AK per health care center, per year (annualized center incidence [ACI]). Two meta-analytical ratios also were calculated: (1) the ratio of eyes with AK to the count of eyes with nonviral microbial keratitis (MK) and (2) the ratio of eyes with AK to the overall population (i.e., the total number of people in a nation or region, as indicated by the authors in each study). Center was defined as the health care facility where the study took place. Actual and projected estimates of the number of eyes with AK in years were calculated multiplying the ratio of eyes with AK to the total population and the corresponding population estimates, sourced from the United Nations Population Prospects.

Results

Overall, 105 articles were included, published between 1987 and 2022. The total number of eyes identified was 91 951, with 5660 eyes affected by AK and 86 291 eyes affected by nonviral MK. The median ACI was 1.9 eyes with AK per health care center per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–2.6 eyes), with no statistically significant differences among continents. The ratio of eyes with AK to the total number of eyes with MK was 1.52% (95% CI, 1.03%-2.22%), whereas the ratio of eyes with AK in relationship to the entire population was estimated at 2.34 eyes per 1 000 000 people (95% CI, 0.98–5.55 per 1 000 000 people). The projected increase in the numbers of eyes with AK indicated an increase of 18.5% (n = 15 355 eyes with AK) in 2053 and 25.5% (n = 16 253 eyes with AK) in 2073, compared with the baseline of 2023 (n = 12 953 eyes with AK).

Discussion

Acanthamoeba keratitis emerged as a relatively low-incident disorder, and no significant differences in terms of its incidence were found among different continents.

### A method for inferring medical diagnoses from patient similarities [^4edba0bf]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prospective validation

Next, we applied our method in a scenario that mimics the admission of new patients. We split the hospitalizations into training and validation subsets, based on admission date when available (Methods). In the following, we report first the USA dataset performance and the ISR performance is provided in parentheses for clarity. As we focus on predicting at least one primary diagnosis per patient, we measure our performance by computing the percentage of patients with at least one correct prediction (that is, precision). While the top predicted discharge code was correct for 18% (17%) of the patients, the top ten predictions contained a correct discharge code for 67% (64%) of the patients. We note that the task here is more challenging than the previous 'cross-validation' one since the latter evaluates a specific set of options for ICD codes (those in the test set) while here we evaluate all possible codes as we have no prior information for a new patient. One reason for the lower precision lies in the fact that discharge diagnosis codes include also 'secondary' discharge codes, ranked lower than the top two discharge codes for a patient. Since the distinction between primary (top discharge codes and physician release codes) and secondary (additional discharge codes) is done manually and is subjective, we also checked the prediction precision relative to the complete set of discharge codes, including both primary codes and secondary codes (the latter not appearing in the training set) to find that our top prediction was correct for 32% of the patients (both datasets) with 84% (89%) of patients with at least one correct hit within the top ten predictions (Figure 3 A). For example, we predicted diabetes mellitus for a patient who indeed had that condition; however it was not marked as the primary diagnosis. For comparison, we tested the precision against 1,000 sets of randomly shuffled associations between diagnoses and patients (maintaining the distribution of the ICDs and the number of diagnoses per patient), verifying that none of the shuffled associations obtained comparable precision (P < 0.001).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Influence of acanthamoeba genotype on clinical course and outcomes for patients with acanthamoeba keratitis in Spain [^dec3e414]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Genotype T4 is by far the most frequent genotype of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) and therefore has been considered the most virulent. This study included 14 cases of AK of genotype T4 and three cases of non-T4 genotype. We found that cases of non-T4 genotype had a worse response to medical therapy, greater need for surgical intervention, greater risk of extracorneal involvement, and remarkably poorer final visual outcome than those of T4 genotype, suggesting an association between Acanthamoeba virulence and genotype that requires additional case investigation.

Blood and tissue parasitic infections — amoebic meningoencephalitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis: Diagnosis relies on microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain tissue and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with PCR noted as faster than culture; specimens for culture should not be refrigerated, and Balamuthia mandrillaris requires specialized cell culture, while stained or unstained tissue slides can be sent to the CDC for identification and PCR/sequencing confirmation.

### An international external quality assessment scheme to assess the diagnostic performance of polymerase chain reaction detection of acanthamoeba keratitis [^03374534]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Early diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis is critical, as this leads to more favorable outcomes compared with late diagnosis. Therefore, an easily implemented, reliable, and sensitive diagnostic tool is needed, aspects in which NAAT are potentially superior to all other currently used diagnostic methods. However, the exact procedures that are used for NAAT-based detection of Acanthamoeba spp. differ substantially between laboratories. By participating in an EQAS, laboratories can compare results and identify methodologies that might affect their diagnostic performance.

Overall, we found a clear correlation between the number of Acanthamoeba cysts or trophozoites in the samples and the detection rate. In the samples containing 20 cysts or trophozoites, the detection rate was considerably lower than in the samples containing 200 cysts or trophozoites (Fig. 2). Although the exact numbers of Acanthamoeba cysts and/or trophozoites present in clinical samples are unknown, it is assumed that only a few amoebae are retrieved in cornea scrapings from patients, indicating the importance of successfully detecting low numbers of amoebae.

### The effect of drug pricing on outpatient payments and treatment for three soil-transmitted helminth infections in the United States, 2010–2017 [^bca6344c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection criteria were:

1 A primary diagnosis of a single infection with ascariasis, hookworm (ancylostomiasis or necatoriasis), or trichuriasis from February 1, 2010 through December 31, 2017. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes were used for data before September 30, 2015, and ICD-10-CM codes were used for patients after this date. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and ICD-10-CM codes for each parasitic disease are shown in. Patients for whom a diagnosis was labeled as "rule-out" (tested and confirmed not to have the condition) were excluded.
2 Insurance coverage by private insurance or Medicaid only. Medicare coverage (either partial or full) was excluded. Because Medicare payment data were not available, we excluded patients enrolled in employer-sponsored Medicare Supplemental plans and those 65 years or older at diagnosis (and thus likely to have access to Medicare).
3 Continuous enrollment in MarketScan CCAE or Medicaid from 30 days before the date of the first diagnosis to 90 days following the date. We chose this window with the assumption that it would likely capture visits associated with the infection. All payments associated with STH treatment in this window were included to estimate average payments per patient in the analyses.
4 Non-capitated insurance. Patients with capitated insurance plans were excluded because payments to healthcare providers are fixed in capitated plans and independent of the amount of care, or cost of any single visit.
5 A single infection with ascaris, or hookworm, or trichuris. We excluded patients diagnosed with more than one of these three parasites; we additionally excluded patients who were also diagnosed with schistosomiasis or strongyloidiasis. Coinfected patients might have had different and more complex clinical presentations; greater variability in the number of outpatient visits, clinician prescribing patterns, and outpatient expenditures; and higher billing due to multiple complaints and diagnoses. Less than 2% of patients were diagnosed with such coinfections.
6 Outpatient treatment only. Patients with inpatient visits were excluded because the pharmaceutical claims during inpatient visits were not available in MarketScan. Inpatient visits were uncommon (< 4%).

Classification of hospital-treated infectious diseases and the number of cases in the primary cohort

The number of cases of different infectious diseases add up to more than the total number of infection cases, because some participants were admitted to hospital for more than one infectious disease. *Too rare to be analysed separately.

In additional analyses, we further divided infections into CNS versus extra-CNS infections; infections predisposed towards entering the CNS versus not predisposed; and chronic versus acute infections. The appendix (pp 29–193) provides the ICD codes for these disease categories as well as the distribution of infections (pp 194–298).

### Successful treatment of disseminated acanthamoeba sp. infection with miltefosine [^7117f1aa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Disseminated Acanthamoeba infection is a rare disease characterized by widespread granulomatous infiltration of the skin and extracerebral organs; it usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. Most reported cases have progressed to granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). The incidence of GAE is low in spite of the ubiquity of these amoebae. Although < 200 cases of GAE have been described worldwide, it is still of substantial medical relevance because it is usually fatal due to diagnostic difficulties and lack of effective treatment.

In our patient, co-infection with M. tuberculosis with severe immunosuppression may have contributed to his susceptibility to Acanthamoeba infection but not to the disease progression and clinical deterioration seen even after TB could be controlled. Problems in culturing acanthamoebae from clinical specimens have been reported frequently, and isolation of amoebae from CSF is generally uncommon. In our case no reactivity to immunofluorescence was seen, either because the biopsy missed the area of active infection or because of the low sensitivity of polyclonal antibodies available. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of Acanthamoeba infection in our patient was achieved by molecular methods that proved to be more sensitive than microscopy and culture.

GAE and cutaneous Acanthamoeba infections have been empirically treated with a wide array of antimicrobial agents. The outcome has been mostly failure, except for a few cases that occurred in immunocompetent patients (,–). Few case studies reported successful treatment of patients with a solitary brain lesion or initiation of therapy before the infection entered the brain. The first successful treatment of AIDS-related GAE was reported in 2000.

The condition of our patient deteriorated under empirical treatment with antimicrobial agents previously used to treat Acanthamoeba infection. When anti-amoebic therapy was changed to peroral and topical miltefosine, the skin lesions healed and the brain lesions regressed. After the remaining brain lesion had been surgically excised, the patient could be discharged from the hospital. Two years after treatment ended, the patient is partly rehabilitated with no signs of amoebic or mycobacterial infection.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### The brief case: meningoencephalitis in a transplant recipient [^2c6a6ae1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Comparison of free-living amebic CNS infections

Prior to brain tissue biopsy, CSF studies can narrow the differential diagnosis. In contrast to its utility in the identification of Naegleria, wet mount examination of CSF for Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia is generally negative, underscoring the need for other diagnostic methods for these infections. Real-time polymerase change reaction (RT-PCR) targeting 18S rRNA gene sequences, for the detection of Naegleria, Acanthamoeba, and Balamuthia infections, is available in a limited number of reference laboratories in the United States. In this report, we emphasize that even state-of-the-art testing of CSF with RT-PCR can be negative for Acanthamoeba and, thus, cannot rule out Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis. This is consistent with other literature reports that Acanthamoeba is rarely detected by PCR of CSF. Perhaps Acanthamoeba is transiently present in the CSF, or there is a low burden of organisms in the CSF by the time patients present clinically with brain abscesses. There are case reports demonstrating that Naegleria and interestingly Balamuthia can be detected in CSF using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and more data are needed to understand the performance of cfDNA testing of CSF or plasma for the detection of free-living amebae. A brain tissue sample was required in our case to detect Acanthamoeba by RT-PCR, highlighting the importance of tissue biopsy for patients with immunocompromising conditions.

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^204c5163]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.

### Coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits, Texas, USA, 2016–2021 [^e521ca2d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 3,276 hospital visits representing all inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient surgical and radiologic procedures, and ambulatory surgery center visits for coccidioidomycosis among Texas residents, the percentages of visits were highest among patients who were 46–64 years of age (40.8%), male (56.3%), and Hispanic (47.5%) (Table 2). In 2021, a total of 709 coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits occurred in Texas (Table 2). Although the 96-county Valley fever region in Texas only accounts for ≈24.0% of the state's population, those counties had 63.4% of coccidioidomycosis-related hospital visits (Table 2). Inpatient hospital encounters constituted the largest (56.7%) percentage of coccidioidomycosis-related visits (Table 3). The percentage of hospital visits where coccidioidomycosis was the principal diagnosis was only 33.5% (Table 3). When stratified by visit type, only 19.8% of hospital visits that coded as inpatient resulted in a principal coccidioidomycosis diagnosis compared with 51.6% of hospital visits coded as outpatient (Table 3). For inpatient hospital visits where coccidioidomycosis was not the principal diagnosis, many of the diagnosis codes were related to symptoms of severe coccidioidomycosis infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. When assessing the principal diagnosis codes for outpatient hospital visits where coccidioidomycosis was not the primary diagnosis, most were related to abnormal diagnostic findings in the lungs or to mild symptoms, such as cough, throat pain, headaches, and abnormal breathing.

### Clinical characteristics of acanthamoeba keratitis infections in 28 states, 2008 to 2011 [^0108b3e0]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim was to describe a geographically and clinically diverse sample of cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) and establish the risk factors for poor outcomes among patients with this disease.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, population-based case series of 116 patients with AK identified through a national surveillance network. Data were collected via a medical record review by diagnosing ophthalmologists and by phone interviews with patients. Exact logistic regression modeling was used to determine risk factors for poor visual outcomes.

Results

Among patients with data available on contact lens use, it was found that 93.3% wore contact lenses. The median time from symptom onset to care seeking was 2 days, whereas the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 27 days. Keratoplasty was performed in 27 of 81 patients with available outcome data and was more likely in patients > 40 years old [odds ratio (OR) 5.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49–21.92]. When adjusted for age, the risk factors for keratoplasty included the presence of a ring infiltrate (OR 40.00, 95% CI 3.58–447.0) or any sign of stromal invasion (OR 10.48, 95% CI 2.56–55.09). One-third of patients with available data on best-corrected visual acuity had a best-corrected visual acuity < 20/200, with the presence of a ring infiltrate as the only significant predictor of this outcome when adjusted for age (aOR 3.45, 95% CI 1.01–12.31).

Conclusions

AK remains challenging to diagnose. Consequently, patients with advanced disease are more likely to have poor outcomes, particularly if they are older. The increasing awareness of AK among general eye care providers may shorten referral times and potentially improve outcomes.

### Coding and documentation: Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups and present-on-admission documentation [^1e0e0225]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Effective October 1, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has changed its methodology for determining the diagnosis-related group for hospitalized patients. In an effort to more accurately reflect severity of illness, the 538 diagnosis-related groups have been converted to 745 new Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups. In addition, selected hospital-acquired complications not identified as present on admission will no longer be reimbursed. The changes will have profound effects on reimbursement for hospitalizations. To minimize financial losses under the new rules, hospitals and physicians will have to devote significant resources and attention to improved documentation. This article will discuss the new payment system, the physician's role in ensuring that all clinically important diagnoses are captured by coding specialists, and strategies that can be employed to respond proactively to the challenge.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics," crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one," and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

To characterize the frequency of neurocysticercosis, associated diagnostic codes, and place of infection, we searched Oregon's All Payer All-Claims dataset for 2010–2013. Twice as many cases were found by searching inpatient and outpatient data than by inpatient data alone. Studies relying exclusively on inpatient data underestimate frequency and miss less severe disease.

### Trends in admissions and outcomes of hospitalizations related toinfection: a nationwide analysis from 2005–2020 [^b1629711]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study population

The study included all hospitalizations of US adults aged 18 years and older, with primary (principal) or secondary diagnoses of CDI, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2020. CDI was defined using ICM-9-CM codes (008.45) from January 1, 2005, to September 30, 2015, and the corresponding ICD-10-CM codes (A047, A0471, A0472) starting October 1, 2015. Only those patients whose records had complete data on key variables, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, mortality status and length of hospital stay, were included.

After patients who lacked data on age, mortality and sex had been excluded, the study population was further stratified into patients with a principal or a secondary diagnosis of CDI. We also excluded patients with elective hospitalizations unrelated to CDI, as defined by specific admission codes.

Principal or primary diagnosis includes patients whose primary reason for hospitalization was CDI, denoted by ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM codes in the first position. Secondary CDI diagnosis included patients hospitalized for conditions other than CDI, denoted by ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM codes in any position other than the first. We further extracted demographics such as age, sex (male and female), race/ethnicity (Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asian or Pacific islanders, Native Americans and others), and patient-level characteristics. The expected primary payment sources were Medicare, Medicaid, private and self-pay. Comorbidity at discharge was estimated using Elixhauser Comorbidity Software, and an index score was derived. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Software is a widely used tool designed to identify and quantify comorbid conditions based on administrative healthcare data. It includes a comprehensive set of 31 comorbidity indicators derived from diagnostic codes in hospital discharge records. These indicators account for a wide range of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal failure and chronic pulmonary diseases. In the context of our study, adverse events related to CDI include clinical complications such as sepsis, septic shock, perforated intestine, megacolon, acute renal failure, prolonged ileus, and the need for surgical interventions such as colectomy. These events were identified using specific ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic and procedure codes from hospital discharge records. Additionally, inflammatory bowel disease was identified independently with diagnostic codes and included in the analysis. Comparative analyses were conducted between the 2 cohorts, primary or secondary CDI diagnosis.

To determine the accuracy in coding for principal injury diagnosis (PDx), external cause, place of occurrence, and activity codes under the Australian Modification of the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10-AM) for public hospital discharges in New Zealand.

A simple random sample of 1800 injury discharges was selected from the National Minimum Dataset (NMDS) of hospital discharges from July 2001 to June 2004. Records were obtained and coded by the Senior Advisor in Clinical Coding (SACC) independently of the codes already recorded in the NMDS.

Results

Of injury discharges selected from the NMDS, 2% were not coded with a PDx of injury by the SACC. Fourteen percent of the PDxs and 26% of the external cause codes (E-codes V01-Y89) had inaccuracies in the first, second, or third characters. Variation in the accuracy of the PDxs and E-codes was obvious by diagnostic and E-code groupings; 22% of the place of occurrence codes (Y92) and 29% of the activity codes (Y93) were incorrect. Accuracy of the PDxs and E-codes was related to the clarity of the documentation in the medical records.

Conclusions

For countries that are considering implementing ICD-10 or one of its variants, these findings provide insight into possible limitations of the classification and offer guidance on where the focus of training should be placed. For countries that have historical data coded according to ICD-10-AM, these results suggest that some specific estimates of injury and external-cause incidence may need to be treated with caution.

### Evaluating healthcare claims for neurocysticercosis by using all-payer all-claims data, Oregon, 2010–2013 [^9102c45e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

To characterize the frequency of neurocysticercosis, associated diagnostic codes, and place of infection, we searched Oregon's All Payer All-Claims dataset for 2010–2013. Twice as many cases were found by searching inpatient and outpatient data than by inpatient data alone. Studies relying exclusively on inpatient data underestimate frequency and miss less severe disease.

### Successful treatment of primary acanthamoeba cutis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia on acalabrutinib [^0dd1bb78]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Primary cutaneous amoebiasis is rare, and typically affects immunocompromised patients and presents with unique clinical and histopathologic changes. Untreated, the infection could progress to involve the central nervous system, which is almost universally fatal. We present a case of primary cutaneous acanthamoebiasis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia on acalabrutinib. Timely diagnosis and treatment resulted in complete resolution of lesions and a disease-free status at the 14-month follow-up. A 76-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of multiple, nonhealing, ulcerated, erythematous, painful, crusted nodules on his trunk, and upper and lower extremities. Two punch biopsies showed mixed inflammatory infiltrate with a histiocytic reaction and microabscesses extending into the deep dermis. Rare, unusual structures with cytoplasmic vacuolations and round nuclei were seen on repeated biopsies. Gomori methenamine silver delineated wrinkled double-walled cytoplasm of rare parasites, concerning for amoebic infection. Molecular workup (polymerase chain reaction) came back positive for Acanthamoeba castellanii. Initial treatment involved flucytosine and fluconazole, followed by fluconazole and miltefosine, but both were discontinued because of nausea and replaced with single-agent voriconazole. Acanthamoeba cutis poses unique diagnostic challenges in a setting of novel agents for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and may be underrecognized. With the expanding population of immunocompromised patients, rare cutaneous infections should enter the differential early on along with early consideration of molecular ancillary testing. The long-term immunomodulating properties of acalabrutinib remain to be elucidated.

### A multicenter evaluation of computable phenotyping approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalizations [^c19f24dd]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis codes are used to study SARS-CoV2 infections and COVID-19 hospitalizations in administrative and electronic health record (EHR) data. Using EHR data (April 2020-March 2021) at the Yale-New Haven Health System and the three hospital systems of the Mayo Clinic, computable phenotype definitions based on ICD-10 diagnosis of COVID-19 (U07.1) were evaluated against positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen tests. We included 69,423 patients at Yale and 75,748 at Mayo Clinic with either a diagnosis code or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. The precision and recall of a COVID-19 diagnosis for a positive test were 68.8% and 83.3%, respectively, at Yale, with higher precision (95%) and lower recall (63.5%) at Mayo Clinic, varying between 59.2% in Rochester to 97.3% in Arizona. For hospitalizations with a principal COVID-19 diagnosis, 94.8% at Yale and 80.5% at Mayo Clinic had an associated positive laboratory test, with secondary diagnosis of COVID-19 identifying additional patients. These patients had a twofold higher inhospital mortality than based on principal diagnosis. Standardization of coding practices is needed before the use of diagnosis codes in clinical research and epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5e2175ee]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Clinical Review

We used clinical review to explore potential reasons for large changes at the time of transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM for diabetes-, cardiac-, and pregnancy-related conditions in the examined classification systems. For each HHS-HCC and AHRQ-CCS condition category with a statistically significant change of 20% or more in prevalence level or trend that was selected for clinical review, we examined frequencies of individual ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses before and after the ICD-10-CM transition. We also reviewed guidance documents for hospital coding staff regarding changes in coding practices related to the ICD-10-CM transition for these diagnostic categories.

### Association of diagnostic coding with trends in hospitalizations and mortality of patients with pneumonia, 2003–2009 [^59b168eb]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Recent reports suggest that the mortality rate of patients hospitalized with pneumonia has steadily declined. While this may be the result of advances in clinical care or improvements in quality, it may also represent an artifact of changes in diagnostic coding.

Objective

To compare estimates of trends in hospitalizations and inpatient mortality among patients with pneumonia using 2 approaches to case definition: one limited to patients with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia, and another that includes patients with a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia if the principal diagnosis is sepsis or respiratory failure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Trends study using data from the 2003–2009 releases of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in the annual hospitalization rate and change in inpatient mortality over time.

Results

From 2003 to 2009, the annual hospitalization rate for patients with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia declined 27.4%, from 5.5 to 4.0 per 1000, while the age- and sex-adjusted mortality decreased from 5.8% to 4.2% (absolute risk reduction [ARR], 1.6%; 95% CI, 1.4%-1.9%; relative risk reduction [RRR], 28.2%; 95% CI, 25.2%-31.2%). Over the same period, hospitalization rates of patients with a principal diagnosis of sepsis and a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia increased 177.6% from 0.4 to 1.1 per 1000, while inpatient mortality decreased from 25.1% to 22.2% (ARR, 3.0%; 95% CI, 1.6%-4.4%; RRR, 12%; 95% CI, 7.5%-16.1%); hospitalization rates for patients with a principal diagnosis of respiratory failure and a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia increased 9.3% from 0.44 to 0.48 per 1000 and mortality declined from 25.1% to 19.2% (ARR, 6.0%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.3%; RRR, 23.7%; 95% CI, 19.7%-27.8%). However, when the 3 groups were combined, the hospitalization rate declined only 12.5%, from 6.3 to 5.6 per 1000, while the age- and sex-adjusted inpatient mortality rate increased from 8.3% to 8.8% (AR increase, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.9%; RR increase, 6.0%; 95% CI, 3.3%-8.8%). Over this same time frame, the age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted mortality rate declined from 8.3% to 7.8% (ARR, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%; RRR, 6.3%; 95% CI, 3.8%-8.8%).

Conclusions

From 2003 to 2009, hospitalization and inpatient mortality rates for patients with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia decreased substantially, whereas hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of sepsis or respiratory failure accompanied by a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia increased and mortality declined. However, when the 3 pneumonia diagnoses were combined, the decline in the hospitalization rate was attenuated and inpatient mortality was little changed, suggesting an association of these results with temporal trends in diagnostic coding.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^e0159918]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Medical interventions for acanthamoeba keratitis [^77abe342]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acanthamoeba are microscopic, free-living, single-celled organisms which can infect the eye and lead to Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK). AK can result in loss of vision in the infected eye or loss of eye itself; however, there are no formal guidelines or standards of care for the treatment of AK.

Objectives

To evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety of medical therapy for the treatment of AK.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2015), PubMed (1948 to January 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to January 2015), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 9 January 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medical therapy for AK, regardless of the participants' age, sex, or etiology of disease. We included studies that compared either anti-amoeba therapy (drugs used alone or in combination with other medical therapies) with no anti-amoeba therapy or one anti-amoeba therapy with another anti-amoeba therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results and full-text reports, assessed risk of bias, and abstracted data. We used standard methodological procedures as set forth by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included one RCT (56 eyes of 55 participants) in this review. The study compared two types of topical biguanides for the treatment of AK: chlorhexidine 0.02% and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.02%. All participants were contact lens wearers with a median age of 31 years. Treatment duration ranged from 51 to 145 days. The study, conducted in the UK, was well-designed and had low risk of bias overall. Outcome data were available for 51 (91%) of 56 eyes. Follow-up times for outcome measurements in the study were not reported. Resolution of infection, defined as control of ocular inflammation, relief of pain and photosensitivity, and recovery of vision, was 86% in the chlorhexidine group compared with 78% in the PHMB group (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.84 to 1.42). In the chlorhexidine group, 20 of 28 eyes (71%) had better visual acuity compared with 13 of 23 eyes (57%) in the PHMB group at final follow-up (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.94). Five participants required therapeutic keratoplasty: 2 in the chlorhexidine group compared with 3 in the PHMB group (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.00). No serious adverse event related to drug toxicity was observed in the study.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety of medical therapy for the treatment of AK. Results from the one included study yielded no difference with respect to outcomes reported between chlorhexidine and PHMB. However, the sample size was inadequate to detect clinically meaningful differences between the two groups as indicated by the wide confidence intervals of effect estimates.

### Diagnosis documentation done right: cross-specialty standard for the diagnosis section in German discharge summaries – A mixed-methods study [^45fdb073]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis section in hospital discharge summaries is critical for continuity of care and patient safety, yet it varies widely in quality, format, and content due to a lack of standards.

Objective

This study aims to develop a cross-specialty standard for the structure and content of the diagnosis section, based on the preferences of German physicians. The study examines physicians﻿' satisfaction with the diagnosis section, their rating of its importance, and their preferences for its specific elements, comparing perspectives between inpatient and outpatient physicians.

Design, Participants, Approach

This mixed-methods study integrated a scoping review, focus group discussion, and a nationwide survey of 602 physicians (317 outpatient primary care and 285 inpatient physicians; 4.1% response rate), most trained in internal medicine. Quantitative analyses evaluated physician satisfaction and preferences, while qualitative feedback provided deeper insights regarding preferred content and format.

Key Results

Although 95.7% of physicians considered the diagnosis section crucial for follow-up care, only 36.9% were satisfied with its current content and format. 91.2% supported standardizing the diagnosis section, identifying 18 content elements to be included for every current treatment diagnosis. Strong consensus (> 95.0% agreement) was reached for "name of the diagnosis", "severity/stage/classification/TNM", "localization/extent/pattern of involvement", "course e.g., acute, chronic, recurrent", "expression", "complications", "date of initial diagnosis", and "etiology/cause". 86.4% preferred separating current and chronic/prior diagnoses with headings. Outpatient physicians were more likely than inpatient physicians to rate "ICD-10 codes" as mandatory (46.2% vs. 14.8%, p < 0.001) and to consider "recommendations for further procedures" (76.6% vs. 63.6%, p < 0.001) and "follow-up appointments" (77.3% vs. 63.5%, p < 0.001) as necessary. Additionally, a list of practical recommendations for clinicians to better document diagnoses was derived.

Conclusions

This study proposes a cross-specialty standard for the diagnosis section based on physician preferences for a clearly structured format and 18 key content elements.

### Hospitalization frequency and charges for neurocysticercosis, United States, 2003–2012 [^1efe452f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Results

During 2003–2012, an estimated 23,266 hospitalizations (95% CI 21,741–24,792) in the United States were assigned an ICD-9-CM code of 123.1 in any of the first 15 diagnostic fields. Of these hospitalizations, 18,584 (95% CI 17,322–19,846), approximately 80% of the total, met our case definition of hospitalization due to neurocysticercosis. The number of hospitalizations due to neurocysticercosis per year ranged from a high of 2,247 in 2006 to a low of 1,495 in 2012. The largest proportion of hospitalizations due to neurocysticercosis occurred in the western region (n = 8,026, 42.9% [95% CI 39.2%–46.7%)], followed by the southern region (n = 5,860, 31.8% [95% CI 28.6%–35.1%]), the northeastern region (n = 2,902, 15.5% 95% CI [13.5%–17.6%]) and the midwestern region (n = 1,796, 9.8% [95% CI 8.2%–11.7%]).

We found distinct differences in the mean annual incidence rates of hospitalization stratified by age, sex, and race (Table 2). The mean annual incidence of hospitalization was highest in 20- to 44-year-old age group (1.04 hospitalizations/100,000 population). Hospitalization rates were 33% higher among male patients than female patients. The age- and sex-adjusted mean annual incidence of hospitalizations was highest among Hispanics (2.50 hospitalizations/100,000 population); the rate was 35 times higher than that for non-Hispanic whites, 10 times higher than that for blacks, and 8 times higher than that for Asian/Pacific Islanders. Unadjusted rates by race were similar: Hispanic, 2.57/100,000; white, 0.06/100,000; black, 0.23/100,000; and Asian/Pacific Islander, 0.26/ 100,000.
