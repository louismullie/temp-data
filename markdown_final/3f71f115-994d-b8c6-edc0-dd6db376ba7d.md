## Question

Red itchy papular rash

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a red, itchy, papular rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical features and how to frame the differential. Then, I should verify the highest-yield history elements that narrow the etiologies. Next, I will examine the physical findings with a focus on distribution, morphology, and specific signs. After that, I need to prioritize the differential by pretest probability and red flags. Then, I will outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when to biopsy. Finally, I will construct a management plan tailored to likely diagnoses and specify follow-up and safety netting, making sure I double-check each assertion against guidelines and key reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a red, itchy, papular eruption implies erythematous, elevated lesions with pruritus, which already shifts the differential toward pruritic papular dermatoses rather than purely vascular or petechial processes, and I should keep in mind that papules can be primary lesions or secondary to scratching and excoriation, which can obscure the original morphology, so I need to check carefully for primary features and distribution patterns [^57b64ad2].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-yield history elements before jumping to conclusions: onset and tempo, distribution and evolution, exposure risks, contact history, travel, pets, medications, immunocompromise, and systemic symptoms are foundational. I should also ask about nocturnal pruritus, household clustering, and whether close contacts are similarly affected, because these strongly steer toward ectoparasites or infectious etiologies, and I should confirm medication timing relative to rash onset to assess drug causality [^57b64ad2] [^1437fcba].

> I will now examine the physical findings with a structured approach: I need to check for burrows in web spaces and wrists, papules on the genitalia, and excoriations for scabies. Look for linear papules in clusters suggesting bedbugs. Assess for folliculitis or impetiginization. And note whether lesions spare the folds, which can hint at entities like papuloerythroderma of Ofuji, while also documenting size, shape, color, scale, and whether lesions are discrete versus coalescent, because these morphologic clues materially change the pretest probabilities [^4399567c] [^1437fcba] [^5cddf13d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should prioritize the differential by likelihood and severity. Common causes include scabies, insect bite reactions including bedbugs and fleas, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and drug eruptions, while I must also consider HIV-associated pruritic papular eruption, secondary syphilis, and less common entities like papuloerythroderma of Ofuji or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma when the course is chronic or atypical, and I should double-check for red flags such as fever, mucosal involvement, bullae, or systemic illness that would escalate urgency [^1437fcba] [^5a3c525c] [^d960e8ed] [^5cddf13d].

> Let me think about scabies first because it is a leading cause of a pruritic papular rash with nocturnal worsening and household spread. I should confirm the presence of burrows, papules on the genitalia, and excoriations, and remember that burrows are pathognomonic but often missed, so I need to inspect carefully and consider a burrow ink test if needed, while also remembering that treatment failure can reflect reinfestation, faulty application, or resistance, which means I should treat all close contacts and launder bedding and clothing properly [^c963d8bc] [^1437fcba] [^37280ee3].

> Next, I should review insect bite reactions, especially bedbugs and fleas, which present with pruritic erythematous papules often in linear or clustered distributions on exposed areas and may show a central punctum. I need to ask about new bedding, travel, or communal living, and I should counsel on environmental control because eradication is essential to prevent recurrence, while treating pruritus and secondary infection if present [^1437fcba] [^a4cb7e77].

> I will now examine atopic dermatitis, which typically shows chronic, relapsing pruritic papules and plaques with lichenification in flexural areas and a personal or family history of atopy. I should confirm the distribution and look for xerosis and excoriations, and I need to ensure I tailor therapy to severity using emollients and topical anti-inflammatory agents while avoiding triggers and addressing sleep disturbance from pruritus [^66f34364] [^bfbdff02].

> But wait, what if this is a drug eruption? I should confirm medication timing, especially new drugs in the prior 2–8 weeks, and characterize the morphology as morbilliform, papulopustular, or urticarial, because papulopustular acneiform eruptions are classic with EGFR inhibitors and require supportive care and sometimes dose modification, whereas morbilliform eruptions may warrant continuation with symptomatic therapy if mild and no mucosal involvement is present [^8c650e9b] [^8ff89d92].

> I should double-check for HIV-associated pruritic papular eruption in patients with risk factors or known HIV, which presents with chronic, symmetric, pruritic papules on the trunk and extremities and may persist despite antiretroviral therapy. Biopsy can help distinguish PPE from eosinophilic folliculitis or prurigo nodularis, and management includes optimizing ART, topical corticosteroids, and antipruritic strategies [^5a3c525c] [^01aaac2b] [^324e844b].

> Let me consider secondary syphilis when the rash is generalized, papulosquamous, and involves the palms, soles, and mucosa, or when there is a history of a prior chancre. I should confirm with serology and remember that the morphology is variable, so a high index of suspicion is warranted in the right epidemiologic context [^d960e8ed].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook papuloerythroderma of Ofuji in chronic, intensely pruritic, erythroderma-like papules that spare the folds, often with eosinophilia and lymphadenopathy. If suspected, I should confirm with biopsy and consider systemic therapies given the chronicity and morbidity of this entity [^5cddf13d].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup in stages. Initially, I will rely on history and physical examination to classify morphology and distribution, then, if the diagnosis remains uncertain or the course is atypical, I will add targeted tests such as KOH prep for tinea, HIV testing when risk factors exist, RPR for syphilis if suspected, and I will reserve skin biopsy for refractory, chronic, or morphologically atypical cases to exclude inflammatory dermatoses, drug reactions, or lymphoproliferative disease, making sure I choose a representative, nonexcoriated lesion for sampling [^57b64ad2] [^fa3394d3].

> Hold on, I should verify management principles by likely diagnosis. For scabies, permethrin 5% cream applied from neck to toes with repeat in 7–14 days and simultaneous treatment of close contacts is first-line, with ivermectin as an alternative or for crusted disease, and I must emphasize laundering and decontamination to prevent reinfestation. For insect bites, environmental eradication plus topical corticosteroids and antipruritics are key. For atopic dermatitis, I should escalate from gentle skin care and low-potency topical corticosteroids to medium-potency agents and calcineurin inhibitors for sensitive areas, and consider systemic options for severe disease. For drug eruptions, remove the culprit when feasible and provide supportive care with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, adjusting the offending agent if indicated. For HIV-associated PPE, optimize ART and use topical and systemic antipruritic strategies. And for suspected secondary syphilis, treat with benzathine penicillin per guidelines [^1437fcba] [^37280ee3] [^66f34364] [^8c650e9b] [^324e844b].

> I should double-check follow-up and safety netting. Pruritus from scabies may persist for up to two weeks after treatment, so I need to set expectations and arrange retreatment if symptoms persist beyond two weeks or if live mites are seen, and I should advise that all household members be treated simultaneously to avoid reinfestation. For any rash with systemic symptoms, mucosal involvement, bullae, or rapid progression, I should expedite evaluation and consider urgent dermatology input or emergency care to exclude serious cutaneous adverse reactions or life-threatening infections [^37280ee3] [^1437fcba] [^7565e82b].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, morphology-driven approach anchored in history and distribution, prioritize common and treatable causes like scabies and insect bites, and escalate to targeted testing and biopsy when the course is atypical or refractory, because this strategy minimizes delays, reduces morbidity, and aligns with best-practice guidance for pruritic papular eruptions [^57b64ad2] [^1437fcba].

A red, itchy papular rash has a broad differential, but the most common causes are **scabies** [^1437fcba], **insect bites** [^a4cb7e77], and **atopic dermatitis** [^66f34364]. Key distinguishing features include: scabies presents with nocturnal pruritus, burrows, and papules in web spaces, wrists, axillae, and genitalia [^c963d8bc]; insect bites show clustered papules on exposed skin with a history of exposure [^a4cb7e77]; atopic dermatitis features chronic, relapsing pruritus with flexural involvement and a personal/family history of atopy [^66f34364]. Other causes to consider include contact dermatitis, drug eruptions, viral exanthems, and HIV-associated pruritic papular eruption [^5a3c525c]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by history and exam; consider KOH prep, biopsy, or labs if uncertain or atypical. Management is cause-specific: permethrin or ivermectin for scabies [^1437fcba], topical corticosteroids and antihistamines for dermatitis, and removal of the allergen or offending drug when relevant [^8c650e9b].

## Diagnostic approach

- **History**: Onset, duration, distribution, exposure risks, travel, medications, atopy, household spread, nocturnal itch [^57b64ad2].
- **Physical examination**: Morphology, distribution, burrows, excoriations, secondary infection [^c963d8bc].
- **Tests**: KOH prep for tinea, scabies scraping, biopsy if uncertain or atypical, HIV testing if risk factors [^5a3c525c].

---

## Management strategies

- **Scabies**: Permethrin 5% cream or ivermectin; treat contacts; launder bedding [^1437fcba] [^37280ee3].
- **Insect bites**: Topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, environmental control [^notfound].
- **Atopic dermatitis**: Emollients, topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, trigger avoidance [^73080f43].
- **Contact dermatitis**: Identify and avoid allergen, topical corticosteroids [^notfound].
- **Drug eruption**: Stop offending drug, supportive care [^notfound].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention

- **Fever, mucosal involvement, bullae, or systemic symptoms**: Suggest serious drug reaction or viral illness [^8ff89d92].
- **Rapid progression or severe pain**: Consider necrotizing infection or vasculitis [^notfound].
- **Immunocompromised status**: Higher risk for severe or atypical presentations [^notfound].

---

A red, itchy papular rash most often reflects scabies, insect bites, or atopic dermatitis, but the differential is broad; **careful history and exam** guide diagnosis, and management should be tailored to the cause while watching for red flags that warrant urgent care [^1437fcba].

### Pruritic papular eruption in HIV [^5a3c525c]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

Pruritic papular eruption (PPE) is characterized chronic pruritus and symmetric papular eruptions on the trunk and extremities with the absence of other definable causes of itching in an HIV-infected patient. PPE seems to be much more prevalent in less developed regions of the world. The etiology of this distressing condition is unclear, although an inappropriate response to an exogenous agent, such as arthropod bites, may underlie the pathogenesis. Identifying PPE's association with the immune dysregulation of HIV and distinguishing this condition from other pruritic disorders found in HIV-infected patients is important for optimal management.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^7565e82b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^57b64ad2]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^36efc081]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Erythematous papular rash with sparing of folds [^5cddf13d]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What type of rash is manifested by this patient?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD)
B. Papuloerythroderma of Ofuji (PEO)
C. Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP)
D. Drug eruption
E. Psoriasis
A. ACD – Incorrect. Although contact dermatitis can spare skin folds, it is unlikely in a patient with no history of atopy. Furthermore, chronic ACD will have more scale and lichenification.
B. PEO – Correct. First described by Ofuji in 1984, PEO is characterized by a pruritic, diffuse erythroderma-like eruption formed by coalescence of flat-topped, red-to-brown papules with a cobblestone-like appearance. The eruption typically spares skin folds and creases, the "deck chair" sign. Other features of PEO seen in patients includes axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and or nail bed infarction.
C. PRP – Incorrect. Although patients with PRP have follicular hyperaccentuation, such as our patient, the rash typically has a predominant scale and distinct orange-red color. The rash will also classically contain islands of sparing but will not spare the skin folds.
D. Drug eruption – Incorrect. Although drug eruptions have nonspecific rashes, they typically progress and resolve quickly. Our patient had a chronic rash and no history of new or changing medications.
E. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Although psoriasis is the most common underlying cause of erythroderma, it rarely spares the skin folds. Additionally, patients typically have a history of psoriasis, facial sparing, and nail changes, such as oil-drop spots and nail pits.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^5337b982]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 4-week history of an itchy, painful, pink-red progressively worsening rash on her chest and neck (Fig 1). Her history included remote breast cancer and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with known axillary nodal involvement. At presentation, she was undergoing treatment of her metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed for the last 6 months, and had undergone radiation to axillary lymph node metastases in previous months. Physical examination found thin pink-red plaques around her neck and chest. She denied fever or chills. She was prescribed a 2-week prednisone taper and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment with 1-month follow-up arranged where she demonstrated no response to treatment.

Question 1: What is the best next step in caring for this patient?
A. Perform biopsy of lesion.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin.

Answers:
A. Perform biopsy of lesion – Correct. In this patient with history of malignancies, biopsy should be done of the lesion to rule out metastasis of internal malignancy.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily – Incorrect. This patient had attempted oral and topical steroids with no relief of symptoms/rash. At this point, another round of steroids would be inappropriate.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction – Incorrect. This would be appropriate if herpes zoster was suspected. This patient's rash does not consist of papules or vesicles expected of herpes zoster and does not follow a dermatomal distribution.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve – Incorrect. This patient's rash has persisted for greater than 4 weeks. Her history of malignancy is concerning, and as such reassurance would be inappropriate at this time.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin – Incorrect. This would be the correct option if erysipelas or severe cellulitis was suspected. We would expect this patient to display acute-onset systemic symptoms such as fever; her rash developed slowly over 4 weeks and not as acutely as one would expect with erysipelas.

### Factors associated with pruritic papular eruption of human immunodeficiency virus infection in the antiretroviral therapy era [^01aaac2b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pruritic papular eruption (PPE) of HIV is common in HIV-infected populations living in the tropics. Its aetiology has been attributed to insect bite reactions and it is reported to improve with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Its presence after at least 6 months of ART has been proposed as one of several markers of treatment failure.

Objectives

To determine factors associated with PPE in HIV-infected persons receiving ART.

Methods

A case-control study nested within a 500-person cohort from a teaching hospital in Mbarara, Uganda. Forty-five cases and 90 controls were enrolled. Cases had received ART for ≥ 15 months and had an itchy papular rash for at least 1 month with microscopic correlation by skin biopsy. Each case was individually matched with two controls for age, sex and ART duration.

Results

Twenty-five of 45 cases (56%) had microscopic findings consistent with PPE. At skin examination and biopsy (study enrolment), a similar proportion of PPE cases and matched controls had plasma HIV RNA < 400 copies mL(-1) (96% vs. 85%, P = 0.31). The odds of having PPE increased fourfold with every log increase in viral load at ART initiation (P = 0.02) but not at study enrolment. CD4 counts at ART initiation and study enrolment, and CD4 gains and CD8(+) T-cell activation measured 6 and 12 months after ART commencement were not associated with PPE. Study participants who reported daily insect bites had greater odds of being cases [odds ratio (OR) 8.3, P < 0.001] or PPE cases (OR 8.6, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Pruritic papular eruption in HIV-infected persons receiving ART for ≥ 15 months was associated with greater HIV viraemia at ART commencement, independent of CD4 count. Skin biopsies are important to distinguish between PPE and other itchy papular eruptions.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 9 refugees, immigrants, and migrants [^a4cb7e77]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Papular lesions — bites by insects and other arthropods are noted as the most common cause of papular lesions, with biting insects including bed bugs, fleas, head lice, midges, mosquitoes, and sand flies, and most bites are itchy due to hypersensitivity reactions to insect saliva proteins. Individual bites usually appear as small (4–10 mm diameter), edematous, pink to red papules with a gentle watch-glass profile, often with a small, subtle break in the epidermis at the entry of the arthropod's mouth parts; the pink to red color is generally limited to the elevated part of the lesion and is surrounded by a subtly pale hypovascular rim. Lesions are often pruritic and scratching puts the site at risk for secondary bacterial infections, usually with Staphylococcus spp. or Streptococcus spp., and bites from bed bugs and fleas often appear as clusters of discrete red papules on unclothed surfaces of the body.

### Pediculosis and scabies [^70e2cffb]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Pediculosis and scabies are caused by ectoparasites; patients usually present with itching. Head and pubic lice infestations are diagnosed by the visualization of insects or viable nits (eggs). Primary treatment is topically administered 1 percent permethrin. Malathion is one alternative for treatment failures. The importance of environmental measures to prevent infestation is a matter of controversy. Pubic lice are treated the same as head lice, but this finding should prompt evaluation for other sexually transmitted diseases. Body lice infestation should be suspected when symptoms of generalized itching occur in persons who do not change or wash their clothing or bedding regularly; lice may be found in the seams of their clothing. Topically administered permethrin may help to eradicate body lice, but personal hygiene measures are essential for successful treatment. Classic scabies in adults can be recognized by a pruritic, papular rash with excoriations; in infants, small children, and the immunocompromised, the rash may include vesicles, pustules, or nodules. Primary treatment for scabies is permethrin cream and environmental measures are important to prevent recurrent infestation. Generalized crusted scabies is best treated with oral ivermectin.

Rash during treatment — all antituberculosis drugs can cause a rash and management depends on severity; if the rash is mainly itchy without mucous membrane involvement or systemic signs such as fever, treat symptomatically with antihistamines and continue all antituberculosis medications; a petechial rash suggests rifamycin hypersensitivity with thrombocytopenia, and if the platelet count is low the rifamycin is permanently stopped and platelet counts closely monitored; drugs are also stopped for a generalized erythematous rash; hypersensitive reactions to multiple antituberculosis drugs have been noted, particularly in persons with HIV infection.

Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis, a human‐specific ectoparasite of approximately 0.4 mm in size that is invisible to the naked eye. 1, 2 Scabies is estimated to affect around 150–200 million people globally 3 with an estimated 455 million annual incident cases, 4 although the accuracy of these estimates is limited by a paucity of epidemiological data. 5 Scabies infestation exists in all countries, but with a higher burden in low‐income settings and tropical areas, and among infants, children and adolescents. 6 Outbreaks are common in institutions and enclosed communities in both high‐income and low‐income settings, particularly where crowding occurs. Outbreaks impose considerable health and economic burden, and are often difficult to control. 7, 8

Scabies causes a rash, which may cause stigma, as well as itch that can lead to sleep disruption, difficulty with concentration and absenteeism from education and employment. Scabies predisposes to superficial bacterial skin infection (due mainly to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes), 9 which in turn can lead to serious complications including severe skin and soft‐tissue infections, sepsis, glomerulonephritis and likely acute rheumatic fever. 10, 11 Although the immune response is incompletely understood, infestation does not confer complete immunity and protection on further exposure. 12 Therefore, recurrent episodes, especially in children, are common in areas of high transmission. 13, 14

The course of a scabies infestation begins when a fertilized female mite burrows into the skin of an uninfected individual. Following primary infestation, individuals are usually asymptomatic for the incubation period of 4–6 weeks. Symptoms develop much more rapidly (hours to days) with subsequent infestations. 15 Itch and skin lesions, most commonly small scattered papules, often with excoriation, develop as a result of hypersensitivity to mites and their products. 1 Burrows may be found in some, but not all, cases. This pattern of symptoms and signs is known as 'common scabies' (also described as classical, typical, ordinary, standard, usual or normal scabies). In the most obvious cases, scabies may be readily recognized based on clinical presentation. 16, 17 However, scabies can manifest with a wide spectrum of clinical signs and variable severities, making clinical diagnosis challenging.

### Case of lichen planus with unusual features [^ccc1b6da]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 25-year-old woman came with an itchy red rash on her back since 2years ago. This lesion then extended to the abdomen, arms and legs. From the patient's back, we found irregular linear hyperpigmented patches with some of the edges in the form of hyperpigmented plaques. On the abdomen, arms and legs, erythema-hyperpigmented plaque and patches were visible along the elevated edges with multiple scattered sizes. Lichen planus (LP) has several types based on various clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of LP can be made based on the clinical appearance and symptoms of pruritus. Many diseases can mimic other diseases so histopathology is used to make the diagnosis. Here, we report a case of LP with unusual features with diagnosis confirmed by histopathological examination. The patient was treated with oral and topical potent corticosteroids with good response.

### Papular-vesicular rash in COVID-19 [^09e3b5d5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The rash usually appears 3 days after the onset of systemic symptoms and disappears by 8 days. The characteristic features of this vesicular exanthem are mild/absent pruritus, frequent trunk involvement, small size, scattered distribution of lesions, and heals without scar. Two morphological patterns of this rash are 1) widespread polymorphic pattern — more common, consisting of small papules, vesicles, and pustules, and 2) localized pattern — less prevalent, consisting of monomorphic lesions over anterior or posterior trunk.

The histology shows dyskeratosis, ballooning multinucleated cells, and scanty necrotic keratinocytes with lymphocytic satellitosis. Dermal and vessel wall edema, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and red blood cells (RBCs) extravasation are the other findings seen.

Varicella-like exanthem is a COVID-19-specific rash whose identification is helpful in the clinical diagnosis.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^8ff9b340]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience and Other Spontaneous Adverse Reaction Reports

The following adverse reactions have been identified with VIJOICE use in patients with PROS in an expanded access program for compassionate use. Because these reactions are reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Decreased appetite.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Pruritus, rash (including rash maculo-papular, rash erythematous, rash papular, and rash pruritic), acne (including dermatitis acneiform).

### Erythematous papular rash with sparing of folds [^7d76a70f]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old Jamaican woman presented with several months of pruritus and a diffuse, erythematous scaly rash on the face, trunk, and extremities. At this time, there was no sparing of the folds. She was preemptively treated with triamcinolone 0.1% ointment and oral prednisone, 10 mg, for atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis with minimal improvement. Laboratory values were significant for lymphocytosis and absolute eosinophilia. Biopsy found an atypical lymphoid infiltrate in the papillary dermis and epidermis (Fig 1). Nine months after initial presentation, the rash transformed into perifollicular red-brown papules that spared body folds and double-coverage areas (Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4). No palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or nail changes were noted. Repeat biopsy findings were again significant for an atypical lymphoid infiltrate in the papillary dermis and epidermis. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 results were negative.

### Summertime and the patient is itchy [^99d7403d]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 36h history of a painful, itchy maculopapular rash and associated vesicles to his arms and neck. He had no history of exposure to new chemicals or hygiene products and no significant medical history. His physiological observations were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. On close inspection the rash was noted to be present only on areas of skin exposed while wearing a polo shirt. On further questioning it transpired that he had been gardening 12h prior to the development of the rash. A diagnosis of phytophotodermatitis was made. The patient was discharged with chlorphenamine, simple analgesia and the advice to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt and sunscreen when gardening in future. Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous reaction caused by contact with light-sensitising compounds found in plants and exposure to ultraviolet A radiation. It is self-limiting and can be managed symptomatically.

Papular skin eruptions in travelers present as numerous fine, slightly elevated, somewhat indistinct papules and include acute allergic contact dermatitis (perhaps due to plants) and photosensitive dermatitis (often associated with photosensitizing medications, e.g., doxycycline, sulfonamides). Onchocerciasis (specifically onchocercal dermatitis due to the inflammatory reaction to dying microfilaria in the skin) can occur in expatriates living in endemic areas in Sub-Saharan Africa and manifests as a generalized pruritic, finely papular dermatitis, a rare finding in travelers that occurs years after exposure. Swimmer's itch (cercarial dermatitis) and hookworm folliculitis are extremely itchy eruptions composed of papules on skin surfaces exposed to freshwater and fecally-contaminated soils, respectively.

Scabies — follow-up notes that the rash and pruritus might persist for < 2 weeks after treatment, whereas symptoms or signs persisting for > 2 weeks can be attributable to multiple factors. Retreatment 2 weeks after the initial treatment regimen can be considered for those who are still symptomatic or when live mites are observed, and use of an alternative regimen is recommended for those who do not respond initially to the recommended treatment.

### Fever and rash [^ee7d974c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

Papular lesions — bites by insects and other arthropods are described as 'probably the most common cause of papular lesions', with 'bed bugs, fleas, head lice, midges, mosquitoes, and sand flies' implicated; 'Individual bites usually appear as small (4–10 mm diameter), edematous, pink to red papules with a gentle "watch-glass" profile'. Lesions 'are often pruritic', and 'Scratching often excoriates or erodes the skin's surface, putting the site at risk for secondary bacterial infections, usually with Staphylococcus spp. or Streptococcus spp'. Patterns include that 'bites from bed bugs and fleas often appear as clusters of discrete red papules on unclothed surfaces of the body'.

### Pediculosis and scabies: treatment update [^85858496]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Pediculosis and scabies are caused by ectoparasites. Pruritus is the most common presenting symptom. Head and pubic lice infestations are diagnosed by visualization of live lice. Finding nits (louse egg shells) alone indicates a historical infestation. A "no nit" policy for schools and day care centers no longer is recommended because nits can persist after successful treatment with no risk of transmission. First-line pharmacologic treatment of pediculosis is permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo. Multiple novel treatments have shown limited evidence of effectiveness superior to permethrin. Wet combing is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment option. Finding pubic lice should prompt an evaluation for other sexually transmitted infections. Body lice infestation should be suspected when a patient with poor hygiene presents with pruritus. Washing affected clothing and bedding is essential if lice infestation is found, but no other environmental decontamination is necessary. Scabies in adults is recognized as a pruritic, papular rash with excoriations in a typical distribution pattern. In infants, children, and immunocompromised adults, the rash also can be vesicular, pustular, or nodular. First-line treatment of scabies is topical permethrin 5% cream. Clothing and bedding of persons with scabies should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer.

### Urticarial lesions: if not urticaria, what else? The differential diagnosis of urticaria: part I. cutaneous diseases [^3f993418]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Acute urticaria is self-limiting, and a cause can be identified in many patients. Chronic urticaria is a long lasting disease, and patients are commonly examined for an autoimmune origin and for associated diseases. Although the diagnosis of urticaria is straightforward in most patients, it may pose some difficulties at times and it may require a careful differential diagnosis with a number of conditions. Urticarial syndromes comprise both cutaneous and systemic disorders. Part I of this two-part series focuses on the clinical and histologic features that characterize common urticaria and on the cutaneous diseases that may manifest with urticarial lesions and must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Learning Objectives

After completing the learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish between the typical wheals of urticaria and urticarial lesions suggesting other diagnoses and to assess patients with urticarial lesions in order to exclude or confirm other cutaneous diseases.

### Diffuse pustules overlying brightly erythematous plaques in skin of color [^ecb0974f]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Miliaria pustulosa
B. Bacterial folliculitis
C. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)
D. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome
E. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms

Answers:
A. Miliaria pustulosa – Incorrect. Although miliaria pustulosa can present with pinpoint pustules overlying erythematous patches or plaques, miliaria pustulosa often favors flexural, intertriginous areas; in contrast, this patient presented with a much more diffuse eruption covering the neck, trunk, and extremities with no clear predilection for areas prone to occlusion and hyperhidrosis. Furthermore, the patient did not report intense pruritus or stinging characteristic of miliaria pustulosa.
B. Bacterial folliculitis – Incorrect. Bacterial folliculitis presents with isolated, follicular-based papules or pustules, which is inconsistent with the clustered, nonfollicular pustules observed in this patient. Furthermore, the negative wound culture decreases likelihood of a bacterial etiology.
C. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) – Correct. AGEP is a rare pustular severe cutaneous adverse reaction classically triggered by beta-lactam antibiotics, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which the patient had taken 3 days before eruption's onset. The timeline of the rash and fever, the eruption of small, nonfollicular pustules overlying erythematous plaques, the lack of mucosal involvement, the neutrophilia on laboratory, and the spongiosis with papillary edema on pathology are characteristic of AGEP.
D. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome – Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by targetoid lesions, bullae formation, full-thickness epidermal necrosis, and mucosal and ocular involvement, which were not seen in this patient.
E. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms – Incorrect. Pustules are rarely observed in DRESS. Although the patient had autoimmune hepatitis at baseline, she did not have new or worsening internal organ involvement as is commonly observed in DRESS. In terms of timeline, symptoms of DRESS typically develop 2 to 8 weeks after initiation of the offending drug, in contrast to the acute onset in this patient.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^14bd8e03]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Contact dermatitis (CD) — epidemiology and clinical presentation indicate that CD is common, with 5.7 million physician visits per year, and the acute clinical expression is characterized by redness, edema, papules, vesiculation, weeping, crusting, and pruritus. The severity ranges from a mild, short-lived condition to a severe, persistent, but rarely life-threatening, disease; thinner skin sites such as the eyelids, ear lobes, and genital areas are most vulnerable, whereas the thicker palms and soles are more resistant. Exposure time to allergenic contactants varies from being brief (eg, poison ivy) to protracted (eg, nickel in jewelry or work chemicals).

### Pigmented pruritic papules in a middle-age man [^5175c295]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 46-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of brown papules that had been steadily increasing in size and number. They periodically became swollen and intensely pruritic, especially with physical exercise. He experienced 2 anaphylactic events in the past, 1 following a bee sting and the other idiopathic, both requiring advanced life support measures. Review of systems elicited a history of indigestion, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Physical examination found innumerable reddish-brown macules and thin papules scattered over the trunk, arms, and upper thighs (Fig 1). Stroking of individual lesions elicited urtication within minutes (Figs 2 and 3).

### Thalidomide – A novel therapeutic approach for pruritic papular eruption of HIV [^324e844b]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Differential diagnoses to consider in patients with HIV and pruritus include PPE, prurigo nodularis, and eosinophilic folliculitis. In our case, there was no perifollicular inflammation on histology, which would be expected with eosinophilic folliculitis. In contrast to prurigo nodularis, the rash was papular rather than nodular, and the histology lacked typical features of compact orthohyperkeratosis, acanthosis, hypergranulosis, and papillary dermal fibrosis with vertical alignment of collagen fibers.

Few studies have identified beneficial therapeutic approaches for PPE, and these are primarily observational studies, case series, or case reports. Currently, there are no randomized controlled trials undertaken to study interventions for PPE. For diagnosis before ART commencement, dramatic responses have been documented in response to ART initiation, with one study reporting complete resolution without recurrence in 86% of their cohort. Initial skin treatment in these circumstances may involve potent topical corticosteroids and high-dose oral antihistamines. Narrowband ultraviolet B and psoralen and ultraviolet A have been reported to be effective, although the period of remission may be brief. Other systemic treatments reported to be effective in observational studies are dapsone and pentoxyfylline.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^586318dc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The COVID Symptom Study app

Users of the COVID Symptom Study appwere recruited through social media outreach and included anyone able to download the app, either themselves or by proxy. On sign‐up the app collects data on sex, age and ethnicity (Asian, black, Chinese, Middle East, mixed or white); core health risk factors, including height, weight and common disease status (e.g. cancer, diabetes, and heart, kidney and lung disease); the use of medications (e.g. corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and blood pressure medications); and whether the user is a healthcare worker. From 7 May 2020, users were prompted to self‐report if they had ever had a SARS‐CoV‐2 test, including how it was performed (e.g. nose or throat swab, antibody testing) and the result (positive, negative, failed or waiting). Users could provide daily updates on their health status and the presence of up to 14 COVID‐19‐related symptoms: abdominal pain, chest pain, delirium, diarrhoea, fatigue, fever, headache, hoarse voice, anosmia, persistent cough, shortness of breath, skipped meals, sore throat and unusual muscle pains. From 29 April 2020, two cutaneous manifestations were also added: raised, red, itchy weals on the face or body or sudden swelling of the face or lips (body rash); and red/purple sores or blisters on the feet or toes (acral rash). Asking the participants to differentiate between a transient urticarial rash and a fixed erythematopapular or vesicular rash was problematic, so the body rashes were collected together, as done elsewhere.

### Dandruff shampoo… [^a9e7ef72]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

What is seborrhea. Seborrhea is a common skin problem. It causes a red, itchy rash and white scales. When it affects the scalp, it is called "dandruff. " It can be on parts of the face as well, including the folds around the nose and behind the ears, the forehead, and the eyebrows and eyelids. On the body, seborrhea often occurs in the middle part of the chest, around the navel and in the skin folds under the arm, below the breasts and in the groin and buttocks area. Who gets seborrhea. Infants may get seborrhea. It's known as "cradle cap. " Cradle cap goes away after about 6 months. It may also affect the diaper area and look like a diaper rash. Seborrhea also affects adults and elderly persons, and is more common in men than in women. Seborrhea occurs more frequently in persons with oily skin. It is also common in patients with Parkinson's disease or AIDS. What causes seborrheic dermatitis. The cause of seborrheic dermatitis is not fully understood.

It is likely that a number of factors, such as hormones and stress, can cause it. A yeast-like organism plays an important role. How is seborrheic dermatitis treated. Treatment will help keep seborrhea under control. It's important to keep your body clean. Cradle Cap Cradle cap in infants also gets better with daily shampooing. First try a mild, nonmedicated baby shampoo. If that doesn't work, try an a dandruff shampoo. If the patch of cradle cap is large and thick, first try softening it by rubbing on warm mineral oil. Next, gently brush with a baby hairbrush. Then use shampoo. Seborrhea on the Face and Body Seborrhea on the face and body gets better if it is washed every day with soap and water. Rest and exercise, especially outdoors, also help. Sunlight seems to stop growth of the yeast organism that causes affected areas to become inflamed. Don't forget to use a sunscreen.

If you have seborrhea around your beard and mustache, the problem will often go away if you shave the hair.

### Periorbital rash and scaly plaques in a 13-year-old boy [^f632f520]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
B. Atopic dermatitis
C. Allergic contact dermatitis
D. Clinically amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis (CAJDM)
E. Systemic sclerosis (SSc)

Answers:
A. Juvenile-onset SLE – Incorrect. Following the 2019 (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria, a diagnosis of SLE cannot be made without systemic involvement and with normal laboratory data. Moreover, in SLE, facial lesions would present as a red, butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks and nose and between the interphalangeal joints.
B. Atopic dermatitis – Incorrect. The absence of muscular involvement leads to a differential diagnosis with papulosquamous dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis. However, the clinical distribution of cutaneous lesions and the absence of spongiotic dermatitis in the skin biopsy specimen are against the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.
C. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Eyelid skin is susceptible to the actions of irritating or allergenic agents; therefore, it can frequently be affected in the context of contact dermatitis. However, violaceous color and cutaneous lesions on both hands cannot be related to an exogenous agent. A cutaneous biopsy would show spongiotic dermatitis.
D. CAJDM – Correct. CAJDM is defined by the presence of hallmark skin lesions of dermatomyositis (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, nailfold capillary changes, and poikiloderma involving the "V" of the chest and the upper back), with no clinical evidence of muscle disease. It represents less than 1% of all juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs). Cases of CAJDM can be classified as amyopathic (no markers of myositis) or hypomyopathic (laboratory, electrophysiologic, or radiologic evidence of myositis). Based on the 2017 (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, the diagnosis could be assessed without a muscle biopsy.
E. SSc – Incorrect. Cutaneous involvement in SSc includes skin thickening, digital ulcers, megacapillaries in the proximal nailfold, calcinosis, and Raynaud phenomenon. However, papulosquamous plaques in the context of this connective tissue disorder are not usually found.

### Lice and scabies: treatment update [^4d0824ac]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediculosis and scabies are caused by ectoparasites. Pruritus is the most common presenting symptom. Head and pubic lice infestations are diagnosed with visualization of live lice. Nits (lice eggs or egg casings) alone are not sufficient to diagnose a current infestation. A "no-nit" policy for return to school is not recommended because nits can remain even after successful treatment. First-line pharmacologic treatment for pediculosis is permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo. Newer treatments are available but costly, and resistance patterns are generally unknown. Noninsecticidal agents, including dimethicone and isopropyl myristate, show promise in the treatment of pediculosis. Extensive environmental decontamination is not necessary after pediculosis is diagnosed. In adults, the presence of pubic lice should prompt an evaluation for sexually transmitted infections. Body lice infestation should be suspected in patients with pruritus who live in crowded conditions or have poor hygiene. Scabies in adults presents as a pruritic, papular rash in a typical distribution pattern. In infants, the rash can also be vesicular, pustular, or nodular. First-line treatment for scabies is permethrin 5% cream. Clothing and bedding of persons with scabies should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. Counseling regarding appropriate diagnosis and correct use of effective therapies is key to reducing the burden of lice and scabies.

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP… [^4272cfb5]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. Red strawberry tongue occurs after desquamation of the white coating. After several weeks, the rash fades and is followed by desquamation of the skin, especially on the face, in skin-folds, and on the hands and feet, potentially lasting four to six weeks. 9 With a sensitivity of 90% to 95%, throat culture is the first-choice method for diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection, but this is not always practical. Initially, children may develop vesicles or pustules that form a thick, yellow crust. With autoinoculation, the lesions may quickly spread.

The face and extremities are most commonly affected. Although impetigo is usually a self-limited disease, antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent complications and spread of the infection.
12. After two to four days, the facial rash fades. In the second stage of the disease process, pink patches and macules may develop in a lacy, reticular pattern, most often on the extremities. After one to six weeks, the rash resolves but may reappear with sun exposure, heat, or stress. The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is made clinically. The condition is self-limited, but clinicians should advise parents to use gentle skin care products on the patient and that lesions may last for months or up to two to four years. Treatment options, including cryotherapy, imiquimod, and intralesional immunotherapy, are available if physical appearance is a concern.

Dermatitis requires treatment to resolve pruritus and limit spread of the molluscum.
14. This lesion is often referred to as ringworm. 15 Tinea capitis is treated with oral griseofulvin and terbinafine, depending on the most common etiologic agent in the geographic area. Tinea corporis is usually effectively treated with topical antifungals, with oral agents reserved for severe cases. 15.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^8c650e9b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) — skin rash, often erythematous and papular or pustular, is commonly associated with TKIs, particularly EGFR inhibitors, occurring in up to 100% of patients; because of outcome associations, supportive care with steroids, antihistamines, and antibiotics is preferable in many cases. Diarrhea is also observed commonly with TKIs as a class, and several agents (lapatinib, sunitinib, pazopanib) carry a black box warning for liver toxicity; dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered with hepatotoxicity as well as severe and chronic diarrhea.

### Pruritic rash in a man with seminoma [^b3e4aefb]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the best initial treatment of BIFE in a patient without evidence of lung toxicity?
A. Permanent discontinuation of bleomycin
B. Antihistamines and topical steroids
C. Oral corticosteroids
D. Topical ketoconazole
E. Avoid sun exposure

Answers:
A. Permanent discontinuation of bleomycin – Incorrect. It is important for dermatologists to recognize that bleomycin-induced cutaneous toxicities can frequently be treated symptomatically without interrupting chemotherapy. An attempt to treat the patient symptomatically is warranted before interrupting chemotherapy. If the skin symptoms severely worsen or do not improve with antihistamines and topical steroids, discontinuation of bleomycin may be considered.
B. Antihistamines and topical steroids – Correct. BIFE is typically self-limited and resolves upon cessation of bleomycin. Oral antihistamines and topical steroids are found improve the itching associated with BIFE. Hyperpigmentation may persist after therapy and occurs in 10% to 20% of patients on bleomycin. If the skin symptoms severely worsen or do not improve with antihistamines and topical steroids, discontinuation of bleomycin may be considered.
C. Oral corticosteroids – Incorrect. Local corticosteroids should be considered before systemic corticosteroids.
D. Topical ketoconazole – Incorrect. Given the patient's history, fungal skin infection is unlikely. There is no indication for ketoconazole, an antifungal.
E. Avoid sun exposure – Incorrect. Limiting sun exposure can be beneficial to all patients. However, avoidance of sun exposure alone is not the best treatment option.

### Efavirenz-induced skin eruption and successful desensitization [^cc36afba]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a patient with efavirenz-induced hypersensitivity syndrome reaction who was successfully desensitized to efavirenz.

Case Summary

A 37-year-old HIV-positive white man was placed on efavirenz, amprenavir, stavudine, lamivudine, and didanosine due to virologic failure with a previous regimen. Eight days into treatment, the patient developed a generalized rash and all medication was discontinued. Two weeks later, he was started on efavirenz, stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, and lopinavir. The next morning, he awoke with red, itchy skin. All of the medications were discontinued. At the HIV Drug Safety Clinic, the patient was successfully restarted on amprenavir, stavudine, didanosine, lamivudine, and lopinavir. A 14-day desensitization to efavirenz was also undertaken; on day 12 of the desensitization, he once again developed a rash. He was treated symptomatically, and the desensitization protocol was extended. Sixteen months following the successful desensitization, he is tolerating full-dose efavirenz in combination with the other antiretroviral agents.

Discussion

The incidence of efavirenz-induced hypersensitivity ranges between 10% and 34%. Generally, an erythematous, maculopapular rash with or without fever develops 1–3 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In many patients without systemic manifestations, an attempt should be made to continue therapy and treat the rash symptomatically. If this fails, desensitization with the implicated drug can be tried.

Conclusions

A history of antiretroviral-induced hypersensitivity reactions often limits the choices of medications that can be used in subsequent treatment regimens. Desensitization may allow for the continued use of previously restricted medications.

### Special considerations for therapy of pediatric atopic dermatitis [^73080f43]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the leading cause of pediatric dermatology visits in developed nations. Recurrent, itchy rashes in typical locations and a family/personal history of atopy helps to identify children with disease. Most cases (85%) are diagnosed by age 5 years. Some comorbidities are age-based and may affect disease course. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy; corticosteroidphobia and side effects complicate use. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are alternatives to corticosteroids, especially in sensitive locations. Systemic therapies include antihistamines, immune suppressive agents, and phototherapy, with specific pediatric modifications. This article reviews the nuances and caveats of pediatric atopic dermatitis diagnosis and management.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^83d9b974]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atypical Variants of PR

Atypical variants of pityriasis rosea account for approximately 20% of all cases. These variants can differ significantly from the classical presentation — owing to morphology, size, distribution, course, or symptoms — making diagnosis more challenging. Current research suggests that children are more predisposed to atypical variants of PR in comparison with adults, with atopy playing a possible role.

Atypical pityriasis rosea (PR) can present in diverse forms, deviating from the classic herald patch followed by smaller lesions. It may include vesicular, purpuric, urticarial, or papulovesicular lesions and, rarely, erythema multiforme-like or targetoid lesions. The size of these lesions varies, with some significantly smaller or larger than the typical 2–10 cm diameter. Unlike the usual "Christmas tree" pattern, atypical lesions may appear in unusual locations such as the face, palms, soles, or mucous membranes, which are generally spared in classic cases. The rash duration can also differ, sometimes lasting longer than the typical 6–8 weeks or resolving more quickly. While classic PR is often asymptomatic or mildly itchy, atypical forms may present with more severe symptoms, including significant pruritus, especially upon contact with sweat, leading to excoriations, pain, or systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.

### Insect bite-induced hypersensitivity and the SCRATCH principles: a new approach to papular urticaria [^d1708367]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Insect bites and the associated hypersensitivity reactions known as papular urticaria account for a significant number of all referrals from pediatricians and dermatologists to our pediatric dermatology clinic. Unfortunately, children affected by these eruptions are frequently misdiagnosed and often subject to expensive evaluations including invasive and unnecessary procedures. Here we review the course of 4 children with the typical physical findings and natural history of these reactions. On the basis of our clinical findings and experience with this patient population, we propose a set of principles (termed "SCRATCH") as clinical features to aid clinicians in making an early and accurate clinical diagnosis. We conclude that a more appropriate term for future study and diagnosis of this entity is insect bite-induced hypersensitivity.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^4c937739]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute urticaria:

- **Definition**: Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition characterized by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals or hives.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute urticaria is caused by mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to characteristic skin lesions. The activation of these cells can occur through multiple triggers, including IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute urticaria in the United Kingdom is estimated at 355 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acute urticaria presents as itchy, raised welts that can appear anywhere on the body. These hives are transient, often moving from one area of the body to another. In some cases, acute urticarial lesions may display central clearing with an ecchymotic or hemorrhagic hue.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute urticaria is generally good, as it is typically a self-limiting condition that resolves within 6 weeks.

She recently recovered from conjunctivitis of the right eye and was noted to sleep with stuffed animals in bed and a fluffy blanket over her face. Her family had no similar findings. She did not develop papules on vacation recently, yet upon returning, new papules appeared the next morning. There were several edematous pink papules, some with a central pustule, on her face and right knee (Fig 1). Examination of the patient's room by an exterminator revealed insect larvae (Figs 2 and 3).

Question 1: Based on this patient's history and presentation, what is the most likely etiology/diagnosis?
A. Flea bites
B. Head louse bites
C. Mosquito bites
D. Dermestid dermatitis
E. Bed bug bites

### Use of the rash appearance to distinguish cholinergic urticaria subtypes: a retrospective cohort study [^b83f3a6f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cholinergic urticaria (CholU) is characterized by pruritic papular wheals induced by various temperature-elevating stimuli such as exercise, bathing, and emotional stress. Although it is considered important to classify CholU into subtype on the basis of the pathogenesis and clinical features for better management, few studies have evaluated the rash type as a clinical feature.

Aim

This study aimed to investigate the associations between different types of rashes in CholU and their clinical phenotypes, and to consider the mechanisms underlying each type of rash.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 64 patients diagnosed with CholU who visited the Dermatological Institute of Kobe University Hospital. Clinical and photographic data obtained after exercise provocation and/or thermoregulatory sweat tests were reviewed and used to classify patients into the red wheal/erythema group (n = 44) or the goosebumps group (n = 20). Intradermal tests, namely the autologous sweat skin test (ASwST) and autologous serum skin test (ASST), were performed to assess sweat and serum reactivity, respectively. The presence of atopic dermatitis and hypohidrosis was evaluated in accordance with established guidelines. Univariable logistic analyses were conducted to assess the associations between rash types and clinical features, namely age, sex, ASwST and ASST results, atopic dermatitis, hypohidrosis, pruritus, and pain. Multivariable logistic analysis was performed using only sex and age. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10, with significance set at P < 0.05.

Results

The red wheal/erythema group had typical punctate or coalescent erythematous wheals, while the goosebumps group had follicular, goosebump-like rashes with or without erythema. Compared with the red wheal/erythema group, the goosebumps group had a higher proportion of males (85% versus 38.6%) and higher prevalences of hypohidrosis (89.4% versus 35.7%) and pain (89.5% versus 37.8%). In contrast, the red wheal/erythema group had significantly higher prevalences of ASwST positivity (68.4% versus 20%), atopic dermatitis (58.1% versus 5.3%), and pruritus (78.4% versus 10.5%). Univariable analysis revealed that ASwST positivity, atopic dermatitis, and pruritus were significantly associated with the red wheal/erythema group, while hypohidrosis and pain were significantly associated with the goosebumps group. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that male sex was significantly associated with the goosebumps group.

Conclusions

Patients with CholU develop rashes with varying coloration and shapes. Goosebump-like rashes, which differ from typical wheals, were often accompanied by hypohidrosis. The type of rash may help to differentiate the clinical subtypes of CholU.

Clinical Presentation, Sex, and Age at Diagnosis

Clinical Presentation

The clinical picture of DH consists of an itchy rash occurring in the favored sites of the elbows, the extensor surfaces of the forearms, the knees, and the buttocks, including the sacral area (Fig. 1). The rash is polymorphic, consisting of small blisters, papules, and erythema; however, because of the intense itch and associated scratching, erosions, crusts, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation often dominate the clinical picture. The localization of the rash is so typical for DH that the itchy rash in the predominant skin sites usually raises suspicion of DH. However, the severity of the rash varies between individuals, and a more intense rash may also affect other sites, such as the scalp, face, and upper back. The clinical picture and severity of the DH rash seem to have remained unchanged over recent decades without becoming milder or otherwise nonclassical as seen in celiac disease. The itch in DH is very prominent; in half of the patients, it is a constant finding and correlates with common sleep disturbances. Triggering factors such as taking indomethacin and inadvertent dietary iodide ingestion are known to exacerbate the rash and itching. A few cases of localized DH on the face or elsewhere on the body have been described. Acral purpura is a rare finding in DH and may be seen either with the typical rash or as the only symptom of the disease, especially in children with DH.

The differential diagnosis of DH includes various itchy, excoriated, and blistering skin diseases. Linear IgA disease and sometimes bullous pemphigoid may clinically resemble DH, but immunofluorescence examination easily differentiates these disorders. Other itchy skin diseases, such as scabies, atopic and nummular dermatitis, lichen planus, and urticaria may also resemble DH, but the most obvious difference is the symmetrical distribution of the rash on the favored sites in DH.

### Mass drug administration for the control of scabies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1be68570]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Scabies is a skin disease caused by infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. The mite burrows under the skin and causes intense itch and a papular rash. Infestation is often complicated by secondary skin infections with bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, which can lead to more severe skin infections, invasive disease, and immune-mediated disease. Scabies also impacts quality of life by disrupting sleep, school or work performance, and by causing stigma.

There are an estimated 455 million new cases of scabies globally each year. The mite is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and is more common in crowded settings. Infestations more frequently occur among people living in resource-poor environments, particularly tropical regions, where prevalence of over 20%, and 50% in children, has been reported. Outbreaks have occurred in institutions such as nursing homes, prisons, and schools. The first line scabies treatment in the majority of guidelines is a topical agent, most commonly permethrin 5% cream or benzyl benzoate 25% lotion. Ivermectin, an oral agent, is also recommended as second line treatment. For scabies, it requires administration of a second dose after 7–14 days because, unlike permethrin or benzyl benzoate, it does not kill mite eggs. Guidelines also recommend treatment for household contacts.

In most high-prevalence settings, individual detection and treatment of scabies is not considered feasible on a large scale, so attention has turned to mass drug administration (MDA), a strategy for infectious disease control that involves treatment of everyone in a population, regardless of whether they have the targeted infection. MDA is a crucial tool in the control of a number of globally important neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, soil-transmitted helminths, and trachoma, and has been used for scabies control in high-prevalence settings, under both programmatic and research frameworks. The first World Health Organization expert consultation on scabies recommended MDA where prevalence is > 10%.

Investigations of MDA for scabies have been conducted in a range of settings using a variety of treatment regimens. Several also assessed the impact of MDA for scabies on impetigo. The aim of this study is to support the development of public health guidelines by assessing the efficacy of MDA for scabies on scabies and impetigo.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^96728fd3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Papular rashes are the most common, while urticaria is short‐lived

Photographs of rashes were shared by 2328 surveyees, and 260 photographs were randomly selected to be assessed by four experienced dermatologists, who divided them into five common categories: papular, urticarial, vasculitic body, livedo reticularis and acral lesions. We discarded 52 photographs (20%) rejected by at least one dermatologist because the image was blurred, or the area photographed was too small to evaluate, or the person could be de‐anonymized. Out of the 208 good‐quality photographs, 30 were judged as not attributable to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (e.g. acne, shingles, molluscum contagiosum, pompholyx eczema, perioral dermatitis, impetigo or tinea; 14.4%), and 18 were discarded due to a disagreement in diagnosis between dermatologists (8.7%), resulting in 160 photographs used in the subsequent analyses. Notably, when asked whether a photograph showed a COVID‐19‐related skin rash, the four dermatologists agreed 82.2% of the time, and three out of four dermatologists agreed 95.7% of the time. The three most common presentations were papular rashes (including erythematopapular and erythematovesicular types, 41.2%), urticaria (30.0%) and acral lesions (23.1%). The overall levels of agreement for acral lesions and urticaria were 96.6% and 80.9%, respectively. Papular rashes showed the lowest agreement (76.4%), possibly because some the papular rashes may be more subtle and more difficult to photograph. Examples of COVID‐19 cutaneous manifestation are shown in Figure 2 and Figures S6–S8 (see Supporting Information). A large website, created in collaboration with the British Association of Dermatologists and including 400 manually curated high‐quality photographs, is available at.

### Common skin rashes in children [^a92a51cb]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the "slapped cheek" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.

Skin Rash and Dermatitis.

The treatments commonly used for the management of skin rash are detailed in Table 3. The reported data have described treatment of patients with grade 1 or 2 skin rash to include petrolatum emollients, medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids, oral minocycline or doxycycline, 0.5% to 2.5% hydrocortisone cream, H 1 antihistaminic loratadine, and saline/boric acid compresses.– Topical antibiotics such as clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole and benzoyl peroxide can be used to treat skin toxicities; however, these are usually avoided in patients with papulopustular or acneiform eruption because these treatments have drying properties that can induce rosacea and can be irritating. Additionally, the use of topical retinoids is typically avoided because of their greater potential for irritation. Patients are cautioned to avoid sunbathing, direct sunlight, hot temperatures, and humidity. Patients should avoid manipulation of skin or hot blow-drying of the hair because these can increase the risk of infection. Although the use of greasy creams such as petroleum jelly is highly effective, the treatment can cause folliculitis owing to its occlusive properties.

For patients with grade 3/4 skin rash, the reports most commonly suggested temporary dose interruption and/or reduction of anti-EGFR therapy, depending on the severity of the rash and the patient's tolerance level. In addition to the suggested reductions, other possible recommended treatment methods include the administration of doxycycline; minocycline; oral; intramuscular; intravenous antihistamine; high-dose tetracycline; oral corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisone); oral retinoids (low-dose isotretinoin); or intravenous antibiotics.,

Treatment of xerosis and/or pruritus often includes the use of moisturizers or oral antihistamines. Emollients and cyanoacry-late tissue adhesives can effectively treat xerosis but must be used with care because their occlusive properties can lead to folliculitis. For patients who experience eczema, treatment with cortico steroids is recommended; for those who experience eczema with blisters (wet eczema), cultures should be conducted to ensure no bacterial or viral infection is present.

### Pruritus, papules, and perspiration [^b3b465d2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The development of pruritus and papules with increased body temperature is a common clinical scenario seen in allergy practice, often leading to a diagnosis of cholinergic urticaria.

Objective

To describe an unusual case of miliaria and its significance in the evaluation of patients with pruritic papular eruptions that occur with increased body temperature.

Methods

An 18-year-old woman was referred to a local allergist for the evaluation of cholinergic urticaria. For the preceding 6 months, she had experienced a facial burning sensation along with diffuse pruritus accompanied by water-filled pinpoint bumps on her abdomen and extremities during exercise and with hot tub use. The lesions appeared anytime she exercised, and she reduced her workouts because of the associated discomfort. An exercise challenge was performed given the atypical description of her cutaneous symptoms.

Results

After indoor aerobic exercise on a treadmill, physical examination revealed facial flushing and numerous pinpoint translucent vesicles covering her abdomen. The diagnosis of miliaria crystallina was made. Given the intense pruritus she experienced with the lesions, she was prescribed cetirizine, 10 mg once daily. However, she noted no improvement with her exercise-induced miliaria. At follow-up 1 year later, her miliaria symptoms had spontaneously resolved with no sequelae observed.

Conclusion

Intermittent, pruritic, papular eruptions that occur with perspiration can provide a diagnostic challenge when not present on initial examination. Although this presentation often leads to a diagnosis of cholinergic urticaria, our case illustrates that other disorders must be considered in the differential diagnosis. In these situations, exercise challenge is a valuable adjunct.

2. Male genital lesions

Discrete papules or larger nodules found on the penis (shaft, corona, glans, prepuce) and/or scrotum are highly specific for scabies. 34 Their surface may be smooth or rough depending on how vigorously the patient has been scratching, but are not scaly. Typically, several lesions are present at one time in an affected individual (Figure 3 g). 74, 75 These lesions are often very itchy, but in some individuals they may not be itchy at all. Genital lesions are reported to occur in up to 10–30% of male patients with scabies, but they may be more frequent in adult male individuals in temperate climates. 58, 76

3. Typical lesions

The clinical signs of common scabies vary widely in terms of the appearance of individual lesions; appearance of grouped or clustered lesions; and severity and degree of secondary changes such as excoriation, impetiginization, eczematization and lichenification (thickening of skin due to scratching and rubbing). In the absence of the highly specific signs of burrows or male genital lesions, the decision whether or not other observed skin lesions are typical for scabies is a critical determination in diagnosing clinical scabies or suspected scabies. For lesions to be considered typical, examiners must consider both morphology and number.

In morphology, typical scabies lesions are small, elevated and easily palpated. The most common lesions are solid and 2–3 mm in diameter (papules). 77 Larger, nodular lesions, usually 5–10 mm and occasionally > 10 mm, are more likely to be seen in certain body areas (groin and genitalia, buttocks, axillae, breasts of women and torsos of infants) 78, 79 and may persist for several months, even after mites are successfully eradicated. The colour is usually erythematous (pink to red) but may be hyperpigmented in darker‐skinned individuals.

### Atopic dermatitis [^66f34364]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atopic dermatitis:

- **Definition**: Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin condition characterized by intense itching.
- **Pathophysiology**: Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction between defects in skin barrier function (caused by mutations in filaggrin gene), immune dysregulation, and environmental and infectious agents (S. aureus).
- **Disease course**: Skin barrier dysfunction and immune dysfunction results in atopic dermatitis, which causes clinical phases of acute atopic dermatitis (vesicular, weeping, crusting eruption), subacute atopic dermatitis (dry, scaly, erythematous papules and plaques), and chronic atopic dermatitis (lichenification, thickening, from repeated scratching). Atopic dermatitis precedes the development of food allergies, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. The disease decreases productivity and QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Atopic dermatitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

Discussion

The incidence of syphilis has been increasing in the USA since 2001. The histology of syphilis, though widely studied, still remains a diagnostic challenge, particularly when the clinical presentation does not suggest the diagnosis. We present an overview of the clinical and pathological features commonly associated with cutaneous primary and secondary syphilis, addressing, at the end, the current case.

Treponema pallidum, as is well known, is the etiological organism of syphilis. Syphilis presents in one of three stages — primary, secondary and tertiary — with primary and secondary syphilis being the most common. Secondary syphilis is most commonly encountered in dermatopathology practice. The anogenital region is the most common location. However, 5% of cases arise in extragenital sites, which are termed endemic, or non-venereal, syphilis. The oral cavity is the most commonly involved extragenital site, but any site can be involved.

In primary syphilis, the lesion typically appears as a chancre, a punched-out, painless ulcer that develops 20–30 days after exposure to T. pallidum and may be associated with painless lymphadenopathy. These lesions resolve within 1–5 weeks and do not scar.

Secondary syphilis arises 6–8 weeks after the primary chancre. The lesions initially present as 5–10 mm erythematous macules on the head, face and neck similar to a viral xanthem. A polymorphic papular eruption subsequently occurs and consists of coppery red papules, measuring 3–10 mm in diameter. Involvement of the palms, soles and oral cavity is highly suspicious for secondary syphilis. However, this classic progression is not always observed and there is clinical significant overlap with other entities and non-specific presentations. Patients can also present with other cutaneous manifestations, some of which overlap with syphilis. These include papulosquamous/psoriasiform lesions, oral ulcers, condylomata, bullous lesions, and erythema muliforme-like folliculitis. Patients with secondary syphilis can also develop fever, headache, weight loss, myalgias and arthralgias. Left untreated, secondary syphilis resolves within 2–10 weeks. After a latent phase, patients can progress to cure with seronegativity; seropositivity without lesions; or develop lesions of tertiary syphilis.

### Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations: a review [^1437fcba]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations are caused by organisms that live on or in the skin, on clothing, or in the environment and commonly cause pruritus and rash. In 2021, approximately 622 million incident cases of scabies occurred globally. Data on bedbug infestations are limited. Body lice prevalence ranges from 4.1% to 35% among persons experiencing homelessness worldwide.

Observations

Scabies is caused by mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) that burrow into the epidermis. Transmission primarily occurs from prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an individual who has an infestation. Common scabies is characterized by excoriated pruritic papules, plaques, and pathognomonic burrows on finger/toe web spaces, volar wrists, ankles, axillae, buttocks, male genitalia, and areolae. Permethrin cream and oral ivermectin are first-line treatments for adults, with similar clearance rates by week 2 (74% with permethrin vs 68% with ivermectin; relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.08). Treatment failure can occur with oral ivermectin (11.8%; 95% CI, 8.4%-15.4%) and topical permethrin (10.8%; 95% CI, 7.5%-14.5%). Bedbugs (Cimex lectularius, Cimex hemipterus) are insects that live on mattresses and furniture and feed on blood nocturnally, causing linear pruritic erythematous papules. New skin lesions on waking, cohabitants with similar symptoms, and recently residing in a high-occupancy setting should raise suspicion. Treatment requires eradication with pest management. Body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus) are insects found on clothing that travel to the skin for blood meals. Body lice bites cause pruritic excoriated macules/papules and hyperpigmentation in areas where clothing seams contact skin. Treatment and prevention require at least once-weekly bathing and laundering of clothing and bedding.

Conclusions and Relevance

Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations are common. Accurate diagnosis requires taking a history, including social drivers of health (eg, housing status, living environment), and physical examination. First-line treatments include scabicides for patients with common scabies and their close contacts. Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations should be treated with decontamination measures.

8 DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES FOR CUTANEOUS PRURITUS

The diagnostic procedures for cutaneous pruritus are shown in Figure 9. The initial step is to ascertain that the presence of primary rash is apparent on the skin. In the absence of pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made. In cases where a primary pruritic dermatosis is evident but the appropriate treatment for it does not alleviate the itch, then the possibility of a coexistence of a pruritic dermatosis with cutaneous pruritus should be considered.

FIGURE 9
Diagnostic procedures for cutaneous pruritus. The initial step is to ascertain whether presence of primary rash is present on the skin. In the absence of pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made, and further examination determines which type of cutaneous pruritus the patient has. CKD‐aP, chronic kidney disease–associated pruritus.

Localized itch is favorably indicative of a neuropathic origin, whereas generalized itch is suggestive of alternative forms of cutaneous pruritus, including cutaneous pruritus with underlying systemic disease(s), drug‐induced itch, psychogenic itch (functional itch disorder), and CPUO. A comprehensive examination for underlying systemic disease(s) is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Question 2: What is the best next step in the management of this patient?
A. Oral prednisone
B. Supportive care
C. Oral antihistamines and reassurance
D. Topical antibiotics
E. Methotrexate

Answers:
A. Oral prednisone – Correct. Corticosteroids are the first-line therapeutic option in the management of Sweet syndrome, with most patients showing rapid clinical response. In fact, improvement with systemic corticosteroids is included in the diagnostic criteria for Sweet syndrome. Topical or intralesional corticosteroids may be considered in patients with localized disease. Alternative first-line therapeutic options include colchicine, dapsone, and potassium iodide. Our patient showed rapid improvement with 60 mg daily of oral prednisone, with near-complete resolution of her rash and pruritus at 2-week follow-up.
B. Supportive care – Incorrect. Supportive care is the mainstay of management for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but pharmacologic therapy is indicated in the treatment of Sweet syndrome.
C. Oral antihistamines and reassurance – Incorrect. Although drug-induced Sweet syndrome may improve following discontinuation of the offending medication, antihistamines and reassurance alone would not be appropriate. Oral antihistamines may be used for symptomatic relief, but further pharmacologic therapy is indicated.
D. Topical antibiotics – Incorrect. Postoperative infection and bacterial sepsis are important initial considerations in the differential diagnosis of this patient with fever, rash, and leukocytosis following surgery. Empiric intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were administered until the correct diagnosis of Sweet syndrome was established. In this situation of a systemic illness, topical antibiotic therapy is not indicated.
E. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Methotrexate has been used with success in refractory cases of Sweet syndrome. However, it is not a first-line treatment option.

Bioterrorism versus emerging infectious diseases — recognizing and responding to outbreaks notes that an intentional biological release can mimic a natural outbreak and that recognizing an undeclared use may be more difficult than announced chemical or biological events. Health investigators may not immediately know an outbreak is intentional; CDC highlights illnesses and symptoms that may result from nature or bioterrorism, including encephalitis, hemorrhagic mediastinitis, pneumonia with abnormal liver function tests, papulopustular rash such as smallpox rash, hemorrhagic fever, descending paralysis, and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Characteristics suggesting possible intentional use include an outbreak of a rare disease; an outbreak in an area that normally does not experience the disease; occurrence of a seasonal disease at an inappropriate time of year; unusual age distribution; unusual epidemiologic features (for example, a foodborne pathogen now transmitted person to person); and unusual clinical symptoms not typically seen with a known pathogen, especially respiratory symptoms.

Scabies — presentation and exam considerations note that infestation 'usually manifests as a generalized or regional pruritic papular rash with erythema, abundant excoriations, and secondarily infected pustules' and 'generally presents in a regionally symmetric manner'. 'For example, 2 of the most commonly involved sites are the volar wrists and finger web spaces; the left and right sides are usually involved in a nearly identical fashion'. 'Also, boys and men with scabies often develop nodular lesions on the scrotum and penis', and 'When considering scabies in any male older than 2 years, a genital examination can be extremely helpful'. 'Scabies burrows are short, delicate, linear lesions that involve the most superficial part of the epidermis; burrows are pathognomonic but are challenging to detect', and treatment information is available at 'https://www.cdc.gov/scabies/about/'.

Follow-Up

The rash and pruritus of scabies might persist for < 2 weeks after treatment. Symptoms or signs persisting for > 2 weeks can be attributed to multiple factors. Treatment failure can occur as a result of resistance to medication or faulty application of topical scabicides. These medications do not easily penetrate into thick, scaly skin of persons with crusted scabies, perpetuating the harboring of mites in these difficult-to-penetrate layers. In the absence of recommended contact treatment and decontamination of bedding and clothing, persisting symptoms can be attributed to reinfection by family members or fomites. Finally, other household mites can cause symptoms to persist as a result of cross-reactivity between antigens. Even when treatment is successful, reinfection is avoided, and cross-reactivity does not occur, symptoms can persist or worsen as a result of allergic dermatitis.

Retreatment 2 weeks after the initial treatment regimen can be considered for those persons who are still symptomatic or when live mites are observed. Use of an alternative regimen is recommended for those persons who do not respond initially to the recommended treatment.

Management of Sex Partners and Household Contacts

Persons who have had sexual, close personal, or household contact with the patient within the month preceding scabies infestation should be examined. Those identified as being infested should be provided treatment.

Management of Outbreaks in Communities, Nursing Homes, and Other Institutional Settings

Scabies epidemics frequently occur in nursing homes, hospitals, residential facilities, and other communities. Control of an epidemic can only be achieved by treating the entire population at risk. Ivermectin can be considered in these settings, especially if treatment with topical scabicides fails. Mass treatment with oral ivermectin is highly effective in decreasing prevalence in settings where scabies is endemic. Epidemics should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

1 INTRODUCTION

Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an uncomfortable sensation that provokes an urge to scratch. It impairs the quality of life (QOL) of those experiencing itch and can be debilitating and even lethal when it becomes severe and/or chronic. Therefore, dermatologists and physicians who see patients with itch must be knowledgeable about it. This review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for itch, with a particular focus on itch with no underlying primary pruritic skin disease.

### Diffuse scaly erythematous plaques in patient taking poziotinib [^5c8865de]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect. Cutaneous findings of seborrheic dermatitis are characterized by a yellow greasy scale in a seborrheic distribution.
B. Pityrosporum folliculitis – Incorrect. Pityrosporum folliculitis presents with pruritic, fine monomorphic papules and pustules on the face and back and may be confused with acne vulgaris.
C. Drug-induced papulopustular eruption with bacterial superinfection – Correct. Papulopustular drug eruptions, also known as acneiform drug eruptions, are common adverse reactions triggered by chemotherapeutic agents that target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family signaling pathways. Papulopustular drug eruptions usually present as diffuse excoriated erythematous papules and pustules that can coalesce into scaly plaques. Pustules are typically sterile, but significant superinfection can occur.
D. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome – Incorrect. This condition typically presents as an extensive morbilliform eruption and is often accompanied by lymphadenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, and laboratory-based evidence of end-organ damage.
E. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis – Incorrect. This condition classically presents as an eruption of papulopustules over erythematous annular plaques with associated pruritus. Other diagnoses with similar morphology, such as acne vulgaris, bacterial folliculitis, dermatophyte infection, mycosis fungoides, seborrheic dermatitis, and rosacea can be excluded with a skin biopsy submitted to potassium hydroxide examination.
