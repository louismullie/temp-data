ECG v2 v3 ST elevation
Management?
- Hydralazine
- ⁠labetalol followed by Nitroprusside
- ⁠Nitroglycerine and Esmolol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antihypertensive strategy is most appropriate for a patient with chest pain radiating to the back, blood pressure 220/120 mmHg, and ST elevation in V2–V3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and whether this is STEMI versus an acute aortic syndrome. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic priorities in suspected aortic dissection, including heart rate and blood pressure targets. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic options and their sequence, especially why hydralazine is problematic and why beta-blockade should precede vasodilators. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting guidance and choose the best-supported regimen with dosing and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the life-threatening differentials. Chest pain radiating to the back with severe hypertension raises concern for acute aortic syndrome, particularly Stanford type A dissection, which can mimic anterior ischemia on ECG due to coronary ostial involvement or coronary compromise, producing ST elevation in V2–V3 and threatening catastrophic outcomes if missed [^95fb0428] [^31a4a835]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; STEMI from anterior MI remains on the table, but in the presence of ripping back pain and extreme hypertension, AAS must be prioritized until excluded because management diverges and delays worsen mortality [^95fb0428] [^e87ae3b5].

> I need to check the hemodynamic strategy for suspected aortic dissection. The priority is to reduce aortic wall stress by lowering heart rate first and then systolic blood pressure; targets are heart rate 60–80 bpm and systolic BP < 120 mmHg if tolerated, using invasive arterial monitoring in an ICU setting to avoid hypotension and organ hypoperfusion [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6] [^ac77d91b]. Wait, let me verify the sequence: beta-blockade should precede vasodilators to prevent reflex tachycardia and increased shear stress, which is consistently emphasized across contemporary guidelines and society statements [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6] [^ac77d91b].

> Now, I will examine the pharmacologic options against this pathophysiology. Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator that can cause reflex tachycardia and unpredictable BP drops, so it is not recommended as first-line in suspected dissection and is generally discouraged in hypertensive emergencies for this reason; I should avoid it here [^24c9c316]. Nitroglycerin is a venodilator that reduces preload and can lower BP but does not reliably control heart rate and may worsen shear if used without beta-blockade; it is not the initial agent of choice in suspected dissection, though it can be considered for ischemic pain control once rate is optimized [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6]. Esmolol is a short-acting IV beta-blocker ideal for rapid titration to achieve rate control and initial BP reduction, and labetalol offers combined alpha/beta blockade with longer duration; both are guideline-endorsed first-line agents for AAS, with labetalol particularly useful when both rate and BP need sustained control [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6] [^7205029d]. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent arteriovenous vasodilator reserved for persistent hypertension after adequate beta-blockade; it should not be started first because of reflex sympathetic activation and increased shear stress [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6] [^ac77d91b].

> Let me consider the competing STEMI pathway briefly. If this were isolated anterior STEMI without dissection risk, immediate reperfusion and guideline-directed medical therapy including nitrates and beta-blockers would be indicated; however, the combination of severe hypertension and back pain mandates that we exclude AAS before anticoagulation and reperfusion, as fibrinolysis or heparinization would be catastrophic in dissection [^95fb0428] [^e87ae3b5]. I should double-check that both ACC/AHA and ESC chest pain guidance prioritize early ECG interpretation to triage STEMI versus alternative life threats, reinforcing the need to resolve this question urgently with imaging if needed [^71d5e482] [^2300f87d].

> Next, I should review the best-supported regimen among the choices. The option of labetalol followed by nitroprusside aligns with first-line beta-blockade followed by vasodilator escalation if BP remains uncontrolled, which matches AAS algorithms and avoids the pitfalls of hydralazine or nitroglycerin monotherapy in this context [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6] [^ac77d91b]. Hold on, I should verify dosing pragmatics: labetalol is typically titrated IV in 5–20 mg boluses or infusion to achieve rate and BP targets, and nitroprusside is added only after adequate beta-blockade with close arterial monitoring, titrated to effect while watching for cyanide toxicity with prolonged use [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6]. This sequence minimizes aortic wall stress and is the safest, evidence-concordant approach here [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6].

> I will now examine why the other options are suboptimal. Hydralazine alone risks reflex tachycardia and abrupt hypotension, worsening shear, and is not recommended as initial therapy in suspected dissection or hypertensive emergencies with vascular compromise [^24c9c316]. Nitroglycerin with esmolol places a venodilator first, which does not reliably control heart rate and may leave the aorta exposed to high shear until beta-blockade takes effect; this sequence is less secure than beta-blockade followed by vasodilator if needed [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6]. But wait, what if the ECG changes reflect true anterior STEMI rather than dissection? Even then, until dissection is excluded, beta-blockade with careful BP control remains appropriate, and systemic anticoagulation or fibrinolysis must be withheld until imaging rules out AAS, so the labetalol-first strategy still holds [^e87ae3b5] [^95fb0428].

> Final answer: Labetalol followed by nitroprusside is the most appropriate choice. It implements first-line beta-blockade to reduce heart rate and aortic wall stress, with escalation to nitroprusside only if hypertension persists after adequate beta-blockade, consistent with contemporary guidelines for suspected acute aortic syndrome and hypertensive emergencies with vascular compromise [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6] [^ac77d91b]. I need to ensure urgent imaging is arranged to distinguish STEMI from dissection and that continuous arterial monitoring is instituted in an ICU setting while titrating therapy to heart rate 60–80 bpm and systolic BP less than 120 mmHg if tolerated [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6].

---

The correct answer is **labetalol followed by nitroprusside**. This regimen is preferred because labetalol provides rapid, controlled beta-blockade to reduce heart rate and aortic wall stress, and nitroprusside offers precise, titratable vasodilation to achieve the strict blood pressure targets required in suspected aortic dissection. Hydralazine is **contraindicated** due to unpredictable, reflex-mediated blood pressure swings, and nitroglycerin alone is inadequate for dissection management. Esmolol is an alternative beta-blocker, but labetalol's combined alpha/beta blockade and longer duration make it the first-line choice here [^e87ae3b5] [^7205029d].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations

In suspected aortic dissection, **severe hypertension increases aortic wall stress** and propagates the dissection; therefore, the priorities are to lower heart rate and blood pressure rapidly and predictably. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and contractility, decreasing shear stress, while vasodilators lower blood pressure to reduce wall tension [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6].

---

## Pharmacological rationale

### Labetalol

- **Mechanism of action**: Combined alpha and beta-blocker; reduces heart rate, contractility, and systemic vascular resistance.
- **Clinical advantages**: Rapid onset (2–5 minutes), predictable dosing, and sustained effect; preferred first-line agent in acute aortic syndromes [^e87ae3b5] [^7205029d].
- **Guideline support**: Strongly recommended by ACC/AHA and ESC for initial management of acute aortic syndromes [^e87ae3b5] [^7205029d].

---

### Sodium nitroprusside

- **Mechanism of action**: Direct vasodilator lowering systemic vascular resistance and afterload.
- **Clinical advantages**: Rapid, titratable effect; used after adequate beta-blockade to avoid reflex tachycardia.
- **Guideline support**: Recommended as adjunct therapy when blood pressure remains uncontrolled after beta-blockade [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6].

---

## Comparison with alternative options

| **Option** | **Rationale for/against** | **Guideline stance** |
|-|-|-|
| Hydralazine | - Unpredictable blood pressure response <br/> - Reflex tachycardia <br/> - Increases aortic wall stress <br/> - Contraindicated in dissection | - Avoided in hypertensive emergencies [^24c9c316] <br/> - Not recommended in aortic dissection [^notfound] |
| Nitroglycerin alone | - Venodilator <br/> - Limited effect on afterload <br/> - Inadequate for dissection management | - Not recommended as monotherapy in dissection [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6] |
| Esmolol | - Short-acting beta-blocker <br/> - Alternative to labetalol <br/> - Less predictable sustained control | - Acceptable alternative <br/> - Less preferred than labetalol [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Both ACC/AHA and ESC recommend **intravenous beta-blockers as first-line therapy** for acute aortic syndromes, with vasodilators added if blood pressure remains uncontrolled. Labetalol is preferred for its combined alpha/beta blockade and predictable pharmacokinetics, while nitroprusside is the vasodilator of choice for precise blood pressure control [^e87ae3b5] [^7205029d].

---

## Potential risks and benefits

Benefits of labetalol plus nitroprusside include **rapid blood pressure control**, reduced aortic wall stress, and lower risk of dissection propagation. Risks include hypotension, bradycardia, and organ hypoperfusion; these are mitigated by close monitoring and careful titration in an ICU setting [^e87ae3b5] [^5892b7b6].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Labetalol followed by nitroprusside is the **preferred regimen** for this patient because it achieves rapid, controlled blood pressure and heart rate reduction, thereby minimizing aortic wall stress and the risk of dissection progression. Hydralazine is contraindicated, and nitroglycerin alone is insufficient; esmolol is an alternative but less ideal than labetalol [^e87ae3b5] [^7205029d].

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A 44-year-old woman presents pain free to our ED after experiencing 45min of tightening of the chest with radiation to her left arm, diaphoresis and nausea. Her vital signs are normal except for her high BP, which is 180/110. She reports recurrent episodes of chest pain in the past 1.5 weeks, unrelated to exercise. She visited a general practitioner who prescribed pain medication and treated her new-onset hypertension. Besides the recently found hypertension, heavy smoking is her only other traditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Q14. A 60-year-old patient with a history of CAD presents to the emergency department with chest pain and cough lasting for 2 days. The right-sided thoracic chest pain is persistent, moderate in intensity, non-radiating, and increases in intensity during inspiration. The last episode of chest pain started 8 h prior to admission and the patient is still mildly symptomatic in the emergency department. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is unremarkable. The 12-lead ECG shows T-wave inversion in lead I and aVL, which were already noted in the ECG performed last year. The initial hs-cTn I Architect concentration is very low/undetectable at 2 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). The emergency department intern, a bright young physician who wants to become a cardiologist, challenges you by saying that 'it is obvious that the chest pain does not represent acute MI and no additional investigations or blood tests in this respect are needed'. Is she right?

Yes. NSTEMI, based on the delay between symptom onset and blood test, can be reliably ruled-out with a single very low level of hs-cTn T/I. In addition, unstable angina is extremely unlikely since prolonged ischaemia is expected to lead to some degree of cTn elevation. An alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia/bronchitis should be considered.

Q15. You are supervising the emergency department/chest pain unit (CPU) and see an 80-year-old patient with a history of CAD, prior MI, and hypertensive heart disease presenting with persistent moderate right-sided thoracic chest pain ongoing for 7 h that increases in intensity during exercise and inspiration. In addition, he has mild fever and an increasing productive cough over the last 3 days. He is haemodynamically stable and the initial physical examination reveals rales over the base of the right lung. ECG shows T-wave inversion in V3–V6, which were already noted on the ECG performed 3 years ago. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate in the right lung suggestive of pneumonia. Your intern is about to order blood cultures (plus legionella and pneumococcus antigen in the urine) and prescribe antibiotics when the hs-cTn T level is reported from the laboratory as elevated. Your intern now asks you if the patient needs treatment for pneumonia, NSTEMI, or both.

2 Materials and Methods

A guiding team of emergency medicine physicians, cardiologists, and nursing leadership was assembled representing an influential coalition. A vision to "establish the standard of care" for this patient population was developed and communicated. Following the ACT methodology, the pertinent systematic review of chest pain risk stratification was performed, current data was presented, a consensus algorithm (adapted from three SCAMPs pilots at Brigham and Women's Hospital; 10/14/2012 to 5/20/2014) was drafted (Fig. 2) with plans to capture the data from adherence to and deviations from the algorithm.

Fig. 2
High level chest pain algorithm*.

*This high level algorithm is an abdriged version of the full interdisciplinary algorithm.

During the planning process, four critical components emerged as essential elements to algorithm formation:
I. Identification: Adults with undifferentiated chest pain presenting to the ED.
II. Indications: Inclusions: Chest discomfort/pain, chest pressure/fullness, pain radiating to left/both arms, jaw pain, pain in back/neck/stomach, shortness of breath, cold sweats, nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness. Exclusions: High concern for ACS on presentation [patients with STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction), definite NSTEMI, heart failure, arrhythmia, or non-cardiac etiology such as gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal or pulmonary.
III. Stratification: The HEART (H istory, E KG, A ge, R isk factors, T roponin) score was chosen as the best stratification tool. The HEART score, had been prospectively validated for ED chest pain patients in The Netherlands via risk stratification with significantly higher concordance (c-statistic) than the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) or the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) scores. A secondary analysis of the Myeloperoxidase In the Diagnosis of Acute coronary syndromes Study (MIDAS) at 18 tertiary referral centers in the United States showed the HEART score identified a substantial number of low-risk patients for the early discharge, by incorporating a serial troponin measure, while maintaining high sensitivity for ACS.
IV. Actions: Patients in the low-risk category (HEART score 0–3) would have a repeat troponin blood test in three hours and if normal would be discharged with cardiology or primary care physician follow-up within 72 h. Patients in the intermediate-risk category (HEART score 4–6) were recommended for observation status. Patients with a high-risk for ACS (HEART score 7–10) were recommended to be admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

Q21. Your fellow asks you if B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) may help in the diagnosis of patients with suspected MI.

No, BNP does not help in the diagnosis. However, it provides important prognostic information for death and/or the development of heart failure, particularly in patients with established NSTE-ACS.

Q22. A point-of-care test (POCT) has been set up in the emergency department. Your colleague asks you if he can use one of the ESC hs-cTn T/I 0 h/1 h-algorithms for rule-in/rule-out of NSTEMI in patients presenting with acute chest pain.

Most likely, this is not possible. The new ESC hs-cTn T/I 0 h/1 h-algorithms for rule-in/rule-out of NSTEMI in patients presenting with acute chest pain can only be used with hs-cTn T/I assays. Unfortunately, the vast majority of current POCTs do have poor sensitivity and cannot be used for rapid rule-out/rule-in protocols. However, there is one exception and others are in development.

Q23. A 69-year-old woman with a past medical history of thoracic radiotherapy for breast cancer and diabetes mellitus on glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) agonist therapy is admitted to the emergency department for acute retrosternal chest pain with radiation to the left arm. She remains in pain despite sublingual nitrates. The physical examination is normal. The 12-lead ECG shows 3 mm ST-segment depression in leads V2 – V6, I, and aVL. The emergency department physician asks you whether the patient should undergo coronary angiography right now or whether she has to wait for the results of the first cTn measurement, which are expected to come back from the lab in about 45 minutes.

Given the very high likelihood of ongoing myocardial ischaemia, and the large myocardial territory at risk, the patient should undergo immediate invasive coronary angiography.

### Time to move on: redefining chest pain outcomes [^c5df4dff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Consider the following case scenarios:

A 65‐year‐old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease presents to his cardiologist with 2 weeks of intermittent, exertional chest pressure and dyspnea. An ECG shows nonspecific findings. His HEART score is 6. The patient is scheduled for a cardiac catheterization the following week. Significant atherosclerotic disease is identified, and revascularization is performed. Most would agree that his evaluation and management were patient centered, expedient, and successful.

Now consider the same patient presentation, only this time in the ED. He has the same history, the same ECG, normal vital signs, and negative serial troponin assays. His HEART score is still 6, placing him at moderate‐risk for a MACE in the next 4–6 weeks. In our current healthcare environment, the patient would likely be admitted to the hospital or placed in an observation unit. But does this make him safer? In both scenarios, he undergoes revascularization, but in the latter, had he been discharged from the ED, his revascularization would have been deemed a missed MACE. This is a contributing factor to patients being exposed to the risks and costs inherent to hospitalization. Does the setting in which care is provided justify these additional risks and healthcare costs?

In ACS, early invasive treatment (within 24–48 hours), with cardiac catheterization and appropriate revascularization, remains the preferred treatment for patients with unstable angina or non–ST‐segment–elevation MI when prohibitive comorbidities are absent. 11 Percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina, even with modest amounts of ischemia, has not been shown to reduce death, nonfatal MI, unplanned revascularization, or angina. 11 Without evidence‐based support for urgent revascularization in the absence of objective findings of myocardial ischemia, infarction, or unstable angina, the outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within the following 4–6 weeks should not be included in the ED disposition decision. However, non–ST‐segment–elevation MI identified in follow‐up and leading to revascularization could be included in the outcome measure.

2 Chest Pain

Because 80% of both women and men with ACS present with chest pain or pressure, this symptom is detailed in the guidelines, derived in part from the US Chest Pain guideline. The ESC document noted that additional symptoms such as diaphoresis, indigestion or epigastric pain, and shoulder or arm pain occur commonly in both women and men with an ACS. However, some symptoms appear to be more common in women, including dizziness and syncope, nausea and vomiting, jaw and back pain, shortness of breath, pain between the shoulder blades, palpitations, and fatigue.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9-1-1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) and anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain localized to a very limited area or radiating below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, and occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdomen discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings consistent with ischemia — In patients with ischemic symptoms, ST-segment elevation in lead augmented vector right with or without V1 combined with multilead ST-segment depression represents a high-risk pattern associated with high morbidity and mortality and often reflects diffuse ischemia from left main and/or 3-vessel disease; in approximately 10% of cases, acute coronary occlusion is present. Emergent coronary angiography should be considered in patients with persistent ischemic symptoms or ECG changes after treatment or if there is hemodynamic instability. Ischemic ST-segment depression is specific but not sensitive for ACS, and in the setting of ischemic symptoms it should prompt treatment consistent with the 2014 NSTE-ACS guidelines.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest, and that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: a companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^73bc8760]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

No. You should calculate the GRACE [Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events] risk score because subgroup analyses of two major trials indicated that patients with a high risk for in-hospital death, according to the original GRACE risk score published by Granger et al (i.e. > 140 points) (for the GRACE risk score 1.0 andfor the GRACE risk score 2.0), may do better with an early invasive strategy as compared to a delayed invasive strategy. The GRACE risk score is 154 points for this patient. Therefore, according to guidelines an invasive coronary angiography within 24 h should be performed and you should schedule the patient for Saturday (< 24 h from now).

Q25. Two hours later, another patient (female, 75 years) enters the emergency department because she experienced chest pain at rest for around 35 minutes earlier in the day. The patient is haemodynamically stable, has no life-threatening arrhythmias, and no ST-segment elevation is documented. The hs-cTn level is 52 and 68 ng/L (ULN 14 ng/L) at presentation and 1 h later (ESC 0 h/1 h-algorithm rule-in path). Your colleague gets enthusiastic about the GRACE risk score that is 129 based on the following criteria: Killip class I, systolic blood pressure 145 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, serum creatinine level 79 µmol/L, no ST-segment alterations, no cardiac arrest before admission. Your colleague states that the workload for the interventional cardiologist on duty can be limited because the patient can wait until Monday morning (GRACE risk score not above 140 points). Is he correct this time?

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Q17. You are supervising the emergency department/CPU. A resident questions you regarding the further management of a 60-year-old woman with a history of CAD presenting with ongoing moderate left-sided thoracic chest pain without radiation that started 2 h prior to admission and resolved spontaneously in the emergency department. She is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination and 12-lead ECG are unremarkable. Levels of hs-cTn T assessed at presentation and 1 h were normal and identical at 7 ng/L (ULN < 14 ng/L). Can NSTEMI be ruled-out?

Yes, the negative predictive value for MI in patients classified as 'rule-out' by the hs-cTn T 0 h/1 h-algorithm is 99–100%. Used in conjunction with clinical assessment and the 12-lead ECG as mandatory additional sources of information, the 0 h/1 h-algorithm allows the early rule-out of MI and early detection of patients that are candidates for outpatient management (i.e. no further investigation or non-invasive imaging). It is important to highlight that prior to discharge, other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain, such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and tension pneumothorax, need to be considered.

Q18. You are supervising the emergency department/CPU. A resident asks you about the further management of a 64-year-old woman without CVRFs and without known CAD presenting with moderate retrosternal chest pain without radiation that started 3 h prior to admission and lasted for 1 h. She is haemodynamically stable, pain free, and the physical examination as well as the 12-lead ECG are normal. Levels of hs-cTn I Architect at presentation are 100 ng/L (ULN < 26 ng/L). Your intern is using the assay-specific ESC 0 h/1 h-algorithm you just introduced in the hospital and he tells you that according to the algorithm the patient can be 'ruled-in'. Now the intern wants to know what it means: does the patient have NSTEMI?

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic.

### Does this patient with chest pain have acute coronary syndrome? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^3d4b6fdc]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

About 10% of patients with acute chest pain are ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Early, accurate estimation of the probability of ACS in these patients using the clinical examination could prevent many hospital admissions among low-risk patients and ensure that high-risk patients are promptly treated.

Objective

To review systematically the accuracy of the initial history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and risk scores incorporating these elements with the first cardiac-specific troponin.

Study Selection

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (January 1, 1995-July 31, 2015), along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify prospective studies of diagnostic test accuracy among patients admitted to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ACS.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We identified 2992 unique articles; 58 met inclusion criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio (LR) of findings for the diagnosis of ACS. The reference standard for ACS was either a final hospital diagnosis of ACS or occurrence of a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks.

Results

The clinical findings and risk factors most suggestive of ACS were prior abnormal stress test (specificity, 96%; LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.0–4.7]), peripheral arterial disease (specificity, 97%; LR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.5–4.8]), and pain radiation to both arms (specificity, 96%; LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8–3.7]). The most useful electrocardiogram findings were ST-segment depression (specificity, 95%; LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–8.6]) and any evidence of ischemia (specificity, 91%; LR, 3.6 [95% CI,1.6–5.7]). Both the History, Electrocardiogram, Age, Risk Factors, Troponin (HEART) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk scores performed well in diagnosing ACS: LR, 13 (95% CI, 7.0–24) for the high-risk range of the HEART score (7–10) and LR, 6.8 (95% CI, 5.2–8.9) for the high-risk range of the TIMI score (5–7). The most useful for identifying patients less likely to have ACS were the low-risk range HEART score (0–3) (LR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.13–0.30]), low-risk range TIMI score (0–1) (LR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.23–0.43]), or low to intermediate risk designation by the Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand risk algorithm (LR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.19–0.31]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with suspected ACS presenting to emergency departments, the initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram alone did not confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ACS. Instead, the HEART or TIMI risk scores, which incorporate the first cardiac troponin, provided more diagnostic information.

Emergency department ECG assessment summary — The ECG is a critical component of the initial assessment and management of ED patients with possible ACS. The ECG should be rapidly assessed for evidence of acute infarction or ischemia, and if present, subsequent care should follow current guidelines for management of acute STEMI and NSTE-ACS. The ECG should also be examined for subtle changes that are also consistent with ACS as well as for other findings that could suggest a non-ACS cause for their symptoms, and patients who have a non-ischemic ECG (as defined previously) are eligible for entering a CDP, and further clinical evaluation should take place as outlined later.

### Introducing a chest pain pathway in the emergency department to improve quality of care for patients with possible cardiac chest pain [^4a2b0acd]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Society of Cardiology define ACS as a clinical spectrum of disease, ranging from unstable angina (no myocardial damage but increased risk of myocardial infarction and subsequent complications), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI – some damage to myocardium), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) which reflects a completely occluded coronary artery.

Diagnosis is made on the presence of an ischaemic ECG, suggestive clinical history, or the presence of circulating biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (Troponin). Two out of these three factors must be present to reach a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, forty to sixty per cent of people who are subsequently diagnosed with ACS present to the ED with an initial non-diagnostic ECG. Some of these patients will not have raised troponin initially, and those with unstable angina will not have elevated troponin at any point, unless they go on to develop an MI. This means that the only way these people can initially be recognised is through the history of the presenting complaint. The full extent of coronary artery disease is often not clear until the patient undergoes invasive investigations such as coronary angiography.

Difficulties in recognition of ACS and the subsequent inconsistencies in management of these patients are well known and challenge clinicians worldwide. DeBusk et al report that half of all patients presenting with chest pain are hospitalised to detect the ten per cent who have an ACS, but that this high admission rate still fails to identify the small percentage of patients with ACS that are discharged inappropriately.

Some tools are available for use in the ED, but many of these suppose knowledge of the various presentations of ACS, are based on populations with confirmed ACS, or are aimed at recognition of MI but not unstable angina. The Goldman score, TIMI score, GRACE score, and HEART scores were all trialled and found to be unhelpful. This is mainly because Goldman is outdated and does not have any criteria relating to unstable angina, which we did not want to miss. TIMI and GRACE were validated on cohorts of patients with confirmed ACS and rely on clinical parameters which do not relate to the presenting complaint, such as createnine and systolic blood pressure. We found that patients who were over 80 years with renal impairment and high systolic blood pressure were likely to be admitted whatever the nature of the chest pain.

A diagnosis of type A aortic dissection was made. Given the very high mortality associated with conservative management, the patient was informed about the necessity of urgent surgical repair. He did not have health insurance; medical evacuation by air ambulance was prohibitively expensive. After a few days of negotiating, he managed to secure a loan from his employer and was assisted in making arrangements for travel to Ghana. Medically optimised, his BP and pain were adequately controlled on oral agents, and he travelled on a standard commercial flight to Accra, where he underwent successful operative repair with an inclusion graft replacement of his ascending aorta (figure 5). The operative findings included 'extensive intimal flap with primary tear at the sinus tabular junction involving the left coronary ostium', which likely explains the ischaemic changes seen on his ECG.

The patient has since returned to Liberia, is living with his family and is back at work. He is still paying off his loan. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first time that a Liberian national with a type A aortic dissection has been diagnosed in Liberia and successfully treated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram in patients with chest pain: When the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is nondiagnostic, serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms persist, or the clinical condition deteriorates (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Patients with chest pain whose initial ECG is consistent with an ACS should be treated according to STEMI and non–ST–segment–elevation ACS guidelines (COR 1, LOE C-EO). In patients with intermediate- to high clinical suspicion for ACS and a nondiagnostic initial ECG, supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior myocardial infarction (MI) (COR 2a, LOE B-NR).

### The effect of an electronic cognitive aid on the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction during caesarean section: a prospective randomised simulation study [^20f09e2e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Scenario

The crisis scenario was based on published case reports of acute myocardial infarction during caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia: Shortly after delivery of a healthy infant with surgery still underway an otherwise healthy patient developed chest pain and shortness of breath. The symptoms the patient complained about were typical for STEMI (e.g. severe pain radiating to the neck, shoulder and left arm) to optimise the likelihood that participants would make the correct diagnosis. Prior to the onset of symptoms the patient had received 3 IE oxytocin as slow intravenous bolus followed by a maintenance infusion of 10 IE oxytocin as mandated by the institutional protocol. Symptoms increased over the next 5–10 min with a concomitant drop in saturation (target SpO₂: 93%), tachycardia (target heart rate: 130 bpm) and a hypertensive blood pressure response (target blood pressure: 150/90 mmHg). Target values were chosen to allow the full range of treatment interventions for STEMI. ST-segment elevation increased at the same rate and was clearly visible on the monitor. Haemodynamic variables and cardiac rhythms were programmed into a manikin-based simulator (SimMan; Laerdal Norway). The protocol was pretested before study commencement using nonparticipating subjects with the aim of improving clinical cues for the participants. The results served to refine the programming and simulation script.

In the scenario, anaesthetic care was handed off to the primary provider by a confederate anaesthetist after spinal anaesthesia had been established. No husband or other family member was in the room with the patient. The consultant anaesthetist was sequestered in a separate room and could be summoned for help by the primary anaesthetist if requested. During the scenario three confederates played the roles of obstetricians and circulating nurses. They did not assist the participants in implementing the critical steps. However, when the anaesthetist raised the issue of nitroglycerine and its impact on uterine contraction or of intravenous aspirin/heparin, the confederate obstetricians agreed to a low dose infusion of nitroglycerine or to a low dose of aspirin/heparin.

To facilitate an intraoperative diagnosis, the study design allowed that a 12-lead ECG could be obtained and interpreted without delay as soon as participants requested it. A feature of the SimMan-monitor made it possible to display a 12-lead ECG with significant ST-segment elevations (> 0.25 mV) in five contiguous leads (V2–V6).

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

Q1. You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks you: what is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (= rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

Q2. A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3 h duration, palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) (twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI have to be differentiated: type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anaemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had both.

Q3. Which are the three mandatory diagnostic cornerstones of the early diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) among the following: past clinical history including a detailed description of the chest pain characteristics, 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, elevated and dynamic rise in cTn, treadmill test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and myocardial perfusion scan?

### Emergency department evaluation of the chest pain patient [^559606ca]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician must have a high degree of suspicion for myocardial ischemia in patients presenting with no obvious for their chest pain. The role of the emergency physician is to determine a relative risk for each patient and to order the appropriate studies to minimize the risk of missed myocardial infarction as well as to recognize acute ischemia or infarction and manage it aggressively. It is not possible to rule out myocardial ischemia or infarction subjectively. It is the opinion of these authors that some form of further testing should be performed on patients in all categories, except those determined to be at very low risk.

For a nondiagnostic or normal ECG, clinicians should "Repeat ECG if symptoms persist or change or if troponins positive (1)" and "Leads V7-V9 are reasonable if posterior MI suspected (2a)". If an arrhythmia is identified, clinicians should "Follow arrhythmia-specific guidelines", and diffuse ST-elevation consistent with pericarditis is recognized as a separate branch; abbreviations are defined in the figure caption for ECG, MI, NSTE-ACS, and STEMI.

Q24. You are working in the emergency department on Friday at 9 pm. A new patient (male, 77 years) arrives with de-novo angina at minimal exertion, which started 3 days ago. The ECG on admission excludes a STEMI and shows no other ST-segment alterations. The laboratory studies reveal normal levels for hs-cTn at presentation and 1 h thereafter as well as a serum creatinine level of 102 µmol/L. The patient is haemodynamically stable (systolic blood pressure 115 mmHg, heart rate 82 beats per min [bpm]) but has rales in the basal portion of both lungs (i.e. Killip class II).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrocardiographic interpretation for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) lists sex- and age-specific thresholds and posterior lead use. STEMI is identified by new or presumed new ST-elevation of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 anatomically contiguous leads (measured at the J-point) in all leads other than V2-V3 and ≥ 2 mm in men ≥ 40 y, ≥ 2.5 mm in men < 40 y, and ≥ 1.5 mm in women regardless of age in leads V2-V3, and posterior leads (V7-V9) should be obtained in patients with suspected left circumflex occlusion particularly in the setting of isolated ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1-V3. Many patients with NSTE-ACS have either nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes or a normal ECG, and the absence of electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia does not exclude ACS.

Electrocardiogram — supportive considerations: When an ECG is nondiagnostic, it "should be compared with previous ECGs, if available", and "a normal or unchanged ECG is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out ACS", so decision‑making "should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG". Masking conditions may occur, and "Up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the ED with a normal ECG", therefore "serial ECGs should be performed and management should be guided by new electrocardiographic changes or other diagnostic testing". When ST‑elevation is present on the initial ECG, "management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms", and if ST depression is identified, "management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines". Because a normal ECG may accompany certain occlusions and posterior ischemia, which is "often 'electrically silent'; therefore, right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected".

Methods

Patients

The patient population has been previously described. In brief, we included consecutive patients attending six UK chest pain clinics (Newham, Oldchurch, Kingston, Blackburn, Manchester, Burnley). The purpose of the clinics was to identify patients with angina to initiate appropriate treatment, including secondary prevention with aspirin and statins. Data on 11 082 patients were electronically recorded from 2 January 1996 to 31 December 2002 using identical databases, details of which have been reported previously. We excluded re-attendances during the study period (n = 448), patients without chest pain (n = 291), patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes on the day of visit (n = 246), patients who reported previously diagnosed coronary heart disease or revascularisation procedures (n = 579), patients for whom a diagnosis was either not entered (n = 132) or not identified as angina or non-cardiac chest pain (n = 83), those with missing data on key explanatory variables (n = 501), and those who were not traced by the national death registry (n = 40). The remaining 8762 patients with complete data and follow-up constituted the study group.

Data collection

Clinical data were systematically recorded at the time of the initial consultation in a purpose-built electronic database that was utilised across the six study centres. The data included age, sex, ethnicity, clinical descriptors of chest pain (duration of symptoms before attendance, character, site and radiation of chest pain, duration of an episode, precipitating factors and relief with glyceryl trinitrate), smoking status, history of hypertension and diabetes, pulse rate, and systolic blood pressure. Twelve-lead resting ECGs were recorded as normal or abnormal, respectively, depending on assessment of rhythm, conduction, and the absence or presence of regional ST segment or T wave changes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and Q waves. Fields for all these clinical and ECG findings were included in the database and were populated by the attending clinicians during consultation in the chest pain clinic. Clinicians were also invited to enter into the electronic record their assessment of the patient's chest pain as being 'typical', 'atypical' or 'non-anginal'

Case presentation

A 64-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking history and hyperlipidaemia, was initially treated for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with bamlanivimab and discharged home. COVID-19 was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing. Due to progressive dyspnoea, he returned to the hospital and was admitted for hypoxic respiratory failure further complicated by diffuse interstitial fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He required therapy with convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, remdesivir, supplemental oxygen and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Later into his hospitalisation, the patient developed acute onset chest pain with ECG showing minimal inferior ST segment elevations. He characterised his chest pain as a non-exertional, substernal pressure, accompanied by radiation to upper extremities, that subsided spontaneously after 30 min. Relevant cardiac history included a nuclear stress test 1 year prior to presentation that did not identify any fixed or reversible perfusion defects. The patient was transferred to our tertiary care facility for further evaluation of ACS. Intake vitals were unremarkable and physical examination was notable only for trace bibasilar crackles. Repeat ECG showed resolution of prior nonspecific ST segment changes with persistence of a T wave inversion in V3 (figure 1).

Her cardiac risk factors included active smoking and hypertension. Initial blood pressure was significantly elevated at 235/147 mm Hg, and she had sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute. The ECG revealed ST-elevations in anterolateral leads (V2 to V6), indicating an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (figure 1).

Contemporary angina classification by pathophysiology

The clinical history is of paramount importance to initially establish whether the nature of the presenting symptoms is consistent with angina (box 1). Indeed, recent data supports specialist physicians under-recognise angina in up to half of their patients. Furthermore, contemporary clinical trials of revascularisation in stable IHD including the ISCHEMIA trial highlight the importance of good clinical history and listening to our patients to determine the nature and frequency of symptoms which helps to plan management. We propose a classification of angina that aligns with underlying aetiology and related management (table 1).

There is no need for a second troponin assessment. The diagnosis of NSTEMI is made and appropriate treatment should be initiated. The positive predictive value for NSTEMI in patients with typical symptoms and a substantial (> 20 times the 99th percentile) elevation in cTn is > 90% (section 3.3.3). If the institution uses the ESC hs-cTn T 0h/1 h-algorithm, an initial hs-cTn T concentration above 52 ng/L allows triage of patients towards rule-in.

The next four scenarii highlight how to use the available different types of hs-cTn.

Q8. A 60-year-old patient without prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) presents to the emergency department with recurrent right-sided thoracic chest pain. The last chest pain episode started 5 h prior to hospital admission and is still ongoing. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is normal. The 12-lead ECG is also normal. The initial hs-cTn T level is normal at 4 ng/L (ULN < 14 ng/L). The intern in the emergency department asks you as a cardiology consultant if this single very low hs-cTn T concentration allows the rule-out of NSTEMI.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) medical management — initial treatment targets and agents: In patients presenting to the hospital with AAS, "prompt treatment with anti-impulse therapy with invasive monitoring of BP with an arterial line in an ICU setting is recommended as initial treatment to decrease aortic wall stress". Patients with AAS "should be treated to a SBP < 120 mm Hg or to lowest BP that maintains adequate end-organ perfusion, as well as to a target heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm". For pharmacotherapy, "initial management should include intravenous beta blockers, except in patients with contraindications", and "in those with contraindications or intolerance to beta blockers, initial management with an intravenous non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is reasonable for heart rate control". If blood pressure is not controlled after beta-blocker initiation, "initial management should include intravenous vasodilators", and "patients with AAS should be treated with pain control, as needed, to help with hemodynamic management".

Q29. A 55-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, a tight feeling on the chest, and palpitations for 3 h. In addition, she mentions a few episodes of intermittent chest discomfort over the last 6 months, lasting minutes but sometimes hours, occurring both at rest and during exercise. She has a positive family history for CAD. The initial ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 130 bpm and then 96 bpm with no ischaemic changes after 30 minutes of a resting period. Initial and 1 h hs-cTn measures were 30 ng/L and 36 ng/L (ULN 14 ng/L), respectively. A resident asks you, as supervisor of the emergency department/CPU, whether CCTA should be performed now to rule-out obstructive coronary artery disease.

CCTA has a high diagnostic accuracy for ruling out occlusive CAD. However, image quality and interpretability may be hampered when irregular heart rhythm is present. Although elevated levels of hs-cTn may be attributable to myocardial injury due to rapid ventricular rate response, a CCTA is recommended because of the chest discomfort during the last 6 months and the positive family history for CAD.

Q30. A just-appointed radiologist challenges the work-up of patients with acute chest pain by stating the following: 'Why bother with clinical evaluation, repeated cTn testing, and ECG assessments in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS? In the end, all need CCTA'. Is this statement correct?

Not at all. Broad adoption of non-invasive anatomic testing, in terms of CCTA, among inadequately risk stratified patients, has been shown to increase downstream testing and costs without clinical benefit for the patient. In addition, despite the reduction in radiation doses achieved in recent years, acquisition of high-quality images with low radiation exposure, as well as appropriate interpretation of CT images, is not usually available on a 24/7 basis at every institution.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^ab8db5af]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

### ST segment elevation in an adult chest pain patient: a case of coronary artery vasospasm [^f02ac06b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in the United States, accounting for up to eight million cases annually. We present a 55-year-old male who was brought in to the ED with sudden onset chest pain and was found to have ST-segment elevations in the infero-lateral leads on electrocardiogram (ECG). These changes resolved with nitroglycerin. Coronary artery vasospasm was diagnosed as coronary angiogram was normal. Calcium channel blocker was prescribed with good symptom relief. The most important teaching point is, coronary vasospasm as a cause of ST-segment elevation is missed frequently and should be considered among the differentials in patients presenting with chest pain. Nitrates and/or calcium channel blockers along with avoidance of triggers can help in symptom management.

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram interpretation and repeat testing — supportive points: A normal or unchanged electrocardiogram (ECG) is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), decision-making should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG, and up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a normal ECG; when the initial ECG is normal or without ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, or ST depression, serial ECGs should be performed and the timing for repeat ECG should be guided by symptoms; when ST-elevation is present on the initial ECG, management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms, and if ST depression is identified on the initial ECG, management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines; a normal ECG may be associated with left circumflex or right coronary artery occlusions and posterior wall ischemia, therefore right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected; an initial normal ECG does not exclude ACS and patients with an initial normal ECG should have a repeat ECG if symptoms are ongoing until other diagnostic testing rules out ACS.

She was started on intravenous (IV) magnesium sulphate infusion as per the Zuspan regime (4 g slow IV bolus followed by 1 g/hour for 24 h) for maternal seizure prophylaxis and fetal neuro-protection. She received multiple push doses of IV hydralazine for blood pressure control and was eventually placed on hydralazine infusion at 1 mg/hour. In addition, she received oral nifedipine and oral alpha methyldopa. Two doses of betamethasone 12 mg were administered intramuscularly 24 h apart for fetal lung maturation. She also received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for thromboprophylaxis and the total fluid intake was maintained at 80 ml/hr. to minimize the risk of pulmonary oedema.

Thirty hours post-admission, she developed worsening orthopnea with severe sub sternal left sided chest pain radiating to the left axilla without symptoms of diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting. Her blood pressure was 138/82 mmHg, pulse rate of 64 beats per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry was 99% on room air. A chest x-ray revealed no features of pulmonary edema while an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a sinus rhythm with ST elevation in the anteroseptal leads (V1–4), Q waves in the septal leads (V1–2) and peaked T waves in V2–4 indicating an acute anteroseptal ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) (Fig. 1). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed wall motion abnormalities with interventricular septum and anterior wall hypokinesia. The left ventricle (LV) was dilated with an ejection fraction of 48% (Fig. 2). The right ventricular size was normal whereas the peak pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated at 50 mm/Hg. Lower extremity dopplers revealed no venous thrombus while an assay of cardiac enzymes revealed elevated Troponin I levels of 0.51 ng/ml (normal ≤ 0.04 ng/ml) and Creatinine Kinase -MB (CK-MB) levels of 54 IU/l (reference range 5–25 IU/l).

### Acute severe hypertension | NEJM resident 360… [^24c9c316]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published November 6, 2019 Blood-pressure elevations above 180/110 to 120 mm Hg can result in acute injury to the heart, brain, and the microvasculature. If acute hypertension-mediated target-organ damage is present, the condition is labeled "hypertensive emergency" and demands immediate and aggressive treatment to limit progressive injury. Read the Clinical Practice Article here. A: Most patients presenting with acute severe hypertension are already known to be hypertensive and have received treatment. Nonadherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications is the most common precipitating factor. Other common precipitating factors for acute severe hypertension include dietary sodium indiscretion; use of prescribed, over-the-counter, or illicit drugs; anxiety or panic; and acute stroke or heart failure, which can be both cause and consequence of severe hypertension. A: There are relatively few trials comparing different agents for hypertensive emergency and hypertensive urgency. Treatment is largely determined by an understanding of the pathophysiological features, the presence and type of target-organ injury, the availability and costs of medications, and physician experience with given agents. There is considerable variability in practice regarding the choice of medications. All patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and treated with intravenous antihypertensive drugs on the basis of the clinical scenario. In the United States, labetalol, nitroglycerin, nicardipine, hydralazine, and nitroprusside are the most commonly used agents.

Of these medications, hydralazine has unpredictable effects, often leads to excessive blood-pressure lowering, and should generally be avoided as a first option. A: Most patients without acute target-organ damage can be cared for as outpatients. Treatment with guideline-concordant long-acting medications should be started, reinstated, or adjusted, and follow-up should be scheduled within 1 to 7 days. In a study involving more than 500 patients presenting to an emergency department with severe hypertension, blood pressure fell to less than 180/110 mm Hg after 30 minutes of quiet rest in approximately one third of the patients. If quiet rest or control of anxiety or other precipitating factors is insufficient, an oral antihypertensive agent may be given. Intravenous medications are discouraged in this context.

Case 1: Early Presentation of Cardiac Toxicity

A 42-year-old woman with rectal carcinoma with no pre-existing CV disease or risk factors developed crushing chest pain across her precordium during the first infusional bolus dosing of 5-FU. ECG showed diffuse ST-segment elevation (Figure 1). She was treated with sublingual nitroglycerin, and her pain resolved. Troponin was negative. Urgent coronary angiography showed no epicardial CAD.

Diffuse ST-Segment Elevation From Coronary Vasospasm

Electrocardiogram showing diffuse ST-segment elevation during bolus 5-fluorouracil administration attributed to coronary artery vasospasm.

Coronary vasospasm from bolus dosing of 5-FU most often presents as classic sudden-onset chest pain during the first exposure with associated ECG changes that range from ST-segment elevation suggestive of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to nonspecific ST-T changes. Circulating troponin levels may or may not be elevated, and echocardiography may or may not show regional wall motion abnormalities. Because this event often occurs in an infusion suite, an appropriate diagnostic work-up is often executed in an expeditious manner (Figure 2).

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

Chest pain — synopsis of care setting goals and transport: The goals in patients presenting to the ED or office with acute chest pain are: 1) identifying life-threatening causes; 2) determine clinical stability; and 3) assess need for hospitalization versus safety of outpatient evaluation and management. The 12-lead ECG, which should be acquired and interpreted within 10 minutes of arrival to a medical facility, is pivotal in the evaluation because of its capacity to identify and triage patients with STEMI to urgent coronary reperfusion. In both cases, transfer should be by EMS; personal automobile for this purpose is associated with increased risk and should be avoided.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^33d330cf]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction — application of supplemental electrocardiogram leads states that supplemental leads and serial ECG recordings should be deployed with a very low threshold in patients with ischemic chest pain and a nondiagnostic initial ECG. Isolated ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1–V3 may indicate left circumflex occlusion, and posterior leads V7, V8, and V9 at specified positions are recommended to capture it; recording of these leads is strongly recommended when suspicion is high. For posterior leads, a cut-off point of 0.5 mm ST elevation is recommended in leads V7–V9, with specificity increased at a cut-off point ≥ 1 mm and this ≥ 1 mm cut-off should be used in men < 40 years old. For suspected right ventricular infarction, V4R and V3R may show ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm, and early recording of V3R and V4R should be performed since ST-elevation ≥ 0.5 mm (≥ 1 mm in men < 30 years old) provides supportive diagnostic criteria.

One of the most common complaints encountered in the emergency department is chest pain. In many evaluations, the leading diagnostic consideration is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary artery pathologies, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The distinction between subtypes of ACS guides acute diagnostic and management decisions. Failure to diagnose and manage ACS properly is a frequent cause of medico-legal litigation. In this article, we review the initial identification and critical management steps in patients presenting to the emergency department with ACS.

### Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a concerning electrocardiogram in the emergency department [^f736e8bf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a rare, complex phenotypic variant of the classically taught hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is highly variable in its pathophysiology as well as its clinical course, spanning the spectrum from a healthy asymptomatic lifestyle to sudden cardiac death and severe diastolic dysfunction. The hallmark electrocardiographic findings of unusually large T-wave inversions, in conjunction with the most common presenting symptom being chest pain, makes this disease entity concerning in the emergency department (ED) setting.

Case Report

A 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the ED with chest pain. His electrocardiogram exhibited a biphasic T wave in lead V2 with ST depressions in leads V3-V6 with deep symmetrical T-wave inversions in these leads as well. His troponin was negative and the patient was taken for cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed no coronary artery disease; however, it revealed a "spade like" filling pattern of the left ventricle, suggestive of an apical variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the patient was started on a beta-blocker and discharged with cardiology follow-up. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Electrocardiographic interpretation is a critical skill of the emergency physician. Awareness of the syndrome and its specific electrocardiogram findings may help facilitate further testing that will aid in timely diagnosis and interventions.

Diagnostic assessment and therapeutic intervention

When the patient was transported to his room, his blood pressure dropped, with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s. His point-of-care glucose level was 182 mg/dL. A dose of 0.3 mg of intramuscular epinephrine was given, leading to an improvement in blood pressure to 133/82 mm Hg. Subsequently, 125 mL of intravenous methylprednisolone and 40 mg of intravenous famotidine were given as adjunctive therapy. The patient also received 2 L of normal saline.

The patient's initial EMS ECG results were as follows: sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis, ST segment elevated present in leads V1 to V4, and no reciprocal ST depressions.

A repeat ECG at the time of the patient's arrival at the hospital (Fig 1) showed sinus rhythm with rate 94 beats per minute, normal intervals, and normal axis. ST elevations were present in leads V1 through V3. No reciprocal ST depressions were found.

Marked improvement was seen in the ST elevations previously seen in leads V1 to V3. Leads V1 and V2 showed minimal ST elevation, and the V3 ST elevation had completely resolved.

Fig 2
Improvement noted in ST elevations. Almost complete resolution of ST elevations in leads V1 and V3, with minimal elevation present in lead V2. The patient no longer meets the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) criteria.

In addition to ECGs, the patient had a workup significant for normal chest radiograph findings. The patient was found to have leukocytosis (14.4 × 10³ cells/μL). Mild hyponatremia of 134 mEq/L was present. His creatinine level was 1.69 mg/dL with a blood urea nitrogen level of 12 mg/dL. All of his liver function test results were normal. His troponin level was less than 0.02 ng/mL. His brain natriuretic peptide level was 654 pg/mL, which was mildly elevated. The patient had a normal partial thromboplastin time and normal prothrombin time and international normalized ratio.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^d3af32e5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic Dissection

The short‐term risk of dying immediately after the onset of dissection (particularly the type A) characterizes an aortic dissection as a medical emergency. BP is frequently high at presentation in the emergency setting because of the intense pain and because most patients have chronic hypertension, the primary cause of aortic syndromes. The rationale to lower BP in this context aims to reduce the wall tension and the shear stress, which promotes endothelial tearing and enhances the disruption of the media layer of the aorta.

Hypertension guidelines, and a recent reviewrecommend lowering systolic BP below 120 mm Hg in patients with aortic dissection, accompanied by heart rate reduction. These strategies were not and will not be tested in randomized controlled trials with major cardiovascular outcomes. Specific guideline provides a broader coverage of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, focusing primarily on the criteria to recommend medical, surgical, or percutaneous therapies.

### Reversible acute myocardial injury following air bag deployment [^2f983422]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

This case report is about a 62 year old woman who was involved in an accident while driving her car, during which the driver side air bag deployed. She experienced intense anterior chest pain that radiated to her left arm after the accident, but was otherwise well; there was no significant medical history. An electrocardiogram done one and half hours after admission revealed 1 mm ST segment elevation in leads V2 and V3 and troponin 1 level was raised. She underwent cardiac catheterisation but three months after the accident both ECG and echocardiographic studies were normal. It is suggested that she underwent cardiac contusion rather than a myocardial infarction.

Figure 9 — Diagnosis and treatment of severe hypertension and hypertensive emergency outlines an algorithm beginning with "SBP > 180 mm Hg or DBP > 120 mm Hg" and assessment for "Acute target organ damage?". If present, "Hypertensive emergency" is managed condition-specifically: for "Aortic dissection" "Reduce to < 120 mm Hg" and for "Pheochromocytoma crisis" "Reduce SBP < 140 mm Hg in the first hour"; if neither applies, "Reduce SBP by 25% in the first hour and to < 160/100–110 over the next 6 hours and to normal in the next 24–48 hours". If acute target organ damage is absent, management of severe hypertension includes "Evaluate INP vs OPT treatment depending on indication(s) other than BP alone", "Avoid parenteral BP lowering therapy or intensified oral therapy in the acute setting", and for outpatients "No need to refer to ED. Reinstitute and intensify or modify medical therapy in the OPT setting" with "Close follow-up in the OPT setting in 4 weeks".

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1df9b569]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Performance of emergency department screening criteria for an early ECG to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^336cce38]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite decades of quality‐improvement efforts, the timely diagnosis of STEMI patients in the ED presents significant operational challenges. In managing the timely care of patients with STEMI, EDs encounter 3 distinct types of patients who differ on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment continuum. First are patients who have been prediagnosed with STEMI, who have had an ECG performed and interpreted by another provider. They are usually transferred to an ED or a hospital capable of definitive treatment, most often percutaneous coronary intervention. The expectation is that treatment will be initiated on arrival. Second are prescreened patients who have been evaluated by another provider and referred to the ED with an ECG concerning for ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a repeat ECG or reinterpretation of the ECG on arrival. The burden of screening for STEMI from the report of symptoms has already been met in these 2 scenarios; however, treatment has not been initiated. Third are the patients at greatest risk of delays in care: those arriving in the ED with undifferentiated symptoms who are primarily screened by that ED. In these cases, timely STEMI diagnosis is dependent on the patient's condition and symptoms triggering ED intake staff to perform an early ECG. 4, 5 The ECG is often considered the screening test for STEMI. In the context of emergency care, however, treatment is initiated with ECG evidence of STEMI, making it a diagnostic test. 6 The true screening test is the criteria by which ED care providers initiate an ECG (Figure 2).

Overly comprehensive screening criteria for a rare disease like STEMI risks underutilization. The sole use of chest pain is user friendly but likely produces inadequate case capture. Overall, 20% to 30% of patients with STEMI will report atypical symptoms like shortness of breath and dizziness 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or will focus on associated symptoms like jaw, neck, or back pain. In addition, age positively influences the probability of STEMI, and elderly patients with STEMI more frequently report atypical symptoms. 12, 13, 14 Shorter time to reperfusion has been shown to improve outcomes. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Door‐to‐ECG time interval is the first STEMI care target toward achieving timely intervention.
