## Question

What is the recommended dosing of trazodone for insomnia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosing of trazodone for insomnia: its regulatory status, what credible guidelines recommend, practical dosing (including special populations), safety risks, and a reasoned bottom line if it is used off‑label anyway. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether trazodone is FDA‑approved for insomnia at all and what the labeled antidepressant doses are. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (AASM, VA/DoD, BAP) say about using trazodone for chronic insomnia. Next, I will examine what credible dosing data exist for specific subgroups (Alzheimer's disease, PTSD, hemodialysis) and what "typical" off‑label dosing looks like in general practice. After that, I need to review the safety profile, especially falls, QT risk, priapism, serotonin syndrome, and geriatric considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable plan emphasizing first‑line therapies and, if trazodone is used despite guidelines, a conservative dosing and monitoring approach, with appropriate citations at each step [^115nVK9V] [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory context. Trazodone is not FDA‑approved for insomnia; its labeled indication is major depressive disorder with typical total daily doses of 150–400 mg (up to 600 mg/day as an inpatient), so any use for sleep is off‑label. I almost said "approved for insomnia", but wait, that would be incorrect; I should stick to the label and SPL listings that show only MDD on‑label and list insomnia use as off‑label in certain contexts [^115nVK9V] [^117VsxBB].

> Next, I should review guideline positions so I don't jump to conclusions based on habit alone. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2017) recommends avoiding trazodone for the treatment of sleep onset or maintenance insomnia; I initially thought this was labeled as a strong recommendation, but hold on, let me verify the exact wording — either way, the direction is to avoid trazodone for chronic insomnia. The VA/DoD 2025 guideline likewise recommends avoiding trazodone for chronic insomnia disorder, and the British Association for Psychopharmacology (2019) emphasizes very low‑dose doxepin rather than trazodone for insomnia management. So, across major guidelines, trazodone is not endorsed for chronic insomnia treatment [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^114Fjp8c].

> I will now examine what dosing information exists despite this. For general insomnia, typical off‑label practice uses much lower doses than for depression, often 25–100 mg at bedtime, with many clinicians starting around 50 mg; in frail or older adults, some start at 12.5–25 mg to reduce adverse effects. Wait, let me verify the strength of this evidence — these ranges come from small trials, reviews, and pharmacology modeling, not high‑credibility insomnia RCTs. A 2018 pharmacology analysis supports the concept that low doses (around 50 mg) may saturate hypnotic targets, though that is indirect evidence, and a 2005 review emphasized limited efficacy data and notable tolerability issues, particularly in older adults. So "typical" practice exists, but it is based on lower‑credibility sources and should be framed cautiously [^116pwmwn] [^111PwWuE].

> Let me consider specific populations where better‑defined regimens exist. In Alzheimer's disease, 50 mg at bedtime is listed as the dose used for insomnia, and in PTSD, 50–200 mg at bedtime has been used for insomnia and nightmares. I should confirm dosing in hemodialysis: the Sleep‑HD randomized clinical trial used a starting dose of 50 mg nightly with optional titration to 100 mg for 6 weeks; effects on the Insomnia Severity Index were small and not clearly superior to placebo. Hold on, I should also check comparative safety in dialysis: a large cohort showed zolpidem initiation carried a higher 30‑day risk of hospitalized fall‑related fractures than trazodone; nonetheless, both agents carry fall risk. These subgroup data support conservative dosing and careful monitoring if used at all [^115F7UGq] [^115bbGo1] [^114euY96] [^116VLkhq] [^113YSmh5] [^115JdHfE].

> Now I need to evaluate safety, especially in older adults. Observational Medicare data show that older adults treated for insomnia have about a 2.3‑fold increased risk of falls versus controls, with the highest risks for benzodiazepines, followed by trazodone. All‑cause mortality at 12 months was also higher among treated patients, and among those who fell, mortality was greater with trazodone than some comparators, although confounding is possible in these nonrandomized data. I should double‑check next‑day impairment as well — sedation and cognitive/motor impairment are recognized risks in labeling. Bottom line: trazodone is not "benign" in older adults and fall risk is a recurrent signal across studies [^112TkbZm] [^111n9ba7] [^114KFTzg].

> I will now examine other important adverse effects and contraindications so I don't miss high‑consequence risks. Trazodone can cause orthostatic hypotension via alpha‑1 blockade, QT prolongation and torsade risk (including cases at doses of 100 mg/day or less), and rare priapism. It carries serotonin syndrome risk with other serotonergic drugs, discontinuation symptoms with abrupt stop, hyponatremia (notably in older adults), and can precipitate angle‑closure glaucoma in susceptible patients. Use caution in hepatic or renal impairment because these populations were not well studied. These issues argue for the lowest effective dose and vigilant monitoring if used off‑label for sleep [^111einms] [^115W2iXJ] [^116BtGi7] [^111J8czV] [^112yGdk4] [^111234Mv] [^11194sun].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions and absolute contraindications. Concomitant MAOIs are contraindicated, with a required 14‑day washout; avoid concurrent serotonergic agents when possible to reduce serotonin syndrome risk. CYP3A4 inhibitors can raise trazodone levels and may necessitate dose reduction, whereas inducers can lower levels. Alcohol and other CNS depressants have additive impairment with trazodone, so patients should be cautioned accordingly. These interaction checks are critical in polypharmacy, which is common in insomnia populations with comorbidities [^113jtRm3] [^111einms] [^116CoicR].

> Let me synthesize dosing if a clinician elects to use trazodone despite guideline recommendations. A conservative approach is to start 25–50 mg at bedtime, with a usual off‑label range of 25–100 mg nightly; in elderly or frail patients, consider 25 mg initially. If needed, titrate in small steps (for example, 25–50 mg) every 3–7 days based on response and tolerability; I should confirm where that interval comes from — strictly speaking, that cadence mirrors the antidepressant label's 3–4 day increments, adapted here for lower hypnotic‑range dosing. I should also ensure we cap the dose: do not exceed 100 mg nightly for insomnia purposes, given diminishing evidence, rising adverse‑effect risk, and that higher doses enter antidepressant territory without clear insomnia benefit. Special populations: Alzheimer's disease 50 mg qHS; PTSD insomnia/nightmares 50–200 mg qHS; hemodialysis 50 mg qHS with option to 100 mg as studied in Sleep‑HD. This preserves cautious practice while acknowledging the off‑label nature and limited efficacy signals [^115nVK9V] [^116VLkhq] [^115F7UGq] [^115bbGo1] [^114euY96] [^116pwmwn].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities so that the plan is clinically safe. Monitor for daytime sedation, cognitive slowing, orthostatic hypotension, and falls, especially in older adults; counsel about priapism and instruct urgent care if it occurs; review for serotonin‑syndrome symptoms with any serotonergic co‑prescriptions; consider baseline and follow‑up electrolytes (Na+, K+, Mg2+) and ECG if there are QT risk factors; and monitor for suicidality during initiation or dose changes per labeling. If stopping, taper gradually to mitigate discontinuation symptoms. These steps align with observed risks and labeling precautions [^112TkbZm] [^115W2iXJ] [^111einms] [^111J8czV] [^116BtGi7].

> But wait, what if we can avoid trazodone altogether as guidelines suggest? First‑line therapy for chronic insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT‑I). If short‑term pharmacotherapy is needed after CBT‑I failure or unavailability, guidelines prefer FDA‑approved hypnotics with evidence: very low‑dose doxepin for sleep maintenance per AAFP/BAP and AASM; and selected non‑benzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g., eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) per VA/DoD 2025 and AASM, with attention to sex‑specific dosing and rebound/taper considerations. A large network meta‑analysis also supports focusing on agents with better efficacy‑tolerability profiles. Choosing among these should be individualized to the insomnia phenotype and comorbidities [^114X6wdZ] [^114Fjp8c] [^115gibaN] [^117DcWoi] [^115YfXEG] [^1121JbMC] [^1139osmK] [^114XvfUB].

> Stepping back, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. There is no universally recommended dose of trazodone for general insomnia because efficacy is insufficient and major guidelines recommend against its use, with meaningful safety concerns — particularly in older adults. If a clinician nevertheless uses trazodone off‑label, keep doses low (generally 25–100 mg qHS, often starting 25–50 mg), titrate cautiously, avoid exceeding 100 mg for insomnia, and monitor closely for adverse effects and interactions, while prioritizing CBT‑I and FDA‑approved insomnia medications when pharmacotherapy is indicated [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c] [^112TkbZm] [^114X6wdZ] [^115nVK9V].

Trazodone is used off-label for insomnia [^115Kztou] at **low bedtime doses** (25–100 mg) [^116pwmwn] to harness sedative effects while minimizing antidepressant activity and adverse effects. Start at **25–50 mg qHS**, titrate by 25–50 mg every 3–7 days to a typical maximum of 100 mg qHS [^113YSmh5]; doses above 150 mg are rarely used for insomnia and increase adverse effects. Use caution in older adults [^112yGdk4] and those with hepatic [^11194sun] or renal impairment [^111234Mv], and avoid combining with MAOIs [^111einms] or using in patients with QT prolongation [^115W2iXJ]. Trazodone is **not first-line for insomnia** [^115Kztou] and should be reserved for patients with comorbid depression [^113iNNg7] or when other options are unsuitable [^1115Mv1c] [^1124aBXW].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Initial dose**: 25–50 mg orally at bedtime (qHS) [^1124aBXW] [^113YSmh5].
- **Titration**: Increase by 25–50 mg increments every 3–7 days based on response and tolerability.
- **Typical effective dose**: 50–100 mg qHS [^115F7UGq] [^116pwmwn] [^111GD1dw].
- **Maximum dose**: 150 mg qHS (rarely used due to increased adverse effects).

---

## Clinical considerations

### Patient-specific factors

- **Age**: Older adults are more susceptible to sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and falls; start at lower doses and titrate cautiously [^112yGdk4] [^112TkbZm].
- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease [^111einms], hepatic or renal impairment [^112yGdk4], or a history of priapism [^116pwmwn].
- **Concurrent medications**: Monitor for interactions with CNS depressants [^116CoicR], serotonergic agents [^116BtGi7], and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers [^116CoicR].

---

### Special populations

Elderly patients should start at **25 mg qHS** and be titrated slowly due to increased risks of sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and falls, while patients with **hepatic or renal impairment** require cautious dosing with consideration of lower doses because of altered metabolism and excretion [^11194sun] [^111234Mv] [^112yGdk4].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Trazodone is generally well tolerated at low doses [^114XvfUB], though adverse effects can occur. Common adverse effects include **sedation, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, orthostatic hypotension, and somnolence** [^115rweSM] [^114KFTzg]. Serious adverse effects include **priapism** [^116pwmwn], **QT prolongation** [^111einms], **serotonin syndrome** [^116BtGi7], and **hyponatremia** [^111J8czV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the **American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)** recommend against routine use of trazodone for insomnia due to limited evidence and potential adverse effects [^115Kztou] [^1115Mv1c], while the **British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP)** recommends low-dose sedating antidepressants, including trazodone, only for patients with coexisting mood disorders [^113iNNg7].

## Comparison with other insomnia medications

| **Attribute** | **Trazodone** | **Zolpidem** | **Eszopiclone** | **Doxepin** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Recommended dose | 25–100 mg qHS | 5–10 mg qHS | 1–3 mg qHS | 3–6 mg qHS |
| Efficacy | Moderate | High | High | Moderate |
| Safety profile | Moderate (sedation, orthostatic hypotension, priapism) | Moderate (sedation, cognitive impairment, dependence) | Moderate (sedation, cognitive impairment, dependence) | Moderate (sedation, anticholinergic effects) |

## Clinical scenarios for trazodone use

Trazodone may be considered for patients with **comorbid depression or anxiety**, as its antidepressant properties may benefit coexisting mood disorders [^1124aBXW]. It is also suitable for patients with a history of substance abuse because of its low abuse and dependence potential, and for those intolerant to benzodiazepines or Z-drugs who require an alternative hypnotic [^114VC2eW].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Efficacy**: Monitor sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep quality [^112JJKpB].
- **Safety**: Monitor for sedation, orthostatic hypotension, priapism, and serotonin syndrome [^115W2iXJ] [^116BtGi7].
- **Discontinuation**: Taper gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms and rebound insomnia [^111J8czV].

---

Trazodone is used off-label for insomnia [^115Kztou] at **low bedtime doses** (25–100 mg), typically starting at 25–50 mg qHS with titration by 25–50 mg every 3–7 days. It is **not first-line for insomnia** and should be reserved for patients with comorbid depression or when other options are unsuitable [^1115Mv1c].

### Evaluating the dose-dependent mechanism of action of trazodone by estimation of occupancies for different brain neurotransmitter targets [^116pwmwn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a drug that was introduced in the clinic almost 40 years ago. It is licensed to treat depression, but it is also commonly used off-label to treat insomnia. A recent study shows that it could be promising in preventing neurodegeneration in mice, and clinical trials to assess its possible beneficial effects on dementia and Alzheimer's disease are expected to start soon in humans. In this study, we describe the dose-dependent pharmacology of trazodone by carrying out pharmacokinetic simulations aiming to predict the brain concentrations of trazodone for different drug-dosing regimens and calculating occupancy for 28 different targets for which published trazodone-binding data are available. Our study indicates that low doses of trazodone (typically 50 mg daily) should suffice to block specific receptors responsible for the hypnotic effect, and to provide the protective effect against neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that could be beneficial in dementia. Higher doses are required for an antidepressant effect. The occupancy of specific receptors at therapeutic doses also explains peculiar side effects reported by patients treated with trazodone, such as dry mouth, hypotension, and priapism.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^111GD1dw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a hypnotic and antidepressant (pharmacologically, a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor), is used for management of insomnia and nighttime behavioral disturbances, irritability, agitation, and aggression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Trazodone has a favorable safety profile if administered in small doses and appears to stabilize circadian rhythms in individuals with AD. Because of its hypnotic properties, trazodone may be particularly useful in patients with nocturnal agitation.

There is growing interest in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to target agitation and aggression in dementia. A recent large randomized controlled trial found that citalopram significantly reduced agitation and caregiver distress compared to placebo, although worsening cognition and QT prolongation were significantly more common in the citalopram group (30 mg/day). Patients in the study were required to have treatment-requiring levels of agitation; those with major depression or psychosis requiring antipsychotics were excluded. Assessment of the 20 mg (the maximum dose recommended by the FDA in adults over 60) has not been conducted. Comparator studies indicate sertraline and citalopram are probably as effective as risperidone in treating agitation in dementia, especially among those with mild to moderate agitation severity.

Dextromethorphan/quinidine, a combination drug containing dextromethorphan, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist and high-affinity sigma-1 receptor agonist, and the antiarrhythmic agent quinidine, is the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of agitation in dementia.

### Effects of antidepressants on sleep [^1124aBXW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

In industrialized countries, approximately 6% of adults suffer from insomnia as a disorder, while as many as 50% may experience transient insomnia symptoms. Although insomnia is not regarded as a severe mental disorder, it shares many features with depression. To offer a patient effective treatment for insomnia, it is necessary to adopt a broader perspective that extends beyond the prescription of hypnotics. Treatment guidelines strongly recommend cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I) as the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder, with sleep-promoting drugs reserved for patients with insufficient response to CBT-I.

However, the use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia is very common in daily clinical practice. Besides benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem), sedative antidepressants are frequently used to treat insomnia. Due to the lack of methodologically sound randomized clinical trials in insomnia, only doxepin is approved by the FDA for treating sleep maintenance insomnia. Recent recommendations also discourage the use of drugs other than doxepin from this class for treating insomnia. Despite these recommendations, sedative antidepressants can be a valuable treatment option for insomnia when patients still require sleep-promoting drugs despite undergoing CBT-I therapy.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114FfDpd]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among older adults (i.e. age ≥ 65 years) and incur a substantial economic burden due to costs associated with subsequent fractures, hospital visits, and long-term care. In particular, medication-related falls or fractures are recognized as an important consideration for clinicians when initiating new pharmacotherapy in older adult patients. Clinical experts have published guidelines, such as the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria, to help inform treatment decisions. However, details on guideline use when treating certain conditions are scant.

Insomnia, a common sleep–wake disorder characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or both, is more prevalent among older adults, and they are more likely to be prescribed medication for insomnia treatment. Medication classes commonly used to treat insomnia — including benzodiazepines and z-drugs (i.e. non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem) — can have adverse effects that may pose elevated risks for older adults.

- **Benzodiazepine adverse effects**: Include cognitive and memory impairment, rebound insomnia upon cessation, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), falls, dependence, and addiction.
- **Z-drugs**: Are associated with next-day cognitive, memory, psychomotor, and balance impairments and risk of dependence and addiction.

Thus, these medications may be inappropriate for use in older adults, particularly those with a history of falls or fractures, due to unfavorable risk–benefit ratios.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^115TqMoV]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Falls are associated with a substantial economic burden. Depending on the severity of the fall, costs per fall can range from $1,596 to $10,913. Costs for fall-related hospitalizations can range from $10,052 to $42,840 (2010 USD). Total annual costs of insomnia in the US are estimated at $77 to $116 billion, with $75 to $100 billion of these costs being indirect. Thus, the present results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating a substantial public health burden and elevated direct medical costs associated with both insomnia treatment and falls.

Our study possesses strengths. Most importantly, we performed a comprehensive, large-scale analysis of the impact of treated insomnia on falls and other adverse outcomes among older adults. Our Medicare sample is highly generalizable, representing 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries in the US. We considered the most widely prescribed insomnia treatments, including low-dose trazodone, which is frequently used off-label to treat insomnia. We also employed multiple measures to maximize the specificity of our operational definitions, such as excluding patients receiving benzodiazepines with a concurrent diagnosis of anxiety.

### Eszopiclone for insomnia [^115SeQJV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a major public health issue affecting between 6% to 10% of the adult population in Western countries. Eszopiclone is a hypnotic drug belonging to a newer group of hypnotic agents, known as new generation hypnotics. It was marketed as being just as effective as benzodiazepines for this condition while being safer and having a lower risk for abuse and dependence. The aim of the review is to integrate evidence from randomized controlled trials and to draw conclusions on eszopiclone's efficacy and safety profile, taking methodological features and bias risks into consideration.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia compared to placebo or active control.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, and registry databases (WHO trials portal, ClinicalTrials.gov) with results incorporated from searches up to 10 February 2016. To identify trials not registered in electronic databases, we contacted key informants and searched reference lists of identified studies. We ran an update search (21 February 2018) and have placed studies of interest in awaiting classification/ongoing studies. These will be incorporated into the next version of the review, as appropriate.

- **Selection criteria**: Parallel group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing eszopiclone with either placebo or active control were included in the review. Participants were adults with insomnia, as diagnosed with a standardized diagnostic system.

### Eszopiclone [^1121JbMC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Rebound insomnia, defined as a dose-dependent temporary worsening in sleep parameters — such as latency, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings — compared with baseline following the discontinuation of treatment, is observed with both short- and intermediate-acting hypnotics.

Rebound insomnia following discontinuation of eszopiclone relative to placebo and baseline was examined objectively in a 6-week adult study on the first two nights of discontinuation (nights 45 and 46) following 44 nights of active treatment with 2 mg or 3 mg doses. In the eszopiclone 2 mg group, compared with baseline, there was a significant increase in wake after sleep onset (WASO) and a decrease in sleep efficiency, both occurring only on the first night after discontinuation of treatment. There were no changes from baseline noted in the eszopiclone 3 mg group on the first night after discontinuation; however, there was a significant improvement in latency to persistent sleep (LPS) and sleep efficiency compared with baseline following the second night of discontinuation.

Comparisons of changes from baseline between eszopiclone and placebo were also performed. On the first night after discontinuation of eszopiclone 2 mg, LPS and WASO were significantly increased, and sleep efficiency was reduced; there were no significant differences on the second night. On the first night following discontinuation of eszopiclone 3 mg, sleep efficiency was significantly reduced. No other differences from placebo were noted in any other sleep parameters on either the first or second night following discontinuation. For both doses, the discontinuation-emergent effect was mild and had the characteristics of the hypnotics' intended effects.

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms [^1173G8t9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant that blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

- **Discussion**: Trazodone is well-absorbed orally and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in individuals who are depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain relief may occur through mechanisms similar to those of venlafaxine. Additionally, delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. However, drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.

- **Conclusion**: Trazodone has a unique pharmacological profile, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence from cohort or randomized trials to guide its use.

### The treatment of chronic insomnia: Drug indications, chronic use and abuse liability. Summary of a 2001 new clinical drug evaluation unit meeting symposium [^114VC2eW]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

This paper summarizes a group of presentations and panel discussions on chronic insomnia at the 2001 NCDEU meeting. The discussions focused on the twin issues of efficacy and concerns of abuse liability with long-term hypnotic therapy. The panel concluded that insomnia may serve as an epidemiological marker for various difficulties, including accidents, increased health care utilization, and the subsequent development of major depression. Whether the treatment of insomnia will prevent these long-term problems has not yet been determined.

Since the mid-1980s, there has been a rapid rise in the off-label use of antidepressants, particularly trazodone, for treating insomnia. Some participants expressed concern about the lack of data supporting this practice, particularly the absence of dose-response and tolerance information, noting that the small amount of efficacy data available is not encouraging. Similarly, there is minimal data to support the use of antihistamines as sleep aids; their side effect profiles and interactions with other drugs may be underappreciated.

The limited data on nightly long-term usage of the newer non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, primarily of six months' duration, suggest an absence of tolerance. However, more data are needed for both nightly and non-nightly administration. Insomniacs tend to exhibit therapy-seeking rather than drug-seeking behavior, and patients without histories of drug abuse are unlikely to self-escalate the dosage of currently available hypnotics. There is fairly good agreement on the characteristics of an ideal hypn…

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^111J8czV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g. paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Potential for cognitive and motor impairment**: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.

- **Angle-closure glaucoma**: The pupillary dilation that occurs following the use of many antidepressant drugs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

- **Hyponatremia**: Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache.

### Effects of trazodone versus cognitive behavioral therapy in the insomnia with short sleep duration phenotype: a preliminary study [^116mp9jS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The insomnia with objective short sleep duration phenotype is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, physiological hyperarousal, and a blunted response to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). It remains unexamined whether insomnia with objective short sleep duration responds better to pharmacological treatment compared to CBT-I.

Participants included 15 patients with chronic insomnia (86.7% female), aged 45.3 ± 8.1 years. Eight patients were randomized to CBT-I and seven to trazodone. Patients were examined with two weeks of actigraphy, salivary cortisol, and the insomnia severity index at three time points (pretreatment, 3-month posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up). A mixed between-within-subjects analysis of variance and univariate analysis of covariance were conducted to assess the impact of trazodone and CBT-I on patients' total sleep time, salivary cortisol, and insomnia severity index scores across these time points.

Trazodone, but not CBT-I, significantly lengthened total sleep time (when measured with actigraphy) both at posttreatment (51.01 minutes vs. -11.73 minutes; p = 0.051; Cohen's d = 1.383) and at follow-up (50.35 minutes vs. -7.56 minutes; p = 0.012; Cohen's d = 1.725). Additionally, trazodone, but not CBT-I, showed a clinically meaningful decrease in salivary cortisol from pretreatment to posttreatment (-36.07% vs. -11.70%; Cohen's d = 0.793) and from pretreatment to follow-up (-21.37% vs. -5.79%; Cohen's d = 0.284). Finally, there were no differences in insomnia severity.

### Optimizing treatment for insomnia [^117Hf3YP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

By tailoring the mechanism of action and effects of therapy to the specific nature of each patient's insomnia and other conditions, clinicians can offer personalized care to achieve an improved risk-benefit ratio compared to a "one-size-fits-all" treatment strategy. To move toward personalization and optimization of treatment, clinicians need awareness of the specific effects of interventions and the subpopulations with insomnia who would benefit from each intervention. This report reviews insomnia treatments, focusing on effects associated with the mechanism of action.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^1155Sgec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Another limitation pertains to whether the observed trazodone effects are primarily mediated through slow-wave sleep (SWS) enhancement. In this study, quantified data of SWS were not available for correlating to the rate of cognitive decline. Additionally, it is possible that trazodone effects could be mediated through its antidepressant benefits. We do not believe the latter is the case, since trazodone is rarely, if ever, given as an antidepressant in our cohort. Moreover, antidepressant doses of trazodone are usually much higher than doses for insomnia that were prescribed for our participants, and often relate to carry-over cognitive deficits the following day, albeit less severe than those observed with certain other antidepressants. Nonetheless, a prospective study would be the optimal approach in controlling potential antidepressant-mediated cognitive benefits of trazodone.

An alternative possibility of the observed trazodone benefits could be explained by its possible neuroprotective effects via inhibition of the phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α signaling pathway of the unfolded protein response (eIF2 α -P/UPR). Specifically, in the MAPT P301L mouse model of tauopathy, trazodone use was associated with less memory deficits, preserved hippocampal neuronal counts, delayed gross brain atrophy, and prolonged survival. Interestingly, the eIF2 α -P/UPR pathway is also induced during sleep deprivation of wild type mice, providing an additional mechanistic explanation through which improving disturbances in sleep may be neuroprotective.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^115uCm4W]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

There are inherent limitations to our study, primarily due to its retrospective nature. Ideally, we would prospectively standardize medication dosage and timing, allocate participants randomly between groups, and monitor medication compliance across a predefined period. For example, benefits observed in the trazodone group may reflect better overall medical management by their physicians and delayed cognitive decline due to unaccounted factors. Possible adverse effects of trazodone were not explicitly reported during the assessment of participants' medication regimens.

It is thus possible there is a biased selection against individuals who tried but did not tolerate trazodone for inclusion in the trazodone group, but who could have been included in the trazodone non-user group. Such participants may be more resistant to achieving better sleep consolidation through SWS enhancers. Alternatively, there may be different metabolism of trazodone in these participants, given that prior work indicates its active metabolite may have different effects on alertness compared to trazodone itself, a possibility that personalized medicine may address.

Ultimately, optimal accounting for confounders necessitates prospective double-blind randomized trials to confirm that differential rates of cognitive decline are directly caused by trazodone. Such prospective studies, ideally incorporating interval cognitive evaluations, could also answer whether potential long-term trazodone benefits are due to continuous modulation of brain networks or other factors.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^112TkbZm]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

Relative to non-sleep disordered controls, the odds ratio (OR) for a fall event in the overall insomnia-treated cohort was 2.3 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.4). Relative to the control cohort, the hazard ratio (HR) for the first fall after the index date for the overall insomnia-treated cohort was 2.3 (95% CI: 2.23, 2.3). Each value was highest among patients receiving benzodiazepines, followed by trazodone. Note that OR and HR patterns for the overall treatment group and specific medications were quite similar.

- **Figures**:
	- **Figure 2a**: Odds ratio (OR) for fall events in the insomnia-treated cohort.
	- **Figure 2b**: Hazard ratio (HR) for fall events in the insomnia-treated cohort.

- **Mortality**:
	- Relative to non-sleep disordered controls, beneficiaries with treated insomnia were significantly more likely to experience all-cause mortality in the 12 months post-index (0.3% vs. 0.02%; p < 0.001). Among beneficiaries with treated insomnia who experienced a fall event, relative to non-sleep disordered controls, all-cause mortality was significantly more likely (prevalence 0.9% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001).

- **Medication impact**:
	- Patients receiving zolpidem ER, zolpidem IR, trazodone, or benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to experience all-cause mortality relative to the respective controls (all p < 0.001). Among individuals who experienced falls, relative to non-sleep disordered controls, patients receiving zolpidem IR, trazodone, or benzodiazepines were significantly more likely to experience all-cause mortality (p < 0.001). Further, in this population, all-cause mortality was greater among patients receiving trazodone (0.4%) than among patients receiving other treatments.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^116Eeu2B]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Recent studies reveal an association between slow-wave sleep (SWS), amyloid-β aggregation, and cognition. This retrospective study examines whether long-term use of trazodone, an SWS enhancer, is associated with delayed cognitive decline.

- **Methods**: We identified 25 regular trazodone users (mean age 75.4 ± 7.5; 9 women, 16 men) who carried a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or normal cognition. They were compared to 25 propensity-matched trazodone non-users (mean age 74.5 ± 8.0; 13 women, 12 men), accounting for age, sex, education, type of sleep deficit (hypersomnia, insomnia, parasomnia), diagnosis, and baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Longitudinal group differences in cognitive testing were evaluated through repeated measures tests over an average inter-evaluation interval of four years.

- **Results**: Trazodone non-users had a 2.6-fold faster decline in MMSE (primary outcome) compared to trazodone users, showing 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.48) versus 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50–0.90) points per year (p = 0.023). The observed effects were especially associated with subjective improvement of sleep complaints in post-hoc analyses (p = 0.0006). Secondary outcomes of other cognitive and functional scores had variable worsening in non-users and varied in significance when accounting for co-administered medications and multiple comparisons. Trazodone effects on MMSE remained significant within participants with AD-predicted pathology, with a 2.4-fold faster decline in non-users (p = 0.038).

These results suggest an association.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^115Ak6Tk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**:

	- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of trazodone's antidepressant action is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS). Trazodone is both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a 5HT2 receptor antagonist, although the net result of this action on serotonergic transmission and its role in trazodone's antidepressant effect is unknown.

	- **Pharmacodynamics**: Preclinical studies have shown that trazodone selectively inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin (Ki = 367 nM) and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT-2A (Ki = 35.6 nM) serotonin receptors. Trazodone is also an antagonist at several other monoaminergic receptors, including 5-HT2B (Ki = 78.4 nM), 5-HT2C (Ki = 224 nM), α1A (Ki = 153 nM), α2C (Ki = 155 nM) receptors and it is a partial agonist at 5-HT1A (Ki = 118 nM) receptor. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension.

	- **Pharmacokinetics**:

		- **Absorption**: In humans, trazodone hydrochloride is absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone hydrochloride is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration, and a lengthening in the time to maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when trazodone hydrochloride is taken on an empty stomach, or two hours after dosing when taken with food.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^111n9ba7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Among our 100% sample of Medicare beneficiaries, relative to non-sleep disordered controls, patients with treated insomnia demonstrated a 2.0- to 2.5-fold greater risk of falls. These results are consistent with and build upon previous studies showing a higher risk of falls among older adults treated for insomnia. In most analyses, relative to patients receiving zolpidem IR or zolpidem ER, patients receiving benzodiazepines demonstrated the greatest risk of falls, followed by patients receiving trazodone.

Increased risk of falls associated with benzodiazepines and zolpidem have been extensively reported in patients with insomnia. The risk is particularly salient among older adults, for whom sedative hypnotic medications are inappropriate per published guidelines. Consistent with prior reports, we found these potentially inappropriate medicines to be prescribed frequently among older adults.

### Treatment options for insomnia [^112snuw2]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The frequency of sleep disruption and the degree to which insomnia significantly affects daytime function determine the need for evaluation and treatment. Physicians may initiate treatment of insomnia at an initial visit; for patients with a clear acute stressor such as grief, no further evaluation may be indicated. However, if insomnia is severe or long-lasting, a thorough evaluation to uncover coexisting medical, neurologic, or psychiatric illness is warranted.

Treatment should begin with nonpharmacologic therapy, addressing sleep hygiene issues and exercise. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy. Exercise improves sleep as effectively as benzodiazepines in some studies and, given its other health benefits, is recommended for patients with insomnia.

Hypnotics generally should be prescribed for short periods only, with the frequency and duration of use customized to each patient's circumstances. Routine use of over-the-counter drugs containing antihistamines should be discouraged. Alcohol has the potential for abuse and should not be used as a sleep aid.

Opiates are valuable in pain-associated insomnia. Benzodiazepines are most useful for short-term treatment; however, long-term use may lead to adverse effects and withdrawal phenomena. The better safety profile of the newer-generation nonbenzodiazepines (i.e. zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone, and ramelteon) makes them better first-line choices for long-term treatment of chronic insomnia.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^113yYnec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Based on previous studies indicating a relationship between decreased slow-wave sleep (SWS), cognitive deficits, and amyloid-β pathology as revealed through molecular PET even in cognitively non-impaired individuals, we included a cognitively normal (CN) group in addition to the two patient groups. Longitudinal trazodone use was associated with delayed cognitive decline across diagnostic groups in our study, supporting its possible utility as a treatment from cognitively non-impaired to mildly-impaired patients. None of our patients had moderate or severe dementia to allow for inferences of trazodone use on more advanced disease.

The trazodone group's comparative delay in cognitive decline persisted when accounting for concomitant use of medications that modulate brain rhythms, such as stimulants and sedatives, which may signify trazodone's contribution to sleep-wake and ultradian rhythm consolidation towards delayed cognitive decline. However, when specifically accounting for cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEi) use, trazodone users did not significantly benefit in delayed cognitive decline compared to non-users. This particular finding does not fully detract from our hypothesis that trazodone use may delay cognitive decline, considering that there may be: 1) decreased statistical power when accounting for ChEi, 2) common mechanistic effects on sleep-wake rhythm consolidation between trazodone and ChEi, or 3) ceiling effects on cognitive outcomes for ChEi users. Specifically, ChEi users benefit from improved attention and alertness through enhancement of cholinergic transmission and may thus perform at ceiling throughout the follow-up period.

### Effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis: A randomized clinical trial [^116VLkhq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study Sleep-HD (trazodone) was published by Rajnish Mehrotra and colleagues in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in 2024. This study is related to insomnia and chronic kidney disease.

In the Sleep-HD (trazodone) study, the trial questioned the role of trazodone in patients undergoing hemodialysis with mild or moderate chronic insomnia. It was a multi-center, double-blinded randomized clinical trial. The population included 83 patients (41 female, 42 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing hemodialysis with an Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 10, experiencing sleep disturbances on ≥ 3 nights per week for ≥ 3 months. Key exclusion criteria included severe cognitive impairment, severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, alcohol or substance misuse, severe restless legs syndrome, pregnancy/lactation, and an anticipated life expectancy of less than 3 months.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Trazodone group (n = 42)**: Starting dose of 50 mg nightly, titrated to 100 mg for 6 weeks.
	- **Placebo group (n = 41)**: Matching placebo for 6 weeks.

- **Primary Outcome**: There was a borderline significant increase in the reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 7 (4.2 points vs. 3.1 points; AD 1.08 points, 95% CI -1.34 to 3.49).

- **Secondary Outcomes**: There was a borderline significant decrease in the reduction of the Insomnia Severity Index score at week 25 (4 points vs. 4.3 points; AD -0.34 points, 95% CI -3.17 to 2.49). No significant difference was noted in other secondary outcomes.

### The use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric insomnia in primary care: Rational approaches. A consensus meeting summary [^116DJasT]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric insomnia in primary care was the focus of a consensus meeting, aiming to formulate a rational approach to pharmacologic treatment and develop clinical guidelines regarding indications, target populations, and parameters for these medications, especially in community-based pediatric settings.

- **Objectives**: To formulate a rational approach to the pharmacologic treatment of pediatric insomnia and to develop clinical guidelines regarding indications, target populations, and parameters for the use of these medications, especially by community-based pediatricians.

- **Participants**: A multidisciplinary task force developed under the auspices of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which included experts in pediatric sleep medicine, psychiatry, pharmacology, neurology, and general pediatrics.

- **Evidence**: Review of existing data regarding the use of over-the-counter and prescription medications for pediatric insomnia in primary care practice, and of empirical data on the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and tolerability of medications commonly used for the treatment of pediatric insomnia.

- **Consensus process**: Group consensus definition of pediatric insomnia and clinical guidelines; working group recommendations regarding special populations and future directions.

- **Conclusions**: Use of medications for pediatric insomnia should be diagnostically driven and implemented in conjunction with empirically-based behavioral treatment strategies and adequate sleep hygiene. Specific target populations include children with neurodevelopmental disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, chronic medical conditions, and psychiatric disorders. Additional research, including clinical trials, is critically needed to provide an evidence-based approach to the use of these medications in clinical practice.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^115nVK9V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Dose selection**: An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dosage should be initiated at a low dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e. more severely depressed patients) may be given up to, but not in excess of, 600 mg/day in divided doses. Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

- **Administration instructions**: Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line. They should be taken shortly following a meal or light snack.

- **Screen for bipolar disorder prior to starting trazodone hydrochloride tablets**: Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Switching to or from monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant**: At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of trazodone hydrochloride tablets.

### Electroconvulsive therapy and cardiovascular complications in patients taking trazodone for insomnia [^116znRY6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Trazodone has been used widely to treat insomnia in depressed patients. When used in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), trazodone has been suspected to cause cardiovascular side effects.

- **Method**: A retrospective study was conducted involving 100 patients who received ECT with trazodone. One patient was excluded because permission to review the patient's records had not been given. The remaining 99 patients were matched with control ECT patients.

- **Results**: No statistically significant between-group differences were identified in cardiovascular side effects, although a trend toward more orthostatic hypotension was observed in patients taking trazodone.

- **Conclusion**: Administering low-dose trazodone for insomnia in conjunction with ECT does not appear to increase cardiovascular complications. The true incidence of adverse cardiac events was not higher than 3.66% at a 95% confidence level.

### Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation and the risk of fall-related fractures among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^115JdHfE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, and trazodone, a sedating antidepressant, are the most common medications used to treat insomnia in the United States. Both drugs have side effect profiles (e.g. drowsiness, dizziness, and cognitive and motor impairment) that can heighten the risk of falls and fractures. Despite widespread zolpidem and trazodone use, little is known about the comparative safety of these medications in patients receiving hemodialysis, a vulnerable population with an exceedingly high fracture rate.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Using data from the United States Renal Data System registry (2013–2016), we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between the initiation of zolpidem versus trazodone therapy and the 30-day risk of hospitalized fall-related fractures among Medicare-enrolled patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We used an active comparator new-user design and estimated 30-day inverse probability of treatment-weighted hazard ratios and risk differences. We treated death as a competing event.

- **Results**: A total of 31,055 patients were included: 18,941 zolpidem initiators (61%) and 12,114 trazodone initiators (39%). During the 30-day follow-up period, 101 fall-related fractures occurred. Zolpidem versus trazodone initiation was associated with a higher risk of hospitalized fall-related fracture (weighted hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.63; weighted risk difference, 0.17%; 95% confidence interval, 0.07% to 0.29%).

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^111nwviQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

In this national Medicare administrative claims data study, older adult beneficiaries taking common insomnia medications demonstrated a significantly elevated risk of falls, all-cause mortality, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and costs compared with non-sleep disordered controls. In addition to highlighting adverse outcomes associated with common insomnia treatments, our most novel findings pertain to substantial risks associated with trazodone, which is often perceived as a safe, albeit off-label, approach to insomnia medication treatment. Note, however, as this study was observational and not a randomized controlled trial, the results show association and not causality. Specifically, residual confounding due to potential misclassification of medication exposure and lack of availability of clinical variables such as severity of insomnia and other underlying illnesses cannot be ruled out.

This study's findings are consistent with two previous studies among older adults which suggested increased risk of falls associated with trazodone use and a comparable risk of fall-related injury associated with the use of low-dose trazodone or benzodiazepines. Very few studies have examined the impact of trazodone in insomnia, particularly among older adults. Roth and colleagues conducted a small, placebo-controlled study and found trazodone to be associated with impairments in next-day balance and arm muscle strength among older adults with insomnia. Low-dose trazodone is commonly prescribed off-label for insomnia, yet it remains understudied and controversial. Indeed, the most common side effects associated…

### A review of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of trazodone in insomnia [^111PwWuE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, is currently the second most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating qualities. Given trazodone's widespread use, a careful review of the literature was conducted to assess its efficacy and side effects when given for the treatment of insomnia.

- **Data sources**: In April 2003, a MEDLINE search was conducted using the search terms trazodone and insomnia, and trazodone and sleep, restricted to 1980–2003, human subjects, and English language. As trazodone has been implicated in cardiac disorders, a further search was conducted using the terms cardiac and trazodone.

- **Study selection**: All clinical trials that measured any endpoint for insomnia efficacy were included in the assessment. A total of 18 studies were identified from the literature search. In addition, commonly used texts were consulted for information regarding adverse effects related to trazodone.

- **Data extraction**: Because so few studies were identified by the literature search, all were evaluated and described.

- **Data synthesis**: Evidence for the efficacy of trazodone in treating insomnia is very limited; most studies are small, conducted in populations of depressed patients, raise issues of design, and often lack objective efficacy measures. Side effects associated with trazodone are not inconsequential, with a high incidence of discontinuation due to side effects such as sedation, dizziness, and psychomotor impairment, which raise particular concern regarding its use in the elderly. There is also some evidence of tolerance.

### Risk of psychiatric disorders in patients with chronic insomnia and sedative-hypnotic prescription: A nationwide population-based follow-up study [^115uS45X]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Previous epidemiological studies have established insomnia as a major risk factor for mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. However, the associations between insomnia with sedative-hypnotic prescriptions and various psychiatric disorders have not been thoroughly examined. This study involved evaluating the risk of psychiatric disorders, namely schizophrenia, mood, anxiety, somatoform, and substance-related disorders, over a six-year follow-up period in three groups: patients with insomnia and sedative-hypnotic prescriptions (Inso-Hyp), those with insomnia and without sedative-hypnotic prescriptions (Inso-NonHyp), and those with neither insomnia nor sedative-hypnotic prescriptions (NonInso-NonHyp).

- **Methods**: We used a historical cohort study design to compare the risk of psychiatric disorders among the three groups. Data regarding these patients were derived from reimbursement claims recorded in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare the six-year risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders among the Inso-Hyp, Inso-NonHyp, and NonInso-NonHyp groups.

- **Results**: Compared with the Inso-NonHyp and NonInso-NonHyp group patients, the Inso-Hyp group patients exhibited a higher risk of psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorders (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 7.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.31–10.89 and AHR: 14.69; 95% CI: 11.11–19.43, respectively). Moreover, among the Inso-Hyp patient group, insomnia prescribed with benzodiazepine, a longer duration of sedative-hypnotic action.

### Comparative effects of pharmacological interventions for the acute and long-term management of insomnia disorder in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114XvfUB]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacological interventions can all be effective for insomnia. However, due to inadequate resources, medications are more frequently used worldwide. We aimed to estimate the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for the acute and long-term treatment of adults with insomnia disorder.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and websites of regulatory agencies from database inception to Nov 25, 2021, to identify published and unpublished randomized controlled trials. We included studies comparing pharmacological treatments or placebo as monotherapy for the treatment of adults (≥ 18 years) with insomnia disorder. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (i.e. quality of sleep measured by any self-rated scale), treatment discontinuation for any reason and due to side effects specifically, and safety (i.e. number of patients with at least one adverse event) both for acute and long-term treatment. We estimated summary standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects.

- **Findings**: We included 170 trials (36 interventions and 47,950 participants) in the systematic review and 154 documents.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^111sLA1o]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone, a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine, was developed in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories. It was approved for medical use in December 1981 in the US by the FDA as an anti-depressant medication under the name Desyrel. However, trazodone is less effective as an anti-depressant compared to many other agents. Due to its extensive use outside the US prior to approval, the drug had a relatively short patent life and became generic in 1986. Consequently, there was a lack of pharmaceutical industry support for extensive research on this drug.

Despite commercial challenges, clinical experiences soon demonstrated several beneficial effects of trazodone. It is unique in its effects on sleep, increasing the deeper stages of slow-wave sleep (SWS) early in the sleep cycle and delaying rapid eye movement (REM) onset. Numerous studies support the use of trazodone for insomnia. It is among the top two drugs prescribed off-label, usually for insomnia. Additionally, trazodone is beneficial and widely used for anxiety, and it is considered highly effective for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), likely due to its effects on sleep. Although tested for potential benefits in alleviating agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex, multi-center study design did not show a statistically significant benefit over other interventions, despite reports of its usefulness in managing agitation in dementia and PTSD. In 2015, 27.6 million prescriptions for trazodone were filled in the US.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^111HAwFh]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Participant selection is illustrated in Figure 1. The flow chart outlines participant selection from the UCSF Memory and Aging Center research volunteer cohort, based on reported sleep disturbances (insomnia, hypersomnia, or parasomnia), diagnostic group, available medication data, and reported trazodone use. Propensity matching was implemented considering age, sex, education, type of sleep disturbance, diagnostic group, and baseline MMSE.

Table 1 presents demographics at baseline visit. CN stands for cognitively non-impaired; MCI refers to mild cognitive impairment; AD denotes Alzheimer's dementia; and MMSE is Mini-Mental State Examination. Pearson χ² and Mann-Whitney tests were used for non-parametric measures, and t-tests were used for parametric measures.

We further wanted to account for moderation effects on outcome measures of the inter-evaluation interval secondary to natural disease progression. For trazodone users, baseline and final evaluations reflected the first and last visits with reported trazodone use. For trazodone non-users, these time points were the first and last visits with available medication data. We anticipated that follow-up intervals would not be identical for paired participants in the two groups, in order to allow for propensity matching of inter-evaluation intervals, and thus planned our analysis a-priori with inter-evaluation intervals as a covariate. The interval between baseline and final visits was indeed different between the two groups (mean ± SD; trazodone users: 3.1 ± 1.9 years, non-users: 5.1 ± 2.8 years; p = 0.013) and interval effects were accounted for in all analyses.

### Prescription medications for the treatment of insomnia and risk of suicide attempt: A comparative safety study [^116gcJHk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of chronic insomnia in adults recognize that trazodone and other off-label medications are commonly prescribed despite poor evidence. The Department of Veterans Health Affairs (VA) fills high volumes of inexpensive, over-the-counter sedating antihistamines and older antidepressants in addition to benzodiazepines and zolpidem. Yet little is known about the comparative safety of these agents with regard to suicidal behavior.

The objective of the study was to assess the comparative effectiveness of the safety of medications routinely used to treat insomnia in VA. The design utilized comparative effectiveness using propensity score-matched samples.

The setting was within the VA, focusing on VA patients without any history of suicidal ideation or behavior 12 months prior to first exposure.

Exposures were identified using VA formularies and data to identify prescriptions for insomnia. Agents accounting for at least 1% of total insomnia fill volume included less than 200 mg trazodone, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, zolpidem, lorazepam, diazepam, and temazepam. Exposure was defined as an incident monotherapy exposure preceded by 12 months without any insomnia medications. Subjects with insomnia polypharmacy or cross-overs in the 12 months following first exposure were excluded.

The main outcome and measure was suicide attempts within 12 months of first exposure.

Results showed that 348,449 subjects met criteria and three well-balanced cohorts by drug class matched to zolpidem were created. After adjusting for days' supply, mental health history, and pain.

### Current, emerging, and newly available insomnia medications [^115yN292]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Research into the sleep-wake cycle has provided new treatment targets for patients with insomnia, as well as a better understanding of how medications affect sleep processes. Insomnia medications, including benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, focus on enhancing sleep-promoting systems through broad antagonism of GABA. Other medications that promote sleep by blocking wake-promoting systems include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antihistamines; however, adverse effects and nonspecific therapeutic effects limit their use.

New and emerging insomnia medications are focusing on blocking wake-promoting systems via more selective antagonism of orexin, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These medications may offer improved efficacy with fewer adverse effects.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia [^115tVjP6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. Reasons for preferential prescription of these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may include a desire to treat concurrent sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication, and/or an attempt to avoid hypnotic drugs due to their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed to treat insomnia. In addition, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles themselves.

Here we review the pertinent research studies published in recent years on antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate in the treatment of sleep issues in specific well-defined populations.

### Effectiveness of sequential psychological and medication therapies for insomnia disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^114KKw9i]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the evidence of efficacious psychological and pharmacologic therapies for insomnia, there is little information about what first-line treatment should be and how best to proceed when initial treatment fails. The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of four treatment sequences involving psychological and medication therapies for insomnia and examine the moderating effect of psychiatric disorders on insomnia outcomes.

In a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial, patients were assigned to first-stage therapy involving either behavioral therapy (BT; n = 104) or zolpidem (n = 107). Patients who did not remit received a second treatment involving either medication (zolpidem or trazodone) or psychological therapy (BT or cognitive therapy [CT]). The study took place at Institut Universitaire en Santé Mentale de Québec, Université Laval, Québec City, Québec, Canada, and at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado. Enrollment of patients occurred from August 2012 through July 2017.

The primary endpoints were the treatment response and remission rates, defined by the Insomnia Severity Index total score. The results showed that the patients included 211 adults (132 women; mean [SD] age, 45.6 [14.9] years) with chronic insomnia disorder, including 74 patients with a comorbid anxiety or mood disorder. First-stage therapy with BT or zolpidem produced equivalent weighted percentages of responders (BT, 45.5%; zolpidem, 49.7%; OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.60–2.33) and remitters (BT, 38.03%; zolpidem, 30.3%).

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112JJKpB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clinical practice recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is clinically indicated. Unlike previous meta-analyses, which focused on broad classes of drugs, this guideline focuses on individual drugs commonly used to treat insomnia. It includes drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, as well as several drugs commonly used to treat insomnia without an FDA indication for this condition. This guideline should be used in conjunction with other AASM guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of four experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, and patient values and preferences. Literature reviews are provided for those pharmacologic agents for which sufficient evidence was available to establish recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Recommendations**: The following recommendations are intended as a guideline for clinicians in choosing a specific pharmacological agent for the treatment of chronic insomnia in adults, when such treatment is indicated. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that…

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^112yGdk4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Reported clinical literature and experience with trazodone have not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. However, as experience in the elderly with trazodone hydrochloride is limited, it should be used with caution in geriatric patients. Serotonergic antidepressants have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Renal impairment**: Trazodone has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Trazodone has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^113PERcJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death among older Americans. While some research has found that insomnia heightens falls, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and costs, the impact of insomnia treatments on fall risk, mortality, HCRU, and costs in the elderly population, which could be of substantial interest to payers, has not been fully elucidated. This study evaluated the risk of falls and related consequences among adults aged 65 years or older treated with common prescription medications for insomnia compared with non-sleep disordered controls.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of deidentified Medicare claims from January 2011 through December 2017. Medicare beneficiaries treated for insomnia receiving zolpidem extended-release, zolpidem immediate-release, trazodone, or benzodiazepines were matched with non-sleep disordered controls. The main outcomes were falls, mortality, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and medical costs during the 12 months following the earliest fill date for the insomnia medication of interest. Generalized linear models controlled for several key covariates, including age, race, sex, geographic region, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score.

- **Results**: The study included 1,699,913 Medicare beneficiaries (59.9% female, mean age 75 years). Relative to controls, adjusted analyses showed that beneficiaries receiving insomnia medication experienced over twice as many falls (odds ratio [OR] = 2.34, 95% CI: 2.31–2.36). In adjusted analyses, patients receiving benzodiazepines or trazodone had the greatest risk.

### Falls, healthcare resources and costs in older adults with insomnia treated with zolpidem, trazodone, or benzodiazepines [^114zMxGv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This national analysis of 100% Medicare claims examined outcomes for older adult patients treated with commonly prescribed medications for insomnia, such as benzodiazepines, trazodone, zolpidem IR, and zolpidem ER. Compared with non-sleep disordered controls, treated adult patients demonstrated a significantly increased risk of falls, all-cause mortality, and adverse economic outcomes. Although prescribers may perceive trazodone as a lower-risk alternative for the treatment of insomnia, this study's findings suggest that trazodone, like benzodiazepines and zolpidem, is associated with a higher risk of falls and increased healthcare resource utilization compared to controls.

Risk varied by insomnia medication, with benzodiazepines and trazodone typically associated with the worst outcomes. It is important to note that this was an observational study rather than a randomized controlled trial, so the results are associative rather than causal. Future research should focus on identifying patients at greatest risk of adverse outcomes from commonly prescribed insomnia treatments and matching these individuals with safe, effective alternatives. These results highlight the necessity for insomnia treatments suitable for older adults with insomnia that do not increase the risk of falls.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: Trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^115HXYsL]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Trazodone has been used in the US since 1981, providing substantial knowledge about its benefits and side effects. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, which may be associated with postural hypotension. It also causes sedation and can lead to uncomfortable feelings. Trazodone is primarily metabolized in liver microsomes, meaning patients with liver damage are more sensitive to this medication and should be prescribed lower doses. The half-life of trazodone is 3 to 5 hours. Due to variability in potency and side effects, dosing must be done cautiously for each patient (start low: 12.5 mg at bedtime; increase slowly: 12.5 mg increments).

Trazodone has minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors, unlike older antidepressant medications. Patients who adjust their dosing according to therapeutic guidance experience higher quality sleep than with GABA agonists (e.g. benzodiazepines), anticholinergics, or antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine), which are widely used but impair cognitive function in the short term and are now considered contributors to the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease pathology in the long term.

Trazodone has a generally positive effect on sexual desire and male erectile function; however, it is known to cause priapism, an emergency condition, like medications used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is estimated that abnormal erectile function occurs in about one in 6,000 male patients, primarily younger, treated with trazodone.

### Burden of insomnia and sleep disturbances and the impact of sleep treatments in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease: A structured literature review [^117NPUD3]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

- **Antidepressants**: A small study by Camargos et al. found that trazodone 50 mg increased sleep duration and efficiency in AD patients versus placebo, was well-tolerated, and did not increase daytime sleepiness. Petrescu et al. also reported that patients taking trazodone (50–200 mg) had more total sleep time in both patient- and nurse-reported measures, although it was associated with more side effects than quetiapine. Interestingly, trazodone may have a possible neuroprotective effect in AD patients with insomnia; a retrospective study by La et al. reported that among a group of older adults, including some with AD, those not using trazodone declined 2.4-fold faster than trazodone users (median dose 50 mg) across an average of 3.75 years based on MMSE results. Notably, while trazodone is an antidepressant, a dose of 50 mg is consistent with use for insomnia, rather than depressive disorders. A small study assessing the antidepressant mirtazapine reported no effects on sleep outcomes in AD patients.

- **Antipsychotics**: A five-year study by Yin et al. reported improved daytime (ESS) and nighttime (PSQI) sleep symptoms with low-dose risperidone versus zolpidem tartrate, melatonin, or no drug treatment in AD patients with sleep disturbances. Risperidone also alleviated neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI) versus no treatment and did not significantly affect cognition or functional autonomy versus zolpidem, melatonin, or no treatment, suggesting no acceleration in mental deterioration. Risperidone was also associated with a significant improvement in caregiver mood and sleep.

### Sleep-HD trial: Short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113YSmh5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The site investigators will prescribe trazodone (50–100 mg) or a corresponding medication placebo to the study participants randomized to the respective arms. The dose range selected for the trial (50–100 mg) is guided by prior studies with trazodone. The starting dose for trazodone will be 50 mg, and if, after the end of the first or second week of treatment, the participants report inadequate improvement in sleep, they will have the option to increase the dose to 100 mg. The dose achieved by the end of week 3 will be maintained for the remaining 3 weeks.

- **Drug procurement and dispensation**: Prior to launching the clinical trial, the Investigational Drug Services at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where the PI is based, will procure 50-mg tablets of trazodone from the same manufacturing stock for both clinical sites and prepare a matching placebo. The medications will be dispensed as per the protocol by the Investigational Drug Services at each site, and the study coordinators will hand the study drug to the participants at the dialysis facility when they arrive for their routine HD treatments. This will occur once during week 1, where a 3-week supply of the drug will be provided (with capacity to increase the dose to 100 mg starting week 2), and at week 4, where a 3-week supply of the drug for the dose being taken during weeks 4, 5, and 6 will be provided.

- **Monitoring drug adherence**: The participants will be asked to return the medication bottles for study drug at week 4 and week 7, and the coordinators will perform a pill count to assess adherence with the medication.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: A potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^115fKCEM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The study investigates the effects of trazodone use on cognitive outcomes. Specifically, the effects on the primary outcome, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), were analyzed between 25 trazodone users and 25 non-users over an inter-evaluation interval of 4.12 years. Error bars in Figure 2 indicate the standard error of the mean.

- **Trazodone effects on secondary outcomes**:
	- **Abbreviations**: CVLTII denotes the California Verbal Learning Test – Second Edition; CVLT is the California Verbal Learning Test; CDR-SB stands for the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes; SEM is the Standard Error of the Mean.
	- a Between-group statistical significance was assessed before Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; however, all results were non-significant after correction.
	- b The CVLT was administered to participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnoses, and CVLTII was administered to cognitively normal (CN) participants.

Additionally, Figure 3 illustrates that the effects of trazodone use on MMSE are dependent on sleep symptom severity at baseline and their longitudinal improvement. Post-hoc analyses showed variations in trazodone effects on longitudinal MMSE performance among users and non-users when accounting for: (A) presence or (B) absence of sleep complaints at baseline evaluation, and (C) changes in sleep complaints (improvement, worsening, or stability) between baseline and final evaluations. The MMSE inter-evaluation interval remained at 4.12 years, and error bars represent the standard error of the mean.

Secondary outcomes, including processing speed, disability scores, and visual recall, also deteriorated more rapidly in trazodone non-users. However, none of these results maintained significance after correcting for multiple comparisons. A noticeable trend suggests trazodone was beneficial, despite all but three secondary outcomes demonstrating no statistical significance.

### Treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder with trazodone: report of 3 cases [^113wWiqK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a sleep disturbance characterized by the absence of regular paralysis during rapid eye movement sleep, accompanied by dream enactment behavior. The available pharmacotherapy options for treating RBD are limited, and the utilization of antidepressants has yielded mixed results. We report three cases of isolated RBD improved with trazodone. Doses of 50–100mg of trazodone at bedtime over 4–6 months resulted in significant clinical improvement. These cases highlight that trazodone could serve as a treatment for isolated RBD that does not respond to traditional treatments at submaximal dosages.
