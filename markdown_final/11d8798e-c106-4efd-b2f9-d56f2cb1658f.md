## Question

Treatment for yeast in skin folds

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and treating yeast infections in skin folds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing candidal intertrigo from mimics. Then, I should verify first-line topical therapy choices and dosing. Next, I will consider when to escalate to systemic therapy and what dose to use. After that, I need to check for bacterial superinfection and how to treat it. I will then examine special populations and red flags that change management. Finally, I should review prevention, follow-up, and what to do if the patient does not improve as expected, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions. Candidal intertrigo typically presents with beefy-red, macerated plaques in moist, opposing skin folds, often with satellite pustules; KOH preparation showing pseudohyphae supports the diagnosis, and culture can be reserved for refractory or atypical cases, so I should verify these features before labeling it as yeast [^112UoMMy] [^112UoMMy]. Hold on, I should also consider mimics such as inverse psoriasis, tinea cruris, bacterial intertrigo, and even cutaneous mucormycosis in immunocompromised hosts, because misclassification delays appropriate therapy and can be dangerous in high-risk patients [^112PSGX4] [^112KkZwF].

> Next, I should review predisposing factors because they guide both treatment and prevention. Obesity, diabetes, recent antibiotics, immunosuppression, and occlusion from clothing or incontinence increase risk; addressing these drivers improves outcomes and reduces recurrence, so I need to ask about them explicitly and plan mitigation steps such as weight management, glycemic control, and minimizing moisture and friction [^116G8SKE] [^112UoMMy].

> For first-line therapy, I will now examine topical antifungals. Wait, let me verify the preferred agents and frequency. IDSA-endorsed options include azoles like clotrimazole or miconazole and the polyene nystatin; applying twice daily until resolution is reasonable, with many patients improving within 48–72 hours, though I should treat for about 1–2 weeks to reduce recurrence risk [^117WHEPy] [^114j2aUY]. I should confirm that no single topical agent is clearly superior, so cost, tolerability, and patient preference can guide selection, and I must avoid systemic therapy in uncomplicated, localized disease unless there is a compelling reason [^114Ka8p4].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation nuances in moist folds. Very moist lesions may benefit from a drying powder such as nystatin powder applied two to three times daily until healed, which helps reduce maceration and friction while delivering antifungal therapy; creams can be used once the area is drier or if powder is impractical [^114ymGnG] [^112UoMMy]. I need to ensure patients apply a thin layer and smooth it in well to avoid trapping excess moisture, especially in intertriginous sites [^114j2aUY].

> Let me consider combination therapy with a topical steroid. The nystatin–triamcinolone combination is FDA-approved for cutaneous candidiasis and may provide faster symptomatic relief in inflamed, pruritic lesions, but I should confirm that this is short-term use only and not a substitute for antifungal monotherapy. Moreover, some contemporary data question routine steroid combinations, so I should reserve them for short courses when inflammation is prominent and reassess promptly [^112oBVP6] [^113c6Wci] [^1157zBif].

> I should double-check when to escalate to systemic therapy. Indications include extensive involvement, failure of appropriate topical therapy after about 2 weeks, severe pain or functional impairment, or immunocompromise. In those scenarios, fluconazole 100–200 mg orally once daily for 7 days is a guideline-supported regimen, with consideration of higher dosing in obesity or severe disease, and I should monitor for hepatotoxicity if treatment extends beyond three weeks or if the patient has hepatic comorbidity [^117QihLd]. But wait, what if there is concern for non-albicans species or resistance? Fluconazole remains first-line for most C. albicans, but if there is azole-refractory disease or concern for C. glabrata or C. krusei, I should verify culture results and consider alternatives accordingly [^116eh8Qj].

> Next, I should review bacterial superinfection, because macerated intertrigo often becomes secondarily infected. If there is malodor, crusting, or rapid progression, I need to check for corynebacterial or streptococcal involvement. Topical mupirocin for streptococci and oral erythromycin for corynebacteria are reasonable, and in severe cases I should obtain bacterial culture to guide therapy and avoid missing MRSA or other pathogens [^112UoMMy]. Hold on, I should verify that antifungal therapy alone will not suffice when bacterial infection is present, so combined therapy is appropriate in those cases [^112UoMMy].

> I will now examine special populations and red flags. In immunocompromised patients, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for molds such as mucormycosis or aspergillosis when lesions are painful, ulcerated, indurated, or fail to respond to standard candida therapy. Early biopsy with fungal culture and tissue pathology is critical, and delays in appropriate antifungal therapy or surgical debridement increase mortality, so I must not anchor on candida in this context [^112PSGX4] [^112KkZwF] [^1125oCLh]. For neonates with congenital cutaneous candidiasis, especially preterm or low birth weight infants, I should confirm that early systemic therapy with fluconazole or amphotericin B is indicated to prevent dissemination, whereas selected full-term infants without systemic signs may be managed with close observation and topical therapy, underscoring the need to assess risk and systemic features promptly [^1166QZDx] [^112KgPPM] [^1122r8k6].

> Let me think about prevention and recurrence mitigation, because durable control depends on environmental modification. I need to ensure patients keep folds clean and dry, use barrier methods such as zinc oxide or petrolatum to reduce friction, consider absorbent powders in very moist areas, and address weight, diabetes, and clothing choices; these measures reduce recurrence and improve topical therapy penetration and efficacy [^117WHEPy] [^114ymGnG]. I should confirm that patients understand to continue antifungal therapy for the full recommended duration even if symptoms improve quickly to minimize relapse risk [^114j2aUY].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment. I will plan a check-in at about 2 weeks to confirm clinical resolution. If there is inadequate improvement, I should verify adherence, reconsider the diagnosis with repeat KOH or culture, and evaluate for resistant organisms, bacterial superinfection, or an alternative diagnosis such as inverse psoriasis or tinea cruris. In immunocompromised hosts or atypical lesions, I should escalate to biopsy and broader antifungal coverage without delay [^112UoMMy] [^115ZJS8E]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapy warrant culture and susceptibility testing to guide targeted therapy and detect non-albicans species or resistance [^116eh8Qj].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient education and safety. I should explain expected time to improvement, potential adverse effects of topical agents such as irritation, and the importance of keeping the area dry. If oral fluconazole is used, I should counsel on gastrointestinal side effects and rare hepatotoxicity and arrange liver function monitoring if treatment exceeds three weeks or if risk factors are present, aligning with HIV OI guidance for mucocutaneous candidiasis management and monitoring [^117QihLd] [^116M3j5j]. Let me reconsider any plan that includes prolonged topical steroids without a clear indication, and I will avoid unnecessary systemic therapy in mild, localized disease to minimize drug–drug interactions and resistance pressures [^114Ka8p4].

For yeast in skin folds (candidal intertrigo), **topical antifungals are first-line** [^117WHEPy] — clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, or nystatin — applied twice daily until 1 week after symptoms resolve [^114j2aUY]. Keep the area **dry and cool** with barrier creams, absorbent powders, and loose clothing [^112UoMMy]. Use **systemic fluconazole** (150–200 mg orally once daily for 7–14 days) for extensive, refractory, or immunocompromised cases [^115SeyV4]. Address predisposing factors (obesity, diabetes, immunosuppression, moisture) to prevent recurrence [^116G8SKE].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: Bright-red, macerated plaques with satellite pustules in intertriginous areas (axillae, groin, inframammary, abdominal folds) [^117WHEPy].

- **Diagnosis**: Usually clinical; confirm with KOH prep showing pseudohyphae or fungal culture if uncertain [^117WHEPy].

- **Differential**: Inverse psoriasis, tinea cruris, bacterial intertrigo, seborrheic dermatitis [^1156PSXt] [^114NC3Ex].

---

## Topical antifungal therapy (first-line)

| **Agent** | **Formulation** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clotrimazole | 1% cream/solution | Apply BID | 1–2 weeks |
| Miconazole | 2% cream/powder | Apply BID | 1–2 weeks |
| Ketoconazole | 2% cream | Apply BID | 1–2 weeks |
| Nystatin | Cream/powder | Apply BID–TID | 1–2 weeks |

- **Application**: Apply thinly to affected and surrounding skin; continue 1 week after clearance to reduce recurrence [^114j2aUY].

- **Combination therapy**: Low-potency topical corticosteroid (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) with antifungal for 3–5 days if inflammation is severe; avoid prolonged steroid use to prevent atrophy and recurrence [^112oBVP6] [^116zm1gg].

---

## Systemic antifungal therapy (second-line)

Indications include extensive disease, failure of topical therapy, immunocompromise, or severe symptoms. The **preferred agent** is fluconazole 150–200 mg orally once daily for 7–14 days [^115SeyV4]; in obesity, consider a higher dose or longer duration [^115SeyV4].

---

## Adjunctive measures and prevention

- **Hygiene**: Keep folds clean and dry; use gentle cleansers and thorough drying [^117WHEPy].

- **Barrier protection**: Zinc oxide, petrolatum, or silicone-based creams to reduce friction and moisture [^notfound].

- **Clothing**: Loose, breathable fabrics; avoid tight garments and synthetic materials [^notfound].

- **Weight management**: Address obesity to reduce recurrence risk [^notfound].

- **Glycemic control**: Optimize diabetes management [^notfound].

---

## Management of recurrent or chronic infections

Identify and treat underlying factors such as obesity, diabetes, immunosuppression, and moisture [^116G8SKE]. For suppressive therapy, use topical antifungals intermittently (e.g. once or twice weekly) or systemic **fluconazole 150 mg weekly** for **4–6 months** [^112Qp4CV]. Consider **susceptibility testing** for recurrent or refractory cases to guide therapy [^1153yGBP].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Use systemic therapy earlier and monitor closely for complications [^1125oCLh].

- **Pregnancy**: Prefer topical azoles; avoid systemic fluconazole in the first trimester [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: Use topical therapy first; systemic fluconazole reserved for severe or refractory cases.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Assess response within 1–2 weeks; if there is no improvement, **reassess diagnosis and adherence** and consider alternative diagnoses or resistance [^112UoMMy]. Monitor for adverse effects with systemic therapy, including hepatotoxicity and drug interactions [^117QihLd].

---

Topical antifungals are the cornerstone of therapy for yeast in skin folds, with **systemic fluconazole for refractory or high-risk cases**; strict moisture control and addressing predisposing factors are essential to prevent recurrence.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow's solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a full-term neonate [^113ZLBsx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 CASE DISCUSSION

CCC is a rare skin infection that typically presents in the first 6 days of life. It is an isolated cutaneous eruption in most reported cases but can also be a serious and invasive systemic infection. Systemic infection is most commonly reported in preterm infants, particularly those weighing under 1000 g. Term infants > 1000 g are less likely to develop both systemic and isolated CCC, likely due to greater maturity of the immune system and a stronger epidermal barrier. Other risk factors for congenital candidiasis include cervical foreign bodies (e.g. IUD [intrauterine device], cervical cerclage) in the setting of preterm delivery, maternal vulvovaginal candidiasis, immediate antepartum antibiotic use, and premature rupture of membranes in both full‐term and preterm deliveries.

The cutaneous infection tends to present as a diffuse rash including numerous macules, papules, and pustules with erythematous bases on the trunk, face, and extensor surfaces. In some cases, involvement of the palms, soles, and nails has also been reported. In general, these skin lesions tend to desquamate and resolve 1–2 weeks following onset, but palm and sole involvement tend to persist longer. Given the rarity of CCC, management for this diagnosis is not well defined.

A recent retrospective cohort study by Kaufman et al. looked at data for CCC cases from 2004 to 2015 from two major neonatal intensive care units in the United States. Twenty‐one cases were treated with systemic antifungal therapy that included amphotericin B 1 mg/kg/day and fluconazole 7–12 mg/kg/day, although the start date of these treatments varied. The majority of the CCC cases in this study were in preterm neonates and of low birth weight, limiting the generalizability of this data to populations of healthy and full‐term neonates. The need for systemic therapy in preterm patients is also highlighted in a 2016 case report by Chen et al. that outlined a case of CCC in a preterm infant (34 weeks) who presented at birth with respiratory distress and was treated with parenteral fluconazole and sertaconazole on Day 1 of life, with resolution of erythema and desquamation in 48 h.

### Cutaneous plasmacytoma-like posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder after renal transplantation with response to imiquimod 5% cream and reduced immunosuppression [^113TYBMa]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 27-year-old man with a history of renal transplantation in 1992 for congenital hypoplastic kidney-related renal failure presented to the dermatology transplant clinic for evaluation of a 2-year history of pruritic plaques in the axillae and inguinal folds recalcitrant to treatment with topical corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, and topical antifungals. Past medical history was notable for bilateral optic neuritis, hypertension, and epilepsy. Relevant review of systems was negative. His immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus 2 mg orally twice daily, mycophenolate mofetil 750 mg orally twice daily, and prednisone 5 mg orally daily had remained unchanged for many years. On clinical examination, there were symmetric erythematous fissured and macerated plaques in the axillae, intergluteal, and inguinal folds with no palpable lymphadenopathy (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Atrophic, erythematous, fissured plaques in the inguinal fold on the right side.

The differential diagnosis included allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, dermatophytosis, cutaneous candidiasis, recalcitrant frictional intertrigo, inverse psoriasis, granular parakeratosis, Hailey-Hailey disease, and pemphigus vegetans.

A biopsy of the skin on the right side of the inguinal fold showed perivascular infiltrates of mature-appearing plasma cells and small lymphocytes in the papillary and superficial dermis with focal epidermotropism (Fig 2). Immunohistochemistry was notable for kappa light-chain restricted plasma cells lacking CD56/cyclin D1/CD20/PAX5/CD10/bcl-6 expression. Test results for EBV-encoded small RNA were negative, and Ki67 showed a low proliferative index (< 10%). The lymphocytic infiltrate featured reactive CD3 + /CD5 + T cells and scant CD20 + B lymphocytes. The diagnosis was consistent with cutaneous plasmacytoma-like EBV-negative PTLD.

### Cutaneous mucormycosis arising in the skin folds of immunocompromised patients: a case series [^112PSGX4]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection associated with high mortality in immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis results in improved patient outcomes; however, there is often a delay in confirming mucormycosis infections. While rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is the most common clinical presentation, cutaneous mucormycosis is known to occur in susceptible populations and is characterized by painful lesions that can progress to tissue necrosis. Skin trauma is a key predisposing factor for infection in prior reports of health care associated cutaneous mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients. However, few reports exist of mucormycosis infections at locations not associated with trauma. Here we report 5 immunocompromised patients with a prolonged hospital course who developed cutaneous mucormycosis in intertriginous skin regions without clear predisposing trauma. These findings highlight the importance of routine skin examination and broadening the differential diagnosis of lesions in skin folds beyond common diagnoses such as candidiasis and cellulitis, especially in immunocompromised patients.

### Oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot [^114dh3Nh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

About 15% of the world population have fungal infections of the feet (tinea pedis or athlete's foot). There are many clinical presentations of tinea pedis, and most commonly, tinea pedis is seen between the toes (interdigital) and on the soles, heels, and sides of the foot (plantar). Plantar tinea pedis is known as moccasin foot. Once acquired, the infection can spread to other sites including the nails, which can be a source of re-infection. Oral therapy is usually used for chronic conditions or when topical treatment has failed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral treatments for fungal infections of the skin of the foot (tinea pedis).

Search Methods

For this update we searched the following databases to July 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and CINAHL (from 1981). We checked the bibliographies of retrieved trials for further references to relevant trials, and we searched online trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral treatments in participants who have a clinically diagnosed tinea pedis, confirmed by microscopy and growth of dermatophytes (fungi) in culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently undertook study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction.

Main Results

We included 15 trials, involving 1438 participants. The 2 trials (71 participants) comparing terbinafine and griseofulvin produced a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 3.44) in favour of terbinafine's ability to cure infection. No significant difference was detected between terbinafine and itraconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole, or between griseofulvin and ketoconazole, although the trials were generally small. Two trials showed that terbinafine and itraconazole were effective compared with placebo: terbinafine (31 participants, RR 24.54, 95% CI 1.57 to 384.32) and itraconazole (72 participants, RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.17 to 20.48). All drugs reported adverse effects, with gastrointestinal effects most commonly reported. Ten of the trials were published over 15 years ago, and this is reflected by the poor reporting of information from which to make a clear 'Risk of bias' assessment. Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall. The majority of the remaining trials were judged as 'unclear' risk of bias because of the lack of clear statements with respect to methods of generating the randomisation sequence and allocation concealment. More trials achieved blinding of participants and personnel than blinding of the outcome assessors, which was again poorly reported.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that terbinafine is more effective than griseofulvin, and terbinafine and itraconazole are more effective than no treatment. In order to produce more reliable data, a rigorous evaluation of different drug therapies needs to be undertaken with larger sample sizes to ensure they are large enough to show any real difference when two treatments are being compared. It is also important to continue to follow up and collect data, preferably for six months after the end of the intervention period, to establish whether or not the infection recurred.

### Lack of TYK2 signaling enhances host resistance to Candida albicans skin infection [^112UMujT]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Another key finding of our study is that Tyk2 -/- and Tyk2 K923E mice show a similar reduction in C. albicans invasion into the deep skin and dissemination to kidneys when compared to wild-type controls, suggesting that TYK2 kinase inhibition might be an option to treat cutaneous candidiasis. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of TYK2 inhibitors on the immune defense against C. albicans skin infections. Our results would also predict that the use of TYK2 inhibitors for the treatment of psoriasis or other autoimmune and inflammatory diseaseswould not increase the risk of C. albicans skin infections.

The major limitation of our study is that it remains unclear how our results translate to human patients. The intradermal infection model used in our study mimics infection of the deeply wounded skin, which may occur upon barrier dysfunction, physical skin injury (e.g. through introduction of medical devices), or burns, and only causes fungal dissemination with high infectious doses. Disseminated candidiasis originating from skin is a rare but serious condition. It can occur in patients with both primary and acquired immunodeficiency, such as patients with CARD9 mutation, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The steady rise in the use of various antibiotics may also increase the risk for disseminated skin infections even in immunocompetent patients in conjunction with burns or extensive invasive procedures. Whether or not these patients would benefit from TYK2 inhibition remains to be investigated. However, it must be taken into consideration that TYK2 inhibition may increase the sensitivity to other microbial infections and impair the immune response against cancer cells, albeit to a lesser extent than JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors. Moreover, it remains to be investigated how TYK2 deficiency affects the antifungal response when C. albicans is directly delivered to the blood stream. Another limitation of our study is the lack of direct evidence for γδ T cells being a major source of IFNγ in our experimental model.

Taken together, our study unravels a novel and as yet unrecognized detrimental role of TYK2 and IFNγ signaling in the immune defense against invasive cutaneous candidiasis and paves the way for exploring TYK2 inhibitors as potential treatment option.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a full-term neonate [^114kq4z9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A case report from 2005 by Aldana‐Valenzuela et al. outlined successful treatment of a full‐term infant delivered by cesarean section who developed invasive CCC, but oral treatment was delayed until 6 days of life. By this time, the infant's respiratory and cutaneous presentation had shown marked improvement without treatment. Another case report from 2010 by Boussetta et al. described the clinical course of a full‐term neonate with CCC who was initially treated with topical econazole for 3 days, but despite treatment the neonate developed systemic infection, with respiratory distress and fever, subsequently treated successfully with IV fluconazole.

Although CCC management clearly continues to remain uncertain, current literature clearly promotes more aggressive treatment for neonates who are preterm, have a burn‐like dermatitis, are < 1000 g, or have signs of systemic infection. Conversely, most healthy, full‐term neonates without signs of systemic infection have been shown to be treated successfully with oral and topical agents, or expectant management only. Nevertheless, it is important to continually monitor all patients with CCC for signs of progression. There are fewer reports of CCC in healthy, full‐term infants and thus our case report adds useful information for clinicians and researchers who come across this presentation. As with most topics in medicine, further research is needed to expand the literature regarding aggressive versus conservative treatment for CCC.

We have received informed consent from all subjects involved in this manuscript. Parental consent has been provided to publish the history and photographs.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112WvR1t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline — oropharyngeal candidiasis treatment outlines first-line therapy for mild and moderate to severe disease and options for fluconazole-refractory cases. For mild disease, clotrimazole troches, 10 mg 5 times daily, or miconazole mucoadhesive buccal 50-mg tablet applied to the mucosal surface over the canine fossa once daily for 7–14 days are recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Alternatives for mild disease include nystatin suspension (100 000 U/mL) 4–6 mL 4 times daily, or 1–2 nystatin pastilles (200 000 U each) 4 times daily, for 7–14 days (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For moderate to severe disease, oral fluconazole, 100–200 mg daily, for 7–14 days is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For fluconazole-refractory disease, itraconazole solution, 200 mg once daily, or posaconazole suspension, 400 mg twice daily for 3 days then 400 mg daily, for up to 28 days are recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Alternatives for fluconazole-refractory disease include voriconazole, 200 mg twice daily, or AmB deoxycholate oral suspension, 100 mg/mL 4 times daily (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Other alternatives for refractory disease include intravenous echinocandin regimens — caspofungin 70-mg loading dose then 50 mg daily, micafungin 100 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200-mg loading dose then 100 mg daily — or intravenous AmB deoxycholate 0.3 mg/kg daily (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### Microbial and transcriptional differences elucidate atopic dermatitis heterogeneity across skin sites [^115fyUnj]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Skin forms a life‐sustaining interface between the human body and the environment, and recent research reveals the importance of cutaneous microbial communities in health and disease. The healthy skin microbiota varies widely between individuals and changes with age, gender, genetic variation, health status, and living environment. 1, 2, 3 It is also clear that the skin microbiota is not one single community, but a collection of commensal communities where each community adapts to and modulates the physiological and immunological environment of the sites they inhabit. 4 Typically, the healthy human skin microbiome is mostly stable within an individual over time. 5 The maintenance of skin homeostasis relies on a finely tuned balance between the host and its microbes at each site, and a disruption of this balance likely contributes to inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). 6, 7

AD is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic itchy rashes, inflammation and frequent skin infections, and it is currently the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in industrialized countries. 8 AD lesions can extend from the typical sites of predilection, such as body folds, to most skin surfaces, 8 and manifestations vary extensively by age, severity, age of onset, 9 and ethnicity. 10 However, at present, the precise mechanisms driving the onset and course of AD are insufficiently understood and the optimal type and time‐point for intervention are unknown. 11 Investigating the role of the microbiome and its interaction with the skin in AD will likely reveal important clues regarding disease mechanisms and improved biomarkers to stratify patients into disease subtypes. This will also stimulate future research on innovative treatments directed at endotype components. 12

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);
- proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and
- adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I² > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I² 40–70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (< 100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

### Topical antifungal treatments for tinea cruris and tinea corporis [^112KrRYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Tinea infections are fungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes. It is estimated that 10% to 20% of the world population is affected by fungal skin infections. Sites of infection vary according to geographical location, the organism involved, and environmental and cultural differences. Both tinea corporis, also referred to as 'ringworm' and tinea cruris or 'jock itch' are conditions frequently seen by primary care doctors and dermatologists. The diagnosis can be made on clinical appearance and can be confirmed by microscopy or culture. A wide range of topical antifungal drugs are used to treat these superficial dermatomycoses, but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antifungal treatments in tinea cruris and tinea corporis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 13th August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We handsearched the journal Mycoses from 1957 to 1990.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with proven dermatophyte infection of the body (tinea corporis) or groin (tinea cruris).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses.

Main Results

Of the 364 records identified, 129 studies with 18,086 participants met the inclusion criteria. Half of the studies were judged at high risk of bias with the remainder judged at unclear risk. A wide range of different comparisons were evaluated across the 129 studies, 92 in total, with azoles accounting for the majority of the interventions. Treatment duration varied from one week to two months, but in most studies this was two to four weeks. The length of follow-up varied from one week to six months. Sixty-three studies contained no usable or retrievable data mainly due to the lack of separate data for different tinea infections. Mycological and clinical cure were assessed in the majority of studies, along with adverse effects. Less than half of the studies assessed disease relapse, and hardly any of them assessed duration until clinical cure, or participant-judged cure. The quality of the body of evidence was rated as low to very low for the different outcomes. Data for several outcomes for two individual treatments were pooled. Across five studies, significantly higher clinical cure rates were seen in participants treated with terbinafine compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 4.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.10 to 6.56, number needed to treat (NNT) 3, 95% CI 2 to 4). The quality of evidence for this outcome was rated as low. Data for mycological cure for terbinafine could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity. Mycological cure rates favoured naftifine 1% compared to placebo across three studies (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.14, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 4) with the quality of evidence rated as low. In one study, naftifine 1% was more effective than placebo in achieving clinical cure (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.41 to 4.16, NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 5) with the quality of evidence rated as low. Across two studies, mycological cure rates favoured clotrimazole 1% compared to placebo (RR 2.87, 95% CI 2.28 to 3.62, NNT 2, 95% CI 2 to 3). Data for several outcomes were pooled for three comparisons between different classes of treatment. There was no difference in mycological cure between azoles and benzylamines (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07). The quality of the evidence was rated as low for this comparison. Substantial heterogeneity precluded the pooling of data for mycological and clinical cure when comparing azoles and allylamines. Azoles were slightly less effective in achieving clinical cure compared to azole and steroid combination creams immediately at the end of treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, NNT 6, 95% CI 5 to 13), but there was no difference in mycological cure rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.05). The quality of evidence for these two outcomes was rated as low for mycological cure and very low for clinical cure. All of the treatments that were examined appeared to be effective, but most comparisons were evaluated in single studies. There was no evidence for a difference in cure rates between tinea cruris and tinea corporis. Adverse effects were minimal - mainly irritation and burning; results were generally imprecise between active interventions and placebo, and between different classes of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled data suggest that the individual treatments terbinafine and naftifine are effective. Adverse effects were generally mild and reported infrequently. A substantial number of the studies were more than 20 years old and of unclear or high risk of bias; there is however, some evidence that other topical antifungal treatments also provide similar clinical and mycological cure rates, particularly azoles although most were evaluated in single studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine if Whitfield's ointment, a widely used agent is effective. Although combinations of topical steroids and antifungals are not currently recommended in any clinical guidelines, relevant studies included in this review reported higher clinical cure rates with similar mycological cure rates at the end of treatment, but the quality of evidence for these outcomes was rated very low due to imprecision, indirectness and risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to confidently assess relapse rates in the individual or combination treatments. Although there was little difference between different classes of treatment in achieving cure, some interventions may be more appealing as they require fewer applications and a shorter duration of treatment. Further, high quality, adequately powered trials focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction with treatment should be considered.

### Intertrigo and secondary skin infections [^112UoMMy]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is a superficial inflammatory dermatitis occurring on two closely opposed skin surfaces as a result of moisture, friction, and lack of ventilation. Bodily secretions, including perspiration, urine, and feces, often exacerbate skin inflammation. Physical examination of skin folds reveals regions of erythema with peripheral scaling. Excessive friction and inflammation can cause skin breakdown and create an entry point for secondary fungal and bacterial infections, such as Candida, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Corynebacterium minutissimum. Candidal intertrigo is commonly diagnosed clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of satellite lesions. Diagnosis may be confirmed using a potassium hydroxide preparation. Resistant cases require oral fluconazole therapy. Bacterial superinfections may be identified with bacterial culture or Wood lamp examination. Fungal lesions are treated with topical nystatin, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, or econazole. Secondary streptococcal infections are treated with topical mupirocin or oral penicillin. Corynebacterium infections are treated with oral erythromycin.

### Clinicopathologic overlap of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis [^113FL3iZ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated multisystem disease arising from dysregulation of interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17 signaling pathways. The two categories of skin manifestations both occur on the vulva: classic plaque type seen as red to purple well-demarcated lesions with silvery scale, and flexural or inverse psoriasis seen as erythema and fissures at skin folds. – The incidence of vulvar psoriasis is unknown; up to 40% of psoriasis patients report genital involvement and 1%–7% attending specialist vulvar clinics receive a diagnosis of psoriasis. Vulvar inverse psoriasis has similar symptoms and examination to erosive or hypertrophic lichen planus (LP), dermatitis, and candidiasis. Exposure to irritants and frictional trauma exacerbates psoriasis and may provoke the Koebner phenomenon of new lesions appearing in previously unaffected skin.

The clinical presentation of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) differs depending on location and estrogen status. Reproductive-age women primarily have vaginal involvement with variable extension to vulvar skin, with chronic or recurrent VVC common in a healthy cohort. – Postmenopausal women predominantly have cutaneous or intracrural candidiasis, usually associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), systemic or local immunosuppression, antibiotic exposure, and skin occlusion. Cutaneous candidiasis occurs across sexes, ages, and sites, accounting for 1%–7% of dermatology clinical encounters. In both cohorts, symptoms include itching, burning, dyspareunia, edema, rash, fissures, adherent debris, and abnormal discharge. Skin abnormalities range from subtle erythema to violaceous or macerated rash, sometimes with peripheral scale and/or satellite lesions. False-negative culture of vaginal swab or vulvar scrapings may occur if organism numbers are low, with recent exposure to antifungal medications, or if an uninvolved site is sampled.

Histopathology of psoriasis and candidiasis both demonstrate corneal or subcorneal neutrophils, acanthosis, and dermal lymphocytic infiltrate. Budding cells and pseudohyphae of candidal organisms in the stratum corneum (SC) may be seen in candidiasis but not psoriasis. Organism detection is easier on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) than hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains, but they may be sparse or absent even with obvious clinical and microbiologic disease.

This common clinicopathologic presentation and a growing body of literature suggest an overlap in immunologic pathogenesis. The study's aim is to explore the relationship of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis to determine if these entities are distinguishable or intertwined.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics? [^112CJ9jv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20–25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

### Cutaneousinfection in an immunocompetent woman [^111kAn33]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients are at increased risk of cutaneous and systemic fungal infections when immunocompromised secondary to chemotherapy administration, hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation, diabetes, and AIDS. Those infections caused by Candida species are increasing in severity and frequency. Yarrowia lipolytica, formerly termed Candida lipolytica, has only recently been implicated as an offending organism and is now believed to exist as normal flora in the mouth, gut, and pulmonary tree. Most infections present as sepsis and, because the organism is considered of low virulence, are not necessarily treated with antifungal medications. A cutaneous infection has only been reported once previously.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

Candidemia treatment comparative evidence: Despite randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another; for instance, amphotericin B (AmB) plus fluconazole is at least as effective as higher-dose (800 mg daily) fluconazole given alone for patients with candidemia, but there is little role for this combination in current practice. While awaiting culture and susceptibility data, a working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical for informed therapeutic decisions.

### Cutaneous fungal infections in the elderly [^111AK5fQ]. Dermatologic Clinics (2004). Low credibility.

Because of impaired host defenses and a favorable environment at specific anatomic sites, there is an increased prevalence of seborrheic dermatitis, mucosal and cutaneous candidiasis, tinea pedis, and onychomycosis in the geriatric population compared with other age groups. Both KOH and fungal culture are timely, convenient, and cost-effective methods of diagnosis. Sensitivity of these tests depends on proper technique for specimen collection and experience. KOH 20% with DMSO and DTM are highly recommended. Treatment should be tailored to the diagnosis and the individual patient. This includes the targeted spectrum of coverage (dermatophyte or yeast); topical versus systemic therapy; review of the patient's medication list for potential drug interactions; and likelihood of compliance. Checking baseline laboratories and routine monitoring of complete blood count and liver function tests in healthy patients, without a history of liver disease or active hepatitis, and without potential drug interactions, seems unwarranted for rare adverse events. Successful management requires adequate patient education, correction of underlying predisposing factors, and prophylactic measures against recurrence.

### Seborrheic dermatitis in skin of color: clinical considerations [^114NC3Ex]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition of unclear etiology. The Malassezia yeast genus are believed to play a role. Seborrheic dermatitis commonly affects areas of the skin with high sebum production, including the scalp, nasolabial folds, glabella, eyebrows, beard, ears, retroauricular skin, sternum, and other skin folds. Seborrheic dermatitis may present differently in individuals with skin of color. Darker-skinned individuals may present with scaly, hypopigmented macules and patches in typical areas of involvement. Arcuate or petal-like patches may be seen, specifically termed petaloid seborrheic dermatitis. Children of color often do not experience the classic "cradle cap" appearance of seborrheic dermatitis, and have erythema, flaking, and hypopigmentation of the affected areas and folds of skin. Seborrheic dermatitis tends to respond well to conventional treatments, although it tends to recur. Skin of color patients may require a modified treatment approach which takes into account differences in hair texture and hair washing frequency. This paper aims to highlight these differences to help reduce disparities in the management of seborrheic dermatitis in patients of color.

### Miconazole nitrate (Monistat-derm) [^114j2aUY]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Dosage and Administration:

Sufficient MONISTAT-DERM Cream should be applied to cover affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and cutaneous candidiasis, and once daily in patients with tinea versicolor. If MONISTAT-DERM Cream is used in intertriginous areas, it should be applied sparingly and smoothed in well to avoid maceration effects.

Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, Candida infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after a month of treatment, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116XK253]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Recommendations for Treating Candidiasis in Patients with Psoriasis

Candida infections in patients with psoriasis often develop in areas that are not readily visible and are often asymptomatic. Dermatologists should be attentive to the presence of mucocutaneous Candida infections when examining a patient with psoriasis. As outlined in Table 3, dermatologists should inquire about oral or genital discomfort to identify potential oropharyngeal or genitourinary candidiasis, especially if a full-body examination is not conducted during the patient visit.

Table 3
Questions to aid in the diagnosis of candidiasis

Based on our clinical experience, candidiasis in patients with psoriasis, who do not have other underlying immunocompromising conditions, is usually superficial and localized. Additionally, Candida infections do not typically exacerbate psoriasis. Treatment is almost always definitive, and it is uncommon for systemic dissemination to occur. Standard antifungal treatment regimens are generally safe and well tolerated in patients with psoriasis, and treatment-related complications are rare. We agree with current guidelines for the treatment of Candida infections, and Tables 1 and 2 can be used to help guide therapy decisions. Physicians should refer to their local or regional guidelines because there may be variations on available treatment options. In our experience, patients with psoriasis are generally more prone to Candida colonization and infections than patients with other chronic dermatoses. Furthermore, the treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis should take into consideration that many individuals with psoriasis are receiving immunosuppressive regimens.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis: insights into the diagnosis and treatment [^114xMFmL]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Recent advances in the genetic diagnosis of these diseases have certainly contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CMC. At the same time, further knowledge of the immune response mechanisms against Candida infections has made it possible to improve the diagnostic approach and develop target therapies to better manage these patients. However, there is a need to expand the research in this area, especially on specific therapies already in use and in development. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach involving different specialistic figures such as immunologists, infectious disease specialists and endocrinologists is fundamental to understanding the complexity of this field, leading to the correct diagnosis and choosing the optimal therapeutic regimen, targeting the treatment for each specific patient.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^114Ka8p4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

Inverse psoriasis — presentation and distribution — Inverse psoriasis is characterized by lesions in the skin folds, where the moist environment leads to erythematous plaques with minimal scale. Common locations include the axillary, genital, perineal, intergluteal, and inframammary areas, and flexural surfaces such as the antecubital fossae can exhibit similar lesions.

### Fungal infections of the folds (intertriginous areas) [^114ShpVH]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are widespread, regardless of age and gender, in populations all around the world and may affect the skin and skin appendages. Although there are thousands of fungal infections from various genera and families in nature, those that are pathogenic for humans and nesting in skin folds are limited in number. The prevalence and distribution of these fungi vary according to the patients and certain environmental factors. Because the areas including the lids, external auditory canal, behind the ears, navel, inguinal region, and axillae, also called flexures, are underventilated and moist areas exposed to friction, they are especially sensitive to fungal infections. Fungi can both directly invade the skin, leading to infections, and indirectly stimulate immune mechanisms due to tissue interaction and their antigenic character and contribute to the development or exacerbation of secondary bacterial infections, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Superficial fungal infections can be classified and studied as dermatophyte infections, candidal infections, Malassezia infections, and other superficial infections independently from the involved skin fold areas.

### Six novel antimycotics [^1167o1c7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

We have reviewed six new antimycotic agents which have potential applications for human cutaneous and mucosal diseases. Information on these six drugs was obtained via an English language search of PubMed through the US National Library of Medicine. The antimycotic agents reviewed include rilopirox, lanoconazole, NND-502, butenafine, eberconazole and voriconazole. Rilopirox is a synthetic pyridone derivative, related to ciclopirox, with a fungicidal action. Rilopirox is a hydrophobic, topical agent with potential application in mucosal candida infections, tinea versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Lanoconazole, an imidazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea infections and cutaneous candidiasis. The drug has been available for clinical use in Japan since 1994 and once-daily application to affected areas is recommended. In addition to its antifungal effect, animal data suggest that application of lanoconazole 0.5 or 1% cream is associated with accelerated wound healing. NND-502, a stereoselective analog of lanoconazole, is a topical agent with potential application in tinea pedis infection. NND-502 appears to be more effective in inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis than lanoconazole or bifonazole and clinical trials comparing these agents are awaited. Butenafine is the first member of a new class of antifungals, the benzylamine derivatives, and has been approved for topical use in Japan (since 1992) and the US. Butenafine has a potent fungicidal action and the drug has been shown to be effective in multiple clinical trials in patients with tinea pedis, tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Butenafine has also been reported to exert an anti-inflammatory action after topical application and this may offer potential benefit over other topical antifungal agents. Eberconazole, an imidazole derivative, is a topical antifungal agent that has been shown to be effective in clinical trials in patients with tinea infections. Preliminary data indicate that the eberconazole is effective against some triazole-resistant yeasts such as Candida krusei and Candida glabrata. Voriconazole is an azole antifungal derivative of fluconazole. The drug is available in both oral and parenteral formulations. Oral voriconazole 200mg twice daily has been effective in treating oropharyngeal candidiasis and apergillosis in immunocompromised patients. After 12 weeks' treatment, a similar dosage of the drug elicited a positive response in 69% of nonimmunocompromised patients with invasive aspergillosis.

### Therapy of common superficial fungal infections [^114VBgab]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are common, especially onychomycosis, dermatophytoses, and superficial Candida infections. Most superficial fungal infections are treated with topical antifungal agents unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. Onychomycosis often requires systemic therapy with griseofulvin, itraconazole, or terbinafine. The objective of this review is to provide the practicing dermatologist with the recommended available therapy for the treatment of common superficial fungal infections.

### Topical therapy for fungal infections [^117Czn3i]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Fungi often infect the skin surface and subsequently invade the stratum corneum to avoid being shed from the skin surface by desquamation. Pharmacologic agents applied to the surface of the skin in the form of creams, lotions, or sprays, readily penetrate into the stratum corneum to kill the fungi (fungicidal agents), or at least render them unable to grow or divide (fungistatic agents). Thus, topical therapies work well to rid the skin of topical fungi and yeasts. Azole drugs such as miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole are fungistatic, limiting fungal growth but depending on epidermal turnover to shed the still-living fungus from the skin surface. Allylamines and benzylamines such as terbinafine, naftifine, and butenafine are fungicidal, actually killing the fungal organisms. Fungicidal drugs are often preferred over fungistatic drugs for treatment of dermatophytic fungal infections, since treatment times as short as one application daily for 1 week are associated with high cure rates. Furthermore, patients often stop treatments when the skin appears healed, usually after about a week of treatment. If this short-term treatment is stopped, fungi recur more often when fungistatic, rather than fungicidal, drugs have been used. Yeast infections such as those caused by Candida albicans respond less well to allylamine drugs. The azole drugs are often preferred for these types of infections. Nail infections are difficult to cure with topical therapies because the infections usually occur under the nail instead of on top of it and products penetrate poorly, if at all, through the nail plate. Infections of hair follicles, nails, and widespread infections often require systemic treatments. Antifungal agents are compounded into many different types of vehicles. Patients often prefer to treat weeping infections with spray formulations. Most physicians prescribe branded products in cream or lotion bases. Cost is a factor dictating prescription choice, especially since most products work well regardless of mechanism of action. Cost becomes especially important when infections involve large areas of the body surface. This article reviews various treatments of cutaneous fungal infections, with special emphasis on cure rates and rationales for choosing particular products.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1125tVJZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis: prompt systemic treatment is associated with improved outcomes in neonates [^1166QZDx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC) is a challenging diagnosis due to various rash presentations. Inadequate early treatment is associated with high rates of dissemination and death. The effects of early diagnosis, dermatologic presentation, and antifungal treatment on outcomes are lacking.

Methods

CCC cases were reviewed from 2 academic neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) from 2004 to 2015. We defined CCC as a diffuse rash involving the body, extremities, face or scalp, and/or funisitis, presenting in the first week (≤ 7 days), with identification of Candida species from skin or mucous membrane cultures, and/or by culture or staining of the placenta or umbilical cord.

Results

CCC occurred in 0.1% of all NICU admissions (21 of 19 303) and 0.6% of infants < 1000 grams birth weight. Median gestational age of CCC infants was 26 3/7 (range, 23 0/7–40 4/7) weeks. Skin findings were commonly present on the day of birth [median (range): 0 (0–6) days], appearing most frequently as a desquamating, maculopapular, papulopustular, and/or erythematous diffuse rash. When systemic antifungal therapy was started empirically at the time of rash presentation and continued for a median (interquartile range) of 14 (14–15) days, all patients survived and none developed dissemination. Delaying systemic treatment, exclusive use of nystatin, and treating for < 10 days was associated with Candida bloodstream dissemination.

Conclusions

CCC is an invasive infection that presents as a diffuse rash in preterm and term infants. Prompt systemic antifungal treatment at the time of skin presentation for ≥ 14 days prevents dissemination and Candida-related mortality.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^112SiVnQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Many of the molecular pathways associated with psoriasis pathogenesis are also involved in host defense mechanisms that protect against common pathogens. Candida can stimulate the production of cytokines that trigger or exacerbate psoriasis, and many systemic psoriasis treatments may put patients at increased risk for developing oral, cutaneous, and genitourinary candidiasis. Therefore, dermatologists should regularly screen patients with psoriasis for signs of Candida infection, and take steps to effectively treat these infections to prevent worsening of psoriasis symptoms. This review provides an overview of candidiasis epidemiology in patients with psoriasis, followed by a primer on the diagnosis and treatment of superficial Candida infections, with specific guidance for patients with psoriasis. Candidiasis in patients with psoriasis typically responds to topical or oral antifungal therapy. While biologic agents used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis, such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and interleukin-17 inhibitors, are known to increase patients' risk of developing localized candidiasis, the overall risk of infection is low, and candidiasis can be effectively managed in most patients while receiving systemic psoriasis therapies. Thus, the development of candidiasis does not usually necessitate changes to psoriasis treatment regimens.

Abstract

We present a case of a full‐term neonate born with respiratory distress and a widespread erythematous rash, who was found to have congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC). The significance of this report is to contribute to the pre‐existing literature on the rarity of CCC, but also to share a case of a patient who was successfully treated conservatively with topical antifungal agents only.

### Assessment of dermatophytosis treatment studies: interpreting the data [^112XD29c]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Antifungal therapy has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest due to the introduction of a number of new formulations of topical drugs and novel molecules. This has led to a plethora of new publications on management of cutaneous fungal disease. This paper summarizes the various clinical trial factors which may affect the published data regarding how well antifungal drugs work. Understanding these parameters allows the healthcare provider to choose more rationally between available agents based upon an assessment of the evidence.

### Pustular skin disorders: diagnosis and treatment [^1122FT5t]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for pustular skin disorders is extensive. The distribution of the lesions and the age of the patient are characteristics that may provide strong clues to the etiology of cutaneous pustular eruptions. In adults, generalized pustular dermatoses include pustular psoriasis, Reiter's disease and subcorneal pustular dermatosis. Medications can cause generalized pustular eruptions, such as in the case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis; or more localized reactions, such as acneiform drug eruptions, which usually involve the face, chest and back. Localized pustular eruptions are seen on the hands and feet in adults with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris and acrodermatitis continua (both of which may be variants of psoriasis); on the face in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea, and perioral dermatitis; and on the trunk and/or extremities in patients with folliculitis. A separate condition known as eosinophilic folliculitis occurs in individuals with advanced human immunodeficiency disease. Severely pruritic, sterile, eosinophilic pustules are found on the chest, proximal extremities, head and neck. Elevated serum immunoglobulin E and eosinophilia are often concurrently found. In neonates, it is especially important to make the correct diagnosis with respect to pustular skin disorders, since pustules can be a manifestation of sepsis or other serious infectious diseases. Generalized pustular eruptions in neonates include erythema toxicum neonatorum and transient neonatal pustular melanosis, both of which are non-infectious. Pustules are seen in infants with congenital cutaneous candidiasis, which may or may not involve disseminated disease. Ofuji's syndrome is an uncommon generalized pustular dermatosis of infancy with associated eosinophilia. As in adults, neonates and infants may develop acne or scabies infestations. In this article, we review the most common pustular dermatoses and offer a systematic approach to making a diagnosis. We also report the most up-to-date information on the treatment of these various cutaneous pustular conditions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mucocutaneous candidiasis — monitoring of response and adverse events: For most patients with mucocutaneous candidiasis, response to antifungal therapy is rapid; signs and symptoms improve within 48 to 72 hours. Short courses of topical therapy rarely result in adverse effects, although patients may experience cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash and pruritus. Oral azole therapy can be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or transaminase elevations. Periodic monitoring of liver function studies should be considered if azole therapy is anticipated for > 21 days, especially in patients with other hepatic comorbidities (AII). The echinocandins appear to be associated with very few adverse reactions: histamine-related infusion toxicity, transaminase elevations, and rash have been attributed to these drugs, and no dose adjustments are required in renal failure.

### Clinicopathologic overlap of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis [^1157zBif]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The prolonged interval from symptom onset to referral and noncollection of microbiology in 13% reinforce previous findings that clinical recognition of vulvar psoriasis and cutaneous candidiasis is poor. Association of visible fungal organisms with prereferral topical corticosteroids may signal iatrogenic exacerbation of disease. Empiric prescribing of topical estrogen, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antimycotics to women with vulvovaginal complaints in the primary care setting is discouraged. Instead, presence of a rash should precipitate microbiologic assessment via swab, scraping, and/or polymerase chain reaction, vulvar care advice, and prompt follow-up. Lack of distinct nomenclature and clinical guidance to separate vulvar cutaneous candidiasis from VVC likely contributes to underrecognition and inadequate skin treatment.

Use of combined antifungal and corticosteroid treatment was common in specialist-led clinics. It is unclear if the reason is uncertain clinical diagnosis, reluctance to cease topical steroids due to possible underlying dermatosis, or belief that dual therapy provides speedier symptomatic relief. The evidence for initial genital psoriasis treatment is limited and favors low- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, supplemented by topical coal tar preparations, calcineurin inhibitors, or vitamin D analogs. Several publications recommend topical antifungals over systemic agents for cutaneous candidiasis, citing efficacy, cost, ease of use, and adverse effect profile, except for severe extensive disease justifying systemic azoles for 2–6 weeks. Scant evidence supports this approach, and use of topicals does not address vulva-specific concerns of nonvisibility and surface area of affected skin, concurrent dermatologic conditions, and propensity toward contact dermatitis. Studies assessing combination topical antifungals with corticosteroids for cutaneous candidiasis did not demonstrate superiority of dual therapy over single-agent antimycotics.

Neutropenic patients with skin lesions — diagnostic evaluation and testing — Blood cultures should be obtained, and skin lesions in this population of patients should be aggressively evaluated by culture aspiration, biopsy, or surgical excision as they may be caused by resistant microbes, yeast, or molds (strong, moderate). The sensitivity of a single serum fungal antigen test is low particularly in patients receiving antifungal agents, and benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent (strong, moderate). PCR in peripheral blood for HSV and VZV might be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of disseminated infection in patients with unexplained skin lesions (weak, moderate).

There presently exists a wide selection of choices in the treatment of superficial mycoses. The main categories of broad-spectrum agents are the allylamines and imidazoles, which have been tried and proven over more than 2 decades of usage with good safety.

Question 3: What is a potential treatment for this condition?
A. Topical corticosteroid
B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin
C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy
D. Meropenem
E. Supportive care

Answers:
A. Topical corticosteroid – Incorrect. Immunosuppression including systemic corticosteroids is a risk factor for cutaneous protothecosis. Further immunosuppression would likely exacerbate this condition.
B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin – Correct. Protothecosis can be difficult to treat and may require multiple agents or months of therapy; optimal treatment for cutaneous disease is unclear, although patients with risk for disease spread should be treated more aggressively. Surgical excision or debridement is often beneficial for local cutaneous disease. For deeper or persistent infections, surgical management is combined with azole antifungals or intravenous amphotericin with a tetracycline. Left alone, disease will persist and potentially spread, although systemic or disseminated infection is rare. The prognosis for cutaneous infection is generally positive.
C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis is an infection and would not respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
D. Meropenem – Incorrect. This patient was treated with multiple antibiotic courses without resolution. Protothecosis infection is not a bacterial infection and would not respond to conventional antibiotics alone.
E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis requires treatment to reduce the likelihood of dissemination.

### NLRP3 inhibition ameliorates severe cutaneous autoimmune manifestations in a mouse model of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy-like disease [^114MQ7i1]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy show diverse endocrine and nonendocrine manifestations initiated by self-reactive T cells because of AIRE mutation-induced defective central tolerance. A large number of American patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy suffer from early-onset cutaneous inflammatory lesions accompanied by an infiltration of T cells and myeloid cells. The role of myeloid cells in this setting remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we characterize the autoinflammatory phenotypes in the skin of both autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy-like kinase-dead Ikkα knockin mice and patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy. We found a marked infiltration of autoreactive CD4 T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils; elevated uric acid; and increased NLRP3, a major inflammasome component. Depleting autoreactive CD4 T cells or ablating Ccl2/Cxcr2 genes significantly attenuated the inflammasome activity, inflammation, and skin phenotypes in kinase-dead Ikkα knockin mice. Importantly, treatment with an NLRP3 inhibitor reduced skin phenotypes and decreased infiltration of CD4 T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. These results suggest that increased myeloid cell infiltration contributes to autoreactive CD4 T cell-mediated skin autoinflammation. Thus, our findings reveal that the combined infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils is required for autoreactive CD4 T cell-mediated skin disease pathogenesis and that the NLRP3-dependent inflammasome is a potential therapeutic target for the cutaneous manifestations of autoimmune diseases.

### Cutaneous mucormycosis arising in the skin folds of immunocompromised patients: a case series [^112KkZwF]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This report describes 5 immunocompromised patients with prolonged hospitalization who developed intertriginous cutaneous mucormycosis. All patients in the series were immunocompromised and included 3 patients with hematologic malignancy receiving chemotherapy, 1 solid organ transplant recipient, and 1 patient with a critical autoimmune condition. In addition, a sixth patient with similar clinical presentation who developed mucormycosis in the left axilla during prolonged hospitalization status after heart transplantation has previously been reported from our inpatient service. The patients were susceptible to opportunistic infection from Mucorales fungi, which are commonly encountered in the environment, including on hospital linen. Surgery, catheterization, and adhesive tape are potential forms of iatrogenic skin trauma that can promote inoculation. All patients presented herein lacked documented trauma to their site of intertriginous mucormycosis infection. Intertrigo is common among bedridden patients; friction and moisture can lead to maceration disrupting the epidermal barrier and presumably serve as a portal of entry for Mucorales fungal spores. Common sites of intertrigo include the skin folds of the inguinal, axillary, and inframammary areas, as seen in this cohort. Four patients were thought to have candidal intertrigo before their diagnosis of mucormycosis was made. Clues to cutaneous mucormycosis infection included ulceration, signs of inflammation, and induration.

All but 1 patient expired due to complications of mucormycosis infection. Delaying amphotericin B therapy and surgical intervention significantly increases mucormycosis-associated mortality, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Given its low incidence, the initial differential diagnosis for the skin findings did not include mucormycosis for all patients as initial treatments included oral fluconazole and topical nystatin before the correct diagnosis was confirmed via skin biopsy and fungal culture. Mucorales species are commonly resistant to most azoles, allylamines, and echinocandins. Inception or persistence of intertriginous lesions in the setting of typical antifungal prophylaxis agents should raise suspicion for mucormycosis, even without predisposing skin trauma as in this cohort. Interestingly, voriconazole prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients has also been identified as a risk factor for mucormycosis infection.

This series demonstrates that intertriginous skin lesions in immunocompromised patients should prompt concern for cutaneous mucormycosis. Measures to minimize moisture within skin folds such as application of drying powders or cloth can prevent the development of intertrigo. Further research is needed to determine effective strategies for prevention and management of cutaneous mucormycosis given the significant associated morbidity and mortality.

Candidiasis Overview

There are more than 200 known species of Candida, a ubiquitous eukaryotic yeast that is part of the normal microbial flora of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract in healthy individuals. When host immunity is compromised, the risk of developing opportunistic Candida infections increases. C. albicans is the most common species associated with Candida infections, which often presents as oral thrush, vulvovaginitis, or cutaneous candidiasis. Predisposing factors for candidiasis include diabetes and other endocrinopathies, obesity, pregnancy, underlying HIV infection, poor hygiene, and recent treatment with antibiotics or corticosteroids. Individuals who wear dentures are also at increased risk for oral candidiasis.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

Cutaneous molds in immunocompromised patients — diagnosis and therapy: Cutaneous mold infections have been increasingly reported in immunocompromised patients with primarily cellular immunodeficiency, with common pathogens including Aspergillus, Mucormycosis, Scedosporium, and Fusarium species. For evaluation, skin biopsy should be performed for diagnostic purposes, and resection of the entire lesion or "debulking" procedures should be considered when a single lesion or localized disease is present. For Aspergillus species, Scedosporium apiospermum, and Fusarium species infections, voriconazole is the best therapeutic option; amphotericin B is an excellent alternative, and posaconazole is also a reasonable alternative in combination with amphotericin B or as a transition to oral therapy.

### The skin as a window into primary immune deficiency diseases: atopic dermatitis and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [^115srKCB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary immune deficiency diseases characteristically present with recurrent, severe, or unusual infections. These infections may often involve the skin, with mucocutaneous candidal infections seen in a variety of different primary immune deficiencies. Primary immune deficiencies may also present with noninfectious cutaneous complications, of which eczema is the most common. In a patient with suspected primary immune deficiency, the presence of eczema or candidal skin infections offers critical information about the underlying immune defect, either the presence of atopy or defect in the T H 17 pathway, respectively. These skin manifestations also are often early or heralding findings of the underlying immunologic disease. Therefore, awareness of associations between these skin findings and specific immune deficiencies may aide in the early detection and treatment of serious or life-threatening immunologic defects. This review specifically will focus on the primary immune deficiencies commonly associated with eczema or mucocutaneous candidiasis.

### Cutaneous expression of systemic candidiasis [^112cXThp]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Skin lesions associated with Candida septicaemia occur only in a minority of patients, who are usually immunocompromised, but they can help to establish a diagnosis rapidly. The lesions form a characteristic maculopapular or nodular rash at the onset of the infection. We report three cases of systemic candidiasis (SC) with cutaneous manifestations in immunocompromised patients. In these patients, the lesions started as asymptomatic or slightly pruriginous macules, papules or nodules localized on the trunk and extremities. The patients' general condition was very poor and they presented a high fever at the onset of the illness. Candida spp. were isolated from blood in all cases, and histology showed yeasts in two of them. Most of the lesions resolved with antifungal treatment. The diagnosis of SC is often delayed or missed because of the absence of useful diagnostic tools, the varying clinical manifestations and the frequent negativity (50–75%) of blood cultures for Candida. Fluconazole is the treatment of choice for Candida albicans, but treatment response is unknown for other Candida spp., which may require treatment with amphotericin B.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in preterm infants [^112KgPPM]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC) is a rare condition, which typically affects premature and very low birthweight neonates. Affected infants present with a diffuse rash of variable morphology, which can appear as peeling, sloughing desquamation; maculopapular lesions; or, less commonly, pustules, vesicles, or bullae. Due to the varied nature of the clinical presentation, the diagnosis of CCC can be quite difficult but critically important because early treatment with intravenous fluconazole can prevent disease progression. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of CCC.

### Case report: diaper dermatitis presenting as pustules [^1168cD8Y]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. Its cause can often be determined clinically based on the clinical presentation. Primary diaper dermatitis is associated with irritants and spares the deep skin folds. Secondary diaper dermatitis is most often caused by Candida yeast overgrowth and typically presents as a well-defined area of beefy red erythema covering the diaper area and including the deep folds of skin with hallmark satellite pustules. Other causes include seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, acrodermatitis enteropathica, allergic contact dermatitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and, in the setting of a primarily pustular eruption, bacterial folliculitis. A simple potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH) can confirm the diagnosis of candida diaper dermatitis and guide proper treatment.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis: insights into the diagnosis and treatment [^112EZyc7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO CMC

CMC needs to be suspected in patients with chronic (more than 6 months) or recurrent candida infections of the nails, skin and mucosae as the main or exclusive clinical manifestation. However, a fungal culture of the site of infection must be always performed to show the positivity to candida.

Secondary causes must be excluded, such as prolonged use of antibiotics, systemic steroids (> 10 mg/die or less with immunosuppressors or comorbidity), other kinds of immunosuppressors, and comorbidities such as diabetes and HIV infection. Other infectious or noninfectious complications must be considered in the clinical spectrum of these patients, which may lead to a specific genetic cause of CMC.

Having received a clinical and microbiological diagnosis of CMC, in the suspected case of IEI, immunological and genetic investigations are required to identify the underlying deficit (Fig. 1).

Candidal Balanitis

Candidal balanitis (Fig. 1 d) is defined as inflammation of the glans penis in the presence of Candida spp. and accounts for less than 20% of all balanoposthitis. Candidal balanitis is generally sexually acquired and is more common in patients with diabetes and in uncircumcised men. Infections are almost always opportunistic and often occur in patients with primary inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis. Symptoms include local burning, soreness, and pruritus, and clinical features include pronounced erythema and papules. Diagnosis is often based on clinical appearance, but European consensus guidelines recommend performing a subpreputial culture to confirm the presence of Candida.

European guidelines for the management of candidal balanitis recommend treatment with 1% clotrimazole cream applied twice daily until symptoms resolve or, if symptoms are severe, oral fluconazole 150 mg once daily (strength of recommendation for both: A). Application of 2% miconazole cream twice daily until symptoms resolve or, if resistance or allergy to imidazoles is suspected, nystatin cream (100,000 units/g) is also recommended (strength of recommendation for both: B). Topical imidazole with 1% hydrocortisone can be used if marked inflammation is present (strength of recommendation: C).

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis with systemic dissemination in a preterm infant [^117TzTAR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is an infrequent invasive fungal infection that usually appears in the first days of life. Extremely low birth weight infants are the most frequently affected. Classic presentation includes diffuse extensive erythematous rash with papules, plaques, pustules and vesicles, which later undergoes desquamation. Systemic dissemination is common in extremely low birth weight infants. Blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should be included in the initial assessment. Early and prolonged treatment has been associated with decreased mortality. We report the case of congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a preterm infant. Early skin lesion recognition allowed establishing adequate treatment in the first hours of life.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a full-term neonate [^1122r8k6]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Darmstadt et al. published a review documenting the weights and outcomes of CCC neonates. A total of 63 infants were reviewed, 36 of which were preterm. Although they recommended particular vigilance of preterm infants, for the 27 patients who were full‐term and with a birth weight > 2500 g, their formal recommendation was that expectant management may be sufficient, except if a "burn‐like dermatitis" is observed. Silverman et al. also commented on the need for systemic treatment for a burn‐like dermatitis, but they also stated that neonates with a birth weight < 1500 g should be treated systemically regardless of culture results.

A 2014 case report by Siriratsivawong et al. outlined a case of CCC on the anterior surfaces of the body in a full‐term neonate who presented with respiratory distress at delivery. This infant was treated with amphotericin B for 3 days, followed by oral fluconazole for 10 days with resolution. Similarly, a 2019 case report by Colantonio et al. also highlighted the successful treatment course of a term neonate with one dose of oral fluconazole, followed by 100,000 units/g of topical nystatin cream 4×/day until resolution with no complications noted.

### Invasive candidiasis [^1177F7az]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis is an important health-care-associated fungal infection that can be caused by several Candida spp.; the most common species is Candida albicans, but the prevalence of these organisms varies considerably depending on geographical location. The spectrum of disease of invasive candidiasis ranges from minimally symptomatic candidaemia to fulminant sepsis with an associated mortality exceeding 70%. Candida spp. are common commensal organisms in the skin and gut microbiota, and disruptions in the cutaneous and gastrointestinal barriers (for example, owing to gastrointestinal perforation) promote invasive disease. A deeper understanding of specific Candida spp. virulence factors, host immune response and host susceptibility at the genetic level has led to key insights into the development of early intervention strategies and vaccine candidates. The early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is challenging but key to the effective management, and the development of rapid molecular diagnostics could improve the ability to intervene rapidly and potentially reduce mortality. First-line drugs, including echinocandins and azoles, are effective, but the emergence of antifungal resistance, especially among Candida glabrata, is a matter of concern and underscores the need to administer antifungal medications in a judicious manner, avoiding overuse when possible. A newly described pathogen, Candida auris, is an emerging multidrug-resistant organism that poses a global threat.

Cryptococcus — cutaneous involvement and management: Single or multiple painless skin lesions involving the face and scalp develop in 5%–10% of clinically infected patients and may precede cryptococcal meningitis by several weeks. Fluconazole is often used as initial treatment for patients with mild infections or to complete treatment after clinical and microbiologic improvement with amphotericin B and 5‑flucytosine induction therapy, and surgical debridement and/or drainage are not helpful in the management of skin or soft tissue cryptococcal infections.

Neutropenia with persistent or recurrent fever — epidemiology of skin and soft tissue involvement and candidiasis — Although skin and soft tissues are less frequent sites of infection in patients with persisting or recurrent fever and neutropenia (< 10%), they often represent a site of infection dissemination. Among the responsible pathogens, 10%–15% are caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli and 30%–40% by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms. The incidence of invasive candidiasis prior to the routine use of azole antifungal prophylaxis was 12% in patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia, and up to 13% of patients with invasive disseminated candidiasis develop single or multiple nodular skin lesions that can appear as discrete pink to red papules (0.5–1.0 cm). In patients with persistent unexplained fever of their first episode (after 4–7 days) or recurrent fever, yeast and molds are the major cause of infection-related morbidity and mortality.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116Kurpd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk for candidiasis, and therapies used to treat psoriasis may increase this risk. With the availability of biologic therapies that target cytokines involved in host defense mechanisms (e.g. IL-17A), treatment-related Candida infections are to be expected in a small percentage of patients who receive these agents for the management of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Thus, it is important for dermatologists to be aware of the symptoms of candidiasis and to know how to manage these symptoms according to current guideline recommendations. With effective management for candidiasis, psoriasis patients do not need to experience disruption in their systemic psoriasis therapies.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a full-term neonate [^111Z3r1x]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a full-term neonate born with respiratory distress and a widespread erythematous rash, who was found to have congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC). The significance of this report is to contribute to the pre-existing literature on the rarity of CCC, but also to share a case of a patient who was successfully treated conservatively with topical antifungal agents only.
