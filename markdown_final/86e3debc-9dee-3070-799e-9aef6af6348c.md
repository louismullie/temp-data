## Question

Inohip prophylaxis dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the "Inohip prophylaxis dose". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Inohip" is a recognized drug name or a misspelling. Then, I should verify what the user likely meant and in what clinical context prophylaxis dosing is needed. Next, I will extract the correct dosing from authoritative guidelines and key trials. Finally, I will tailor the dose to common scenarios and highlight special populations and safety considerations, making sure I cite the best available sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity, because "Inohip" does not map to any standard anticoagulant or heparin product in the provided references, and I should not jump to conclusions without checking. Wait, let me verify the closest matches: the most plausible interpretation is that the user meant enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin used for VTE prophylaxis, and the question is about its prophylactic dose in adults, which is consistently described as 40 mg subcutaneously once daily in major guidelines and trials [^116WhKok] [^113Rjx5a].

> I will now examine the standard adult prophylaxis dose to ensure I'm precise. The ACCP 9th edition defines prophylactic LMWH regimens to include enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily, and this is echoed across obstetric, perioperative, and general medical prophylaxis contexts, establishing 40 mg daily as the conventional prophylactic dose in adults without renal impairment or extreme body weight [^116WhKok] [^113fAouC] [^114nCUE4].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives and common variations so I don't overgeneralize. Some clinicians use enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours in trauma or critical care settings to improve anti-Xa attainment, but this is not the default prophylactic regimen and is supported by limited and lower-certainty evidence; thus, 40 mg once daily remains the standard unless there is a specific rationale to adjust frequency or dose [^112YbLhx] [^116BhjFP].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with renal impairment, because accumulation risk changes dosing. In severe renal insufficiency with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, enoxaparin should be dose-reduced to 30 mg once daily for prophylaxis to mitigate bleeding risk from accumulation, and this adjustment is consistently recommended in ACCP and pharmacokinetic summaries [^113Vx4W7] [^113k5ubE].

> Let me consider obesity, since underdosing can occur with fixed prophylactic doses. Evidence suggests that in morbid obesity, higher enoxaparin doses may be needed to achieve target anti-Xa levels, and some centers use weight-adjusted intermediate dosing such as 40 mg every 12 hours or 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, but I should emphasize that this is off-label and supported by limited data; individualized decisions and, when used, anti-Xa monitoring can be considered in select cases [^111Ws7HT] [^111XTXAR].

> I need to check pregnancy-specific guidance because dosing differs from the nonpregnant population. In pregnancy, prophylactic LMWH is preferred, with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily as a standard option, and intermediate dosing such as 40 mg every 12 hours is reserved for higher-risk scenarios; neuraxial anesthesia timing must be planned around LMWH pharmacokinetics to reduce epidural hematoma risk [^113fAouC] [^113VUzLV].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is COVID-19, where intermediate dosing has been explored. Randomized trials and guidelines indicate that for critically ill COVID-19 patients without confirmed VTE, prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation is favored over intermediate or therapeutic intensity due to increased bleeding without clear efficacy benefit, so routine escalation beyond 40 mg daily is not recommended in that setting [^115vwVmj] [^115fNtcS] [^113Rjx5a].

> I should double-check perioperative bridging language to avoid conflating prophylaxis with therapeutic bridging. Therapeutic-dose LMWH bridging uses 1 mg/kg enoxaparin once or twice daily and is distinct from prophylaxis; ACCP perioperative guidance reserves bridging for high thrombotic risk patients and uses prophylactic-dose LMWH postoperatively when indicated, reinforcing that 40 mg daily is the prophylactic reference dose in this context as well [^114UwJy8] [^114nCUE4].

> Let me reconsider pediatric and adolescent dosing briefly, even though the user's question is likely adult-focused. Pediatric prophylaxis is weight-based and age-dependent, with enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg once daily as a common starting point, but this is extrapolated and often requires anti-Xa monitoring and dose adjustments in infants and young children, underscoring that adult fixed 40 mg dosing should not be transplanted to pediatrics [^notfound].

> In summary, after verifying the drug identity and cross-checking guidelines and trials, the standard adult prophylaxis dose for enoxaparin is 40 mg subcutaneously once daily, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily if creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min, and consideration of adjusted or intermediate dosing in obesity or pregnancy based on individualized risk and, when used, anti-Xa monitoring; I should confirm that this aligns with the user's intent and clinical scenario before finalizing the recommendation [^116WhKok] [^113Vx4W7] [^113fAouC].

The standard prophylactic dose of enoxaparin (LMWH) is **40 mg subcutaneously once daily** for most adult patients, including medical inpatients and general surgical patients [^116WhKok] [^114nCUE4]. For patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), reduce the dose to **30 mg once daily** to mitigate bleeding risk from accumulation [^113Vx4W7] [^113k5ubE]. In obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²), consider weight-based dosing at **0.5 mg/kg once daily** or split dosing to achieve target anti-Xa levels [^111Ws7HT] [^111XTXAR]. For trauma or critically ill patients, some centers use **30 mg every 12 hours** to improve anti-Xa attainment, though evidence for improved outcomes is limited [^112YbLhx] [^116BhjFP]. Always individualize dosing based on renal function, weight, and bleeding risk [^111Ws7HT].

---

## Standard prophylactic dose

The standard prophylactic dose of enoxaparin for most adult patients is **40 mg subcutaneously once daily** [^116WhKok]. This regimen is supported by multiple guidelines and clinical studies for medical inpatients, general surgical patients, and orthopedic surgery patients [^11682nkG] [^111WxCnk].

---

## Dose adjustments in special populations

### Renal impairment

In severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 30 mL/min), enoxaparin clearance is reduced, increasing the risk of accumulation and bleeding [^113k5ubE]. The recommended prophylactic dose in this population is **30 mg subcutaneously once daily** [^113Vx4W7].

---

### Obesity

Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) is associated with altered pharmacokinetics of enoxaparin, potentially leading to subtherapeutic anti-Xa levels with standard dosing [^111XTXAR]. Weight-based dosing at **0.5 mg/kg once daily** or split dosing (e.g. 30 mg every 12 hours) may be considered to achieve target anti-Xa levels, although evidence for improved clinical outcomes is limited [^111Ws7HT] [^111XTXAR].

---

### Trauma and critically ill patients

Critically ill patients, including trauma patients, often have altered pharmacokinetics and increased VTE risk. Some centers use **30 mg every 12 hours** to improve anti-Xa attainment, though evidence for improved clinical outcomes is limited [^112YbLhx] [^116BhjFP].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| General medical or surgical patients | 40 mg once daily | High |
| Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | 30 mg once daily | High |
| Obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) | 0.5 mg/kg once daily or 30 mg every 12 hours | Moderate |
| Trauma or critically ill patients | 30 mg every 12 hours | Moderate |

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

Routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels is not required for most patients receiving prophylactic enoxaparin. However, monitoring may be considered in special populations, such as those with severe renal impairment, obesity, or critical illness, to ensure adequate anticoagulation and minimize bleeding risk [^111Ws7HT] [^111XTXAR]. Bleeding complications are the primary safety concern with enoxaparin prophylaxis. The risk of major bleeding is generally low but increases with higher doses, renal impairment, and concomitant use of other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents [^113k5ubE].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard dose**: 40 mg subcutaneously once daily for most adult patients.
- **Renal impairment**: 30 mg once daily if CrCl < 30 mL/min.
- **Obesity**: Consider 0.5 mg/kg once daily or 30 mg every 12 hours.
- **Trauma/critical illness**: Consider 30 mg every 12 hours.
- **Monitoring**: Consider anti-Xa levels in special populations.

---

The standard prophylactic dose of enoxaparin is **40 mg subcutaneously once daily**, with adjustments for renal impairment, obesity, and critical illness. Individualized dosing and monitoring are essential to balance efficacy and safety.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: consensus, controversies, and challenges [^112iuyJN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The last 50 years have witnessed a multitude of publications evaluating the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of many different thromboprophylaxis interventions. There is widespread consensus that thromboprophylaxis safely reduces morbidity and mortality. More than 25 evidence-based guidelines, published since 1986, also recommend routine thromboprophylaxis in the majority of hospitalized patients. As a result, thromboprophylaxis is recognized as a key safety priority for hospitals. Some of the remaining areas of controversy that will be discussed in this paper include the role of individual risk assessments to determine thrombosis risk and prophylaxis, replacement of low-dose heparin by low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), the optimal duration of prophylaxis, the role of combined thromboprophylaxis modalities, the safety of anticoagulant prophylaxis with regional analgesia, the use of LMWHs in chronic renal insufficiency, and the emerging role of new oral anticoagulants as thromboprophylactic agents. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting thromboprophylaxis, rates of thromboprophylaxis use remain far from optimal. Successful implementation strategies to bridge this knowledge:care gap are the most important current challenges in this area. These strategies must be multifaceted, utilizing local, systems-based approaches as well as legislation and incentives that reinforce best practices.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114nCUE4]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Role of low-dose LMWH as VTE prophylaxis in perioperative management — In patients who require perioperative interruption of a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and are considered at high risk for post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE), the need to administer low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as VTE prophylaxis may be obviated once the VKA or DOAC is resumed. There may be circumstances when low-dose LMWH can be used in patients at high VTE risk; for example, those having abdominopelvic cancer surgery or hip or knee replacement surgery, and in such hospitalized patients, low-dose LMWH would be started, typically, 12 to 24 hours post-operatively and continued for 2 to 3 days while the VKA takes effect or until resumption of DOAC therapy. The administration of heparin bridging, particularly if only used pre-operatively, does not preclude the administration of post-operative low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily), including in patients at high risk for bleeding in whom post-operative therapeutic-dose LMWH bridging might be avoided. In patients who resume antiplatelet therapy after a surgery, the addition of low-dose LMWH can be justified in high VTE risk situations but is empiric and should consider the risk of bleeding.

### Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for venous thromboembolism [^114g2ubn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be effective and safe in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE). They may also be effective for the initial treatment of VTE. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999 and previously updated in 2004.

Objectives

To determine the effect of LMWH compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the initial treatment of VTE.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Specialised Register and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library). Colleagues and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing fixed dose subcutaneous LMWH with adjusted dose intravenous or subcutaneous UFH in people with VTE.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and quality, and extracted data independently.

Main Results

Twenty-three studies were included (n = 9587). Thrombotic complications occurred in 3.6% of participants treated with LMWH compared with 5.3% treated with UFH (odds ratio (OR) 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.85). Thrombus size was reduced in 53% of participants treated with LMWH and 45% treated with UFH (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81). Major haemorrhages occurred in 1.1% of participants treated with LMWH compared with 1.9% treated with UFH (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.83). In 19 trials, 4.3% of participants treated with LMWH died compared with 5.8% of participants treated with UFH (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93). Nine studies (n = 4451) examined proximal thrombosis, 2192 participants were treated with LMWH and 2259 with UFH. Subgroup analysis showed statistically significant reductions favouring LMWH in thrombotic complications and major haemorrhage. By end of follow up, 80 (3.6%) participants treated with LMWH had thrombotic complications compared with 143 (6.3%) treated with UFH (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.75). Major haemorrhages occurred in 18 (1.0%) participants treated with LMWH compared with 37 (2.1%) treated with UFH (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85). Nine studies showed a statistically significant reduction in mortality favouring LMWH. By the end of follow up, 3.3% (70/2094) of participants treated with LMWH had died and 5.3% (110/2063) treated with UFH.

Authors' Conclusions

Fixed dose LMWH is more effective and safer than adjusted dose UFH for the initial treatment of VTE. Compared to UFH, LMWH significantly reduced the incidence of thrombotic complications, the occurrence of major haemorrhage during initial treatment and overall mortality at follow up.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114czh9r]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — prophylactic-dose heparin dosing and timing are defined as follows: Prophylactic-dose heparin is treatment with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at a lower dose than what is typically used for therapeutic anticoagulation. Prophylactic-dose UFH was defined as 10,000 to 15,000 units/d and prophylactic-dose LMWH as 3,000 to 6,000 International Units/day. Prophylactic-dose heparin therapy is typically initiated within 48 h after onset of stroke and continued throughout the hospital stay or until the patient regains mobility. Prophylactic-dose heparin should not be used within the first 24 h after administration of thrombolytic therapy.

### Meta-analysis: low-molecular-weight heparin and bleeding in patients with severe renal insufficiency [^114Z6eyh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dose adjustment or laboratory monitoring of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min), but the basis for this recommendation is unclear.

Purpose

To compare levels of anti-Xa heparin and risk for major bleeding in LMWH-treated patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less versus those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min by using standard weight-adjusted therapeutic doses, empirically adjusted doses, or prophylactic doses of LMWH.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library) searched to December 2005 with no language restrictions. The authors also searched reference lists and contacted experts.

Study Selection

Observational or subgroups of randomized studies that included non-dialysis-dependent patients with varying degrees of renal function who were treated with LMWH and reported creatinine clearance and anti-Xa levels or major bleeding.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data on patient characteristics, renal function, LMWH treatment, anti-Xa levels, and major bleeding. The pooled odds ratio of major bleeding in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less was calculated by using the Peto method.

Data Synthesis

Eighteen studies using 3 preparations of LMWH (15 studies using enoxaparin, 2 using tinzaparin, and 1 using dalteparin) were included. Peak anti-Xa levels measured 4 hours after a subcutaneous injection were statistically significantly higher in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less compared with those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min in studies that used a standard therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (4 studies) but not in studies of empirically dose-adjusted enoxaparin (3 studies). Data were insufficient to assess the relationship between anti-Xa and renal function for prophylactic doses of enoxaparin and therapeutic doses of tinzaparin or dalteparin. In 12 studies involving 4971 patients, LMWH was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk for major bleeding in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less compared with those with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min (5.0% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.19 to 4.27]; P = 0.013). When analyzed according to LMWH preparation, major bleeding was increased when a standard therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was used (8.3% vs. 2.4%; odds ratio, 3.88 [CI, 1.78 to 8.45]) but may not be increased when an empirically adjusted dose of enoxaparin is used (0.9% vs. 1.9%; odds ratio, 0.58 [CI, 0.09 to 3.78]; P = 0.23 for heterogeneity). There were insufficient studies to assess the risk for major bleeding with tinzaparin, dalteparin, and prophylactic doses of enoxaparin.

Limitations

The data for tinzaparin and dalteparin were limited. Data are observational, and the potential for confounding cannot be excluded.

Conclusions

Non-dialysis-dependent patients with a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less who are treated with standard therapeutic doses of enoxaparin have elevated levels of anti-Xa and an increased risk for major bleeding. Empirical dose adjustment of enoxaparin may reduce the risk for bleeding and merits additional evaluation. No conclusions can be made regarding other LMWHs.

### Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for venous thromboembolism [^114XrhPD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) have been shown to be effective and safe in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), and may also be effective for the initial treatment of VTE.

Objectives

To determine the effect of LMWH compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the initial treatment of VTE.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified from the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL and LILACS. Colleagues and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing fixed dose subcutaneous LMWH with adjusted dose intravenous or subcutaneous UFH in people with VTE.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers assessed trials for inclusion and quality, and extracted data independently.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies were included (n = 8867). Thrombotic complications occurred in 151/4181 (3.6%) participants treated with LMWH, compared with 211/3941 (5.4%) participants treated with UFH (odds ratio (OR) 0.68; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.55 to 0.84, 18 trials). Thrombus size was reduced in 53% of participants treated with LMWH and 45% treated with UFH (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81, 12 trials). Major haemorrhages occurred in 41/3500 (1.2%) participants treated with LMWH, compared with 73/3624 (2.0%) participants treated with UFH (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.83, 19 trials). In eighteen trials, 187/4193 (4.5%) participants treated with LMWH died, compared with 233/3861 (6.0%) participants treated with UFH (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92). Nine studies (n = 4451) examined proximal thrombosis; 2192 participants treated with LMWH and 2259 with UFH. Subgroup analysis showed statistically significant reductions favouring LMWH in thrombotic complications and major haemorrhage. By the end of follow up, 80 (3.6%) participants treated with LMWH had thrombotic complications, compared with 143 (6.3%) treated with UFH (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.75). Major haemorrhage occurred in 18 (1.0%) participants treated with LMWH, compared with 37 (2.1%) treated with UFH (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85). Nine studies (n = 4157) showed a statistically significant reduction favouring LMWH with respect to mortality. By the end of follow up, 3.3% (70/2094) of participants treated with LMWH had died, compared with 5.3% (110/2063) of participants treated with UFH (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.84).

Reviewers' Conclusions

LMWH is more effective than UFH for the initial treatment of VTE. LMWH significantly reduces the occurrence of major haemorrhage during initial treatment and overall mortality at follow up.

### Low molecular weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin for perioperative thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer [^115Ce6j1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The choice of the appropriate perioperative thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer depends on the relative benefits and harms of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Objectives

To update a systematic review of the evidence for the relative efficacy and safety of LMWH and UFH for perioperative thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search for trials of anticoagulation in patients with cancer including a February 2013 electronic search of: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also handsearched conference proceedings, reviewed reference list of included studies, used the 'related citations' feature in PubMed, and searched clinicaltrials.gov for ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled patients with cancer undergoing a surgical intervention and compared the effects of LMWH to UFH on mortality, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), bleeding outcomes, or thrombocytopenia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently used a standardized form to extract in duplicate data on participants, interventions, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Where possible, we conducted meta-analyses using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Of 9559 identified unique citations, we included 16 RCTs with 12,890 patients with cancer, all using preoperative prophylactic anticoagulation. We identified no new study with this update. The overall quality of evidence was moderate. The meta-analyses did not conclusively rule out either a beneficial or harmful effect of LMWH compared with UFH for the following outcomes: mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.08), PE (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.54), symptomatic DVT (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.20 to 1.28), asymptomatic DVT (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.01), major bleeding (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.37), and minor bleeding (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.79). LMWH was associated with lower incidence of wound hematoma (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88) but higher volume of intraoperative transfusion (mean difference (MD) 74 mL; 95% CI 47 to 102). The meta-analyses found no statistically significant differences for any of the following outcomes: reoperation for bleeding (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.06 to 8.48), intraoperative blood loss (MD = -6mL; 95% CI -87 to 74), postoperative transfusion (MD = 79mL; 95% CI -54 to 211), postoperative drain volume (MD = 27mL; 95% CI -44 to 98), and thrombocytopenia (RR 1.33; 95% CI 0.59 to 3.00).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no difference between perioperative thromboprophylaxis with LMWH versus UFH in their effects on mortality, thromboembolic outcomes, major bleeding, or minor bleeding in patients with cancer. Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and harms of different heparin thromboprophylaxis strategies in this population more thoroughly.

### Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism [^112WwGzf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be effective and safe in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE). They may also be effective for the initial treatment of VTE. This is the third update of the Cochrane Review first published in 1999.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin compared to adjusted dose unfractionated heparin (intravenous or subcutaneous) for the initial treatment of people with venous thromboembolism (acute deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (15 September 2016). In addition the CIS searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library (searched 15 September 2016) and trials' registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing fixed dose subcutaneous LMWH with adjusted dose intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UFH) in people with VTE.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed for quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Six studies were added to this update resulting in a total of 29 included studies (n = 10,390). The quality of the studies was downgraded as there was a risk of bias in some individual studies relating to risk of attrition and reporting bias; in addition several studies did not adequately report on the randomisation methods used nor on how the treatment allocation was concealed. During the initial treatment period, the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolic events was lower in participants treated with LMWH than in participants treated with UFH (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to 0.98; 6238 participants; 18 studies; P = 0.04; moderate-quality evidence). After a follow-up of three months, the period in most of the studies for which oral anticoagulant therapy was given, the incidence of recurrent VTE was lower in participants treated with LMWH than in participants with UFH (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.90; 6661 participants; 16 studies; P = 0.005; moderate-quality evidence). Furthermore, at the end of follow-up, LMWH was associated with a lower rate of recurrent VTE than UFH (Peto OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.88; 9489 participants; 22 studies; P = 0.001; moderate-quality evidence). LMWH was also associated with a reduction in thrombus size compared to UFH (Peto OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.82; 2909 participants; 16 studies; P < 0.00001; low-quality evidence), but there was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 56%). Major haemorrhages occurred less frequently in participants treated with LMWH than in those treated with UFH (Peto OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 8780 participants; 25 studies; P = 0.02; moderate-quality evidence). There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH (Peto OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; 9663 participants; 24 studies; P = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review presents moderate-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced the incidence of recurrent thrombotic complications and occurrence of major haemorrhage during initial treatment; and low-quality evidence that fixed dose LMWH reduced thrombus size when compared to UFH for the initial treatment of VTE. There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with UFH (moderate-quality evidence). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria and downgraded due to concerns over risk of bias in individual trials together with a lack of reporting on the randomisation and concealment of treatment allocation methods used. The quality of the evidence for reduction of thrombus size was further downgraded because of heterogeneity between studies.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112rPwmf]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) dialysis anticoagulation — low‑molecular‑weight heparin (LMWH) dosing and monitoring are outlined. "The doses of low-molecular-weight heparin, as provided by the manufacturers, should be adapted to the bleeding risk of the individual patient". "Dose reduction may also be required in patients receiving daily dialysis, which increases the risk of accumulation". Because many AKI patients need deep‑vein thrombosis prophylaxis, timing the prophylactic dose at the start of dialysis "may serve the two purposes". With prolonged use, "Periodic measurement of anti-Factor Xa levels may be useful".

### Effect of weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus fixed-dose prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin on venous thromboembolism among noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19: the COVI-DOSE trial, a multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4 trial [^113Rjx5a]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomization and masking

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an intermediate weight-adjusted prophylactic dose (experimental arm) or a fixed-dose (control arm) of low-molecular-weight heparin. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated allocation sequence, with permuted blocks of two, four and six and stratified according to center and hospitalization setting at inclusion (medical wards versus intensive care units). The randomization was centrally conducted through an interactive online system.

Treatments

The experimental and control low-molecular-weight heparin regimens are presented in Table 1 and in the protocol available at. In the experimental arm and regardless of the hospitalization setting, patients received an increased weight-adjusted intermediate dose of low-molecular-weight heparin ranging from a double standard dose (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 UI twice daily for < 50 kg) to a higher dose (e.g. enoxaparin 7000 UI twice daily for ≥ 100 kg). In the control arm, patients admitted to the medical wards received a fixed standard dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 UI once daily), while patients from the intensive care units received a fixed doubled standard dose (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 UI twice daily). The heparin doses might have changed during hospitalization and after inclusion based on predefined criteria in case of a) creatinine clearance modifications overtime (both arms) and b) transfert from wards to intensive care unit and vice-versa (control arm only). For instance, regardless of the group of randomization, a patient with a drop of creatinine clearance from > 30 to ≤ 30 mL/min will be prescribed a lower dose of low-molecular-weight heparin according to Table 1. For patients randomized in the control arm only, low-molecular-weight heparin doses are doubled in case of transfert from the medical wards to intensive care unit or decreased by 50% in case of transfert from intensive care unit to the medical ward except for patients with a history of mechanical ventilation. The trial treatment was administered during the entire hospital stay (maximal duration of 28 days). Beyond this delay, the treatment and the dose prescribed were left to the discretion of the investigator. Laboratory (platelet testing) and clinical follow-up of the heparin treatment were applied in accordance with current clinical practice.

### Effect of weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus fixed-dose prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin on venous thromboembolism among noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19: the COVI-DOSE trial, a multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4 trial [^1143uVqB]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in medical wards or intensive care units, an intermediate weight-adjusted prophylactic dose versus a standard fixed-dose of low-molecular-weight heparin did not result in a reduction in either the risk of venous thromboembolism or mortality and was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Whether an increased intermediate-dose of anticoagulation might reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and improve the prognosis of COVID-19 requires additional evaluation based on randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses, such as those conducted on behalf of the World Health Organization Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID-19 Therapies Working Groupor the International Network of VENous Thromboembolism (INVENT) Clinical Research Networks.

High-risk venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients not at high risk for major bleeding — mortality benefit with heparin prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis: Among patients who are at high risk for VTE (~6.0%) but not at high risk for major bleeding complications, there is high-quality evidence that compared with no prophylaxis, low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) will result in one to eight fewer deaths from pulmonary embolism (PE), and there is moderate-quality evidence that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis may result in six fewer (95% CI, nine fewer to one more) deaths from PE.

### Effect of weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus fixed-dose prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin on venous thromboembolism among noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19: the COVI-DOSE trial, a multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4 trial [^112fTvyq]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The COVI-DOSE study, which involved 1000 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in medical wards or intensive care units, did not show that an intermediate weight-adjusted prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin reduced the risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared to that with a fixed prophylactic dose. Importantly, an intermediate dose was associated with a near 2-fold increased risk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

To our knowledge, few trials compared intermediate weight-adjusted prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin versus fixed prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin in COVID-19 patients, most of them included critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units or with laboratory evidence of coagulopathy. These trials failed to demonstrate the benefit of an increased intermediate (nontherapeutic) weight-adjusted dose using low-molecular-weight heparin for several outcomes, including thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mortality, probably due to either a lack of power or the absence of a treatment effect or both. Together with these studies, we confirm the lack of superiority of weight-based intermediate dose low-molecular-weight heparin versus standard fixed prophylactic dose in critically ill patients. Similarly, in other trials assessing the effect of therapeutic versus standard dose anticoagulation in critically ill patients, higher doses had no effect on efficacy but induced a higher risk of bleeding.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 197: inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy [^1118t5hM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Anticoagulation regimen definitions in pregnancy outline dosing for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH): prophylactic LMWH options include enoxaparin, 40 mg SC once daily; dalteparin, 5,000 units SC once daily; tinzaparin, 4,500 units SC once daily; and nadroparin 2,850 units SC once daily. Intermediate-dose LMWH is enoxaparin 40 mg SC every 12 hours or dalteparin 5,000 units SC every 12 hours. Adjusted-dose (therapeutic) LMWH regimens include enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg every 12 hours; dalteparin, 200 units/kg once daily; tinzaparin, 175 units/kg once daily; and dalteparin, 100 units/kg every 12 hours, with a target anti-Xa level in the therapeutic range of 0.6–1.0 units/ mL 4 hours after last injection for twice-daily regimens, and slightly higher doses may be needed for a once-daily regimen. Prophylactic UFH is UFH, 5,000–7,500 units SC every 12 hours in first trimester; UFH, 7,500–10,000 units SC every 12 hours in the second trimester; and UFH, 10,000 units SC every 12 hours in the third trimester, unless the aPTT is elevated. Adjusted-dose (therapeutic) UFH is UFH, 10,000 units or more SC every 12 hours in doses adjusted to target aPTT in the therapeutic range (1.5–2.5 × control) 6 hours after injection. Postpartum anticoagulation may include prophylactic, intermediate, or adjusted dose LMWH for 6–8 weeks, and oral anticoagulants may be considered postpartum based upon planned duration of therapy, lactation, and patient preference; surveillance consists of clinical vigilance with objective investigation of symptoms and VTE risk assessment prepregnancy or early in pregnancy, repeated if complications develop, particularly those necessitating hospitalization/prolonged immobility. Footnotes specify that at extremes of body weight, modification of dose may be required and that adjusted-dose regimens are also referred to as weight-adjusted, full treatment dose.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^112YbLhx]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) — agent selection and dosing for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis emphasize low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as the preferred agent; LMWH is considered superior to unfractionated heparin (UFH) for VTE prophylaxis in trauma patients without TBI and is associated with lower VTE rates and comparable ICH progression rates compared with UFH in both operative and nonoperative TBI patients. For enoxaparin, current best practice dosing in general trauma is 40 mg every 12 hours, whereas because of insufficient and specific research in TBI, an initial regimen of 30 mg every 12 hours is recommended for patients with TBI; if using dalteparin, standard dosing is recommended, and consider monitoring anti-factor Xa activity levels to guide subsequent LMWH dosing. If UFH is chosen, best practice is to dose at 5000 units every 8 hours, and use of prophylactic inferior vena cava filters is no longer recommended for TBI patients regardless of timing; the indication for filter placement is the presence of a known VTE in a patient with contraindication for therapeutic anticoagulation.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin use in the obese, elderly, and in renal insufficiency [^111XTXAR]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Superior bioavailability and simple weight-based dosing have made low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) the preferred agents for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for most indications. Despite improved pharmacokinetics, there remain populations where appropriate LMWH dose intensity and frequency are open to question. Obese patients have a lower proportion of lean body mass as a percentage of total body weight. As a result, LMWH dosing based on total body weight could cause supra-therapeutic anticoagulation. Elderly patients also have less lean body mass in addition to a higher incidence of age-related renal disease and increased risk of bleeding. Renal insufficiency presents a risk of LMWH accumulation as well as increased risk of bleeding. Among LMWH products, only dalteparin labeling recommends a maximum dose. Prospective data call into question the validity of this dose limitation. Additionally, because obese patients are already at higher risk of VTE recurrence, they may be particularly sensitive to subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Prospective data evaluating LMWH use in elderly patients have been limited to in-patient treatment. Few recommendations can be made in this population other than close monitoring. Renal insufficiency is a risk for bleeding during LMWH use. Available evidence supports the potential for enoxaparin accumulation, but not tinzaparin. Enoxaparin dose adjustment, either empiric or based on anti-Xa monitoring, has insufficient data to support widespread implementation. Unfractionated heparin is not reliant on renal elimination and is a sensible option for VTE treatment in patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Current guidelines recommend routine venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with prophylactic‐dose low molecular weight heparin in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The clinical role of higher‐dose anticoagulation remains unknown.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ This meta‐analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of higher‐dose anticoagulation compared with prophylactic‐dose anticoagulation.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ There is currently insufficient evidence of survival benefit of therapeutic‐dose or intermediate‐dose anticoagulation compared with prophylactic‐dose anticoagulation in noncritically ill and in critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID‐19. Further, this analysis does not support the routine use of d‐dimer as an isolated biomarker to guide anticoagulation dose escalation.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMA‐COLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Our findings do not support the routine use of therapeutic‐dose or intermediate‐dose anticoagulation. Patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 should continue to receive prophylactic‐dose anticoagulation according to current guidelines.

### Benefits and harms of direct oral anticoagulation and low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113zFPLf]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To systematically compare the effect of direct oral anticoagulants and low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis on the benefits and harms to patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), up to August 2021.

Review methods

Randomised controlled trials in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery were selected, comparing low molecular weight heparin (prophylactic (low) or higher dose) with direct oral anticoagulants or with no active treatment. Main outcomes were symptomatic venous thromboembolism, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and major bleeding. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for network meta-analyses. Abstracts and full texts were screened independently in duplicate. Data were abstracted on study participants, interventions, and outcomes, and risk of bias was assessed independently in duplicate. Frequentist network meta-analysis with multivariate random effects models provided odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) assessments indicated the certainty of the evidence.

Results

68 randomised controlled trials were included (51 orthopaedic, 10 general, four gynaecological, two thoracic, and one urological surgery), involving 45 445 patients. Low dose (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.67) and high dose (0.19, 0.07 to 0.54) low molecular weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants (0.17, 0.07 to 0.41) reduced symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared with no active treatment, with absolute risk differences of 1–100 per 1000 patients, depending on baseline risks (certainty of evidence, moderate to high). None of the active agents reduced symptomatic pulmonary embolism (certainty of evidence, low to moderate). Direct oral anticoagulants and low molecular weight heparin were associated with a 2-3-fold increase in the odds of major bleeding compared with no active treatment (certainty of evidence, moderate to high), with absolute risk differences as high as 50 per 1000 in patients at high risk. Compared with low dose low molecular weight heparin, high dose low molecular weight heparin did not reduce symptomatic venous thromboembolism (0.57, 0.26 to 1.27) but increased major bleeding (1.87, 1.06 to 3.31); direct oral anticoagulants reduced symptomatic venous thromboembolism (0.53, 0.32 to 0.89) and did not increase major bleeding (1.23, 0.89 to 1.69).

Conclusions

Direct oral anticoagulants and low molecular weight heparin reduced venous thromboembolism compared with no active treatment but probably increased major bleeding to a similar extent. Direct oral anticoagulants probably prevent symptomatic venous thromboembolism to a greater extent than prophylactic low molecular weight heparin.

### Patients requiring interruption of long-term oral anticoagulant therapy: the use of fixed sub-therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin [^116ARy2i]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

We tested the efficacy and safety of fixed doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients requiring interruption of vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) because of invasive procedures.

Methodology

Preoperatively, patients discontinued VKA for 5 ± 1 days; in those at low risk for thrombosis, LMWH was given at a prophylactic dosage of 3800 UI (nadroparin) or 4000 UI (enoxaparin) anti-factor (F) Xa once daily the night before the procedure. In patients at high risk for thrombosis, LMWH was started early after VKA cessation and given at fixed sub-therapeutic doses (3800 or 4000 UI anti-FXa twice daily) until surgery. Postoperatively, LMWH was reinitiated 12 h after procedure while VKA was reinitiated the day after. Heparin was continued until a therapeutic INR value was reached. The primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of thromboembolism and major bleeding from VKA suspension (because of surgery) up to 30 ± 2 days postprocedure.

Results

A total of 328 patients (55.4% at low risk and 44.6% at high risk for thrombosis) were enrolled; 103 (31.4%) underwent major surgery and 225 (68.6%) non-major invasive procedures. Overall, thromboembolic events occurred in six patients (1.8%, 95% confidence interval 0.4–3.2), five belonging to the high-risk group and one belonging to the low-risk group. Overall, major bleeding occurred in seven patients (2.1%, 95 confidence interval 0.6–3.6), six patients belonged to the high-risk group and one belonged to the low-risk group; most of the events occurred in the high-risk group during major surgery.

Conclusion

LMWH given at fixed sub-therapeutic doses appears to be a feasible and safe approach for bridging therapy in chronic anticoagulated patients.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112hddvK]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — clinical features and population-specific incidence — is characterized by thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 × 10⁹/L) occurring in 85% to 90% of patients; when defined as a 30%-50% platelet count fall even if the nadir remains > 150 × 10⁹/L, this increases to 90% to 95% of HIT cases. The characteristic onset of the platelet count fall is 5 to 10 days after heparin initiation (first day = day 0), but "rapid-onset HIT" is an abrupt fall within 24 h in patients with circulating HIT antibodies from recent exposure (usually within the last month, occasionally as long as 100 days earlier), and "delayed-onset HIT" can occur as long as 3 weeks after cessation. In up to 25% of patients with HIT, thrombosis precedes thrombocytopenia. Among cardiac surgery patients, approximately 50% develop HIT antibodies but only 1% to 2% develop clinical HIT, and platelet counts fall by approximately 35% immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass. Incidence estimates (minimum of 4-d exposure) include: postoperative patients receiving heparin prophylactic dose 1–5, therapeutic dose 1–5, heparin flushes 0.1–1, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) 0.1–1; cardiac surgery patients 1–3; medical settings such as patients with cancer 0.1, heparin prophylactic or therapeutic dose 0.1, LMWH 0.6, intensive care patients 0.4, heparin flushes < 0.1, and obstetrics patients < 0.1.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: may 2021 update on the use of intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients [^112ZRj2U]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendation 1a

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁◯◯).

Remarks:
The ASH guideline panel plans to continue to update this recommendation when the full results of other trials become available. Clinicians should weigh the benefits and harms based on the most up-to-date evidence in caring for their patients.
A now-expired recommendation published on 27 October 2020 compared therapeutic-intensity or intermediate-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness. With the emergence of new evidence, this recommendation has now been split into 2 recommendations: a recommendation comparing intermediate-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation (Recommendation 1a) and a separate recommendation comparing therapeutic-intensity with prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation (Recommendation 1b), whereby the latter remains unchanged for now, but, as with other recommendations in this guideline, is subject to review and revision as new evidence becomes available that meets prespecified criteria for updating.
Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life-threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Examples include patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy.
An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. Risk assessment models to estimate thrombotic and bleeding risk in hospitalized patients are available, but they have not been prospectively validated in patients with COVID-19.
At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants. The selection of a specific agent (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH], unfractionated heparin [UFH]) may be based on availability, resources required, familiarity, and the aim of minimizing the use of personal protective equipment or exposure of staff to COVID-19–infected patients as well as patient-specific factors (eg, renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, concerns about gastrointestinal tract absorption).
This recommendation does not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or continuous renal replacement therapy.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115Lvtn5]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — definition and dosing targets defines heparin bridging as administration of a short-acting anticoagulant, typically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH), for an 8- to 10-day perioperative period during interruption of a VKA when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below the therapeutic range. A heparin bridging regimen is therapeutic-dose (or full-dose) LMWH, for example enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, or full-dose UFH to achieve a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2-times the control aPTT or a target anti-factor Xa level of 0.35–0.70 IU/mL. Although intermediate-dose LMWH regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid) have been referred to as bridging, the definition and associated recommendations pertain to therapeutic-dose heparin bridging to prevent arterial thromboembolism (ATE), and this is the bridging dose regimen that has been most widely studied; heparin bridging should also be distinguished from perioperative use of low-dose LMWH (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg daily, dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) administered for prophylaxis against postoperative VTE rather than prevention of ATE.

Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), up to August 2021.

Review Methods

Randomised controlled trials in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery were selected, comparing low molecular weight heparin (prophylactic (low) or higher dose) with direct oral anticoagulants or with no active treatment. Main outcomes were symptomatic venous thromboembolism, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and major bleeding. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for network meta-analyses. Abstracts and full texts were screened independently in duplicate. Data were abstracted on study participants, interventions, and outcomes, and risk of bias was assessed independently in duplicate. Frequentist network meta-analysis with multivariate random effects models provided odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) assessments indicated the certainty of the evidence.

Results

68 randomised controlled trials were included (51 orthopaedic, 10 general, four gynaecological, two thoracic, and one urological surgery), involving 45445 patients. Low dose (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.67) and high dose (0.19, 0.07 to 0.54) low molecular weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants (0.17, 0.07 to 0.41) reduced symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared with no active treatment, with absolute risk differences of 1–100 per 1000 patients, depending on baseline risks (certainty of evidence, moderate to high). None of the active agents reduced symptomatic pulmonary embolism (certainty of evidence, low to moderate). Direct oral anticoagulants and low molecular weight heparin were associated with a 2-3-fold increase in the odds of major bleeding compared with no active treatment (certainty of evidence, moderate to high), with absolute risk differences as high as 50 per 1000 in patients at high risk. Compared with low dose low molecular weight heparin, high dose low molecular weight heparin did not reduce symptomatic venous thromboembolism (0.57, 0.26 to 1.27) but increased major bleeding (1.87, 1.06 to 3.31); direct oral anticoagulants reduced symptomatic venous thromboembolism (0.53, 0.32 to 0.89) and did not increase major bleeding (1.23, 0.89 to 1.69).

Conclusions

Direct oral anticoagulants and low molecular weight heparin reduced venous thromboembolism compared with no active treatment but probably increased major bleeding to a similar extent. Direct oral anticoagulants probably prevent symptomatic venous thromboembolism to a greater extent than prophylactic low molecular weight heparin.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^1117NJHA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines addressing the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients are heterogeneous and their implementation has been suboptimal worldwide.

Objectives

To establish a common international consensus addressing practical, clinically relevant questions in this setting.

Methods

An international consensus working group of experts was set up to develop guidelines according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system.

Results

For the initial treatment of established VTE: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended [1B]; fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be also used [2D]; thrombolysis may only be considered on a case-by-case basis [Best clinical practice (Guidance)]; vena cava filters (VCF) may be considered if contraindication to anticoagulation or pulmonary embolism recurrence under optimal anticoagulation; periodic reassessment of contraindications to anticoagulation is recommended and anticoagulation should be resumed when safe; VCF are not recommended for primary VTE prophylaxis in cancer patients [Guidance]. For the early maintenance (10 days to 3 months) and long-term (beyond 3 months) treatment of established VTE, LMWH for a minimum of 3 months is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) [1A]; idraparinux is not recommended [2C]; after 3–6 months, LMWH or VKA continuation should be based on individual evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, tolerability, patient preference and cancer activity [Guidance]. For the treatment of VTE recurrence in cancer patients under anticoagulation, three options can be considered: (i) switch from VKA to LMWH when treated with VKA; (ii) increase in LMWH dose when treated with LMWH, and (iii) VCF insertion [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in surgical cancer patients, use of LMWH o.d. or low dose of UFH t.i.d. is recommended; pharmacological prophylaxis should be started 12–2 h preoperatively and continued for at least 7–10 days; there are no data allowing conclusion that one type of LMWH is superior to another [1A]; there is no evidence to support fondaparinux as an alternative to LMWH [2C]; use of the highest prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended [1A]; extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) after major laparotomy may be indicated in cancer patients with a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding [2B]; the use of LMWH for VTE prevention in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may be recommended as for laparotomy [Guidance]; mechanical methods are not recommended as monotherapy except when pharmacological methods are contraindicated [2C]. For the prophylaxis of VTE in hospitalized medical patients with cancer and reduced mobility, we recommend prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux [1B]; for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with l-asparaginase, depending on local policy and patient characteristics, prophylaxis may be considered in some patients [Guidance]; in patients receiving chemotherapy, prophylaxis is not recommended routinely [1B]; primary pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE may be indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic [1B] or lung [2B] cancer treated with chemotherapy and having a low risk of bleeding; in patients treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide combined with steroids and/or chemotherapy, VTE prophylaxis is recommended; in this setting, VKA at low or therapeutic doses, LMWH at prophylactic doses and low-dose aspirin have shown similar effects; however, the efficacy of these regimens remains unclear [2C]. Special situations include brain tumors, severe renal failure (CrCl < 30 mL min⁻¹), thrombocytopenia and pregnancy. Guidances are provided in these contexts.

Conclusions

Dissemination and implementation of good clinical practice for the management of VTE, the second cause of death in cancer patients, is a major public health priority.

### Heparin-induced osteoporosis and pregnancy [^113uYWqy]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Osteoporosis is the most common serious side effect of long-term unfractionated heparin use. Until recently, it was unknown whether long-term low-molecular-weight heparin was associated with any change in bone mineral density. With increasing long-term low-molecular-weight heparin use, for a variety of indications, this was an important knowledge gap.

Recent Findings

We recently completed an a-priori planned substudy to assess the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on bone mineral density in an ongoing multicenter multinational randomized trial designed to compare the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis on pregnancy outcomes in thrombophilic pregnant women. The results revealed that there is no significant difference in mean bone mineral density between a low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis group and a no prophylaxis group. The study was not adequately powered to detect differences in absolute fracture risk.

Summary

Recent results suggest that the use of long-term prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin in pregnancy is not associated with a significant decrease in bone mineral density. Whether higher doses might be a risk factor for osteoporosis is still an unanswered question. It is also possible that subgroups are more susceptible. Overall, women should be reassured regarding the risk of osteoporosis associated with the use of prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin during their pregnancy.

Prior VTE in pregnancy — antepartum and postpartum prophylaxis: For all pregnant women with prior VTE, we suggest postpartum prophylaxis for 6 weeks with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or vitamin K antagonists targeted at INR 2.0 to 3.0 rather than no prophylaxis (Grade 2B). For pregnant women at low risk of recurrent VTE (single episode of VTE associated with a transient risk factor not related to pregnancy or use of estrogen), we suggest clinical vigilance antepartum rather than antepartum prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For pregnant women at moderate to high risk of recurrent VTE (single unprovoked VTE, pregnancy- or estrogen-related VTE, or multiple prior unprovoked VTE not receiving long-term anticoagulation), we suggest antepartum prophylaxis with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH rather than clinical vigilance or routine care (Grade 2C). For pregnant women receiving long-term vitamin K antagonists, we suggest adjusted-dose LMWH or 75% of a therapeutic dose of LMWH throughout pregnancy followed by resumption of long-term anticoagulants postpartum, rather than prophylactic-dose LMWH (Grade 2C).

### Low-molecular-weight heparins in renal impairment and obesity: available evidence and clinical practice recommendations across medical and surgical settings [^111Ws7HT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop practical recommendations for the use of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) as prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and acute coronary syndromes in patients with impaired renal function or obesity.

Data Sources

Multiple MEDLINE searches were performed (November 2008) to identify studies for inclusion, using a comprehensive list of search terms including, but not limited to, LMWH, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, obesity, weight, renal, kidney, elderly, monitoring, and anti-Xa.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Only articles published in English that were relevant for this review were included.

Data Synthesis

In the majority of patients, standardized prophylaxis or treatment doses of LMWHs can be used without the need for monitoring and adjusting regimens. For patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 30 mL/min), doses of some LMWHs should be adjusted or unfractionated heparin should be used instead. CrCl should be estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault method. Differences are noted in the degree of accumulation of various LMWHs in patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment, and thus, the degree of dose adjustment may differ among the various LMWHs. Increasing the prophylactic doses of LMWH may be appropriate in morbidly obese patients (body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m(2)). The use of total body weight is appropriate for therapeutic doses of LMWH in obese patients. Laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulation effect of LMWHs is generally not necessary, but should be considered in patients with morbid obesity (weight > 190 kg), those with severe renal impairment, and those with moderate renal impairment with prolonged (> 10 days) LMWH use. When anti-Xa activity is monitored, it should be determined using a chromogenic method and a calibration curve based on the LMWH used.

Conclusions

Additional data are needed for specific dose guiding in obese and renally impaired patients, who are often excluded from larger clinical trials. Practice recommendations are made based on available evidence and authors' clinical opinions.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) pharmacokinetics — after subcutaneous injection, the bioavailability of LMWHs is about 90%, with an elimination half-life of 3 to 6 h and anti-Xa levels peaking 3 to 5 h after dosing; LMWHs are predominately cleared by the kidneys and their biologic half-life may be prolonged in patients with renal failure.

### VTE, thrombophilia, antithrombotic therapy, and pregnancy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112y769L]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Prevention of pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women with thrombophilia — recommendation 9.2.1 applies to pregnant women with no prior history of VTE who are homozygous for factor V Leiden or the prothrombin 20210A mutation and have a positive family history of VTE, and it states that "we suggest" antepartum prophylaxis with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and postpartum prophylaxis for 6 weeks with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist targeted to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 rather than no prophylaxis (Grade 2B). When antepartum prophylaxis is used, it should be commenced as early as possible in the first trimester, and for postpartum prophylaxis a vitamin K antagonist targeted to an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is considered an appropriate alternative to LMWH except in protein C or S deficiency due to risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

### Prevention of venous thromboembolism: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111WxCnk]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article discusses the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following. We recommend against the use of aspirin alone as thromboprophylaxis for any patient group (Grade 1A). For moderate-risk general surgery patients, we recommend prophylaxis with low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH) (5,000 U bid) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) [≤ 3,400 U once daily] (both Grade 1A). For higher risk general surgery patients, we recommend thromboprophylaxis with LDUH (5,000 U tid) or LMWH (> 3,400 U daily) [both Grade 1A]. For high-risk general surgery patients with multiple risk factors, we recommend combining pharmacologic methods (LDUH three times daily or LMWH, > 3,400 U daily) with the use of graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 1C+). We recommend that thromboprophylaxis be used in all patients undergoing major gynecologic surgery (Grade 1A) or major, open urologic procedures, and we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH two times or three times daily (Grade 1A). For patients undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty, we recommend one of the following three anticoagulant agents: LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [international normalized ratio (INR) target, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0] (all Grade 1A). For patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS), we recommend the routine use of fondaparinux (Grade 1A), LMWH (Grade 1C+), VKA (target INR, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B], or LDUH (Grade 1B). We recommend that patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, or HFS receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days (Grade 1A). We recommend that all trauma patients with at least one risk factor for VTE receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A). In acutely ill medical patients who have been admitted to the hospital with congestive heart failure or severe respiratory disease, or who are confined to bed and have one or more additional risk factors, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH (Grade 1A) or LMWH (Grade 1A). We recommend, on admission to the intensive care unit, all patients be assessed for their risk of VTE. Accordingly, most patients should receive thromboprophylaxis (Grade 1A).

### Effect of weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus fixed-dose prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin on venous thromboembolism among noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19: the COVI-DOSE trial, a multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4 trial [^117EykRN]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding more than doubled in the experimental arm versus the control arm. At the beginning of the pandemic, the main goal of a randomized controlled trial was to decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism considering the adverse effect of bleeding induced by high doses of anticoagulation. Bikdeli et al. concluded that, among patients admitted to intensive care units with COVID-19, weight-adjusted intermediate anticoagulation was associated with a 2-fold increased risk –though not reaching significance– of clinically relevant nonmajor bleedingcompared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, which was similar to our finding. Of note, even if non-major bleeding are clinically relevant, only major bleeding have been shown to be strongly associated with mortality and should be the only relevant safety endpoint in a benefit/risk analysis when paired with symptomatic venous thromboembolism (which is also clearly associated with mortality). For this reason, we included the net clinical benefit as an outcome and failed at demonstrating its significant improvement between both arms.

Finally, death from any cause was not significantly decreased by our intervention regardless of the hospitalization setting, similar to previous trials performed in intensive care units only.

To our knowledge, our trial is one of the largest randomized controlled trial assessing an intermediate weight-adjusted dose of low-molecular-weight heparin versus a standard dose, especially in noncritically ill patients with COVID-19. Patients were prospectively followed with careful documentation of outcomes and adverse events. Loss to follow-up was very low, as was the rate of withdrawal of consent. For pragmatic reasons and due to the urgent need for evidence, an open-label design was used, which is subject to risk of bias. However, the randomization method used ensured concealment, all analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis, and all effectiveness and safety outcomes were adjudicated by a central clinical adjudication committee unaware of the treatment allocation.

Anticoagulation regimen shorthand — unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) — is defined as follows: adjusted-dose UFH is UFH subcutaneously every 12 h titrated to a midinterval aPTT in the therapeutic range; prophylactic LMWH examples include dalteparin 5,000 units every 24 h, tinzaparin 4,500 units every 24 h, nadroparin 2,850 units every 24 h, or enoxaparin 40 mg every 24 h; intermediate-dose LMWH examples include dalteparin 5,000 units every 12 h or enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 h; and adjusted-dose LMWH consists of weight-adjusted or full-treatment dosing once daily or bid (eg, dalteparin 200 units/kg or tinzaparin 175 units/kg once daily or dalteparin 100 units/kg every 12 h or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 h).

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and venous thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^111VqFkS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

In the context of COVID-19, another consideration is the frequency of dosing. Unfractionated heparin prophylaxis is often administered twice or thrice daily, whereas LMWH, especially enoxaparin, is dosed daily. International guidelines also state that once-daily regimens of LMWH may be advantageous over UFH because missed doses may be associated with worse outcomes, will reduce healthcare worker exposure, and conserve personal protective equipment.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1) In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either LMWH or UFH for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and moderate quality of evidence).
2) If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for VTE prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers (UG best practice statement).
3) We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
4) Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of "enhanced" or "intermediate" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs (weak recommendation and low quality of evidence).
5) In hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).
6) If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with IPC devices or GCS for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs (strong recommendation and low quality of evidence).

How should clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19–related VTE be managed in LMICs?

Rationale.

Management of VTE requires timely diagnosis, knowledge of risk factors for both thrombosis and bleeding, safe administration of medications, and ability to monitor, when indicated. Clinical suspicion for PE should arise if a patient develops a sudden deterioration of oxygenation, respiratory distress, or hypotension disproportional to pulmonary involvement by COVID-19. According to COVID-19 clinical management guidelines from the WHO, NIH, and various societies, patients with suspected or confirmed VTE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation as would be indicated in those without COVID-19. The optimal approach to managing VTE related to COVID-19 in LMICs remains unknown.

EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Venous thromboembolism is a major complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We hypothesized that a weight-adjusted intermediate dose of anticoagulation may decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism COVID-19 patients.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4, superiority trial with blinded adjudication of outcomes, we randomly assigned adult patients hospitalised in 20 French centers and presenting with acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive an intermediate weight-adjusted prophylactic dose or a fixed-dose of subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin during the hospital stay. The primary outcome corresponded to symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (fatal) pulmonary embolism during hospitalization (COVI-DOSEnumber:).

Findings

Between May 2020, and April 2021, 1000 patients underwent randomisation in medical wards (noncritically ill) (80.1%) and intensive care units (critically ill) (19.9%); 502 patients were assigned to receive a weight-adjusted intermediate dose, and 498 received fixed-dose thromboprophylaxis. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred in 6 of 502 patients (1.2%) in the weight-adjusted dose group and in 10 of 498 patients (2.1%) in the fixed-dose group (subdistribution hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.22–1.63; P = 0.31). There was a twofold increased risk of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding: 5.9% in the weight-adjusted dose group and 3.1% in the fixed-dose group (P = 0.034).

Interpretation

In the COVI-DOSE trial, the observed rate of thromboembolic events was lower than expected in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, and the study was unable to show a significant difference in the risk of venous thromboembolism between the two low-molecular-weight-heparin regimens.

### Dosing and monitoring of enoxaparin (low molecular weight heparin) therapy in children [^114eUXVx]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are commonly used in paediatric tertiary institutions for primary prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events. Despite this widespread use, the therapeutic and prophylactic guidelines for LMWH therapy in children are extrapolated from adult guidelines. In fact, there is very little information regarding the pharmacokinetics, clinical effectiveness, adverse event profile and optimal dose schedule for LMWH therapy in children. This study was designed to determine whether paediatric-specific dosage requirements for LMWH are justified, by investigating the doses required to achieve target therapeutic ranges. Patients who were treated with enoxaparin between October 2003 and July 2007 were identified for inclusion in this study. One hundred forty patients had an anti-activated factor X assay result with a total of 55 (39%) patients achieving therapeutic levels 4–6 h post dose. Children younger than 1 year required the highest dose of enoxaparin/kg and highest number of dose changes to achieve the target therapeutic range. Major bleeding occurred in one patient, equating to 0.7%, with complete clot resolution recorded in 16 (11%) patients. This study demonstrated a 2-3-fold variation in individual dose requirements for LMWH in children ≤ 5 years of age, and further mandates the need for age-specific dosage requirements in children receiving enoxaparin.

EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Flow chart. Between May 2020 and April 2021, 1005 patients were included in 20 centers: 502 were randomly assigned to receive a weight-adjusted prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin, and 498 received a fixed prophylactic dose. Thus, 1000 patients were considered in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Table 2
Baseline demographic, clinical and therapeutic characteristics of the patients.

Twenty-one patients (4.2%) in the experimental arm and 13 (2.6%) in the control arm did not receive any study dose of low-molecular-weight heparin. The result was unchanged in the modified-ITT population (patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment). Among patients who started treatment (99.6% enoxaparin and 0.4% tinzaparin), study drug compliance was evaluated and is described in Table 2. The median duration of trial-drug administration was 7 days in both groups, with a median daily dose of 12,000 UI (interdecile range: 10,000–14,000) in the experimental arm and 4000 UI (interdecile range: 4000–8000) in the control arm. The median (IQR) follow-up was 65 days (61–75) in the experimental arm and 64 days (61–75) in the control arm. Steroid use during hospitalization did not differ between experimental and control arms (81.2% versus 80.2%, respectively), nor did tocilizumab use (1.5% versus 1.9%, respectively).

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: executive summary [^115fNtcS]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1a

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Recommendation 1b

The ASH guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Remarks:

- Patients with COVID-19–related critical illness are defined as those suffering from an immediately life–threatening condition who would typically be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) because of COVID-19. Examples include patients requiring hemodynamic support, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy.
- An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. Risk assessment models (RAMs) to estimate thrombotic risk have been validated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (critically or noncritically ill), with modest prognostic performance. No RAMs for bleeding have been validated for patients with COVID-19. The panel acknowledges that higher-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at low bleeding risk and high thrombotic risk.
- At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants. The selection of a specific agent (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] and unfractionated heparin [UFH]) may be based on availability, resources required, familiarity, the aim of minimizing the use of personal protective equipment or exposure to staff to patients with COVID-19, as well as patient-specific factors (eg, renal function, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and bleeding risk). LMWH and UFH were used in the identified studies and may be preferred because of a preponderance of evidence with these agents. There are no studies of intermediate- or therapeutic-intensity fondaparinux, argatroban, or bivalirudin in this population.
- These recommendations do not apply to patients who require anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of extracorporeal circuits such as those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dosing in renal insufficiency — For treatment dosing of enoxaparin in impaired renal function, dose reduction may be used in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min, and the recommended treatment dose for patients with a CrCl < 30 mL/min who have acute coronary syndromes or VTE is 50% of the usual dose (ie, 1 mg/kg once daily); no specific recommendations have been made for other LMWH preparations. With prophylactic dosing in renal failure, higher anti-Xa levels have been observed but the mean peak anti-Xa level was only 0.6 units/mL, the trough was < 0.2 units/mL, and no increased bleeding was observed. In critically ill populations, dalteparin bioaccumulation was not observed despite repeated dosing, and subcutaneous dalteparin (5,000 International Units) given daily to ICU patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min showed no evidence of drug accumulation nor was the risk of bleeding increased. For pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with CrCl < 30 mL/min, the manufacturer of enoxaparin recommends that 30 mg once daily be used; in a small comparative study of enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) or tinzaparin (4,500 units once daily), bioaccumulation of enoxaparin, but not tinzaparin, was seen over 8 days of exposure.

### Adherence to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis orders in hospitalized patients [^114g9HJa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared adherence to unfractionated heparin (UFH) 2 or 3 times daily prophylaxis orders versus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) once daily orders. Our goals were to determine which strategy demonstrated the best adherence in terms of timing and frequency of dose administration, and to determine reasons for ordered heparin not being administered.

Methods

We queried our electronic medication administration record where nurses document reasons for delayed administration or omitted doses. We identified 250 consecutive patients who were prescribed prophylaxis with UFH 2 or 3 times daily or LMWH once daily. We followed patients for their hospitalization to determine adherence to physicians' prophylaxis orders.

Results

Adherence, defined as the ratio of prophylaxis doses given to doses ordered, was greater with LMWH (94.9%) than UFH 3 times daily (87.8%) or UFH twice daily (86.8%) regimens (P < .001). Patients receiving LMWH more often received all of their scheduled prophylaxis doses (77%) versus UFH 3 times daily (54%) or UFH twice daily (45%) (P < .001). There were no differences between regimens regarding reasons for omitted doses. The most common reason for late or omitted doses was patient refusal, which explained 44% of the UFH and 39% of the LMWH orders that were not administered.

Conclusions

LMWH once a day had better adherence than UFH 2 or 3 times daily. For both LMWH and UFH, patient refusal was the most common reason for not administering prophylaxis as prescribed. These findings require consideration when evaluating pharmacological prophylaxis strategies. Educational programs, explaining the rationale, may motivate patients to improve adherence during hospitalization.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: recognition, treatment, and prevention: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^1165Ewew]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients in whom the risk of HIT is considered to be > 0.1%, we recommend platelet count monitoring (Grade 1C). For patients who are receiving therapeutic-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), we suggest at least every-other-day platelet count monitoring until day 14, or until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first (Grade 2C). For patients who are receiving postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis with UFH (HIT risk > 1%), we suggest at least every-other-day platelet count monitoring between postoperative days 4 to 14 (or until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first) [Grade 2C]. For medical/obstetric patients who are receiving prophylactic-dose UFH, postoperative patients receiving prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), postoperative patients receiving intravascular catheter UFH "flushes", or medical/obstetrical patients receiving LMWH after first receiving UFH (risk, 0.1 to 1%), we suggest platelet count monitoring every 2 days or 3 days from day 4 to day 14, or until heparin is stopped, whichever occurs first (Grade 2C). For medical/obstetrical patients who are only receiving LMWH, or medical patients who are receiving only intravascular catheter UFH flushes (risk < 0.1%), we suggest clinicians do not use routine platelet count monitoring (Grade 2C). For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend use of an alternative anticoagulant, such as lepirudin (Grade 1C+), argatroban (Grade 1C), bivalirudin (Grade 2C), or danaparoid (Grade 1B). For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, we recommend routine ultrasonography of the lower-limb veins for investigation of deep venous thrombosis (Grade 1C); against the use of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [coumarin] therapy until after the platelet count has substantially recovered; that the VKA antagonist be administered only during overlapping alternative anticoagulation (minimum 5-day overlap); and begun with low, maintenance doses (all Grade 2C). For patients receiving VKAs at the time of diagnosis of HIT, we recommend use of vitamin K (Grade 2C) For patients with a history of HIT who are HIT antibody negative and require cardiac surgery, we recommend use of UFH (Grade 1C).

Section 6.2 UFH dosing and monitoring evidence in outpatients: Weight-adjusted subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (SC UFH) monitored with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) compared with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in three RCTs (n = 937) showed recurrent VTE (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.52–2.46), major bleeding (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.42–4.09), and death (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.62–2.93); in one RCT comparing weight-adjusted SC UFH to weight-based LMWH without monitoring, SC UFH was administered as an initial dose of 333 units/kg followed by 250 units/kg bid, with subsequent UFH dosing kept constant.

### Sex matters: practice 5P's when treating young women with venous thromboembolism [^112DBnq1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

The most important strategy to reduce the risk of recurrence during pregnancy consists of prophylaxis with heparin (either unfractionated heparin or LMWH), which is the only anticoagulants that does not cross the placenta and is thus safe during pregnancy. 75 Data from studies in which LMWH was directly compared to unfractionated heparin in the non‐pregnant population demonstrate similar efficacy and a superior safety profile of LMWH. 77, 78 From the pregnant population, only observational data with similar observations are available. 79, 80, 81, 82 The LMWH has a lower risk of osteoporosis and heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia. 73

The optimal dose of LMWH for prevention of pregnancy‐related recurrent VTE has not been adequately investigated. Data from retrospective cohort studies suggest high recurrence rates ranging from 2.5% to 8% of VTE despite thromboprophylaxis. 68, 69, 83, 84, 85 Only two small randomized controlled trials (n = 16 and n = 40), comparing LMWH with placebo or no treatment, have been conducted. 86, 87 In the absence of high‐quality evidence, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guideline suggests use of either prophylactic or intermediate (half of therapeutic) dose, with no preference for one dose over the other, 73 whereas the American Society of Hematology (ASH) VTE guideline suggests a prophylactic dose antepartum and has a conditional recommendation against the intermediate dose. 74 During the postpartum period both guidelines suggest either low‐dose or intermediate‐dose thromboprophylaxis. 73, 74 Since 2013, the Highlow study (NCT01828697), an international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, comparing low‐dose with intermediate dose LWMH for the prevention of pregnancy‐related recurrent VTE, is ongoing. 88 To date, > 815 patients have been recruited and results are expected in 2021.

### Low molecular weight heparins as extended prophylaxis against recurrent thrombosis in cancer patients [^117Ft967]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Cancer has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE; deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Thromboprophylaxis reduces the incidence of VTE in patients with cancer; however, active cancer places patients at high risk for recurrent VTE, necessitating extended prophylactic regimens. Extended prophylaxis in patients with cancer can be problematic because of increased risk for bleeding. Oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, have been the standard of care for extended prophylaxis, but maintaining a clinically effective level of anticoagulation can be difficult because of a wide range of drug interactions, a narrow therapeutic window, and an increased risk of bleeding complications, particularly in patients with cancer. Recent evidence indicates that long-term prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) is an effective and safe alternative to oral anticoagulation in patients with VTE and cancer, reducing the risk for recurrent VTE by up to 52%. LMWHs can also be seen as cost-effective for long-term prophylaxis, because higher drug acquisition costs are offset by the potential for reduced hospital stays, reduced need for coagulation monitoring, and fewer bleeding complications. Some studies suggest that LMWHs may also have direct antitumor effects and improve survival rates, most notably in patients with non-metastatic disease. Further clinical research is needed to evaluate the potential survival benefits of LMWH therapy in patients with cancer.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113ixG4y]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — Warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) perioperative management for interventional procedures states warfarin is continued for minimal bleed risk, whereas for low to moderate and high bleed risk it is stopped for 5 days; other guidance recommends it be stopped for 3–5 days, and individualized care may achieve an appropriate INR below 1.5 after stopping for 2 days. Warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) or the day after procedure (D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. "Bridging suggested for high thrombotic risk populations with full-dose, subcutaneous LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily), with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D-1) at half the total daily dose". Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for VTE prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure. Initiation of low molecular heparin therapy has been questioned and is no longer a recommendation as it increases the risk.

### Guideline for reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine [^112PrMWT]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) reversal in intracranial hemorrhage — We recommend discontinuing LMWH when intracranial hemorrhage is present or suspected and recommend reversing LMWH in patients with intracranial hemorrhage receiving therapeutic doses of LMWH. Protamine administration by slow intravenous injection over a period of about 10 min is advised for enoxaparin: If enoxaparin was given within 8 h, protamine sulfate should be administered at 1 mg per 1 mg of enoxaparin (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg); if given within 8–12 h, 0.5 mg of protamine per 1 mg of enoxaparin should be administered, and after 3–5 half-lives have elapsed, protamine is probably not needed. If life-threatening bleeding persists or in renal insufficiency, we suggest redosing protamine (0.5 mg of protamine per 100 anti-Xa units or per 1 mg of enoxaparin). If protamine is contraindicated, we suggest considering recombinant Factor VIIa (90 mcg/kg IV). For prophylactic dosing, we recommend against the reversal of LMWH in patients with intracranial hemorrhage receiving prophylactic dosing of LMWH.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116pwi1t]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with a past history: Re-exposure to heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for anticoagulation is unlikely to be limited to < 4 days, and the limited available evidence suggests that the longer the re-exposure to heparin, the higher the likelihood of re-emergence of HIT antibodies; 25% of patients with HIT will present with thrombosis before their platelet count drops, so relying on platelet count monitoring alone may not be safe. For thromboprophylaxis, given available alternatives, re-exposure to heparin/LMWH should be avoidable in most cases. For treatment of acute thrombosis, warfarin will not inhibit active thrombin and should not be used alone to treat acute thrombosis. A recent secondary analysis of two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found fondaparinux was less likely to exacerbate HIT, with zero out of 10 patients on fondaparinux developing clinical HIT compared with four out of four on heparin or LMWH; this suggests fondaparinux may be safe to use in patients with a previous history of HIT. Recommendation 6.3 states: In patients with a past history of HIT who have acute thrombosis (not related to HIT) and normal renal function, we suggest the use of fondaparinux at full therapeutic doses until transition to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) can be achieved (Grade 2C).

### Survey of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in trauma patients: current prescribing practices and concordance with clinical practice guidelines [^113TvRJD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with either low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended for hospitalized trauma patients, with LMWH being preferred for most patients. Ongoing debate exists regarding the optimal dosing of LMWH, timing of initiation in patients at high risk of hemorrhage, and duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis after discharge.

Enoxaparin is the LMWH currently recommended and the most common agent in the USA. Previous studies have demonstrated that 'standard' enoxaparin doses do not achieve target prophylactic antifactor Xa (anti-Xa) levels to prevent VTE complications in trauma patients. Therefore, many practitioners have adopted practices to monitor anti-Xa levels and provide dose adjustments to achieve anti-Xa targets. Additionally, patients with obesity are at high risk for failure of thromboprophylaxis and some clinicians opt for higher, initial, fixed-dose enoxaparin or weight-based regimens in this patient population. While higher alternative enoxaparin dosing regimens have demonstrated improved attainment of target anti-Xa levels, the addition of routine monitoring can be costly and the impact on clinical outcomes is controversial, making adoption into standard practice variable.

Timing of initiation, duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis, holding doses for procedures, and screening for VTE are other practices that may vary significantly. Ideally, most trauma patients should receive pharmacological VTE chemoprophylaxis within 24 hours of admission and in an uninterrupted fashion. In some cases, delaying initiation of VTE chemoprophylaxis is necessary due to active bleeding, coagulopathy, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), solid organ injury, epidural catheter placement, or hemorrhage risk. In these circumstances, less guidance is available regarding optimal timing of chemoprophylaxis which can lead to significant delays. Moreover, the optimal agent and duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis postdischarge and routine screening practices are controversial.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) perioperative management and bridging — For patients on a VKA, warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) for most patients, or the day after procedure (i.e. D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. For high thrombotic risk populations, bridging is suggested with full-dose, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), for example enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D–1) at half the total daily dose. Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure.

### Anticoagulants for thrombosis prophylaxis in acutely ill patients admitted to hospital: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113LSxTh]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Implications

Our results support the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Society of Hematology guidelines on thrombosis prophylaxis in their recommendations on the use of low-molecular-weight heparins or pentasaccharides. Our conclusion to prefer low-molecular-weight heparin over unfractionated heparin is in line with a previous network meta-analysis that focused on patients who are critically ill. Additionally, our analyses contribute new information on the low-molecular-weight heparin dose by showing that an intermediate dose is probably preferable over a low dose for prophylaxis. Current guidelines do not provide any dose recommendations, even though no unambiguous definition of standard dose prophylaxis is available. Recent randomised controlled trials in patients with covid-19 compared higher doses of low-molecular-weight heparin with various standard prophylactic regimens that included doses we defined as both low and intermediate.

Importantly, our definition of an intermediate dose is lower than the one used by the INSPIRATION trial. Compared with another network meta-analysis on prophylaxis with different low-molecular-weight heparin doses and direct oral anticoagulants in surgical patients, the directions of the effect estimates for reducing venous thromboembolism seem similar, while the effect sizes appear smaller in acutely ill patients. Additionally, the estimates of bleeding risks were similar for direct oral anticoagulants but differed for low-molecular-weight heparins. These differences can be explained by clinical and methodological factors such as patient population, quality of the evidence base, and dose cut-off points for low-molecular-weight heparin. No similar analysis has focused on the dose-response relation of low-molecular-weight heparins in the low to intermediate dose range in acutely ill patients who have been admitted to hospital. Previous pairwise meta-analyses could not answer this question because of the small number of direct comparisons between different low-molecular-weight heparins. Judging from the summary of product characteristics, the low-molecular-weight heparin dose range that we defined as intermediate is most commonly used in the United States (eg, enoxaparin 40–60 mg), whereas in Europe, Canada, and Israel, the low dose (eg, enoxaparin 20 mg) appears more often registered.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: executive summary [^114Qwipx]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions for this recommendation

Regarding recommendation 2a, the panel judged that the balance of effects probably favors the comparison (prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation) based on the trivial desirable effects, trivial undesirable effects, possibly important uncertainty or variability in how much people value the outcomes, and the overall very low certainty of the available data. Other factors considered in the EtD framework did not importantly affect this assessment for the recommendations.

Regarding recommendation 2b, the panel judged that the balance of effects probably favors the intervention (therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation) based on the small desirable effects, owing to additive trivial effects on multiple independent outcomes, trivial undesirable effects, possibly important uncertainty or variability in how much people value the outcomes, and the overall low certainty of the available data. Other factors considered in the EtD framework did not importantly affect this assessment for the recommendations.

The panel noted that for both recommendations 2a and 2b an individualized decision is important for each patient based on an assessment of thrombosis and bleeding risk. Dose adjustment of prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation for extremes of body weight or renal impairment may also be considered. This guideline did not address the use of therapeutic- vs intermediate-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related acute illness because this clinical question was not prioritized by the panel.

Patients being discharged from hospital after COVID-19

Should prophylactic-intensity direct oral anticoagulants, LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux vs no anticoagulation be used for postdischarge outpatient thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19 who are being discharged from the hospital and who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation?

Recommendation 3

The ASH guideline panel suggests against using postdischarge outpatient anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19 who are being discharged from the hospital and who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Remarks:

- An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding and shared decision-making are important when deciding on whether to use postdischarge thromboprophylaxis.
- The panel acknowledged that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable for patients judged to be at high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 196: thromboembolism in pregnancy [^114egX52]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Administration and dosing of anticoagulation during pregnancy — Based on pharmacokinetics, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) should be administered once or twice daily and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin at least every 12 hours. A retrospective study of once daily versus twice daily doses of various heparins for VTE in pregnancy found no cases of recurrent VTE in 126 women, 66% of whom received once daily low-molecular-weight heparin. Another study comparing once daily tinzaparin versus twice daily tinzaparin found that a higher-than-recommended dosage was required to maintain anti-Xa activity when tinzaparin was taken only once a day, and a separate retrospective series reported two unusual thrombotic complications among 37 pregnancies using once-a-day tinzaparin. Any adjustment for obesity is incorporated into adjusted-dose regimens; although there is no evidenced-based protocol for adjusting prophylactic doses, at extremes of body weight or as pregnancy progresses, intermediate doses of low-molecular-weight heparin may be considered, and prophylactic unfractionated heparin doses increase throughout pregnancy with dosage adjustments recommended for each trimester.

Pregnant women with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE) — management recommendations are: For all pregnant women with prior VTE, we suggest postpartum prophylaxis for 6 weeks with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH or vitamin K antagonists targeted at INR 2.0 to 3.0 rather than no prophylaxis (Grade 2B). For pregnant women at low risk of recurrent VTE (single episode of VTE associated with a transient risk factor not related to pregnancy or use of estrogen), we suggest clinical vigilance antepartum rather than antepartum prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For pregnant women at moderate to high risk of recurrent VTE (single unprovoked VTE, pregnancy- or estrogen-related VTE, or multiple prior unprovoked VTE not receiving long-term anticoagulation), we suggest antepartum prophylaxis with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH rather than clinical vigilance or routine care (Grade 2C). For pregnant women receiving long-term vitamin K antagonists, we suggest adjusted-dose LMWH or 75% of a therapeutic dose of LMWH throughout pregnancy followed by resumption of long-term anticoagulants postpartum rather than prophylactic-dose LMWH (Grade 2C).

### Enoxaparin, effective dosage for intensive care patients: double-blinded, randomised clinical trial [^113683HU]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Geerts et al. determined the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients not receiving prophylaxis to be in the range of 10–80%. The critically ill patient is especially predisposed to thromboembolism, possessing many inherent risk factors: cardiac failure, trauma, sepsis, cancer, increasing age, and obesity. The acquisition of others, for example: respiratory support with decreased mobility and invasive monitoring, further tips the scale in favor of thrombosis during the ICU stay. Thus, these patients should undergo routine assessment for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The use of routine thromboprophylaxis will probably be justified in most.

Discerning DVT in critically ill patients is difficult. The history and physical examination are often of little use, and thus, these patients are vulnerable to a delay in diagnosis. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are often used as a safe and effective means of prophylaxis against VTE in medical and surgical patients. However, the efficacy of LMWHs in critically ill patients is less certain.

The antithrombotic activity of LMWHs is often determined by aFXa assay, despite several studies finding no direct correlation between aFXa activity and clinical outcome. Mayr concluded that the European standard daily dose of 40 mg enoxaparin was ineffective in ICU patients to achieve the recommended, albeit unproven, aFXa levels of 0.1 to 0.3 IU/ml. Thus, existing guidelines in other patient populations should not be directly applied to critical care patients without further study.

Most intensive care physicians widely acknowledge the need for evidence-based guidelines for antithromboembolic prophylaxis in this patient population and lament the dearth of research on VTE in critical care patients. This study aims to establish the optimal dose of enoxaparin for ICU patients.

### Effect of weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus fixed-dose prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin on venous thromboembolism among noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19: the COVI-DOSE trial, a multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4 trial [^112wv1pG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding noncritically ill patients, our results suggest a different treatment effect depending on the hospitalization setting at inclusion with a nonsignificantly lower frequency of venous thromboembolism in the medical wards (0.5% versus 1.6%, respectively) not seen in the intensive care units (4.2% versus 3.9%, respectively). Of note, patients from the experimental arm with supplemental oxygen less than 15 L had a significant reduction of the primary outcome. However, because of the risk of the overall type I error rate inflation (sub-group analysis with multiple comparisons), this result may be due to chance. To date, some trials assessing therapeutic dose heparin showed significant reduction of different primary outcomes such as thrombosisor the need for organ supportin non-critically ill selected COVID-19 patients (e.g. according to d-dimer results). Data from two years of trials looking at the optimal thromboprophylaxis stategy in hospitalized noncritically ill COVID-19 patients were summarized in the recent ISTH guidelines: a) therapeutic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin is preferred over standard prophylactic dose in selected COVID-19 ward patients (class of recommendation 1), while b) only data from retrospective observational studies supported the recommendation of the absence of benefit of an intermediate dose versus standard prophylactic dose (class of recommendation 3). The COVI-DOSE randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate the superiority of an increased weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus standard fixed-dose low-molecular-weight heparin. The following could have impacted primary outcome measures: First, we recorded a lower frequency of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (< 5%) than previously reported at the beginning of the pandemic (up to 31%), and the point estimate of the treatment effect was lower (relative risk reduction of 41%) than expected (50%), probably leading to an underpowered and a nonconclusive trial. This could be explained by the mixing of patients from medical wards and intensive care units as well as several factors that have induced a lower incidence of thrombosis since 2020: the primary outcome was measured during the hospital stay and the average recorded hospital duration was 7 days, the measurement of only symptomatic venous thromboembolism events without systematic screening, lower COVID-19 variant severity in terms of systemic inflammation, and the benefit of steroids, SARS-CoV-2 vaccinationin the overall prognosis. Second, the absence of treatment effect in critically ill patients could be explained by the choice of heparin dose regimen in the control group. Indeed, we observed that the treatment effect was higher in the medical wards than in intensive care units. Patients from the control arm admitted to the intensive care units received a double standard-dose of low-molecular-weight heparin in comparison to patients admitted to the medical wards. This could have decreased the difference in doses between the experimental arm (weight-adjusted) and the control arm (double standard dose) especially in low weight patients below 60 kg. However, the potential overlap of dosages was low in the group of patients randomized in intensive care units because low-weight patients under 60 kg were under-represented in this group (3.0%) and in the whole population (7% of patients below 60 kg, mean weight: 83.8 kg [IQR, 72–95]). Importantly, the choice of low-molecular-weight heparin dose regimen prescribed in intensive care unit patients randomized in the control group was supported by French guidelines published in 2020.

Meanwhile, for patients with COVID-19–related acute illness, most guidance documents suggest or recommend that therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation be considered in preference to prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation. The NIH is more specific in recommending that therapeutic-dose heparin be used for patients who have an elevated D-dimer, who are on low-flow oxygen, and who have low bleeding risk. The ISTH guidelines recommend that therapeutic LMWH or UFH is beneficial in preference to intermediate- or prophylactic-dose LMWH or UFH in select patients who are not critically ill. European Society of Cardiology guidance endorses anticoagulation at standard-dose prophylactic doses for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Finally, regarding postdischarge thromboprophylaxis, these other guidance documents also do not recommend the routine use of postdischarge pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. However, in the absence of high-quality evidence, they generally suggest that an individualized decision be made, balancing the patient's thrombosis and bleeding risk factors at the time of discharge, and that thromboprophylaxis may be considered for select patients. The CHEST 2020 guideline suggests that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis would only result in net clinical benefit if the risk of symptomatic VTE were found to be > 1.8% within 35 to 42 days after release from the hospital, whereas the updated 2022 CHEST guideline did not comment specifically on postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. The 2023 ISTH guideline suggests that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis with prophylactic dose rivaroxaban may be considered for ∼30 days to reduce the risk of VTE after hospitalization for COVID-19, particularly for patients with persistent VTE risk factors that may include a high IMPROVE risk score, or high D-dimer.

### Effectiveness of therapeutic heparin versus prophylactic heparin on death, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission in moderately ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital: RAPID randomised clinical trial [^114rC39S]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and study drugs

We used web based central randomisation with a computer generated random sequence of variable block sizes stratified by site and age (≤ 65 v > 65 years) to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to therapeutic heparin or prophylactic heparin. Throughout the paper heparin refers to either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin — both forms of heparin are within the same drug class and exert their anticoagulant effect by amplifying the activity of the coagulation inhibitor antithrombin. They both also have similar non-anticoagulant effects. Patients allocated to therapeutic heparin received therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin as used for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Unfractionated heparin was administered using a weight based nomogram (bolus plus continuous infusion) with activated partial thromboplastin time or unfractionated heparin anti-Xa titration according to the centre specific protocols (that is, high dose nomogram). Patients allocated to prophylactic heparin received dose capped prophylactic subcutaneous heparin (low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin) adjusted for body mass index and creatinine clearance (see supplementary file for dosing). Prophylactic doses of heparin were thus restricted to evidence based protocols for the prevention of venous thromboembolism for medical patients admitted to hospital. Study treatment was started within 24 hours after randomisation and continued until the first of hospital discharge, day 28, study withdrawal, or death (supplementary fig S1). If a participant was admitted to ICU, continuation of the allocated treatment was recommended.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^111AEke3]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU anticoagulation and D-dimer — For venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) whenever available, and although some clinicians advocate intermediate-dosing LMWH or UFH for adults with severe or critical COVID-19 there are no published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing conventional dosing to intermediate-dosing prophylaxis. It remains unclear whether therapeutic anticoagulation should be administered to COVID-19 patients without VTE, and a pilot RCT randomized 20 hospitalized mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer to receive either full-dose anticoagulation with enoxaparin or prophylactic-dose UFH or enoxaparin but was underpowered to detect meaningful differences. In a U.S. cohort of 3,334 hospitalized patients, 829 were admitted to the ICU; in this study, male sex and elevated D-dimer were the only variables significantly associated with VTE, and a D-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng/mL was associated with an HR of 32 (95% CI 17.2 to 61.9) for VTE. Although D-dimer levels were elevated in patients with and without VTE, median D-dimer was higher in pulmonary embolism cases (1,748 ng/mL; IQR 398 to 10,000) compared with those without VTE (414 ng/mL; IQR 268 to 768). Because different assays measure D-dimer with different diagnostic utility and a decision process based on D-dimer levels needs to be better studied before clinicians adopt empiric anticoagulation — especially since elevated D-dimer could also indicate bleeding — clinical evaluation is crucial before making decisions based on laboratory values. Considering the uncertainty in the absence of VTE, the panel issued a weak recommendation against the use of therapeutic anticoagulation outside clinical trials.

Patients with COVID-19–related acute illness

Should direct oral anticoagulants, LMWH, UFH, fondaparinux, argatroban, or bivalirudin at intermediate intensity or therapeutic intensity vs prophylactic intensity be used for patients with COVID-19–related acute illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation?

Recommendation 2a

The ASH guideline panel suggests using prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related acute illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Recommendation 2b

The ASH guideline panel suggests using therapeutic-intensity over prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related acute illness who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁○○○).

Remarks:

- Patients with COVID-19–related acute illness are defined as those with clinical features that would typically result in admission to an inpatient medical ward without requirement for intensive clinical support. Examples include patients with dyspnea or mild-to-moderate hypoxia.
- An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding is important when deciding on anticoagulation intensity. RAMs to estimate thrombotic risk have been validated in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (critically or noncritically ill), with modest prognostic performance. No RAMs for bleeding have been validated for patients with COVID-19. The panel acknowledges that lower-intensity anticoagulation may be preferred for patients judged to be at high bleeding risk and low risk of thrombosis.
- At present, there is no direct high-certainty evidence comparing different types of anticoagulants in patients with COVID-19. LMWH or UFH may be preferred because of a preponderance of evidence with these agents. There are no studies of therapeutic-intensity fondaparinux, argatroban, or bivalirudin in this population.

### Treatment of deep venous thrombosis with low-molecular-weight heparin during pregnancy [^115dAx7y]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparins have been shown to be at least as effective as unfractionated (UF) heparin in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in nonpregnant subjects. LMW heparins have been shown to be safe when used during pregnancy as they do not cross the placenta. Up to now, they have been used mainly in thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and rarely in the treatment of acute DVT in pregnant women. In a prospective observational study, we compared the effectiveness and safety of the LMW heparin, dalteparin, with UF heparin in the initial treatment (first week) of DVT during pregnancy. After confirmation of DVT by ultrasonography, 10 women were treated with UF heparin (25,430 IU/day, mean) and 21 women with dalteparin (16,000 IU/day, mean) for 7 days and, thereafter, all women were given treatment doses of LMW heparin for another 2 weeks. The dose was then gradually decreased and kept at a high prophylactic dose until delivery. One patient in the dalteparin group had recurrence of DVT 2 weeks after starting the treatment. No differences were observed between the groups in symptoms or bleeding complications during pregnancy and delivery. Our results indicate that LMW heparin is as effective and safe as UF heparin for the first week of treatment, but LMW heparin has the advantage of being easily administered and few laboratory controls are required.

### The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology consensus statement on the anesthetic management of pregnant and postpartum women receiving thromboprophylaxis or higher dose anticoagulants [^113VUzLV]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Medium credibility.

SOAP consensus — neuraxial procedures in pregnant/postpartum patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) are timed as follows: After LMWH "therapeutic" doses, "24 hours after "therapeutic" doses (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg SQ once daily) before performing a neuraxial procedure or withdrawing an epidural catheter", with prophylactic enoxaparin examples listed as " ≤ 40 mg subcutaneous [SQ] once daily or 30 mg SQ twice daily". For UFH 5000 U SQ twice daily, "the new recommendation is to now wait 4–6 hours… before performing a neuraxial procedure", whereas "in the first 3 editions… UFH 5000 U SQ twice daily was not considered to be a contraindication" to immediate neuraxial placement; this change "was made to be consistent with the European Society of Anaesthesiology guidelines and is not based on reports of new cases of SEH".

### VTE, thrombophilia, antithrombotic therapy, and pregnancy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^117AUPuF]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis during pregnancy — LMWH dosing, monitoring, and screening considerations include that LMWH is the preferred agent for prophylaxis, and dose regimens include subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg every 24 h, dalteparin 5,000 units every 24 h, and dose-adjusted LMWH to achieve a peak anti-Xa level of 0.2 to 0.6 units/mL. Although indirect evidence suggests that prophylactic-dose LMWH is effective (ie, RR of 0.36) in high-risk settings, women who have an indication for long-term vitamin K antagonists are considered at very high risk, for whom dose-adjusted LMWH is a rational option during pregnancy and a reduced therapeutic-dose regimen (~75% of the usual therapeutic dose) may represent a reasonable option. Increased renal clearance of LMWH during pregnancy has led to suggestions to monitor anti-Xa levels; however, the appropriate target range for prophylaxis is uncertain, there is no evidence to support any specific target range, and routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels is expensive, inconvenient, and possibly unreliable. An alternate strategy of repeated antepartum screening with compression ultrasonography is generally not justified; if we postulate rates of recurrent VTE of 5%, with ultrasound sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98%, 28% of positive results would be false positives. We recommend that women should be investigated aggressively if symptoms suspicious of DVT or PE occur, and a baseline compression ultrasound of a previously affected leg prior to or early on in pregnancy may be useful to help differentiate residual thrombosis from new disease in symptomatic women during pregnancy.

Inherited thrombophilia without prior VTE — risk-stratified prophylaxis: For pregnant women with no prior history of VTE who are known to be homozygous for factor V Leiden or the prothrombin 20210A mutation and have a positive family history for VTE, we suggest antepartum prophylaxis with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and postpartum prophylaxis for 6 weeks with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH or vitamin K antagonists targeted at INR 2.0 to 3.0 rather than no prophylaxis (Grade 2B). For pregnant women with all other thrombophilias and no prior VTE who have a positive family history for VTE, we suggest antepartum clinical vigilance and postpartum prophylaxis with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH or, in women who are not protein C or S deficient, vitamin K antagonists targeted at INR 2.0 to 3.0 rather than routine care (Grade 2C). For pregnant women with no prior history of VTE who are known to be homozygous for factor V Leiden or the prothrombin 20210A mutation and who do not have a positive family history for VTE, we suggest antepartum clinical vigilance and postpartum prophylaxis for 6 weeks with prophylactic- or intermediate-dose LMWH or vitamin K antagonists targeted at INR 2.0 to 3.0 rather than routine care (Grade 2B). For pregnant women with all other thrombophilias and no prior VTE who do not have a positive family history for VTE, we suggest antepartum and postpartum clinical vigilance rather than pharmacologic prophylaxis (Grade 2C).

### Effect of weight-adjusted intermediate-dose versus fixed-dose prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin on venous thromboembolism among noncritically and critically ill patients with COVID-19: the COVI-DOSE trial, a multicenter, randomised, open-label, phase 4 trial [^112KD8dN]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

During the early course of moderate to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an increased risk of venous thromboembolism was reported despite a conventional dose of thromboprophylaxis using heparin. Therefore, several strategies evaluating increased doses of anticoagulation were proposed to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism, but at the cost of an excess of bleeding, particularly when using therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Risk factors for severe or critical COVID-19 include old age and obesity. While frail elderly patients may be more subject to bleeding complications, obesity may require a higher anticoagulation dosage in COVID-19. The majority of published randomized controlled trials have evaluated either fixed-dose or therapeutic-dose thromboprophylaxis. Few studies have assessed intermediate dose as in the COVI-DOSE trial. One randomized trial has assessed the effect of weight-adjusted dosing versus fixed dose of low-molecular-weight heparin in trauma patients. This pilot study did not demonstrate a statistical difference between groups although there was a trend in favor of a lower incidence of deep vein thrombosis with the increased dose. The US Western Association of Trauma suggest the use of enoxaparin 4000 IU bid in severe trauma patients, although strong evidence to support this strategy is lacking. The use of intermediate rather than standard dose low-molecular-weight heparin has been proposed in other high-risk settings, such as morbidly obese inpatients, cancer patientsand was assessed recently in pregnant women with a history of venous thromboembolism. To our knowledge, the benefit of a weight-adjusted intermediate prophylactic dose of anticoagulation has not been fully investigated, especially in noncritically ill COVID-19 patients, compared to that of fixed-dose thromboprophylaxis. Thus, the objective of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the benefit of a weight-adjusted intermediate dose versus a lower fixed-dose of low-molecular-weight heparin on the risk of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 inpatients from medical wards and intensive care units.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment in patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^116pWVJh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — Initial anticoagulation for established VTE in cancer states that initial anticoagulation may involve low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. For patients initiating treatment with parenteral anticoagulation, LMWH is preferred over UFH for the initial 5–10 days of anticoagulation for the patient with cancer with newly diagnosed VTE who does not have severe renal impairment (defined as creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min; Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong).

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in renal insufficiency — pharmacokinetics and bleeding risk — are characterized by trial exclusions at creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/min, strong correlations of anti-Xa clearance with CrCl including enoxaparin (R = 0.85, P < .001), and accumulation with repeated dosing: a linear correlation between CrCl and anti-Xa levels (P < .0005) with significantly increased levels in CrCl < 30 mL/min, reduced anti-Xa clearance by 39% and 35% higher exposure vs CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min after prophylactic dosing, and correlation for nadroparin but not tinzaparin (R = 0.49, P < .002) even when CrCl was as low as 20 mL/min. In 12 studies involving 4,971 patients, major bleeding with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min had OR 2.25 (95% CI, 1.19–4.27); with therapeutic-dose enoxaparin bleeding was 8.3% vs 2.4% (OR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.78–8.45), whereas empirical dose reduction showed 0.9% vs 1.9% (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.09–3.78). Additional findings include increased risk with enoxaparin at CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min in ESSENCE/TIMI 11B (RR = 6.1; 95% CI, 2.47–14.88), RR 2.8 (95% CI, 1.0–7.8) for CrCl < 20 mL/min in another study, and retrospective data showing RR 2.3 for any bleeding and RR 5.0 for major hemorrhage. In severe renal insufficiency requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) avoids problems from impaired LMWH clearance, and an estimated CrCl of about 30 mL/min is noted as a reasonable cutoff based on available literature.

Pregnancy-related venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis dosing — ACOG/ACCP/NPMS table: For prophylactic unfractionated heparin (UFH), ACOG lists 5000–10,000 U every 12 h with trimester-specific ranges of 5000–7500 U every 12 h in 1st trimester, 7500–10,000 U every 12 h in 2nd trimester, and 10,000 U every 12 h in the 3rd trimester unless aPTT is elevated; NPMS adds that hospitalized antepartum patients may receive 5000 U every 12 h. For prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), options include Dalteparin 5000 U once daily, Tinzaparin 4500 U once daily, and Enoxaparin 40 mg once daily, with the note that at extremes of body weight, modification of dose may be required. Therapeutic UFH is described as ≥ 10,000 U every 12 h in doses adjusted to target aPTT in the therapeutic range, while therapeutic-dose LMWH includes Dalteparin 200 U/kg QD or dalteparin 100 U/kg every 12 h, Tinzaparin 175 U/kg QD, and Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 h; LMWH monitoring targets are anti–factor Xa peak 0.5 to 1.0 U/mL (measured 3–4 hours after dose) and trough 0.2 to 0.4 U/mL (measured 12 hours after dose).

Reversal of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant effect — There is no proven method for neutralizing LMWH, and protamine sulfate neutralizes the anti-IIa activity of LMWH while neutralizing a variable portion of the anti-Xa activity. The following approach is recommended in clinical situations in which the anticoagulant effect of LMWH needs to be neutralized: if LMWH was given within 8 h, protamine sulfate should be administered in a dose of 1 mg per 100 anti-Xa units of LMWH up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg (1 mg enoxaparin equals approximately 100 anti-Xa units), with a second dose of 0.5 mg protamine sulfate per 100 anti-Xa units if bleeding continues, and smaller doses if the time since LMWH administration is longer than 8 h; agents such as an antithrombin variant that may neutralize heparin derivatives, including LMWH and fondaparinux, are described but these agents are not approved for clinical use.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin and fondaparinux use in pediatric patients with obesity [^112RyWV9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to comprehensively review the efficacy and safety data of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) and fondaparinux in pediatric patients with obesity.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was conducted (1900 to July 2020). Search terms utilized included LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, fondaparinux, pediatric, child, children, obese, obesity, overweight. No limits or timeline restrictions were imposed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies that reported pediatric patients with described overweight or obesity and utilized LMWHs or fondaparinux were considered.

Data Synthesis

Of 207 studies screened, 12 were included. Average dose reductions of 12.9% to 37.3% from the starting dose were observed with treatment indications of enoxaparin and increased up to 27.3% for prophylactic indications. Trends could not be concluded in the dalteparin and fondaparinux studies. Four thrombotic and 15 bleeding events were reported in the studies.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Pediatric patients with obesity may initially be underdosed or overdosed with enoxaparin compared with children with healthy body weight, depending on the indication.

Conclusion

Pediatric patients with obesity may benefit from proactively adjusting enoxaparin dosing on initiation of therapy. Further studies are needed for dalteparin and fondaparinux in these populations. Clinical controversy exists with the relevance of monitoring these high-risk medications for therapeutic and prophylactic indications. Thrombotic and hemorrhagic events were similar to reported adult outcomes.

### Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in the medical patient: controversies and perspectives [^111NDS8A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with venous thromboembolism in hospitalized at-risk medical patients, the publication of large-scale studies showing that prophylaxis is effective in this patient group, and the presence of international guidelines, prophylaxis rates in medically ill patients remain suboptimal. Studies show that low-molecular-weight heparins, given once daily, are at least as effective as unfractionated heparin usually given thrice daily with equivalent or improved safety profiles, and that thrice-daily dosing of unfractionated heparin might be more effective than twice-daily dosing. However, the most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not distinguish between these regimens, and twice-daily unfractionated heparin is still commonly used in the United States. Furthermore, the optimal duration for out-of-hospital and extended prophylaxis for specific patient groups is not established. Finally, there are few data on the use of mechanical methods in this patient group and no established standard of care for prophylaxis of special patient populations, such as obese patients or those with renal insufficiency. Even though prophylaxis entails additional acquisition costs, it can reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism, which can improve care and decrease overall costs.

### Antithrombotic therapy in children: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^112KRfkb]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article about antithrombotic therapy in children is part of the 7th American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following. In neonates with venous thromboembolism (VTE), we suggest treatment with either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or radiographic monitoring and anticoagulation therapy if extension occurs (Grade 2C). We suggest that clinicians not use thrombolytic therapy for treating VTE in neonates, unless there is major vessel occlusion that is causing the critical compromise of organs or limbs (Grade 2C). For children (ie, > 2 months of age) with an initial VTE, we recommend treatment with i.v. heparin or LMWH (Grade 1C+). We suggest continuing anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic thromboembolic events (TEs) for at least 6 months using vitamin K antagonists (target international normalized ratio [INR], 2.5; INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) or alternatively LMWH (Grade 2C). We suggest that clinicians not use thrombolytic therapy routinely for VTE in children (Grade 2C). For neonates and children requiring cardiac catheterization (CC) via an artery, we recommend i.v. heparin prophylaxis (Grade 1A). We suggest the use of heparin doses of 100 to 150 U/kg as a bolus and that further doses may be required in prolonged procedures (both Grade 2 B). For prophylaxis for CC, we recommend against aspirin therapy (Grade 1B). For neonates and children with peripheral arterial catheters in situ, we recommend the administration of low-dose heparin through a catheter, preferably by continuous infusion to prolong the catheter patency (Grade 1A). For children with a peripheral arterial catheter-related TE, we suggest the immediate removal of the catheter (Grade 2C). For prevention of aortic thrombosis secondary to the use of umbilical artery catheters in neonates, we suggest low-dose heparin infusion (1 to 5 U/h) (Grade 2A). In children with Kawasaki disease, we recommend therapy with aspirin in high doses initially (80 to 100 mg/kg/d during the acute phase, for up to 14 days) and then in lower doses (3 to 5 mg/kg/d for ≥ 7 weeks) [Grade 1C+], as well as therapy with i.v. gammaglobulin within 10 days of the onset of symptoms (Grade 1A).

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^111SxyZo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), we recommend short-term treatment with subcutaneous (SC) low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or, alternatively, IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) [both Grade 1A]. For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C+). In acute DVT, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH or UFH for at least 5 days (Grade 1C), initiation of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) together with LMWH or UFH on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of heparin when the international normalized ratio (INR) is stable and > 2.0 (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for acute DVT of the leg, the recommendations include the following: for patients with a first episode of DVT secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend long-term treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with a first episode of idiopathic DVT, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 6 to 12 months (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend against high-intensity VKA therapy (INR range, 3.1 to 4.0) [Grade 1A] and against low-intensity therapy (INR range, 1.5 to 1.9) compared to INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 (Grade 1A). For the prevention of the postthrombotic syndrome, we recommend the use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For patients with objectively confirmed nonmassive PE, we recommend acute treatment with SC LMWH or, alternatively, IV UFH (both Grade 1A). For most patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend clinicians not use systemic thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1A). For the duration and intensity of treatment for PE, the recommendations are similar to those for DVT.

Antifactor Xa monitoring and associated dose adjustments

What is the utility of antifactor Xa monitoring for VTE chemoprophylaxis?

Recommendation

A regimen for VTE prophylaxis using enoxaparin with dose adjustment based on anti-Xa levels may be considered for trauma and surgical ICU patients thought to have a low bleeding risk. Such a regimen results in more patients having anti-Xa levels in the target range than with a fixed dosing regimen. However, evidence is insufficient to determine if this practice results in lower VTE rates. This strategy may not be appropriate for some patients (eg, those with TBI) and individual patient characteristics should be considered when choosing a dosing regimen.

Discussion

The study by Geerts et al in 1996showed benefit of enoxaparin 30 mg twice a day in reducing venogram-diagnosed DVT rates, and minimal reduction with UFH (5000 units twice a day) in trauma. More recent evidence, mostly from underpowered retrospective studies, has suggested that the typical fixed dosing regimen of enoxaparin 30 mg two times per day does not inhibit factor Xa in a uniform and predictable manner in all patients. This makes intuitive sense, given the variable degree of VTE risk, hypercoagulability and sometimes unpredictable pharmacokinetics in critically ill and injured patients.

Anti-Xa activity is assessed via a functional assay that measures the degree of inhibition of factor Xa by UFH or LMWH. Blood for anti-Xa testing is typically drawn 4 hours after the third dose of enoxaparin. Levels are measured in International Units per milliliter, with target prophylactic levels falling in the range of 0.2–0.4 IU/mL (the target for therapeutic full anticoagulation is > 0.5 IU/mL). If levels are below target, the dose may be increase by 10 mg and levels rechecked again 4 hours after the third new dose. Data on the maximum safe dose are insufficient, but several authors have recommended not exceeding 60 mg two times per day dosing. While true therapeutic dosing often exceeds 60 mg two times per day, the conditions under which clinicians may provide prophylactic enoxaparin may differ from those for therapeutic, especially when considering bleeding risk. Also, if anti-Xa levels have not reached prophylactic targets at higher doses, one should consider heparin resistance or antithrombin-III deficiency, occult VTE with high clot burden or other undetected factors that may prompt further investigation.

### Reconsidering the switch from low-molecular-weight heparin to unfractionated heparin during pregnancy [^112389ZX]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic disease accounts for 9% of all maternal deaths in the United States. In patients at risk for thrombosis, common practice is to start prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin and transition to unfractionated heparin during the third trimester, with the perception that administration of neuraxial anesthesia will be safer while on unfractionated heparin, as spinal/epidural hematomas have been associated with recent use of low-molecular-weight heparin. In patients receiving prophylactic doses of unfractionated heparin, neuraxial anesthesia may be placed, provided the dose used is 5,000 units twice a day. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine guidelines recognize that the safety of neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving more than 10,000 units per day or more than 2 doses per day is unknown, limiting the theoretical benefit of unfractionated heparin at doses higher than 5,000 units twice a day.

### A comparative study of varying doses of enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients: a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^116UeH61]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The critically ill patient is especially predisposed to venous thromboembolism (VTE), possessing many inherent risk factors: history of VTE, renal insufficiency, cardiac failure, trauma, sepsis, cancer, increasing age, and obesity. The risk of VTE is approximately 1% per day amongst some subgroups of critically ill patients. When compared with patients who did not have VTE, those with VTE are reported to have a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer duration of intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital stay, and higher hospital mortality.

Thromboprophylaxis with agents such as enoxaparin, a low- molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is justified in most ICU patients. The effect of subcutaneous (sc) enoxaparin on the coagulation cascade is thought to be reflected by anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels, however, this surrogate marker for efficacy has never been validated in suitably sized studies. Normally, anti-Xa levels peak 3 to 5 hours after dosing. For sc administration, steady-state levels are achieved after the third dose.

LMWH is often employed as a safe and effective means of prophylaxis against VTE in medical and surgical patients. Conventional target peak anti-Xa levels for thromboprophylaxis in this population are 0.1 to 0.40 IU/ml. Corresponding levels for critically ill patients are unknown, but are likely to be higher. Levine's study conducted in orthopaedic patients, demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between anti-Xa levels and the occurrence of wound haematoma and thrombosis. Furthermore, regression analysis suggested anti-Xa levels were predictive of outcome.

Previous studies in critically ill patients demonstrated sub-therapeutic levels when the European standard daily dose of 40 mg enoxaparin was administered. VTE also tended to occur more frequently during the ICU stay as compared to the subsequent period on the wards. Despite ICU patients receiving LMWH, 5.1% to 15.5% developed proximal leg deep vein thrombosis in studies conducted by Fraisse and Cook et al. This study aims to establish the optimal dose of enoxaparin for ICU patients. We hypothesised that higher doses of enoxaparin would optimise thromboprophylaxis without increasing the risk of bleeding in these patients.

### Should we follow the 9th ACCP guidelines for VTE prevention in surgical patients? [^113TFG1f]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

The 9th edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines on antithrombotic therapy and prevention, includes relevant changes compared to previous versions. In the 9th ACCP, leadership of most chapters was given to methodologists who were familiar with the GRADE methodology. All topic panelists underwent a selection process paying particular attention to their financial and intellectual conflicts of interests. In the 9th ACCP guidelines, evidence has been explicitly presented in many evidence profiles and summary of evidence tables. In order to get a more balanced trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects of the alternative prevention and therapeutic interventions, there has been an increased emphasis on clinically relevant events, as opposed to previous surrogate asymptomatic outcomes. In addition, there has been a systematic review and survey on patient values and preferences for thrombotic and bleeding outcomes. As a result of the above changes, the strength of most recommendations has been downgraded compared to previous editions. The main changes regarding prevention on nonorthopedic surgical patients include the adoption of two risk assessment models. The only recommendation that has been upgraded is to extend prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for four weeks after abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery. A controversial modification in orthopedic patients is recommendation in favor of the use of aspirin after hip or knee arthroplasty. New oral anticoagulants are recommended, but LMWH are suggested as the preferred option. Extending pharmacological prophylaxis for up to 35days rather than 10-14days is now suggested for patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery.

LMWH — Dosing for decreased renal function: For patients receiving therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) who have severe renal insufficiency (calculated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), we suggest a reduction of the dose rather than using standard doses (Grade 2C). In enoxaparin studies reporting bleeding by calculated creatinine clearance (CalcCrCl), studies where dose was unadjusted for CalcCrCl reported 17/206 (8.3) at CalcCrCl ≤ 30 versus 96/4,081 (2.4) at CalcCrCl > 30 with OR 3.88 (1.78–8.45); studies where dose was adjusted reported 1/106 (0.9) versus 5/265 (1.9) with OR 0.58 (0.09–3.78). LMWH is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, and the evidence base is indirect and of low quality regarding how to reduce LMWH if dose reduction is chosen.

### Weight-based enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in young trauma patients: analysis of the CLOTT-1 registry [^115SiD3j]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common and potentially lethal complication after injury. Endothelial dysfunction resulting from trauma-induced local and systemic inflammatory signals significantly increases the risk of DVT and PE, even in baseline healthy individuals. Risk can be reduced through the use of mechanical and chemical VTE prophylaxis. A 2013 Cochrane database meta-analysis estimated the rate of DVT and PE in trauma patients receiving no prophylaxis at 8.7% and 3.3%, respectively. VTE prophylaxis of any kind (chemical, mechanical, or both) was associated with a significant reduction in DVT (relative risk [RR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32–0.84), but not PE. The authors also reported that chemoprophylaxis was more effective than mechanical prophylaxis in reducing overall DVT risk (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.95).

Enoxaparin is the preferred agent for chemoprophylaxis in severely injured patients without contraindications for low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH); however, controversy remains regarding optimal dosing strategies. Early administration of LMWH has been associated with lower rates of DVT, PE, and in-hospital mortality when compared with unfractionated heparin (UH). These studies typically used one of two fixed dosing regimens: 40 mg daily (once a day) or 30 mg every 12 hours (two times per day). Recent recognition that these regimens may not achieve adequate biochemical prophylaxis, as measured by anti-Xa activity level, has increased the support for alternative dosing strategies. Obesity has been identified as a possible risk factor for subtherapeutic prophylaxis, leading to the adoption of weight-adjusted dosing schemes. Weight-adjusted enoxaparin prophylaxis is clearly linked to increased anti-Xa activity. Despite evidence that patients with higher anti-Xa levels have reduced rates of VTE, a large meta-analysis of 24 studies was unable to correlate any type of dosing adjustment aimed at achieving target anti-Xa levels with a reduction in VTE incidence. Additionally, a recent systematic review of 45 studies evaluating the effect of standard fixed-dose and weight-based (WB) chemoprophylaxis regimens on anti-Xa levels and VTE rates in obese trauma and surgical patients was unable to establish the superiority of a particular dosing strategy.

### Tinzaparin versus dalteparin for periprocedure prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in hemodialysis patients: a randomized trial [^114xsvdd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is cleared predominantly by the kidneys and hence there is uncertainty about the safety of its use in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Our primary objective was to compare whether tinzaparin and dalteparin differentially accumulate in HD patients.

Study Design

Open-label randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

HD patients undergoing periprocedure bridging anticoagulation.

Intervention

After warfarin therapy was discontinued, participants were randomly assigned to either 3 daily doses of tinzaparin (175 IU/kg) or dalteparin (200 IU/kg), with 2 intervening HD treatments between the first dose of study drug and their procedure.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was predialysis anti-Xa levels 20 to 24 hours after the third LMWH dose (therapeutic target, < 0.2 IU/mL). Secondary outcomes included thromboembolic events and major bleeding.

Results

Of 29 eligible and consenting patients, 17 patients received tinzaparin and 12 patients received dalteparin. Mean predialysis anti-Xa level 20–24 hours after the third LMWH dose was 0.37 ± 0.23 (SD) IU/mL for tinzaparin and 0.62 ± 0.41 IU/mL for dalteparin (P = 0.1), indicating clinically important accumulation for both drugs. No invasive procedures were canceled due to study drug accumulation. 4 patients experienced serious adverse events (1 major bleed after traumatic arteriovenous fistula puncture in the tinzaparin arm, 2 non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions [1 in each group], and 1 upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis [dalteparin group]).

Limitations

Small sample size.

Conclusions

Dalteparin and tinzaparin significantly accumulate in HD patients at therapeutic doses. "Bridging therapy" with LMWHs at therapeutic doses in HD patients who require temporary interruption of warfarin therapy has the potential for complications and is of uncertain benefit. Other anticoagulation strategies, including no bridging therapy or intravenous heparin, need comparative evaluation in this unique patient population.

### Fondaparinux sodium compared with low-molecular-weight heparins for perioperative surgical thromboprophylaxis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112XAX3m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. Reviewers had access to the full text of all of the studies included in this meta‐analysis except 1 study from China. 20 Efforts to contact the principal investigators of this study were made but were unsuccessful; consequently, reviewers labeled this study as having "unclear bias" during study bias assessment. This study was excluded during the sensitivity analysis as well. The clinical trial by Sasaki et al 14 compared the fondaparinux with the non‐fondaparinux group. This non‐fondaparinux group was considered to be the LMWH group, as all the major clinical trials 11, 12, 18 considered LMWH as the comparator to fondaparinux. However, in the sensitivity analysis, this study was excluded and the results were consistent. The clinical trial by Steele et al 16 used a double dose of both fondaparinux and LMWH as a titration to the weight (body mass index, 35–59 kg/m²) of the participants randomized in the clinical trial. This study was included in the analysis because the dose was doubled in both arms. Nevertheless, this study was excluded as well during the sensitivity analysis, with no meaningful change to the results. In the clinical trial by Hata et al, 13 randomized patients received low‐dose (5000 IU) unfractionated heparin for thromboprophylaxis during the first 24 hours after surgery. Low‐dose unfractionated heparin was administered initially because in Japan neither fondaparinux nor LMWH are approved to be prescribed immediately after surgery. 13 After 24 hours, patients received either fondaparinux or LMWH for 5 days postoperatively. As patients in both arms received low‐dose unfractionated heparin, outcomes might have been affected similarly in each group.
