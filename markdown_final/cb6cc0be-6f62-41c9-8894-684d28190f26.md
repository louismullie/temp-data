## Question

Long term oxygen therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) — specifically, its indications, dosing, monitoring, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical evidence base and what exactly has been proven. Then, I should verify current guideline thresholds and how they differ from older practice. Next, I will examine the evidence for moderate hypoxemia and isolated exertional desaturation, including LOTT and meta-analyses. After that, I need to check nocturnal-only desaturation data. I will then review dosing strategy and the REDOX trial. I should confirm reassessment timelines and practical implementation. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety, and synthesize a concise clinical algorithm with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational evidence. The survival benefit of LTOT in COPD with severe resting hypoxemia rests on two classic randomized trials from the late 1970s/early 1980s, NOTT and MRC, which together showed a mortality reduction of roughly 30–50% in patients with PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88% at rest, with an apparent dose–response favoring longer daily use, though the latter was inferred across trials rather than tested head-to-head at the time [^113kPhH3] [^1124nUN2] [^112mwSh4].

> Wait, let me verify the current eligibility thresholds before I overgeneralize. Contemporary guidelines converge on initiating LTOT for chronic stable COPD with PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88% on room air, and extending to PaO2 56–59 mmHg or SaO2 89–90% if there is evidence of tissue hypoxia such as hematocrit > 55%, pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale; importantly, these measurements should be confirmed on two occasions at least 3 weeks apart and off acute illness, and the benefit pertains to survival rather than quality of life or exercise capacity [^114aD9kN] [^1175MpSv] [^111NimHv] [^1156DNiR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about broader use. I need to check the evidence for moderate hypoxemia and isolated exertional desaturation. The LOTT randomized trial in patients with stable COPD and moderate resting or exercise-induced desaturation showed no benefit of LTOT on the composite of death or first hospitalization, nor on quality of life or 6-minute walk distance, and a subsequent meta-analysis of trials in moderate hypoxemia found little to no mortality effect, reinforcing that routine LTOT should not be offered in these settings [^111psnUM] [^112SQmJK] [^115w8Y9N] [^113YeYVB].

> I should double-check nocturnal-only desaturation. The INOX randomized, placebo-controlled trial in COPD with isolated nocturnal desaturation did not show a signal for benefit on progression to LTOT or mortality, and although the trial was underpowered, it aligns with guideline cautions against routine nocturnal oxygen in the absence of qualifying daytime hypoxemia. Thus, nocturnal oxygen is not recommended unless standard LTOT criteria are met or another indication exists [^113GVTBr] [^1128szWE].

> Next, I should review dosing strategy and the long-standing " ≥ 15 hours/day" recommendation. Historically, NOTT suggested better outcomes with near-continuous use, but that inference was indirect; the REDOX registry-based randomized trial directly compared 24 hours/day versus 15 hours/day and found no superiority of 24-hour therapy for hospitalization or death at 1 year, supporting the adequacy of 15 hours/day in severe hypoxemia while allowing individualized adjustments for activity and sleep needs [^114sake3] [^114uNEVb].

> Let me consider practical titration and targets. I should confirm that prescriptions are individualized: start around 1 L/min and titrate to achieve SpO2 ≥ 90% at rest, verify with ABG that PaO2 ≥ 60 mmHg, and titrate separately for exertion and sleep as needed. Importantly, many patients desaturate overnight even when resting daytime saturation is adequate, so nocturnal titration may require a modest flow increase, though routine blanket increases are not universally necessary and should be guided by oximetry or ABG [^115VHzfr] [^112NkL89].

> I need to ensure reassessment is built into care. Guidelines advise re-evaluating LTOT need 60–90 days after initiation in stable patients, and sooner after exacerbation-driven starts, with repeat ABG or oximetry off oxygen to confirm ongoing indication. In practice, adherence and equipment adequacy should be checked at least every 6 months, and many patients can be weaned off oxygen if they no longer meet criteria after recovery [^116JHyXY] [^115eHJQ2].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts. For interstitial lung disease, evidence is weaker, yet guidelines and expert statements generally support LTOT for severe resting hypoxemia and consider ambulatory oxygen for exertional desaturation, acknowledging low-quality evidence and the potential burden; for cystic fibrosis, data are sparse and largely limited to short-term exercise or sleep studies without clear long-term outcome benefits, so decisions should be individualized; for post-exacerbation patients, short-term oxygen at discharge is common, but a substantial fraction do not meet LTOT criteria on reassessment, underscoring the need for timely follow-up [^112XBtUi] [^116ZocZ3] [^1131d7yY] [^1152KvVq].

> I should confirm safety and implementation issues. Smoking while on oxygen carries fire risk and should be strongly discouraged. Equipment selection should balance mobility, liter-flow needs, and patient preferences, with liquid oxygen or high-flow portable concentrators considered for active patients requiring higher flows. Education on cannula care, fire safety, travel, and altitude considerations is essential, and automated or closed-loop oxygen systems are promising but require device-specific titration and evidence for routine use remains limited [^1157g7sH] [^116ZocZ3] [^117CPCkH] [^1158W3WJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm, and I will double-check it against guidelines as I go. Severe resting hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) confirmed on two occasions ≥ 3 weeks apart warrants LTOT with a goal of at least 15 hours/day, titrated to SpO2 ≥ 90% and PaO2 ≥ 60 mmHg, with separate titration for exertion and sleep; moderate hypoxemia (PaO2 56–59 mmHg or SaO2 89–90%) qualifies only with tissue hypoxia features such as hematocrit > 55%, pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale; isolated exertional desaturation or nocturnal-only desaturation without qualifying daytime hypoxemia should not receive routine LTOT, though a time-limited, carefully monitored trial may be considered in select symptomatic patients after optimizing other therapies; reassess at 60–90 days and periodically thereafter, and discontinue if criteria are no longer met [^114aD9kN] [^1175MpSv] [^111psnUM] [^116JHyXY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the LOTT trial showed a hazard ratio of 1.06 for death or first hospitalization and concluded "no harm", but I should correct that framing: although the point estimate was 1.06, the 95% CI crossed 1 and included potential harm, so the accurate interpretation is no statistically significant benefit rather than proof of no harm. Importantly, adverse events were more frequent with oxygen, reinforcing caution in prescribing outside clear indications [^111psnUM] [^112SQmJK].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. LTOT improves survival in COPD with severe resting hypoxemia and remains one of the few disease-modifying interventions in this population. It does not improve survival, and generally does not improve quality of life or long-term functional outcomes, in moderate hypoxemia or isolated exertional or nocturnal desaturation, so its use should be restricted to those who meet evidence-based criteria and reassessed regularly to avoid overtreatment and burden [^111bheym] [^113YeYVB] [^115w8Y9N].

---

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is indicated for **severe chronic hypoxemia** (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) [^114aD9kN] or moderate hypoxemia (PaO2 56–59 mmHg or SaO2 89–90%) with evidence of tissue hypoxia (polycythemia, cor pulmonale, or pulmonary hypertension) [^1175MpSv]. LTOT **improves survival** in severe hypoxemia [^113kPhH3] but does not reduce mortality in moderate hypoxemia or isolated exercise-induced desaturation [^111psnUM] [^115w8Y9N]. It is typically prescribed for **≥ 15 hours/day** [^114uNEVb], with flow titrated to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% [^115VHzfr]; patients should be reassessed at 60–90 days [^116JHyXY] and monitored for hypercapnia, nasal irritation, and oxygen-related hazards [^116AmL2h] [^1139uSTo]. LTOT is not recommended for routine use in moderate hypoxemia or isolated exercise-induced desaturation [^113YeYVB] [^114oNY8m].

---

## Indications for LTOT

LTOT is indicated for patients with chronic stable hypoxemia, primarily due to COPD, and other chronic respiratory conditions. The following criteria are based on current guidelines and evidence:

- **Severe chronic hypoxemia**: PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88% on room air at rest, confirmed on two occasions at least three weeks apart [^114aD9kN].

- **Moderate chronic hypoxemia**: PaO2 56–59 mmHg or SaO2 89–90% with evidence of tissue hypoxia, such as polycythemia (hematocrit ≥ 55%), cor pulmonale, or pulmonary hypertension [^111NimHv] [^115K2AAo].

- **Other chronic respiratory conditions**: LTOT may be indicated for severe hypoxemia in interstitial lung disease (ILD), cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic heart failure with hypoxemia [^112XBtUi] [^113YtQG4].

---

## Evidence for LTOT benefits

LTOT has been shown to confer significant clinical benefits in specific patient populations:

- **Survival benefit**: LTOT improves survival in patients with severe chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) [^113kPhH3], with the NOTT and MRC trials demonstrating a mortality reduction of approximately 30–50% [^112LCax6].

- **No survival benefit in moderate hypoxemia**: Recent randomized controlled trials, including the LOTT trial, have shown no significant survival benefit in patients with moderate hypoxemia (PaO2 56–59 mmHg or SaO2 89–90%) without evidence of tissue hypoxia [^111psnUM] [^115w8Y9N].

- **Exercise capacity and quality of life**: LTOT may improve exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with severe exertional hypoxemia, although evidence is limited and inconsistent [^112XBtUi] [^1154QhpQ].

---

## Duration and delivery of LTOT

LTOT is typically prescribed for **≥ 15 hours per day** [^114uNEVb], with many guidelines recommending up to 24 hours per day for maximal benefit. Oxygen delivery systems include stationary concentrators, compressed gas cylinders, and portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) [^115USDfY]. The choice of delivery system depends on patient mobility, lifestyle, and oxygen flow requirements [^112XBtUi].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

LTOT is generally safe when appropriately prescribed and monitored; however, potential risks and adverse effects include:

- **Hypercapnia**: Oxygen-induced hypercapnia can occur, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure [^116AmL2h].

- **Oxygen toxicity**: Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of oxygen can cause oxidative stress and lung injury, although this is rare in clinical practice [^116AmL2h].

- **Nasal irritation and dryness**: Common side effects due to continuous oxygen flow through nasal cannulas [^notfound].

- **Fire hazard**: Oxygen increases the risk of fire, necessitating strict safety precautions, particularly for patients who smoke [^116TudxP].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure the **safe and effective use of LTOT**. Patients should be reassessed at 60–90 days after initiation [^116JHyXY] and periodically thereafter to confirm ongoing need, adjust oxygen flow rates, and monitor for adverse effects [^115eHJQ2]. Arterial blood gas (ABG) or pulse oximetry should be performed at each visit to verify adequate oxygenation and detect hypercapnia [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from major respiratory societies provide clear recommendations on LTOT use:

| **Guideline** | **Indications for ltot** | **Recommendations against ltot** |
|-|-|-|
| GOLD 2025 | - Severe chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) [^114aD9kN] <br/> - Moderate hypoxemia with tissue hypoxia (polycythemia, cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension) [^114aD9kN] | - Routine use in moderate hypoxemia without tissue hypoxia [^113YeYVB] <br/> - Isolated exercise-induced desaturation [^114BwQVH] |
| VA/DoD 2021 | - Severe chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 < 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) [^1175MpSv] <br/> - Moderate hypoxemia with tissue hypoxia (hematocrit > 55%, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale) [^115K2AAo] | - Routine ambulatory oxygen for isolated exercise-induced hypoxemia [^114oNY8m] |
| ATS 2020 | - Severe chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) [^1139uSTo] <br/> - Moderate hypoxemia with tissue hypoxia | - Routine use in moderate hypoxemia without tissue hypoxia [^112XBtUi] <br/> - Isolated exercise-induced desaturation |

---

## Special considerations

- **Travel and altitude**: Patients on LTOT require careful planning for travel, particularly air travel, as oxygen levels decrease at altitude, necessitating supplemental oxygen during flights [^117CPCkH].

- **Smoking cessation**: Smoking cessation is strongly recommended for patients on LTOT due to the increased risk of fire hazards and the potential for worsening hypoxemia [^116TudxP].

- **Patient education**: Comprehensive patient education on oxygen use, safety precautions, and equipment maintenance is essential for optimal outcomes [^112XBtUi].

---

LTOT is a **life-saving therapy** for patients with severe chronic hypoxemia, but it is not beneficial for patients with moderate hypoxemia or isolated exercise-induced desaturation. Regular monitoring, patient education, and adherence to guidelines are essential for optimal outcomes.

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^115qqzmi]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

This article has demonstrated that oxygen should be considered a treatment for hypoxaemia, not breathlessness, and thus it has little role in the non-hypoxaemic patient. Conversely, robust evidence exists for the use of LTOT in chronically hypoxaemic patients where it confers a significant long-term survival benefit. These patients need specialist assessment and follow-up by a local home oxygen assessment service. There is little evidence to support the routine use of other forms of oxygen such as SBOT, AOT or POT in patients who do not qualify for LTOT.

### Long-term continuous oxygen treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: proper use, benefits and unresolved issues [^113zuBNj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Long-term oxygen treatment is one of the few interventions that improve survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and it is widely used even though published evidence supporting the use of this treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is scanty. In addition, some studies do not demonstrate a mortality benefit for long-term oxygen treatment in this disease. It is important that long-term oxygen treatment be administered only to those patients who will benefit and in a manner that maximizes its efficacy. New studies are urgently needed to address these questions.

Recent Findings

The published evidence for and against the use of long-term oxygen treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is summarized and problems with current guidelines and important areas for future research are discussed.

Summary

Future research will address the optimal timing and duration of oxygen therapy during rest, exercise and sleep, ways of identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients who are most likely to benefit and ways of improving patient compliance, all of which may have a profound effect on clinical practice.

### A review of long-term oxygen therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116ENUQ4]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This study aimed to review the evidence for the use of long-term oxygen therapy for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The design was a systematic Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of long-term oxygen therapy for COPD and main outcome measure was survival on home oxygen therapy. Five RCTs were identified. Data from two trials of nocturnal oxygen therapy in mild to moderate hypoxaemia were aggregated. Data from the other three trials could not be aggregated because of differences in trial design and patient selection. Treatment with continuous versus nocturnal oxygen therapy produced a significant improvement in mortality after 24 months [Peto odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.25–0.81] for the continuous therapy group. Treatment with oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy showed a significant improvement in mortality after five years in the group receiving oxygen therapy (Peto odds ratio 0.42, 95% CI 0.18–0.98). There was no difference in mortality for patients with COPD and mild to moderate daytime hypoxaemia and nocturnal desaturation receiving nocturnal oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy or sham treatment. Long-term oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy in patients with COPD and moderate hypoxaemia had no effect on survival. In conclusion, long-term oxygen therapy improved survival in a selected group of COPD patients with severe hypoxaemia but few co-morbidities. Long-term oxygen therapy did not improve survival in patients with moderate hypoxaemia or in those with mild to moderate hypoxaemia and arterial desaturation at night.

### Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: guidelines… [^1139uSTo]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

- Long-term oxygen therapy reduces mortality in patients with COPD who have severe hypoxia and a resting oxygen saturation of 88% or less. From the AFP Editors Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation from airway or alveolar abnormalities. The goal of medical treatment for COPD is to reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life, and control symptoms. The American Thoracic Society published guidelines for pharmacologic management of COPD and long-term oxygen therapy for COPD and interstitial lung disease based on systematic reviews. Baseline Therapy For patients with symptoms from COPD, the ATS recommends combination therapy with a long-acting beta agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist based on improved outcomes over monotherapy with either agent.

LABA/LAMA combination therapy results in fewer exacerbations than monotherapy, with a number needed to treat of 12 to prevent one exacerbation. Treatment of Hypoxia The ATS evaluated long-term oxygen therapy for COPD in a separate guideline. Long-term oxygen therapy of at least 15 hours a day is recommended for patients with severe resting hypoxia, defined as an oxygen saturation of 88% or less or a partial pressure of oxygen of 55 mm Hg or less. In these patients, oxygen therapy reduces mortality by more than one-half at two and five years, although evidence is limited. Harms include burns, nosebleeds, tripping over equipment, and patient and caregiver burden of equipment maintenance and use. With less than severe hypoxia, mortality is not improved by oxygen therapy. When patients have severe hypoxia only with exertion, ambulatory oxygen therapy improves walking distance but has a clinically insignificant effect on dyspnea and quality of life.

All three organizations note that exacerbation risk is further reduced by adding an ICS at the cost of increased pneumonia risk. All three organizations recommend long-term oxygen therapy in COPD when associated with severe resting hypoxia, and the ATS alone suggests consideration of ambulatory oxygen with severe exertional hypoxia. Only the ATS discusses the use of opioid therapy for refractory dyspnea. The ATS addresses smoking cessation in a separate guideline. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Long-term oxygen treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: recommendations for future research: an NHLBI workshop report [^111RHrCV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) prolongs life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe resting hypoxemia. Although this benefit is proven by clinical trials, scientific research has not provided definitive guidance regarding who should receive LTOT and how it should be delivered. Deficiencies in knowledge and in current research activity related to LTOT are especially striking in comparison to the importance of LTOT in the management of COPD and the associated costs. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, in collaboration with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, convened a working group to discuss research on LTOT. Participants in this meeting identified specific areas in which further investigation would likely lead to improvements in the care of patients with COPD or reductions in the cost of their care. The group recommended four clinical trials in subjects with COPD: (1) efficacy of ambulatory O(2) supplementation in subjects who experience oxyhemoglobin desaturation during physical activity but are not severely hypoxemic at rest; (2) efficacy of LTOT in subjects with severe COPD and only moderate hypoxemia; (3) efficacy of nocturnal O(2) supplementation in subjects who show episodic desaturation during sleep that is not attributable to obstructive sleep apnea; and (4) effectiveness of an activity-dependent prescription for O(2) flow rate that is based on clinical tests performed at rest, during exercise, and during sleep.

### Oxygen for interstitial lung diseases [^1169NdUP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Supplemental oxygen therapy is prescribed for management of hypoxaemia in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). This review summarizes current evidence and implications of the use of supplemental oxygen therapy at home and during exercise training in ILD.

Recent Findings

Despite the significance of hypoxaemia in patients with ILD, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to guide the use of oxygen therapy in this population. Recent studies suggest that ambulatory oxygen may improve symptoms and health-related quality of life in patients with ILD. Long-term oxygen therapy for resting hypoxaemia in ILD is recommended by international guidelines. Supplemental oxygen during exercise may augment training effects, whereas therapeutic effects of nocturnal oxygen therapy are yet to be evaluated in patients with ILD. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the potential burden imposed by oxygen therapy on patients' daily activities of living.

Summary

Ambulatory oxygen may be considered in ILD patients with exertional hypoxaemia, with long-term oxygen therapy being a standard care for resting hypoxaemia. Trials are currently underway to clarify therapeutic potentials of supplemental oxygen for exertional hypoxaemia and during exercise training in ILD patients, with additional research needed for the evaluation of nocturnal oxygen therapy.

### Overnight prescription of oxygen in long term oxygen therapy: time to reconsider the guidelines? [^112NkL89]. Thorax (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) recommend increasing oxygen flow by 1 l/min overnight. A study was undertaken in patients with COPD on LTOT to determine the prevalence of overnight desaturation if the usual oxygen flow rate is not increased at night, whether resting oxygen saturation predicts overnight desaturation, and whether overnight desaturation correlates with health related quality of life (HRQL) and sleep quality.

Methods

A cross sectional prospective study was performed on consecutive patients with COPD on LTOT attending our regional outpatient oxygen service. All patients fulfilled standard criteria for LTOT, had been established on LTOT at a flow to achieve resting oxygen saturations > 90%, but had not been instructed to increase oxygen flow overnight. Overnight desaturation was defined as < 90% for ≥ 30% of the night on either of two consecutive nights. HRQL was evaluated with the SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

Results

Thirty eight patients (63% men) of mean (SD) age 73.5 (8.04) years and mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second 0.77 (0.35) l were evaluated. Overnight desaturation occurred in six (16%; 95% CI 4 to 27). Desaturators had mean (SD) resting oxygen saturation on room air of 88 (4.2)% compared with 90 (4.1)% in non-desaturators (p = 0.15), and corrected saturations of 93 (2.0)% versus 94 (2.0)% (p = 0.18). HRQL and sleep quality were poor but did not differ between desaturators and non-desaturators.

Conclusions

Most patients did not exhibit overnight desaturation despite not increasing their LTOT prescription overnight. These results challenge the recommendation of routinely increasing overnight oxygen flow in patients receiving LTOT.

### Ambulatory home oxygen: what is the evidence for benefit, and who does it help? [^111BSC6r]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The beneficial effects of ambulatory home oxygen have been demonstrated since the 1950s, when Cotes and Gibson gave oxygen to ambulatory COPD patients from small portable high pressures cylinders in the United Kingdom. Over the ensuing 7 decades, oxygen has been prescribed to millions of COPD patients in the home setting. Additionally, it is common clinical practice to prescribe supplemental oxygen when chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure not due to COPD (eg, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, kyphoscoliosis, and cystic fibrosis) is present or in patients with hypoxemia at hospital discharge following flares of their underlying chronic respiratory disorder, without any substantial evidence. Despite the importance of long-term oxygen therapy in clinical home management, there are many gaps in our current knowledge regarding its mechanisms of action, indications for prescription, and its effects on important patient outcomes. Research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s still provides the basis for clinical decision making and insurance coverage policies regarding long-term oxygen administration. Remarkably, little current research is being conducted to extend our knowledge regarding the indications, mechanisms, and benefits of long-term oxygen therapy. This review will focus on our current knowledge of the end points for supplemental oxygen at home, such as mortality, effects on functional performance, sensation of dyspnea, cognitive function, and quality of life, and highlight areas where future research is needed.

### Similar risk of hospitalization and mortality for patients continuing and discontinuing LTOT [^112LCax6]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is an established treatment method for prolonging life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypoxemia. Use of LTOT is common, and contributes both to significant societal costs and to a considerable burden, including adverse effects, for the individual.

The evidence base for LTOT rests on two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in the late 1970 s. The studies included COPD patients of predominantly male sex with a mean age of 65 years, both demonstrating a mortality reduction by up to 50% at three and two years after treatment initiation, respectively.

While no RCT has since reexamined the effect of LTOT on mortality among patients with severe hypoxemia, rapid development has been seen in the medical management of chronic respiratory disease, and in the characteristics of the treated population. Recent trials have also questioned the effects of LTOT on clinical outcomes in contemporary patients, by showing both a lack of benefit among patients with moderate hypoxemia, and non-superiority of LTOT prescribed for 24 rather than 15 h per day in patients with severe hypoxemia.

In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of LTOT for severe hypoxemia in a modern patient population, by studying the risks of hospitalization and death among patients discontinuing treatment.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: getting it right. does optimal management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alter disease progression and improve survival? [^111gcyKU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We live in a world where people live longer lives. The standardized mortality rate for many diseases is decreasing. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not following this trend. Over the last 10 years, interventions for COPD have been developed, but have any changed the prognosis or trajectory of this modern epidemic? We review the most recent and classical literature in order to answer this question.

Recent Findings

Recent analyses of data have clarified which interventions are effective in COPD and which are not. New studies have defined what is achievable with the current therapies. Only two interventions have been demonstrated to improve survival: smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy. Other treatments do reduce exacerbations, improve lung function and improve the patient's quality of life, but do not affect physiological disease progression or mortality.

Summary

There is much work to do, not only to improve the treatments we have for this disease, but also to diagnose it early, intervene at the right time, reduce the treatment side-effects and most importantly understand the pathophysiology better. Moreover, we are duty bound to look at each patient and review what we are trying to achieve for each one through appropriate phenotyping as well as sometimes taking a more palliative approach.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111bheym]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Oxygen therapy and ventilatory support in stable COPD — core effects and indications: The long-term administration of oxygen increases survival in patients with severe chronic resting arterial hypoxemia (Evidence A). In patients with stable COPD and moderate resting or exercise-induced arterial desaturation, prescription of long-term oxygen does not lengthen time to death or first hospitalization or provide sustained benefit in health status, lung function and 6-minute walk distance (Evidence A). Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may improve hospitalization-free survival in selected patients after recent hospitalization, particularly in those with pronounced daytime persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 53 mmHg) (Evidence B), and in patients with severe chronic hypercapnia and a history of hospitalization for acute respiratory failure, long-term noninvasive ventilation may be considered (Evidence B).

Prevention and management of COPD — long-term oxygen therapy: In patients with severe resting chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or < 60 mmHg if there is cor pulmonale or secondary polycythemia), long-term oxygen therapy improves survival. In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, long-term oxygen treatment should not be prescribed routinely, and individual patient factors must be considered when evaluating the patient's need for supplemental oxygen.

### Home oxygen for moderate hypoxaemia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115w8Y9N]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Background

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypoxaemia. However, the best method of management of moderate hypoxaemia not qualifying for LTOT (including isolated nocturnal desaturation) is uncertain. We examined the effect of home oxygen (either LTOT or nocturnal oxygen therapy) on overall survival in patients with COPD and moderate hypoxaemia.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINHAL, and Web of Science from database inception to Jan 13, 2022, for parallel-group randomised trials of long-term or nocturnal oxygen in patients with COPD and moderate daytime hypoxaemia or isolated nocturnal desaturation, or both. Control groups received usual care or ambient air through sham concentrators (placebo) throughout the study period. The primary outcome of interest was 3-year mortality. Crossover trials and trials of oxygen in severe hypoxaemia were excluded. Two reviewers applied inclusion and exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts and screened the full-text articles and reference lists of relevant studies. Aggregate data were extracted manually in duplicate using structured data collection forms. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool individual studies. We considered the minimal clinically important difference for home oxygen to be a relative risk reduction in mortality at 3-year follow-up of 30–40%. The meta-analysis is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42021225372.

Findings

We identified 2192 studies and screened 1447 after removal of duplicates, of which 161 were subjected to full-text screening, and six were identified as being eligible for inclusion. These six randomised trials were published between 1992 and 2020 and the quality of evidence was high. In the primary meta-analysis (five trials; 1002 patients), we found the effect of home oxygen in reducing 3-year mortality to be small or absent (relative risk 0·91 [95% CI 0·72–1·16]; τ 2 = 0·00), hence the lower limit of the 95% CI did not meet the prespecified minimal clinically important difference.

Interpretation

The results of our meta-analysis suggest that home oxygen probably makes little or no difference to 3-year mortality in patients with COPD and moderate hypoxaemia. The data do not support the widespread use of home oxygen in this patient population.

Funding

None.

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^1133qPzw]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Ambulatory oxygen therapy

AOT is the use of oxygen delivered via a portable cylinder during exercise and other exertion, such as activities of daily living. Historically, AOT has been used in mobile patients who are not hypoxaemic at rest but who desaturate on exercise, with the aim of improving oxygen saturations and exercise capacity.

A number of lab-based studies suggest that AOT may improve certain physiological parameters during supervised exercise. However, longer-term 'real-life' clinical trials of AOT used at home/community suggest that AOT offers no substantial long-term benefits and is often under-utilised. Appropriate use of domiciliary oxygen relies on successful patient engagement — this is a particular issue with AOT where patients can feel self-conscious leaving the house with visible, and often heavy, oxygen equipment. Given the lack of long-term data, there is therefore insufficient evidence to support routine use of AOT in COPD patients who do not fulfil the criteria for LTOT.

Despite the lack of evidence, it is recognised that a small proportion of patients with debilitating breathlessness and reduced exercise capacity due to hypoxaemia may engage with using AOT and may benefit from it. This is particularly relevant in other non-COPD chronic lung diseases (e.g. pulmonary fibrosis) in which patients more often tend to desaturate substantially on exercise. The guidelines therefore allow motivated patients to be considered for a trial of AOT following formal assessment by a specialist home oxygen assessment service, once all other medical interventions have been optimised. These patients should only continue if they can demonstrate benefit from, and good compliance with, therapy.

### Post-hospitalization short-term oxygen therapy: use of a clinical management pathway and long-term follow-up [^1152KvVq]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Home oxygen therapy is commonly prescribed for patients who remain hypoxemic at hospital discharge, although evidence supporting this practice is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate oxygen prescription and follow-up for patients who were prescribed post-discharge short-term oxygen therapy (STOT) and to assess their long-term outcome.

Methods

A retrospective audit was undertaken of subjects prescribed STOT following hospitalization at a single site in Melbourne, Australia, between January 2011 and December 2015. During the study period, a designated clinical pathway for STOT prescription and follow-up after hospital discharge was in place. Chart review was performed to collect subject demographics and comorbidities, results of oxygen assessment (arterial blood gas and 6-min walk tests) and prescription, and results at follow-up re-assessment and mortality.

Results

Over five 5 years, 205 subjects were prescribed STOT upon hospital discharge. Common indications for oxygen treatment were chronic lung disease (54%) and dyspnea palliation (26%). Of the 152 subjects who were discharged with non-palliative oxygen therapy, 28% did not fulfil the recommended prescribing criteria or did not have recommended assessments. Among the 118 subjects who returned for re-assessment 4 weeks after initial oxygen provision, 47 (40%) did not fulfill criteria for long-term oxygen therapy. The 1-y cumulative survival rate for the study population was 56%.

Conclusions

A significant proportion of subjects who were prescribed post-discharge STOT did not fulfill the recommended prescribing criteria. The long-term prognosis for subjects who were prescribed post-discharge STOT was poor.

### REgistry-based randomized controlled trial of treatment and duration and mortality in long-term OXygen therapy (REDOX) study protocol [^115vknW1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) during 15 h/day or more prolongs survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypoxemia. No randomized controlled trial has evaluated the net effects (benefits or harms) from LTOT 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day or the effect in conditions other than COPD. We describe a multicenter, national, phase IV, non-superiority, registry-based, randomized controlled trial (R-RCT) of LTOT prescribed 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day. The primary endpoint is all-cause-mortality at 1 year. Secondary endpoints include cause-specific mortality, hospitalizations, health-related quality of life, symptoms, and outcomes in interstitial lung disease.

Methods/design

Patients qualifying for LTOT are randomized to LTOT 24 h/day versus 15 h/day during 12 months using the Swedish Register for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox). Planned sample size in this pragmatic study is 2126 randomized patients. Clinical follow-up and concurrent treatments are according to routine clinical practice. Mortality, hospitalizations, and incident diseases are assessed using national Swedish registries with expected complete follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes are assessed using postal questionnaire at 3 and 12 months.

Discussion

The R-RCT approach combines the advantages of a prospective randomized trial and large clinical national registries for enrollment, allocation, and data collection, with the aim of improving the evidence-based use of LTOT.

### Randomized trial of nocturnal oxygen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113GVTBr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-term oxygen therapy improves survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic severe daytime hypoxemia. However, the efficacy of oxygen therapy for the management of isolated nocturnal hypoxemia is uncertain.

Methods

We designed this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to determine, in patients with COPD who have nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation without qualifying for long-term oxygen therapy, whether nocturnal oxygen provided for a period of 3 to 4 years would decrease mortality or the worsening of disease such that patients meet current specifications for long-term oxygen therapy. Patients with an oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of the recording time on nocturnal oximetry were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either nocturnal oxygen or ambient air from a sham concentrator (placebo). The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause or a requirement for long-term oxygen therapy as defined by the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT) criteria in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Recruitment was stopped prematurely because of recruitment and retention difficulties after 243 patients, of a projected 600, had undergone randomization at 28 centers. At 3 years of follow-up, 39.0% of the patients assigned to nocturnal oxygen (48 of 123) and 42.0% of those assigned to placebo (50 of 119) met the NOTT-defined criteria for long-term oxygen therapy or had died (difference, -3.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -15.1 to 9.1).

Conclusions

Our underpowered trial provides no indication that nocturnal oxygen has a positive or negative effect on survival or progression to long-term oxygen therapy in patients with COPD. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; INOX ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01044628.).

### Oxygen therapy for cystic fibrosis [^1131d7yY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The most serious complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) relate to respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen supplementation therapy has long been a standard of care for individuals with chronic lung diseases associated with hypoxemia. Physicians commonly prescribe oxygen therapy for people with CF when hypoxemia occurs. However, it is unclear if empiric evidence is available to provide indications for this therapy with its financial costs and often profound impact on lifestyle.

Objectives

To assess whether oxygen therapy improves the longevity or quality of life of individuals with CF.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search of Group's Trials Register: 15 May 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing oxygen, administered at any concentration, by any route, in people with documented CF for any time period.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors independently assessed the risk of bias for included studies and extracted data.

Main Results

This review includes 11 published studies (172 participants); only one examined long-term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. There was an improvement in regular attendance at school or work in those receiving oxygen therapy at 6 and 12 months. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, mild hypercapnia was noted. Participants fell asleep quicker and spent a reduced percentage of total sleep time in rapid eye movement sleep, but there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters. Six studies evaluated oxygen supplementation during exercise. Again, oxygenation improved, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Participants receiving oxygen therapy were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration during exercise. Other exercise parameters were not altered by the use of oxygen.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Short-term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. There are improvements in exercise duration, time to fall asleep and regular attendance at school or work. There is a need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of long-term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both. However, we do not expect any new research to be undertaken in this area any time soon and do not plan to update this review again until any new evidence does become available.

### Are patients on long-term oxygen therapy followed up properly? Data from the Danish oxygen register [^1158ttk6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to assess the extent and quality of follow-up of patients on LTOT.

Setting

The Danish Oxygen Register.

Subjects

A total of 890 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who were on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) during the period from 1 November 1994 to 31 August 1995.

Main Outcome Measures

The extent and quality of follow-up.

Results

Only 38.5% of the patients were followed up in the study period, and only 17.5% had a 'sufficient follow-up' defined as at least one follow-up visit within 10 months which included measurement of arterial blood gases or pulsoximetry with oxygen supply, verification that the patient used oxygen ≥ 15 h day-1 and was nonsmoker. Female gender, LTOT initiated 3–12 months ago, LTOT started by a chest physician at pulmonary department and LTOT prescribed ≥ 15 h day-1 were found to be significant predictors of 'sufficient follow-up' (odds ratio (OR): 1.7, 2.0, 3.7 and 1.9, respectively).

Conclusions

The extent and the quality of follow-up of patients on LTOT were poor, especially if a nonpulmonary physician initiated LTOT. We recommend that more attention should be paid on proper monitoring of LTOT, and that only chest physicians should be able to prescribe and re-evaluate LTOT.

### AARC clinical practice guideline. oxygen therapy in the home or alternate site health care facility – 2007 revision&update [^117UUPH8]. Respiratory Care (2007). Medium credibility.

Oxygen therapy in the home or alternate site health care facility — assessment of need states that initial need is determined by measurement of inadequate blood oxygen tensions and/or saturations by invasive or noninvasive methods and/or the presence of clinical indicators; ongoing evaluation indicates additional measurements may be indicated whenever there is a change in cardiopulmonary-related clinical status, and once the need for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) has been documented, repeat arterial blood gases or oxygen saturation measurements are unnecessary other than to follow the course of the disease, to assess changes in clinical status, or to facilitate changes in the oxygen prescription.

Long-term oxygen therapy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are summarized as follows: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in COPD patients with resting PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or < 60 mmHg with cor pulmonale or secondary polycythemia showed a survival benefit, whereas no significant benefit of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) was found in patients with moderate desaturation; recent meta-analyses have shown positive results of long-term NPPV in patients with stable COPD, and although RCT results have been inconsistent on survival, larger trials enrolling patients with marked hypercapnia and applying higher IPAP levels demonstrated a reduction of mortality.

### Oxygen for breathlessness in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who do not qualify for home oxygen therapy [^1154QhpQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Breathlessness is a cardinal symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is given to improve survival time in people with COPD and severe chronic hypoxaemia at rest. The efficacy of oxygen therapy for breathlessness and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with COPD and mild or no hypoxaemia who do not meet the criteria for LTOT has not been established.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of oxygen versus air in mildly hypoxaemic or non-hypoxaemic patients with COPD in terms of (1) breathlessness; (2) HRQOL; (3) patient preference whether to continue therapy; and (4) oxygen-related adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase, to 12 July 2016, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We handsearched the reference lists of included articles.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of the effects of non-invasive oxygen versus air on breathlessness, HRQOL or patient preference to continue therapy among people with COPD and mild or no hypoxaemia (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) > 7.3 kPa) who were not already receiving LTOT. Two review authors independently assessed articles for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and analysed data. We assessed risk of bias by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias tool'. We pooled effects recorded on different scales as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. Lower SMDs indicated decreased breathlessness and reduced HRQOL. We performed subanalyses and sensitivity analyses and assessed the quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Compared with the previous review, which was published in 2011, we included 14 additional studies (493 participants), excluded one study and included data for meta-analysis of HRQOL. In total, we included in this review 44 studies including 1195 participants, and we included 33 of these (901 participants)in the meta-analysis. We found that breathlessness during exercise or daily activities was reduced by oxygen compared with air (32 studies; 865 participants; SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.21; I² = 37%; low-quality evidence). This translates to a decrease in breathlessness of about 0.7 points on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale. In contrast, we found no effect of short-burst oxygen given before exercise (four studies; 90 participants; SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.28; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Oxygen reduced breathlessness measured during exercise tests (25 studies; 442 participants; SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.22; I² = 29%; moderate-quality evidence), whereas evidence of an effect on breathlessness measured in daily life was limited (two studies; 274 participants; SMD -0.13, 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.11; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Oxygen did not clearly affect HRQOL (five studies; 267 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.26; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Patient preference and adverse events could not be analysed owing to insufficient data.

Authors' Conclusions

We are moderately confident that oxygen can relieve breathlessness when given during exercise to mildly hypoxaemic and non-hypoxaemic people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who would not otherwise qualify for home oxygen therapy. Most evidence pertains to acute effects during exercise tests, and no evidence indicates that oxygen decreases breathlessness in the daily life setting. Findings show that oxygen does not affect health-related quality of life.

### International approaches to the prescription of long-term oxygen therapy [^1178BsSR]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

While there is broad agreement about who should receive long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), there is little information available on how clinicians should decide on the oxygen prescription itself, at rest, during sleep and during exercise. The authors describe the results of an international survey that was undertaken to compare how respirologists prescribed oxygen. A questionnaire was sent to 100 respirologists in each of seven countries. The questionnaire identified whether resting flow rates were derived in a standard manner or by individualized patient testing. Test targets were ascertained for rest, exercise and sleep, as was the percentage of time that each test target had to reach for the test to be accepted. The majority of respondents individualized the oxygen prescription at rest (81%). Resting arterial oxygen saturation (Sa, O2) was most commonly targeted at 90–91%. The approach to night prescription varied (p < 0.001). Respirologists in Canada and the USA increased the resting Sa, O2 by 1–2 L x min(-1) during sleep, while those in Spain used the resting (awake) flow for the night prescription (62%). Respirologists in the Netherlands, France, and Italy individualized the night prescription more frequently. Although oxygen during exercise was individualized in most countries (74%), significant differences remained among countries (p < 0.001). The majority of respirologists (62%) aimed to achieve an Sa, O2 of 90–91% during exercise, while 70% of all respirologists tried to achieve the desired Sa, O2 for 90% of the test. There were substantial differences among countries as to how the oxygen prescription was written. This survey highlights the need for multicentre studies that improve the effectiveness of long-term oxygen therapy utilization.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116MTvMs]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Oxygen supplementation around exercise training — Exercise-induced oxygen desaturation occurs in a significant minority of COPD patients and is associated with impaired quality of life, exacerbation risk, and mortality. A large randomized controlled trial (RCT) did not suggest clinical improvement with long term oxygen therapy for patients without resting hypoxemia but exertional desaturation. During pulmonary rehabilitation it is common practice to supplement oxygen during exercise training to facilitate higher exercise intensity, yet a 2007 systematic review found little support for oxygen supplementation during exercise training for individuals with COPD and noted that most evidence was limited by low study quality. A large RCT with blinding of participants, trainers and assessors showed that training with either supplemental oxygen or medical air significantly improved exercise capacity and health-related quality of life, with no greater benefit with oxygen, and the incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in both groups.

### Oxygen therapy in COPD [^111zG78V]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) at home has been demonstrated to improve survival in patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia. Support for LTOT is based on 2 landmark trials published nearly 4 decades ago. These results form the basis for reimbursement and prescription of LTOT to this day. Recent work has demonstrated no outcome benefit of LTOT in stable COPD patients with moderate desaturation at rest or during activity. Oxygen therapy during activity and exercise has been shown to alleviate symptoms and maintain arterial oxygen saturation, but not improve long-term outcomes. Oxygen therapy in COPD has a number of physiologic, functional, and biologic effects, not all of which are completely understood. Oxygen therapy in exacerbations of COPD can be both helpful and harmful. New guidance on the use of oxygen therapy during pre-hospital care has been published in the United Kingdom. Technology for LTOT represents a challenge for physicians writing prescriptions, durable medical equipment suppliers, caregivers, and patients. New technology for automated control of LTOT shows promise but is hampered by regulatory processes and cost pressures. Recent changes in government reimbursement for home oxygen therapy also present challenges. This paper will review the current evidence regarding LTOT in COPD and the impact on mortality and functional outcomes as well as reviewing technological challenges.

### Long-term oxygen therapy in chronic respiratory failure: a multicenter Italian study on oxygen therapy adherence (MISOTA) [^116G1Epo]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The adherence to the prescribed oxygen therapy is difficult to obtain for patients on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). There is little information on the modalities of oxygen utilisation for patients on LTOT who are using liquid oxygen in real life.

Study Objective

Evaluation of the behaviour and the knowledge regarding LTOT in a large group of patients mainly using liquid oxygen.

Design and Setting

Questionnaire administered to consecutive outpatients on domiciliary LTOT for at least 6 months referring to one of 20 clinics throughout Italy. Blinded to this result, the physician who cared for the patient completed another questionnaire.

Results

We evaluated 1504 patients (mean age 71.6 years; males 64%; 74% suffering from COPD). Most respondents (93%) used liquid oxygen with mobile device. Fifteen per cent of patients had a prescribed length of oxygen therapy less than 15 h/day; 21% reported to practice oxygen for less than 15 h/day. Patients reported using oxygen for less hours than had been prescribed during the day at rest (P = 0.02, k = 0.80) during exercise (P = 0.002, k = 0.72) and at night (P = 0.0036, k = 0.77). There was no difference between the flow prescribed by the physician and that known and practised by the patient at rest or during sleep; during exercise the flow reported by patients was lower than that prescribed by the physician. Patients used in the night but not at rest or during exercise, a lower level of oxygen flow than what they knew had been prescribed. Fifty-five per cent of patients received indications to modify the oxygen flow in the various situations of life. Liquid oxygen was almost always useful to decrease breathlessness. Most (84%) patients possessed a mobile device, but only 40% declared they used it daily, 'shame' being indicated as the principal barrier. On the physicians' side, we found that the criteria used in prescribing did not always correspond to evidence-based recommendations.

Conclusion

The widespread use of liquid oxygen did not automatically assure optimal adherence to the prescribed treatment as regards times and modality of oxygen use. A better education of patients, relatives, and the general public, as well as increased self-assessment on the part of health caregivers would improve the practice of LTOT in Italy.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113kPhH3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in COPD — LTOT reverses hypoxemia, and in severe hypoxemia defined as PaO2 ≤ 55 mm Hg, LTOT improved survival; a separate trial showed oxygen administered 19 h/d improved survival versus 12 h/d. In moderate hypoxemia defined as PaO2 < 69 mm Hg, LTOT showed no effect on survival regardless of daily duration, and nocturnal oxygen therapy versus no nocturnal oxygen therapy also found no effect on survival. Trials were limited by small sample sizes and events with only 370 patients and 164 deaths collectively. These data suggest that LTOT has a mortality benefit that may be related to the severity of hypoxemia.

### Oxygen therapy in COPD [^113JYrXd]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is a mainstay treatment for patients with severe resting hypoxemia secondary to chronic respiratory conditions including COPD. The evidence for LTOT is based on two trials that are now several decades old but have been insufficiently revisited. Therefore, many questions remain about precisely which patients experience the most benefit from LTOT, as well as how to define that benefit. Most studies have examined LTOT's effect on longevity rather than its impact on quality of life. In addition, many challenges exist in training both clinicians and patients on best practices for LTOT and associated equipment. Reimbursement policies have reduced the kinds of equipment available to the LTOT patient community, presenting additional challenges. This paper will review the current evidence for LTOT in COPD, the challenges involved with providing optimal therapy, and potential avenues of modernizing this essential intervention.

### Definitions and diagnostic criteria for bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^113cPEpw]. Seminars in Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

The changes in clinical presentation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in recent years have made many of the original definitions of BPD obsolete. The use of supplemental oxygen as a criterion for BPD diagnosis has many limitations. Supplemental oxygen is necessary to treat these infants, but at the same time it plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BPD. Because there are no accepted standards for supplemental oxygen administration, there are wide variations for its indications among different centers and this has a marked effect on the reported incidence of BPD. For this reason, it is essential to standardize the indications for supplemental oxygen when duration of oxygen therapy is used as the main criteria to diagnose BPD. Using supplemental oxygen need at specific time points does not necessarily reflect chronic lung damage and should be avoided as a single diagnostic criterion for BPD. A prolonged duration of supplemental oxygen is necessary to demonstrate the presence of chronic lung damage. The criteria based on supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age has gained wide acceptance, but it is a less stringent criterion for the more mature infants. The longer the gestation, the shorter the time on oxygen that is required to meet this BPD criterion. None of the proposed criteria based on duration of oxygen therapy have shown a strong predictive value for long-term outcome. In view of all these shortcomings, it is essential to develop more objective physiologic tools to define the degree of lung damage and improve the prediction for long-term outcome in these infants.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: the evidence base [^115hpsKm]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of those drugs would seem intuitive, but there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by those drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement such as dyspnea reduction is certainly strong reason to use those agents. The 2 most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations. In acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the large body of literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116ZocZ3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Implementation considerations

We defined exertional hypoxemia as an Sp O 2 ≤ 88%. Ambulatory oxygen seems to have similar effects in patients who are eligible for LTOT and in those who have isolated exertional hypoxemia. In patients who are eligible for LTOT, prescription of ambulatory oxygen may be important to increase the daily hours of oxygen usage. Individuals who experience a reduction in dyspnea or increased activity levels with ambulatory oxygen may be more likely to benefit from, and adhere to, this therapy. Standardization of the level of exertion is critical when assessing the effects of oxygen on dyspnea. Ambulatory oxygen devices vary in terms of portability, volume, and flow; shared decision-making between the patient and provider is necessary to ensure that the device prescription meets the patient's needs and goals.

Values and preferences

This recommendation places a high value on increasing HRQL and the potential for facilitating physical activity outside the home and places a lower value on cost, inconvenience, and resource use.

Research needs

Given the well-documented burden of ambulatory oxygen, there is an urgent need for new ambulatory oxygen devices that increase portability (improved battery life, weight, flow rates, wireless connections, etc.). Although we found several studies evaluating the effects of oxygen during laboratory testing, few studies evaluated ambulatory oxygen during daily life activities, the context for which it is prescribed. Future studies of ambulatory oxygen should address patient-centered outcomes such as HRQL and physical activity in daily life, together with outcomes pertinent to cost-effectiveness, such as productivity, days missed from work, and hospital readmissions. Future studies should also capture costs of care for other health conditions that may occur because of physical inactivity, which could be reduced with ambulatory oxygen.

Question 4: Should long-term oxygen be prescribed for adults with ILD who have severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia?

Background

Severe resting hypoxemia is highly prevalent in adults living with ILD. Those with fibrotic forms of ILD, such as IPF, often experience a progressive course characterized by breathlessness, cough, hypoxemia, episodes of acute respiratory worsening, and early death. When present, severe resting hypoxemia often contributes to disabling and distressing breathlessness, which is common in ILD. With the exception of lung transplantation, supplemental oxygen is the only treatment that improves hypoxemia that persists despite optimal medical management of the underlying disease.

The critical outcome for this question was mortality; important outcomes were dyspnea, fatigue, HRQL, physical activity in daily life, healthcare resource use, exercise capacity, and safety.

### Optimizing home oxygen therapy. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1124nUN2]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) evidence — key trials and research priorities emphasize survival benefit and remaining questions. The Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group and the Medical Research Council Working Party published multicenter randomized clinical trials of oxygen in 1980 and 1981, respectively, and results of the two COPD oxygen therapy trials indicated that LTOT reduced mortality in an apparent dose-dependent manner. Prior Oxygen Consensus Conferences in 2000 and 2006 identified research priorities for efficacy of LTOT in COPD with resting, exertional, and nocturnal hypoxemia, concluding that additional investigations were warranted to compare oxygen use versus no oxygen use in patients with mild resting hypoxemia, nighttime-only hypoxemia, exertion-only hypoxemia, or hypoxemia during rest and exercise.

### Home oxygen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^11233T6U]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Two landmark trials conducted more than 35 years ago provided scientific evidence that, under very specific circumstances, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) may prolong life. These two trials enrolled 290 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe daytime hypoxemia documented by direct arterial blood gas measurement. From that time, LTOT became a standard of care, and the indications for oxygen therapy expanded to include nocturnal oxygen therapy for isolated nocturnal oxygen desaturation, ambulatory oxygen to correct exercise-induced desaturation, and short-burst oxygen to relieve dyspnea. In most cases, the rationale for broadening the indications for oxygen therapy is that, if hypoxemia exists, correcting it by increasing the Fi O2 should help. However, with the exception of LTOT in severely hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, randomized controlled trials of oxygen therapy have failed to demonstrate clinically significant benefits. Also, adherence to LTOT is usually suboptimal. Important areas for future research include improving understanding of the mechanisms of action of supplemental oxygen, the clinical and biochemical predictors of responsiveness to LTOT, the methods for measuring and enhancing adherence to LTOT, and the cost-effectiveness of oxygen therapy. A standardization of terminology to describe the use of supplemental oxygen at home is provided.

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^117CkRxv]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The ability to provide oxygen in a patient's home can offer enormous benefits, including improvements in life expectancy when given in the appropriate setting. Confusingly, however, home oxygen is available in many forms, including long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), ambulatory oxygen therapy (AOT), palliative oxygen therapy (POT) and short-burst oxygen therapy (SBOT)-each with varying degrees of supporting evidence. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has recently published new guidance on home oxygen therapy, after collating the available evidence. This article aims to summarise those guidelines, focusing on who should and should not be considered for oxygen therapy. Although the BTS guidelines target a UK audience, many of the principles covered below are applicable internationally, even if the availability of certain oxygen modalities and supporting service arrangements may vary between different healthcare systems.

### Supplemental oxygen in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: evidence from nocturnal oxygen treatment trial to long-term oxygen treatment trial [^116B1YRE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Oxygen therapy was the first treatment shown to prolong life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been joined by lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients with emphysema, smoking cessation, and potentially noninvasive ventilation in chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure. Although there is consensus around the survival-enhancing effect of supplemental oxygen (SupplO2) for patients with chronic severe hypoxemia at rest, the impact of SupplO2 for COPD patients with moderate hypoxemia and exertional desaturation had been less clear.

Recent Findings

The recently published Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) showed no benefit of SupplO2 for the composite outcome of survival and all-cause hospitalizations, or for component outcomes, severe COPD exacerbations, or quality of life in COPD patients with moderate resting hypoxemia or room air normoxemia with exercise desaturation.

Summary

Results of the LOTT challenge the practice of prescribing SupplO2 for patients with COPD and moderate resting hypoxemia or isolated exertional desaturation. In the context that LOTT may not have recruited patients for whom SupplO2 conferred subjective benefit, there may be a role for short-term trials of SupplO2 with assessment of subjective benefit in such patients.

### British thoracic society guidelines for home oxygen use in adults [^1157g7sH]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Home Oxygen Guideline provides detailed evidence-based guidance for the use of home oxygen for patients out of hospital. Although the majority of evidence comes from the use of oxygen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the scope of the guidance includes patients with a variety of long-term respiratory illnesses and other groups in whom oxygen is currently ordered, such as those with cardiac failure, cancer and end-stage cardiorespiratory disease, terminal illness or cluster headache. It explores the evidence base for the use of different modalities of oxygen therapy and patient-related outcomes such as mortality, symptoms and quality of life. The guideline also makes recommendations for assessment and follow-up protocols, and risk assessments, particularly in the clinically challenging area of home oxygen users who smoke. The guideline development group is aware of the potential for confusion sometimes caused by the current nomenclature for different types of home oxygen, and rather than renaming them, has adopted the approach of clarifying those definitions, and in particular emphasising what is meant by long-term oxygen therapy and palliative oxygen therapy. The home oxygen guideline provides expert consensus opinion in areas where clinical evidence is lacking, and seeks to deliver improved prescribing practice, leading to improved compliance and improved patient outcomes, with consequent increased value to the health service.

### The clinical impact of new long-term oxygen therapy technology [^114qtNoq]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival for patients afflicted with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may also reduce the incidence of repeat hospitalization due to exacerbations. When properly dosed and titrated, LTOT has also been shown to improve exercise tolerance, thereby enhancing the overall health-related quality of life for this growing patient population. Equipment used to provide LTOT is undergoing a radical transformation, with newer delivery devices offering a sharp contrast to older, more traditional home oxygen equipment. This newer approach to providing LTOT-commonly referred to as "non-delivery technology"-affords LTOT users unprecedented freedom, since they are no longer dependent on home-care providers for repeat deliveries to replenish or replace depleted oxygen contents. Instead, non-delivery LTOT equipment is self-sufficient and able to provide all of the oxygen needed to meet both stationary and ambulatory requirements. However, several models of the newer LTOT equipment have certain operational and performance limitations. Accordingly, in order to preclude unintended desaturation with newer LTOT devices, each patient must undergo an individualized pulse-oximetry titration study by a knowledgeable and experienced respiratory therapist to ensure optimum dosing under all conditions of use.

### Optimizing home oxygen therapy. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115MJSam]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Optimal home oxygen therapy definition — The workshop members came to consensus on the definition of optimal oxygen therapy, which states that optimal oxygen therapy prioritizes maximizing each individual patient's quality-of-life and health outcomes with a goal to minimize the burden on patients, their families, providers, payers, and oxygen suppliers, and includes principles emphasizing an effective and transparent interface among patients, caregivers, clinicians, durable medical equipment companies, and payers to ensure patient-centered, long-term management of hypoxemia. The definition further specifies that a qualified clinician provides initial and ongoing assessment of hypoxemia and establishes a guideline- or evidence-based oxygen prescription during rest, exertion, and sleep (and high altitude as needed) and ensures an individualized action plan and therapeutic oxygen patient education program, and that collaborative efforts of the clinician and DME company provide patient-centered oxygen systems that are clinically effective and safe, support maximal long-term mobility and management of hypoxemia, and address comorbidities including frailty, cognitive and/or physical impairments, as well as patient financial constraints.

### A randomized trial of long-term oxygen for COPD with moderate desaturation [^111psnUM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study LTOT was published by Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial Research Group and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Dyspnea in palliative care. In the LTOT study, the trial question was: what is the role of long-term supplemental oxygen in patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation? In the LTOT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the LTOT study, the population was: 738 patients (196 female, 542 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with stable COPD who had moderate resting desaturation (SpO2 89–93%) and moderate exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-minute walk test, SpO2 ≥ 80% for ≥ 5 minutes and < 90% for ≥ 10 seconds). The key exclusion criteria were COPD exacerbations requiring antibiotics, thoracic surgery or other procedures in the 6 months before randomization, non-COPD lung disease affecting oxygenation or survival, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 15, desaturation < 80% for at least 1 minute during the 6-minute walk, or disease or condition expected to cause death or inability to perform procedures within 6 months of randomization. In the LTOT study, the interventions were: n = 368 supplemental oxygen (long-term supplemental oxygen with 24-hour oxygen for patients with resting desaturation and oxygen during exercise and sleep for patients with desaturation only during exercise) n = 370 no supplemental oxygen (no long-term supplemental oxygen). In the LTOT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of death or first hospitalization (36.4/100 py vs. 34.2/100 py; HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26). In the LTOT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of death (5.7/100 py vs. 5.2/100 py; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.56) No significant difference in the incidence of hospitalization (34.5/100 py vs. 31.6/100 py; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.29). In the LTOT study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in adverse events (51 vs. 0). In the LTOT study, the conclusion was: in patients with stable COPD who had moderate resting desaturation (SpO2 89–93%) and moderate exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-minute walk test, SpO2 ≥ 80% for ≥ 5 minutes and < 90% for ≥ 10 seconds), supplemental oxygen was not superior to no supplemental oxygen with respect to the incidence of death or first hospitalization.

### Oxygen therapy for cystic fibrosis [^113zAK6Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The most serious complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) relate to respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen supplementation therapy has been a standard of care for individuals with chronic lung diseases associated with hypoxemia for decades. It is common for physicians to prescribe oxygen therapy for people with CF when hypoxemia occurs. However, it is unclear if empiric evidence is available to provide indications for this therapy with its financial costs and often profound impact on lifestyle.

Objectives

To assess whether oxygen therapy improves the longevity or quality of life of individuals with CF.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of Group's Trials Register: April 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing oxygen, administered at any concentration, by any route, in people with documented CF for any time period.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Nine published studies (149 participants) are included in this review, of which only one examined long-term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters and modest hypoventilation was noted. In three studies, oxygen supplementation was evaluated during exercise. Hypoxemia was prevented, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Work performance was not improved, as measured in one study, but was improved in a second study. Furthermore, in two studies, exercise duration was enhanced by oxygen supplementation. In the study examining the impact of oxygen supplementation after exercise, recovery time was enhanced.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Short-term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. During exercise, there are improvements in exercise duration and peak performance. There is a need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of long-term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112XBtUi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Evidence-based guidelines are needed for effective delivery of home oxygen therapy to appropriate patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Methods: The multidisciplinary panel created six research questions using a modified Delphi approach. A systematic review of the literature was completed, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to formulate clinical recommendations. Recommendations: The panel found varying quality and availability of evidence and made the following judgments: 1) strong recommendations for long-term oxygen use in patients with COPD (moderate-quality evidence) or ILD (low-quality evidence) with severe chronic resting hypoxemia, 2) a conditional recommendation against long-term oxygen use in patients with COPD with moderate chronic resting hypoxemia, 3) conditional recommendations for ambulatory oxygen use in patients with COPD (moderate-quality evidence) or ILD (low-quality evidence) with severe exertional hypoxemia, 4) a conditional recommendation for ambulatory liquid-oxygen use in patients who are mobile outside the home and require > 3 L/min of continuous-flow oxygen during exertion (very-low-quality evidence), and 5) a recommendation that patients and their caregivers receive education on oxygen equipment and safety (best-practice statement). Conclusions: These guidelines provide the basis for evidence-based use of home oxygen therapy in adults with COPD or ILD but also highlight the need for additional research to guide clinical practice.

Summary of ATS Recommendations

Question 1: Should long-term oxygen be prescribed for adults with COPD who have severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia?

Background

Hypoxemia is common in people with COPD, particularly those with more advanced disease, because of worseningmismatch and decreased diffusion capacity. In some patients, hypoxemia can be sufficiently severe to occur at rest and is associated with dyspnea, worsening neurocognitive function, PH, and mortality.

In 1917, Haldane described the therapeutic potential of providing supplemental oxygen. Since then, several studies have examined the role of oxygen therapy in patients with COPD. "LTOT" refers to supplemental oxygen for a period of years, and in most cases for the remainder of the patient's life (Table 3). LTOT can be delivered through a combination of stationary equipment (e.g. stationary oxygen concentrator and liquid reservoirs) and ambulatory oxygen equipment (e.g. compressed-oxygen cylinders, portable oxygen concentrators [POCs], and LOX canisters) (Figure 1). In this section, we discuss the role of LTOT for adults with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia. The critical outcome for this question was mortality, and important outcomes included dyspnea, healthcare resource use, exercise capacity, fatigue, health-related quality of life (HRQL), physical activity, and safety.

### Clinical research in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: needs and opportunities [^114MgthE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition, and one difficult to manage. Available treatments, other than smoking cessation, are only minimally effective, and the knowledge basis for clinical decision making is limited. To identify areas in which further clinical research may lead to significant improvements in the care of patients with COPD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a Working Group, entitled "Clinical Research in COPD: Needs and Opportunities", on March 21–22, 2002. This group of experts identified important questions in the field and made the following recommendations: (1) establish a multicenter Clinical Research Network to perform multiple, short-term clinical trials of treatments in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD; (2) create a system for the standardized collection, processing, and distribution of lung tissue specimens and associated clinical and laboratory data; (3) develop standards for the classification and staging of COPD; (4) characterize the development and progression of COPD using measures and biomarkers that relate to current concepts of pathogenesis; and (5) evaluate indications for long-term oxygen therapy for patients with COPD.

### Long-term oxygen therapy for 24 or 15 hours per day in severe hypoxemia [^114sake3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-term oxygen supplementation for at least 15 hours per day prolongs survival among patients with severe hypoxemia. On the basis of a nonrandomized comparison, long-term oxygen therapy has been recommended to be used for 24 hours per day, a more burdensome regimen.

Methods

To test the hypothesis that long-term oxygen therapy used for 24 hours per day does not result in a lower risk of hospitalization or death at 1 year than therapy for 15 hours per day, we conducted a multicenter, registry-based, randomized, controlled trial involving patients who were starting oxygen therapy for chronic, severe hypoxemia at rest. The patients were randomly assigned to receive long-term oxygen therapy for 24 or 15 hours per day. The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a composite of hospitalization or death from any cause within 1 year. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome assessed at 3 and 12 months.

Results

Between May 18, 2018, and April 4, 2022, a total of 241 patients were randomly assigned to receive long-term oxygen therapy for 24 hours per day (117 patients) or 15 hours per day (124 patients). No patient was lost to follow-up. At 12 months, the median patient-reported daily duration of oxygen therapy was 24.0 hours (interquartile range, 21.0 to 24.0) in the 24-hour group and 15.0 hours (interquartile range, 15.0 to 16.0) in the 15-hour group. The risk of hospitalization or death within 1 year in the 24-hour group was not lower than that in the 15-hour group (mean rate, 124.7 and 124.5 events per 100 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 1.36; 90% CI, 0.76 to 1.29; P = 0.007 for nonsuperiority). The groups did not differ substantially in the incidence of hospitalization for any cause, death from any cause, or adverse events.

Conclusions

Among patients with severe hypoxemia, long-term oxygen therapy used for 24 hours per day did not result in a lower risk of hospitalization or death within 1 year than therapy for 15 hours per day. (Funded by the Crafoord Foundation and others; REDOX ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03441204.).

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with COPD and interstitial lung disease… [^112mwSh4]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Home oxygen therapy is supplemental oxygen used outside health care settings. In the US, an estimated 1. 5 million adults are receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory disorders. 1 COPD and ILD represent the 2 major diagnoses for which oxygen therapy is prescribed in the US. Long-term oxygen therapy is oxygen used for at least 15 hours per day. Ambulatory oxygen is oxygen delivered during exercise or daily activities. The efficacy of home oxygen therapy for persons with chronic lung disease is extrapolated from a few, decades-old randomized clinical trials that were conducted prior to the era of modern bronchodilator pharmacotherapy and reported a survival benefit from long-term oxygen therapy among patients with COPD. 2–4.

### REgistry-based randomized controlled trial of treatment and duration and mortality in long-term OXygen therapy (REDOX) study protocol [^114QC3Re]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Design and participants

The REDOX is a multicenter, single-blinded (analyst), effectiveness, phase IV R-RCT. Current Swedish guidelines recommend LTOT to be used for at least 15–16 h/day but preferably 24 h/day. In the present study, patients starting LTOT will be randomized to either oxygen prescribed 24 h/day or 15 h/day using the Swedish Register for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox). Clinical follow-up and concurrent treatments are according to routine clinical practice. The main endpoints of mortality, hospitalizations, and incident disease are assessed using Swedish registry data, with expected complete follow-up due to compulsory registrations nationally. Patient-reported outcomes are assessed using postal questionnaire at three and 12 months. The study is managed by the Uppsala Clinical Research Center (UCR), a clinical trial unit with great experience from national randomized controlled trials. All 48 centers prescribing LTOT in the Swedish Quality Register for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox) are invited to participate in the trial. The study design is outlined in Fig. 1. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial are listed in Table 2. As all patients eligible for starting LTOT are included regardless of the underlying disease, the overall study population is expected to be heterogeneous. The main analysis will be in the defined group of patients with spirometrically verified COPD and severe hypoxemia. Secondary analyses will also be performed in sub populations listed in Table 3.

### 2023 year in review: home oxygen therapy [^117Jpkfk]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is a treatment that involves the provision of supplemental oxygen to individuals with respiratory disease to correct hypoxemia in the post-acute care environment. Over 1.5 million adults in the United States use supplemental oxygen for various respiratory disorders. This paper explores literature published on LTOT from September 2022-September 2023. Upon the conclusion of this literature review, 4 distinct categories emerged. This paper highlights the significant findings associated with the 4 categories: supplemental oxygen and COVID-19, telemonitoring, LTOT equipment, and in-home high-flow nasal cannula.

### Long-term oxygen therapy improves health-related quality of life [^115aoiWt]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the prescription of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in hypoxemic COPD patients are based on two landmark studies in which survival was the primary outcome. Such patients are importantly symptomatic with poor health-related quality of life (HRQL) but the effect of LTOT on HRQL remains uncertain. We undertook a prospective longitudinal interventional study of consecutive COPD patients referred to our regional oxygen service; n = 43 fulfilling criteria and commenced on LTOT, n = 25 not fulfilling criteria and continued on standard care. HRQL was measured at baseline, 2 and 6 months. Both patient groups had severe COPD as defined by mean FEV1 < 35% predicted. At baseline the LTOT group demonstrated significantly worse HRQL as defined by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) (fatigue, emotional function, mastery and total scores), total generic Dartmouth COOP Charts and anxiety domain of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Significant improvements in HRQL were noted at 2 and 6 months in the LTOT group. Conversely the non-LTOT group demonstrated a progressive decline in HRQL. Using validated criteria for a minimal clinically significant improvement in CRQ, there were 28 (67%) and 26 (68%) 'responders' at 2 and 6 months respectively in the LTOT group. The introduction of LTOT to patients with severe COPD fulfilling standard criteria was associated with early significant improvements in HRQL with sustained or further response at 6 months.

Discussion

This is the first study to compare effectiveness of LTOT duration of 24 and 15 h/day on clinical outcomes in people with chronic respiratory failure, with a potential direct impact on research and clinical management. LTOT is used commonly as it is one of few interventions that can affect prognosis in COPD, but there has been no trial of LTOT in severe hypoxemia since the 1970s. Research in LTOT has been held back by problems and high cost of recruitment and follow-up of patients with advanced disease, and challenges with ethical justification to withhold oxygen 24 h/day in patients with severe hypoxemia for the purpose of conducting a clinical trial even though there is no clear evidence of difference in outcomes between shorter and longer duration LTOT. This study will be by far the largest study in LTOT to date, and the first R-RCT in respiratory medicine. The R-RCT design is a paradigm shift and enables a large-scale, randomized trial in a representative sample of people with very advanced disease, with complete follow-up of main endpoints. This will be the first trial investigating whether LTOT 24 h/day improves important patient outcomes − survival time, risk of hospitalization, levels of symptoms, oxygen side effects, and HrQoL compared with LTOT 15 h/day, or whether LTOT 24 h/day might unnecessarily constraint and burden patients. This study will also for the first time evaluate effects of LTOT by the degree of hypoxaemia and in people with disease other than COPD. Further, evaluating the effect on the risk of hospitalization is crucial as hospitalization is a major driver of health care costs. If COPD hospitalizations can be reduced by LTOT 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day, increased use of long term oxygen treatment could be cost-effective, which will be evaluated in a comprehensive health economic analysis. The trial will also examine the effect of LTOT prescribed 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day on survival and other outcomes, several of which were not assessed in the LOTT trial of patients with moderate hypoxemia. The study will investigate effectiveness of the prescription of LTOT in clinical care. No objective measurement of oxygen use will be used, as there is no accepted, user-friendly objective means of collecting usage data. However self-reported actual oxygen duration will be collected.

Background

Long-Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) is an established treatment to improve survival in patients with chronic daytime hypoxemia due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Internationally accepted guidelines recommending that LTOT should be given for 15 h/day or more are based on two small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the 1970s with a total of 290 patients; the 'Continuous or Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy' trial (NOTT) published in 1980 and the 'Medical Research Council' (MRC) study published in 1981. In NOTT, prescribed oxygen duration 24 h/day (mean use 18 h/day) increased survival compared with 12 h/day, and in the MRC study oxygen 15 h/day increased survival compared with no oxygen. The internationally accepted recommendation to use LTOT at least 15 h/day and preferably 24 h/day is based on an unadjusted observational comparison of the treatment arms of these two trials, where the crude mortality rate was lower for the 18 h/day group in NOTT than for the 15 h/day group in the MRC trial (21% vs 41%). However, the presumed survival benefit of continuous LTOT over 15 h /day has not been proven in a randomized controlled trial. Our recently performed observational study of 2249 patients using LTOT for hypoxemic COPD suggested that there may indeed be no differences in survival for LTOT 24 h/day compared with 15 h/day. As for LTOT to patients with mild hypoxemia at rest or with isolated hypoxemia during exertion, the recent 'Long Term Oxygen Therapy' (LOTT) trial showed no reduced mortality, and a Cochrane metaanalysis reported some effect on breathlessness but not on health related quality of life (HRQoL).

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is described as having cost with few adverse clinical effects, with the major hazard being fires or explosions, and prescribing LOTT for current smokers is controversial. We recommend: Studies that measure the effects of LTOT on outcomes in various COPD subtypes. Examples of subtypes that warrant evaluation include patients with mild and moderate hypoxemia, desaturation with exertion, desaturation during sleep, comorbid heart disease, frequent exacerbations, decreased exercise capacity, or pulmonary hypertension. Studies that evaluate the effect of LTOT on physical activity and the relationship of this effect on other outcomes, such as quality of life, frequency of exacerbations, and mortality. Studies that compare the effects of various modalities of LTOT (e.g., continuous, exercise, sleep, combined, with or without flow titration) on outcomes in different patient subtypes.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) oxygen therapy — duration and outcomes are as follows: The long-term administration of oxygen (> 15 hours per day) to patients with chronic respiratory failure has been shown to increase survival in patients with severe resting hypoxemia. Among patients with severe hypoxemia agreeing to participate in a study, long-term oxygen therapy used for 24 hours per day did not result in a lower risk of hospitalization or death within one year compared to therapy for 15 hours per day, but the generalizability of this finding is unclear.

### Home oxygen therapy for adults with chronic lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115eHJQ2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Proper reassessment of home oxygen needs is so important that it has been identified as one of the top five areas for further improvement in adult respiratory medicine by the Choosing Wisely Campaign. According to the TSANZ guideline, patients who commence LTOT after a COPD exacerbation should be reassessed 4–8 weeks after hospital discharge to ensure continued eligibility. In patients prescribed home oxygen for severe chronic resting room air hypoxemia, the 2020 GOLD initiative recommends reassessing the need for oxygen after 60–90 days; when home oxygen is started to treat severe hypoxemia after a COPD exacerbation, the GOLD initiative recommends reassessing the home oxygen requirement at 1–4 weeks and again at 12–16 weeks to update the oxygen prescription as clinically indicated. At the time of reassessments, Sp O 2 (or arterial blood gases) at rest and with exertion should be considered. Ideally, reevaluation should occur at home to capture context and barriers to use. Expert opinion suggests that patients should be monitored, at minimum, every 6 months to confirm continued oxygen use, a current oxygen prescription, and adequacy of the equipment used.

Values and preferences

This recommendation places a high value on reducing mortality and a lower value on cost and resource use.

Research needs

The practice of initiating short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge in patients with severe hypoxemia is based on indirect evidence from the NOTT and MRC clinical trial populations with chronic hypoxemia. The harms and benefits of prescribing short-term oxygen therapy on hospital discharge deserves further study. The panel recommends studies to develop and test the acceptability and effectiveness of easy-to-use ambulatory oxygen equipment that can facilitate LTOT use by patients, to identify strategies that improve adherence to LTOT, and to develop and test strategies to discontinue home oxygen in patients who recover sufficiently after an exacerbation or no longer have a clinical indication for its use. Studies to examine whether some subgroups of patients with COPD and severe hypoxemia (e.g. higher hematocrit, higher mean PAP, early hemodynamic impairment) are more or less likely to benefit from LTOT are also needed.

### Supplemental oxygen therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: is less is more? How much is too much? [^1158W3WJ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Currently available evidence supporting the use of supplemental oxygen therapy (SOT) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is complex, and data on the mortality reduction associated with SOT usage in patients with severe daytime resting hypoxemia have not been updated since the development of other treatments.

Recent Findings

No reduction in mortality was found when SOT was used in patients with moderate resting daytime, isolated nocturnal, or exercise-induced hypoxemia. However, some of these patients obtain other significant benefits during SOT, including increased exercise endurance, and a mortality reduction is possible in these 'responders'. The adverse effects of long-term oxygen therapy also need to be considered, such as reduced mobility and social stigma. Furthermore, conservative SOT could improve outcomes in the setting of COPD exacerbations compared with higher concentration oxygen regimens. Compared with usual fixed-dose SOT, automated oxygen administration devices might reduce dyspnea during exercise and COPD exacerbations.

Summary

Current recommendations for SOT need to be revised to focus on patients who respond best and benefit most from this therapy. A conservative approach to SOT can reduce side effects compared with higher concentration oxygen regimens, and automated oxygen administration devices may help to optimize SOT.

### When should I be considering home oxygen for my patients? [^117DWCHh]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The ability to provide oxygen in a patient's home can offer enormous benefits, including improvements in life expectancy when given in the appropriate setting. Confusingly, however, home oxygen is available in many forms, including long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), ambulatory oxygen therapy (AOT), palliative oxygen therapy (POT) and short-burst oxygen therapy (SBOT) — each with varying degrees of supporting evidence. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has recently published new guidance on home oxygen therapy, after collating the available evidence. This article aims to summarise those guidelines, focusing on who should and should not be considered for oxygen therapy. Although the BTS guidelines target a UK audience, many of the principles covered below are applicable internationally, even if the availability of certain oxygen modalities and supporting service arrangements may vary between different healthcare systems.

### What happens to patients with COPD with long-term oxygen treatment who receive mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation? A 1-year retrospective follow-up study [^115kdZ9B]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the USA. The disease follows a progressive course, and patients with advanced disease most often die from respiratory failure or cardiovascular disease. Patients hospitalised for respiratory failure due to COPD (COPD exacerbation) have a 2-year median survival, and 50% of patients who survive hospitalisation are readmitted within 6 months of discharge. In addition, patients with COPD are more likely to die after receiving life-supporting technologies and less likely to receive palliative care compared with lung cancer patients. Unless patients explicitly choose to forego invasive treatments, often the default is to 'do everything' to prolong survival. However, survivors of invasive treatments often have decreased functional capacity, are discharged to a nursing home and have recurrent hospitalisations that may adversely impact quality of life.

Knowledge of these potential outcomes may influence patients' informed decision making about whether to accept invasive mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, few studies have measured outcomes beyond hospital survival for patients with COPD.

In this study, we describe outcomes for patients with COPD on LTOT who are admitted to an ICU for respiratory failure and receive invasive mechanical ventilation. The focus of our analysis is on outcomes that may inform patient-level decision making about whether to accept invasive mechanical ventilation, including in-hospital and 12-month mortality, readmissions and discharge to nursing home. Further, we describe the association between patient-level factors such as comorbidities and nursing home residence, and these outcomes.

### Oxygen therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116AmL2h]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of oxygen as a therapeutic agent 70 years ago, much has been learned regarding the detrimental effects of hypoxemia and the beneficial impact of oxygen therapy. It is projected that there are close to 800,000 patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in the United States, at a cost of approximately $1.8 billion annually. The large numbers of patients receiving supplemental oxygen as treatment and the high costs incurred in providing oxygen therapy necessitate the practitioner to know the indications for LTOT as well its effects on survival, pulmonary hemodynamics, sleep, and exercise capacity. It is now recognized that the basis for LTOT prescription for all patients is founded on data that are over 25 years old and that only involve a very select cohort of patients. It is clear that further studies are required to assess the effects of oxygen on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with only mild hypoxemia, not only survival but also on neurocognitive function, quality of life, exercise physiology, and sleep quality. In addition, although proven to be safe when prescribed long term to individuals with lung disease, there are some concerns about worsening carbon dioxide retention and increased oxidant injury. The goals of this article are to briefly describe the indications for chronic oxygen administration, the physiologic effects of treatment, and potential toxicities, as well as its effect on morbidity and mortality.

### Multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nocturnal oxygen therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a study protocol for the INOX trial [^111jvuLe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a major health issue worldwide. For instance, while 4% of Canadians aged 35 to 79 self-reported being diagnosed with COPD, direct measurements of lung function from the Canadian Health Measures Survey indicate that 13% of Canadians had a lung function score indicative of COPD. Among individuals aged > 40 with a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years visiting a primary care physician for any reason, one in five met spirometric criteria for COPD. COPD represents the fourth leading cause of mortality in Canada. Continuous (i.e. long-term) oxygen therapy (LTOT) is one of the few components of the management of COPD that improves survival and it is only indicated in patients with severe daytime hypoxemia. LTOT is usually provided by a stationary oxygen concentrator and should be used for at least 15 h a day.

### What happens to patients with COPD with long-term oxygen treatment who receive mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation? A 1-year retrospective follow-up study [^112fovgg]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) on long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) who received invasive mechanical ventilation for COPD exacerbation. Of the 4791 patients, 23% died in the hospital, and 45% died in the subsequent 12 months. 67% of patients were readmitted at least once in the subsequent 12 months, and 26.8% were discharged to a nursing home or skilled nursing facility within 30 days. We conclude that these patients have high mortality rates, both in-hospital and in the 12 months postdischarge. If patients survive, many will be readmitted to the hospital and discharged to nursing home. These potential outcomes may support informed critical care decision making and more preference congruent care.

If LTOT 24 h/day is found to be non-superior to 15 h/day, this will confirm that patients safely can be free of supplemental oxygen for up to nine hours per day. If not, LTOT 24 h/day may be superior which implies the importance of oxygen therapy in chronic respiratory failure and the relevance of implementing services to facilitate and optimize the daily duration of LTOT. The trial design will provide robust, detailed data using validated instruments that enable correlational analyses of factors influencing the adherence to and net clinical effectiveness of LTOT in patients with respiratory failure in current clinical practice. The study also aims to take forward an infrastructure for randomized trials that can be used to facilitate research and improved evidence-based treatment in patients with chronic respiratory failure.

Long-term oxygen need

"It is a Herculean task for a family caring for someone who needs oxygen at home. We are really on our own, with little support from the government".

 — Daughter of person on long-term oxygen therapy, Pakistan

An estimated 9·2 million people with COPD meet the criteria for long-term oxygen therapy annually. Each of these people requires a continuous portable oxygen supply. 6·2 million (67%) of the 9·2 million people who need long-term oxygen therapy annually live in LMICs. Of these 9·2 million people, 3·2 million (35%) are in east Asia and the Pacific and 1·8 million (20%) are in south Asia.

The number of people who needed long-term oxygen increased by 33% (ie, from 6·9 million to 9·2 million) between 2010 and 2021 (figure 2B, appendix 1 p 115), driven by the long-term effects of smoking on an ageing population and exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, and exacerbated by climate change and urbanisation. The prevalence of COPD is projected to increase by 23% between 2020 and 2050, with disproportionately large increases in women and in LMICs, and so inequities in access to long-term oxygen therapy are likely to grow. Public health programmes that reduce smoking and burning of biomass indoors, improve diets and air quality, and protect ageing populations and overcrowded communities from the effects of extreme heat and climate change could help to reduce the anticipated growth in long-term oxygen therapy needs (see Sweden case study; appendix 2).

Our long-term oxygen estimates focused on COPD, the condition for which the strongest data showing treatment benefit and the most consistent diagnostic classification and eligibility criteria are available. However, there is great variation in COPD guidelines and long-term oxygen therapy eligibility between and within countries and regions. Most guidelines come from high-income and upper-middle income countries and as a result they probably under-recognise chronic lung injuries from diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia.

### Home oxygen therapy for treatment of patients with… [^117QFgMZ]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer There is good evidence that the addition of home long-term continuous oxygen therapy for COPD increases survival rates in patients with severe hypoxemia but not in patients with moderate hypoxemia or nocturnal desaturation. 2 According to these standards, oxygen therapy is covered for patients with a documented PaO 2 of up to 55 mm Hg or a saturation of oxygen in arterial blood of up to 88 percent on room air at rest. Most insurers, including Medicare, will allow a prescription for home oxygen therapy for up to 99 months. In a study of long-term oxygen therapy versus no oxygen therapy in patients with moderate hypoxemia, no effect on survival was found in up to three years of follow-up. A search conducted in January 2003 did not identify any additional studies for inclusion in the review.

Reviewers' Conclusions. Long-term oxygen therapy improves survival rates in a select group of COPD patients with severe hypoxemia. Long-term oxygen therapy does not appear to improve survival in patients with moderate hypoxemia or in those with only nocturnal arterial desaturation. The three modes of delivery for oxygen therapy include oxygen concentrators, compressed gas, and liquid oxygen. CMS uses a "modality neutral" method, which applies a fixed reimbursement regardless of the mode of delivery. Because survival rates are not better in patients with moderate hypoxemia, this review supports these coverage guidelines. According to the results of this review, physicians should be vigilant in making sure that patients with COPD receive long-term oxygen therapy. One trial included in the review determined that continuous long-term oxygen therapy in patients with a PaO.

2 of up to 58 mm Hg reduced mortality rates over 24 months compared with nocturnal therapy. In another trial, patients with a PaO 2 of 40 to 60 mm Hg who were treated with long-term oxygen therapy had increased five-year survival rates compared with patients who received placebo.

### REgistry-based randomized controlled trial of treatment and duration and mortality in long-term OXygen therapy (REDOX) study protocol [^114dzrWa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) during 15h/day or more prolongs survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypoxemia. No randomized controlled trial has evaluated the net effects (benefits or harms) from LTOT 24h/day compared with 15h/day or the effect in conditions other than COPD. We describe a multicenter, national, phase IV, non-superiority, registry-based, randomized controlled trial (R-RCT) of LTOT prescribed 24h/day compared with 15h/day. The primary endpoint is all-cause-mortality at 1year. Secondary endpoints include cause-specific mortality, hospitalizations, health-related quality of life, symptoms, and outcomes in interstitial lung disease.

Methods/Design

Patients qualifying for LTOT are randomized to LTOT 24h/day versus 15h/day during 12months using the Swedish Register for Respiratory Failure (Swedevox). Planned sample size in this pragmatic study is 2126 randomized patients. Clinical follow-up and concurrent treatments are according to routine clinical practice. Mortality, hospitalizations, and incident diseases are assessed using national Swedish registries with expected complete follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes are assessed using postal questionnaire at 3 and 12months.

Discussion

The R-RCT approach combines the advantages of a prospective randomized trial and large clinical national registries for enrollment, allocation, and data collection, with the aim of improving the evidence-based use of LTOT.

### Oxygen therapy for cystic fibrosis [^112nYm4j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The most serious complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) relate to respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen supplementation therapy has been a standard of care for individuals with chronic lung diseases associated with hypoxemia for decades. Physicians commonly prescribe oxygen therapy for people with CF when hypoxemia occurs. However, it is unclear if empiric evidence is available to provide indications for this therapy with its financial costs and often profound impact on lifestyle.

Objectives

To assess whether oxygen therapy improves the longevity or quality of life of individuals with CF.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of Group's Trials Register: November 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing oxygen, administered at any concentration, by any route, in people with documented CF for any time period.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eleven published studies (172 participants) are included in this review, of which only one examined long-term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. There was an improvement in regular attendance at school or work in those receiving oxygen therapy at 6 and 12 months. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, mild hypercapnia was noted. Participants took less time to fall asleep and spent a reduced percentage of total sleep time in rapid eye movement sleep, but there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters. Six studies evaluated oxygen supplementation during exercise. Again, oxygenation improved, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Participants receiving oxygen therapy were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration during exercise. Other exercise parameters were not altered by the use of oxygen.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Short-term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. There are improvements in exercise duration, time to fall asleep and regular attendance at school or work. There is a need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of long-term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both.

### A randomized trial of long-term oxygen for COPD with moderate desaturation [^112SQmJK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Long-term treatment with supplemental oxygen has unknown efficacy in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation.

Methods

We originally designed the trial to test whether long-term treatment with supplemental oxygen would result in a longer time to death than no use of supplemental oxygen among patients who had stable COPD with moderate resting desaturation (oxyhemoglobin saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Spo 2], 89 to 93%). After 7 months and the randomization of 34 patients, the trial was redesigned to also include patients who had stable COPD with moderate exercise-induced desaturation (during the 6-minute walk test, Spo 2 ≥ 80% for ≥ 5 minutes and < 90% for ≥ 10 seconds) and to incorporate the time to the first hospitalization for any cause into the new composite primary outcome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive long-term supplemental oxygen (supplemental-oxygen group) or no long-term supplemental oxygen (no-supplemental-oxygen group). In the supplemental-oxygen group, patients with resting desaturation were prescribed 24-hour oxygen, and those with desaturation only during exercise were prescribed oxygen during exercise and sleep. The trial-group assignment was not masked.

Results

A total of 738 patients at 42 centers were followed for 1 to 6 years. In a time-to-event analysis, we found no significant difference between the supplemental-oxygen group and the no-supplemental-oxygen group in the time to death or first hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.12; P = 0.52), nor in the rates of all hospitalizations (rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.13), COPD exacerbations (rate ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.19), and COPD-related hospitalizations (rate ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.17). We found no consistent between-group differences in measures of quality of life, lung function, and the distance walked in 6 minutes.

Conclusions

In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, the prescription of long-term supplemental oxygen did not result in a longer time to death or first hospitalization than no long-term supplemental oxygen, nor did it provide sustained benefit with regard to any of the other measured outcomes.

### Oxygen therapy for patients with COPD: current evidence and the long-term oxygen treatment trial [^113TGQ9k]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Long-term use of supplemental oxygen improves survival in patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia. However, the role of oxygen in symptomatic patients with COPD and more moderate hypoxemia at rest and desaturation with activity is unclear. The few long-term reports of supplemental oxygen in this group have been of small size and insufficient to demonstrate a survival benefit. Short-term trials have suggested beneficial effects other than survival in patients with COPD and moderate hypoxemia at rest. In addition, supplemental oxygen appeared to improve exercise performance in small short-term investigations of patients with COPD and moderate hypoxemia at rest and desaturation with exercise, but long-term trials evaluating patient-reported outcomes are lacking. This article reviews the evidence for long-term use of supplemental oxygen therapy and provides a rationale for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial. The trial plans to enroll subjects with COPD with moderate hypoxemia at rest or desaturation with exercise and compare tailored oxygen therapy to no oxygen therapy.

Background: Evidence-based guidelines are needed for effective delivery of home oxygen therapy to appropriate patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Methods: The multidisciplinary panel created six research questions using a modified Delphi approach. A systematic review of the literature was completed, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to formulate clinical recommendations.

Recommendations: The panel found varying quality and availability of evidence and made the following judgments: 1) strong recommendations for long-term oxygen use in patients with COPD (moderate-quality evidence) or ILD (low-quality evidence) with severe chronic resting hypoxemia, 2) a conditional recommendation against long-term oxygen use in patients with COPD with moderate chronic resting hypoxemia, 3) conditional recommendations for ambulatory oxygen use in patients with COPD (moderate-quality evidence) or ILD (low-quality evidence) with severe exertional hypoxemia, 4) a conditional recommendation for ambulatory liquid-oxygen use in patients who are mobile outside the home and require > 3 L/min of continuous-flow oxygen during exertion (very-low-quality evidence), and 5) a recommendation that patients and their caregivers receive education on oxygen equipment and safety (best-practice statement).

Conclusions: These guidelines provide the basis for evidence-based use of home oxygen therapy in adults with COPD or ILD but also highlight the need for additional research to guide clinical practice.
