## Question

Is atorvastatin 10 mg indicated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atorvastatin 10 mg is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and whether 10 mg is an approved starting dose. Then, I should verify how major guidelines classify 10 mg by intensity and in which patient groups it is recommended. Next, I will review the expected LDL-C lowering at 10 mg and whether that aligns with guideline targets. After that, I should consider special populations and scenarios where 10 mg may be preferred or insufficient. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer with practical prescribing guidance and caveats about monitoring and titration.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory foundation. The FDA labeling for atorvastatin calcium lists multiple indications, including primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as adjunct, hypertriglyceridemia, and cardiovascular risk reduction in primary and secondary prevention settings, and it explicitly allows a starting dose of 10 mg once daily with a maintenance range of 10–80 mg once daily, which establishes that 10 mg is an approved and indicated dose across these conditions [^2244ed46] [^f93db739] [^f7952810] [^09f73eb2] [^737e7462] [^ae4cae5f] [^16f0a874] [^ed78fead] [^4ac9f0d2].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline intensity framework before I overgeneralize. The ACC/AHA and VA/DoD guidelines classify atorvastatin 10 mg as moderate-intensity therapy, expected to lower LDL-C by about 30–49%, which is the appropriate intensity for many adults who are at intermediate ASCVD risk, those with diabetes aged 40–75 years, and some older adults after shared decision-making, whereas high-intensity regimens (atorvastatin 40–80 mg) are reserved for clinical ASCVD, very high-risk primary prevention, or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^3a4411fc] [^0fdc680a] [^0817b1ad].

> I should double-check the expected LDL-C reduction at 10 mg to ensure clinical relevance. Multiple sources consistently show that atorvastatin 10 mg lowers LDL-C by roughly 33–40% on average, which fits the moderate-intensity category and supports its use when a 30–49% reduction is the therapeutic goal, with the understanding that individual responses vary and dose titration is standard practice [^af3ee97d] [^4425dee1] [^01f6bb08].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal applicability. I need to consider scenarios where 10 mg may be insufficient or where a different starting point is preferred. In patients with established ASCVD, recent acute coronary syndrome, or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, guidelines favor high-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40–80 mg) to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction, so starting at 10 mg would generally under-treat unless there are tolerability concerns or drug–drug interactions that necessitate a lower dose with plans to intensify later [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^0fdc680a]. Conversely, in older adults, those with frailty, renal impairment, or prior statin-associated muscle symptoms, starting at 10 mg can be a reasonable, conservative approach with careful monitoring and titration as tolerated, aligning with safety-first principles in these populations [^aec55ff0] [^9503c6c1] [^a02c1e1a].

> Let me consider special populations where 10 mg is specifically endorsed. For adults with type 2 diabetes aged 40–75 years, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated, making 10–20 mg atorvastatin appropriate unless multiple ASCVD risk factors justify high-intensity therapy, and for people with HIV at intermediate ASCVD risk, expert guidance supports at least moderate-intensity statins, with atorvastatin 20 mg commonly recommended but 10 mg acceptable if tolerability or interactions are a concern, underscoring that 10 mg sits at the lower bound of moderate intensity and may be used selectively in these groups [^0fdc680a] [^4fff2aaf] [^df77fe63].

> I should confirm pediatric and familial hypercholesterolemia nuances. In heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, atorvastatin is approved from age 10 years, with typical starting doses of 10–20 mg and titration based on response, so 10 mg is an appropriate starting dose in adolescents with HeFH, whereas in homozygous FH, atorvastatin 10–80 mg is used as adjunct to other therapies, again placing 10 mg at the low end of a wide, individualized range [^09f73eb2] [^737e7462] [^f93db739].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing details to ensure safe initiation. The FDA label advises starting at 10 or 20 mg once daily, reassessing lipids in 2–4 weeks, and titrating to a maximum of 80 mg as needed and tolerated, with attention to drug–drug interactions, hepatic disease, and age-related susceptibility to muscle symptoms; this reinforces that 10 mg is not only indicated but also a common and sensible starting point for many adults, with built-in room to intensify based on response and goals [^f93db739] [^f7952810].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a statin and experiencing muscle symptoms? I need to ensure I address statin-associated muscle symptoms. Strategies include lowering to the minimal effective dose, switching agents, or intermittent dosing, and many patients with SAMS can ultimately tolerate some statin regimen; in this context, 10 mg atorvastatin may be the maximally tolerated dose that still delivers meaningful LDL-C lowering, which preserves cardiovascular benefit while minimizing adverse effects [^aec55ff0] [^0a0f525c].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, atorvastatin 10 mg is indicated across FDA-approved indications and is guideline-concordant moderate-intensity therapy suitable for many adults who require a 30–49% LDL-C reduction, including those with diabetes, intermediate ASCVD risk, older adults prioritizing tolerability, and selected patients with prior statin intolerance, while recognizing that higher-risk patients often need high-intensity regimens and that 10 mg serves as a starting dose with planned titration to achieve individualized LDL-C goals [^2244ed46] [^1e9724fd] [^0fdc680a] [^3a4411fc] [^af3ee97d].

---

Atorvastatin 10 mg is **indicated** for adults who need moderate-intensity LDL-C lowering, including primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, and primary prevention in patients with diabetes or multiple cardiovascular risk factors [^2244ed46] [^0fdc680a]. It is also appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate higher doses due to muscle symptoms or drug interactions, and for older adults where a conservative start is preferred [^aec55ff0] [^a02c1e1a]. Atorvastatin 10 mg is **not indicated** for patients who require high-intensity therapy (e.g. clinical ASCVD, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or diabetes with multiple risk factors) [^1e9724fd] [^0fdc680a]. Dose should be individualized and adjusted based on response and tolerability [^f93db739].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) provide clear recommendations on the use of atorvastatin 10 mg:

- **Moderate-intensity statin therapy**: Atorvastatin 10–20 mg is recommended for adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes, those with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%, and for primary prevention in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors [^1e9724fd] [^0fdc680a].

- **High-intensity statin therapy**: Atorvastatin 40–80 mg is recommended for patients with clinical ASCVD, those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, and for patients with diabetes aged 40–75 years with multiple ASCVD risk factors [^1e9724fd] [^0fdc680a].

- **Older adults**: In adults older than 75 years, the decision to initiate or continue statin therapy should be individualized based on patient preference, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^d562e8a0].

## Clinical scenarios where atorvastatin 10 mg is appropriate

Atorvastatin 10 mg is **particularly appropriate** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia | Effective LDL-C and triglyceride reduction with favorable tolerability [^2244ed46] [^4425dee1] |
| Primary prevention in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors | Reduces risk of MI, stroke, and revascularization procedures [^2244ed46] [^853a9ff4] |
| Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus | Reduces cardiovascular events and is guideline-recommended [^2244ed46] [^0fdc680a] |
| Patients intolerant to higher statin doses | Lower dose may improve adherence and reduce adverse effects [^aec55ff0] [^0a0f525c] |
| Older adults (≥ 75 years) | Conservative dosing is recommended due to increased risk of adverse effects [^a02c1e1a] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where atorvastatin 10 mg is not indicated

Atorvastatin 10 mg is **not indicated** or may be insufficient in the following scenarios:

- **Clinical ASCVD**: High-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 40–80 mg) is recommended [^1e9724fd] [^fd7d5c32].

- **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL**: High-intensity statin therapy is recommended [^1e9724fd] [^0fdc680a].

- **Diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors**: High-intensity statin therapy is reasonable [^1e9724fd] [^0fdc680a].

- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**: High-intensity statin therapy is recommended [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Atorvastatin 10 mg is **generally well tolerated**. Common adverse effects include myalgia, mild gastrointestinal symptoms, and rare elevations in liver enzymes. Serious adverse effects such as rhabdomyolysis are rare but require monitoring for muscle symptoms and liver enzyme elevations [^b970330c] [^016d6401].

## Summary of indications and recommendations

Atorvastatin 10 mg is indicated for:

- Primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia [^2244ed46].
- Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^2244ed46].
- Hypertriglyceridemia [^2244ed46].
- Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia [^2244ed46].
- Primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with multiple risk factors [^2244ed46].
- Prevention of cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes [^2244ed46].
- Prevention of cardiovascular events in coronary heart disease [^2244ed46].

It is **not indicated** for patients requiring high-intensity statin therapy, such as those with clinical ASCVD, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors [^1e9724fd] [^0fdc680a].

---

Atorvastatin 10 mg is a **moderate-intensity statin** indicated for primary hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, HeFH, hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, and primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in appropriate patients. It is not indicated for patients who require high-intensity statin therapy. Dose should be individualized based on patient characteristics, response, and tolerability [^f93db739].

### Treating to new targets (TNT) study: does lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below currently recommended guidelines yield incremental clinical benefit? [^544e5664]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial is a parallel-group study that has randomized 10,003 patients from 14 countries to double-blind treatment with either atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg. During the double-blind period, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are expected to reach approximate mean values of 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L) for the low-dose atorvastatin group and 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) for the high-dose group. Randomized patients are expected to be followed for an average of 5 years. The primary end point is the time to occurrence of a major cardiovascular event, defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. The large patient numbers in the TNT study and long follow-up should ensure that there is adequate power to definitively determine if reducing LDL cholesterol levels to approximately 75 mg/dl (1.9 mmol/L) can provide additional clinical benefit.

### Is lower and lower better and better? A re-evaluation of the evidence from the cholesterol treatment trialists' collaboration meta-analysis for low-density lipoprotein lowering [^34d8bc00]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.

### Lipid lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^01f6bb08]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of atorvastatin on blood lipids and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2011, MEDLINE (1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (1980 to November 2011), ISI Web of Science (1899 to November 2011) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to November 2011). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of 3 to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. WDAE information was collected from the placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

Two hundred fifty-four trials evaluated the dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 33,505 participants. Log dose-response data revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides. Combining all the trials using the generic inverse variance fixed-effect model for doses of 10 to 80 mg/day resulted in decreases of 36% to 53% for LDL-cholesterol. There was no significant dose-related effects of atorvastatin on blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. WDAE were not statistically different between atorvastatin and placebo for these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.45).

Authors' Conclusions

Blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effect of atorvastatin was dependent on dose. Log dose-response data was linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Manufacturer-recommended atorvastatin doses of 10 to 80 mg/day resulted in 36% to 53% decreases of LDL-cholesterol. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 37% of the placebo-controlled trials.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^b123e085]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — statin recommendation and evidence: "We recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk (1/⊕⊕○○)". Statins have a modest triglyceride-lowering effect, typically about 10–15%, with high-dose regimens such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg lowering plasma triglyceride by 25–30%. Statin monotherapy should not be first-line therapy in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), while addition of statins can be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl and < 1000 mg/dl) with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects occur in about 5–10% of patients, muscle symptoms occur in about 10% of patients, and conditions predisposing to severe myopathy include advanced age, renal failure, polypharmacy, and acute illness.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^03f70667]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Statin medicines — categories by intensity and anticipated % low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction include low-intensity statins (Simvastatin 10 mg, Pravastatin 10–20 mg, Lovastatin 20 mg, Fluvastatin 20–40 mg) with anticipated LDL-C reduction < 30%; moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10–20 mg and Rosuvastatin 5–10 mg with 30–49%; and high-intensity statins (Atorvastatin 40–80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) with ≥ 50%.

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^ee9cc814]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment; those with: 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, were identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group, and with rosuvastatin 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57% and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

Conclusions

The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

SECONDARY PREVENTION: HOW LOW SHOULD WE GO?

In patients with overt CVD, the guidelines state an optional goal LDL of 70 mg%. This recommendation is based on several recently published trials that examined the effect of aggressive LDL lowering therapy (i.e. high dose statin therapy) in high risk populations of patients (Table 3). In the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial, 4,162 patients 10 days after an acute coronary syndrome (acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], or high-risk unstable angina) were randomized to standard 40 mg pravastatin treatment or high dose/aggressive 80 mg atorvastatin treatment. Patients were followed for 18 to 36 months and achieved an average LDL cholesterol level of 62 mg% in the atorvastatin group and 95 mg% in the pravastatin group. In the aggressive therapy group versus the control group, a significant 16% reduction in the primary end point (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring re-hospitalization, revascularization and stroke) was noted. 18% of the ∼1,600 patients in each treatment arm suffered from diabetes and showed similar risk reduction to that of the general cohort. A post hoc analysis of the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial data revealed a reduction not only in LDL cholesterol but also in CRP levels. This reduction in CRP was significantly associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events irrespective of the associated LDL reduction.

Another important trial was the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study. In one arm of this study, a total of 1,501 patients with diabetes, stable coronary heart disease, and LDL levels < 130 mg% were randomized to receive low-dose (10 mg) or high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin and followed for 4.9 years. At the end of the study, LDL levels in the low-dose group were 98 versus 77 mg% in the high-dose group. This was associated with a significant 25% reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events (defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal non–procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke) in the high-dose versus the low-dose group.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^a53370ef]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — definitions from select organizations describe criteria for inability to tolerate statins and assessment of statin-associated muscle symptoms. NLA Expert Panel on Statin Intolerance 2014 defines "the inability to tolerate at least two statins: one statin at the lowest starting daily dose and another statin at any daily dose", with adverse findings that are "temporally related to statin treatment and reversible upon statin discontinuation, but reproducible by rechallenge" after excluding other determinants; it specifies lowest starting doses as "rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg and pitavastatin 2 mg". A Unified Definition from an International Lipid Expert Panel requires "The inability to tolerate at least two different statins - one statin at the lowest starting average daily dose and the other statin at any dose" with confirmed adverse effects or biomarker abnormalities, improvement "upon dose decrease or discontinuation", and that changes are "not attributable to established predispositions such as drug-drug interactions and recognized conditions". The European Atherosclerosis Society statement notes assessment should "take account of the nature of the muscle symptoms, the elevation in CK levels and their temporal association with statin initiation, discontinuation, and re-challenge".

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^4425dee1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives
- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin.• To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40).

Authors' Conclusions

This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

### Interpretation of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of statin therapy [^a3769b73]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

This Review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment. Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (ie, coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved. For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an effective low-cost statin regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about £2 per month) for 5 years in 10000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1000 patients (ie, 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease (secondary prevention) and in 500 patients (ie, 5% absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (primary prevention). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long term. The only serious adverse events that have been shown to be caused by long-term statin therapy-ie, adverse effects of the statin-are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase), new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, probably, haemorrhagic stroke. Typically, treatment of 10000 patients for 5 years with an effective regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would cause about 5 cases of myopathy (one of which might progress, if the statin therapy is not stopped, to the more severe condition of rhabdomyolysis), 50–100 new cases of diabetes, and 5–10 haemorrhagic strokes. However, any adverse impact of these side-effects on major vascular events has already been taken into account in the estimates of the absolute benefits. Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (eg, muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50–100 patients (ie, 0.5–1.0% absolute harm) per 10000 treated for 5 years. However, placebo-controlled randomised trials have shown definitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution). The large-scale evidence available from randomised trials also indicates that it is unlikely that large absolute excesses in other serious adverse events still await discovery. Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy would not be expected to alter materially the balance of benefits and harms. It is, therefore, of concern that exaggerated claims about side-effect rates with statin therapy may be responsible for its under-use among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For, whereas the rare cases of myopathy and any muscle-related symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped, the heart attacks or strokes that may occur if statin therapy is stopped unnecessarily can be devastating.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^df77fe63]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Statin therapy as primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people with HIV — For those aged 40–75 years with 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%, the Panel recommends initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (AI); recommended options are pitavastatin 4 mg once daily (AI), atorvastatin 20 mg once daily (AII), and rosuvastatin 10 mg once daily (AII). When 10-year ASCVD risk estimates are < 5%, the Panel favors initiating at least moderate-intensity statin therapy (CI), using the same options for moderate-intensity statin therapy as recommended for 10-year ASCVD risk estimates of 5% to < 20%. The absolute benefit from statin therapy is modest in this population; therefore, the decision to initiate a statin should take into account the presence or absence of HIV-related factors that can increase ASCVD risk. For people aged < 40 years, data are insufficient to recommend for or against statin therapy as primary prevention of ASCVD in people with HIV. Estimates are based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator from the American College of Cardiology (ACC).

### Clinical insights from the treating to new targets trial [^8c337bdd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial enrolled 10,001 patients with coronary disease to treatment with atorvastatin, 80 or 10 mg/d, and observed them for a median of 4.9 years. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were 77 mg/dL in the 80-mg group and 101 mg/dL in the 10-mg group. The primary end point, a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infraction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and stroke, occurred in 10.9% of patients in the 10-mg and 8.7% of patients in the 80-mg group (P = 0.0002). In large subgroups of patients in TNT, specifically those with diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, or previous coronary bypass (CABG) surgery, the risk of an event was significantly higher than in patients without these features. The absolute risk reduction in the 80-mg group was greater in each of these subgroups than in other TNT patients. The rates of stroke and hospitalization for heart failure were significantly lower in the more aggressively treated patients. A total of 18,696 patients have taken 80 mg of atorvastatin in clinical trials, usually for 4 to 5 years, with an excellent safety record. Pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that treatment with the 80-mg dose instead of the 10-mg dose almost costs neutral in US TNT-like patients (additional cost $181 for 5 years). In summary, wider use of the 80-mg dose of atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease is safe, cost-effective, and provides an incremental reduction in coronary events.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add-on therapy in high-cardiovascular-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with atorvastatin (20 or 40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 or 20 mg): design and rationale of the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies [^dfe5b02b]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A recent study conducted with another proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, in patients with hypercholesterolemia and on stable, daily, moderate‐intensity (10 mg atorvastatin, 40 mg simvastatin, or 5 mg rosuvastatin) or high‐intensity (80 mg atorvastatin or 40 mg rosuvastatin) statin therapy, assessed the LDL‐C–lowering effect of added evolocumab or ezetimibe. 31 Findings showed that the addition of evolocumab resulted in additional LDL‐C lowering. 31 The ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies assess the lipid‐lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add‐on therapy in comparison with the current clinical strategies that exist for high–CV‐risk patients whose LDL‐C levels are not sufficiently reduced with the most commonly used atorvastatin or rosuvastatin doses. The studies are designed to answer practical questions facing the clinician: Which clinical strategy provides the best combination of LDL‐C–lowering efficacy and safety/tolerability? Add alirocumab? Increase the statin dose or switch to another statin, or add ezetimibe? The study design also provides flexibility in the alirocumab dosing regimen, which in turn allows for individualized therapy based on the degree of LDL‐C reduction required to achieve the desired treatment response.

Whether additional LDL‐C lowering in patients optimally treated with statins will further reduce CV events is under evaluation in ongoing trials of ezetimibe as well as a number of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial is evaluating alirocumab in patients with acute coronary syndromes.

In conclusion, the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies aim to provide further data regarding the efficacy of alirocumab to reduce LDL‐C levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia at high CV risk, in particular those patients who are not achieving specific LDL‐C levels with the most commonly used atorvastatin or rosuvastatin doses. This trial will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab in a larger patient population over 24 weeks.

### Atorvastatin has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on kidney function and associated cardiovascular outcomes: post hoc analysis of 6 double-blind randomized controlled trials [^a622af6a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

In the pooled analysis, individual data of 30 621 patients from 6 RCTs who were randomly assigned to either placebo (10 057), atorvastatin 10 mg (12 763), or atorvastatin 80 mg (7801), were analyzed. Median treatment duration was 3.9 (range: 1‐4.9) years. Pooled demographic and baseline characteristics of the 6 RCTs are given in Table 2 (for the demographics of the 6 separate studies included see Tables S1 through S6). Due to differences in disease conditions and study design, almost all baseline characteristics of the 3 groups, including sex, body mass index, systolic and diastolic BP, reciprocal serum creatinine, plasma total, high‐density lipoprotein, and LDL cholesterol, hypertension, history of CVD, and diuretic, RAAS inhibitor, and/or aspirin use, differed significantly. Furthermore, in the atorvastatin 10‐mg group, age was significantly lower as compared with the placebo and atorvastatin 80‐mg groups. The atorvastin 80‐mg group contained a slightly but significantly lower number of subjects from African descent as compared with the atorvastatin 10‐mg group and higher numbers of subjects of white descent as compared to placebo. The presence of CKD at baseline was higher and eGFR was lower in the atorvastatin 80‐mg group as compared with placebo and the atorvastatin 10‐mg groups (Table 2).

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Twelve-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparison of the effects of rosuvastatin 10 mg / D and atorvastatin 10 mg / D in high-risk adults: a DISCOVERY study [^730fd4ac]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) advocate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels as the primary goals. However, approximately 50% to 60% of patients fail to reach recommended cholesterol goals.

Objectives

The primary objective of this Direct Statin Comparison of LDL-C Values: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin Therapy Compared with Atorvastatin (DISCOVERY) trial was to compare the efficacy of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors rosuvastatin calcium and atorvastatin calcium in achieving the 1998 Second Joint Task Force (JTF) of European and Other Societies on Coronary Prevention target for LDL-C. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in achieving the 1998 JTF-recommended goal for TC and modifying other lipid levels, and to compare the tolerability of the 2 statins.

Methods

This 12-week, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group trial was conducted at 210 centers in Finland, Iceland, and Ireland. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a high risk for CHD and primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L [> 135 mg/dL]) were randomized (2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg PO OD for 12 weeks. Before randomization, statin-naive patients underwent 6 weeks of dietary counseling, whereas patients receiving treatment with a starting dose of another lipid-lowering therapy but with an LDL-C level > 3.1 mmol/L (> 120 mg/dL) were switched to study drug immediately after they were determined eligible for the study Patients were assessed for fasting lipid levels at weeks 0 and 12, and the proportions of patients attaining 1998 and 2003 JTF lipid goals (1998: LDL-C, < 3.0 mmol/L [< 116 mg/dL]; TC, < 5.0 mmol/L [< 193 mg/dL]; 2003: LDL-C, < 2.5 mmol/L [< 97 mg/dL]; TC, < 4.5 mmol/L [< 174 mg/dL]) were calculated. Tolerability was monitored for the 12-week study and for an additional 36-week optional extension period.

Results

One thousand twenty-four patients were randomized to treatment (568 men, 456 women; mean age, 60.7 years). Patient demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The efficacy analysis consisted of 911 patients (504 men, 407 women; mean age, 60.7 years; mean body weight, 82.4 kg); 627 received rosuvastatin and 284 received atorvastatin. Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.05), and with a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P < (105). A greater proportion of patients in the rosuvastatin group compared with the atorvastatin group reached the 1998 goals for LDL-C (83.4% vs 683%; P < 0.001) and TC (76.4% vs 59.5%; P < 0.001). Also, compared with the atorvastatin group, greater proportions of patients in the rosuvastatin group achieved the 2003 JTF goals for LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.001). Both agents were well tolerated: serious drug-related events were observed in ≤ 3.0% of patients in each group, and no clinically significant differences were found between the 2 treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study of selected patients at high risk for CHD and with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/d for 12 weeks was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Furthermore, significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved the 1998 and 2003 JTF-recommended lipid targets compared with those receiving atorvastatin. Both agents were well tolerated.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients with dyslipidemia with and without coronary heart disease [^f3c288be]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 10 mg versus simvastatin 20 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg versus simvastatin 80 mg was determined in a 6-week, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial of dyslipidemic patients with and without coronary heart disease. A total of 1,732 patients with hypercholesterolemia and triglycerides ≤ 600 mg/dl (6.8 mmol/L) were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 650), simvastatin 20 mg (n = 650), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 216), or simvastatin 80 mg (n = 216). The primary efficacy parameter was the change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline to week 6. Secondary efficacy parameters included the percent change from baseline to week 6 in total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and the percent of patients achieving their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) LDL cholesterol goal at study end. Atorvastatin had significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol than simvastatin in both comparator groups: atorvastatin 10 mg (37.1%) versus simvastatin 20 mg (35.4%) (p = 0.0097), and atorvastatin 80 mg (53.4%) versus simvastatin 80 mg (46.7%) (p < 0.0001). Atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg also provided significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B than simvastatin 20 and 80 mg, respectively (all p < 0.05). All treatment groups had a significantly decreased LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio from baseline (all p < 0.0001). In both comparator groups a higher proportion of atorvastatin-treated patients reached their NCEP LDL cholesterol goal compared with simvastatin. All 4 study treatments were well tolerated.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Evidence from meta‐analyses and well‐controlled randomized trials of statin therapy show that reducing LDL‐C is associated with a significant reduction in risk of CV events and mortality. 1, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Despite the availability of statins and other LLTs, many patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CV risk are not achieving LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients tend to be initiated on low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin therapy (a daily dose that provides an approximate < 30% to 30% to 50% LDL‐C reduction, respectively), with up‐titration or switching to a higher‐intensity statin regimen (a daily dose that provides an approximate ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction) as necessary for individuals not achieving LDL‐C targets or the expected therapeutic response from the initial dose of statin. 12, 13

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk.

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^dd0aaefd]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

The combination of low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) is significantly more effective in reducing LDL‐C levels than low‐intensity atorvastatin (5 mg), ezetimibe (10 mg), or moderate‐intensity atorvastatin (10 mg) monotherapy in patients with dyslipidemia. The combination therapy also shows good efficacy in improving other lipid levels, including non‐HDL‐C and Apo B levels, and the Apo B/Apo AI ratio, with a rapid onset of the effect observed within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This approach offers a viable alternative for patients who are intolerant to high‐intensity statins or who are unable to use or afford PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin initiated at different starting doses in patients with dyslipidemia [^192e6023]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The NASDAC study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin at starting doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg.

Methods

After an 8-week placebo washout period, 919 patients who were candidates for lipid-lowering therapy according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were randomized to 1 of 4 atorvastatin treatment groups: 10 mg (n = 229), 20 mg (n = 228), 40 mg (n = 231), and 80 mg (n = 231).

Results

Atorvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels dose dependently across the 10- to 80-mg-dose range (35.7%-52.2%). Each of the 20-, 40-, and 80-mg doses provided significantly greater decreases in LDL-C than all lower doses (P < .01). All doses also reduced total cholesterol, the LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides from baseline. An increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed in all dose groups. Most participants, regardless of their level of coronary heart disease risk, attained their National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goal by the end of the study. Patients in all risk groups were more likely to achieve the NCEP LDL-C goal at higher starting doses. Atorvastatin was well tolerated at all dose levels.

Conclusions

Atorvastatin initiated at doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia. Depending on the percentage reduction needed to achieve an LDL-C goal, patients with or at risk of coronary heart disease may benefit from starting therapy at a higher dose of atorvastatin.

Pediatric dyslipidemia — statin therapy initiation, dosing, monitoring, and counseling: If low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) remains ≥ 130 to 159 mg/dL after lifestyle/diet management (CHILD 1 → CHILD 2-LDL) in a child age 10 years or older with specified combinations of high- and moderate-level risk factors, then statin therapy should be considered (Grade C). For children ages 8 and 9 years with LDL–C persistently ≥ 190 mg/dL after lifestyle/diet management together with multiple first-degree family members with premature cardiovascular disease/events or qualifying risk factors/conditions, statin therapy should be considered (Grade B). Statin use should begin with the lowest available dose given once daily; if LDL–C target levels are not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, the dose may be increased by one increment (usually 10 mg), and if still not achieved with at least 3 months of compliant use, the dose may be further increased by one increment; alternatively, a second agent such as a bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist (Grade B). Children taking a statin should have routine clinical monitoring for symptoms of muscle toxicity and assessment of hepatic transaminases and creatine kinase (Grade A). Pediatric care providers should be on the alert for, and children and families counseled about, potential medication interactions (Grade D). Females taking a statin should be counseled about risks associated with pregnancy and appropriate contraception strategies if indicated; use of oral contraceptives in combination with statins is not contraindicated (Grade D).

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 8.)

In three multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 9).

Table 9 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the trials summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

Hypertriglyceridemia in Adults

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 10). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267–1502).

2.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets are 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin calcium tablets are 10 mg to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin calcium tablets should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin calcium tablets, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.

2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 Years to 17 Years of Age)

The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin calcium tablets are 10 mg/day; the usual dose range is 10 mg to 20 mg orally once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.

2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia

The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets in patients with HoFH is 10 mg to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin calcium tablets should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable.

2.4 Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy

Atorvastatin calcium tablets may be used with bile acid resins. The combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates should generally be used with caution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

2.5 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin calcium tablets; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statins are first‐line therapy for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. 1 Several international guidelines recommend high‐risk and very high‐risk patients achieve low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels < 100 mg/dL and < 70 mg/dL, respectively. 2, 3, 4 However, many patients fail to reach expected or recommended LDL‐C levels on statin therapy. For example, a 2012 cross‐sectional survey reported that approximately two‐thirds of high‐risk patients on statin monotherapy for > 90 days did not achieve LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL, and only an estimated quarter of these high‐risk patients had LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL. 5 Surveys from other countries show similar results. 6, 7, 8, 9 A European study found that of dyslipidemic patients receiving lipid‐lowering drugs, fewer than half achieved LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL. 6 In addition, studies have shown that approximately 80% of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) do not achieve LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL from a statin. 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients are typically started on a statin of moderate intensity, where the daily dose is expected to lower LDL‐C levels by approximately 30% to < 50%. 12, 13 However, the recent 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults recommended high‐intensity statin therapy that lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50% for higher‐risk patients, such as those with clinical ASCVD, diabetes mellitus (with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%), and for LDL‐C ≥ 190 mg/dL. 1

If patients fail to reach target LDL‐C levels or achieve the expected therapeutic response on their initial statin therapy, the treating clinician currently has the options of increasing the statin dose or switching to a more effective LDL‐C–lowering statin; and for those unable to tolerate high‐intensity statins, nonstatin therapy may be added to further lower LDL‐C (most commonly ezetimibe). 1 Given the degree to which hypercholesterolemia remains poorly controlled, even with statin therapy, high–CV‐risk patients may benefit from more intensive cholesterol‐lowering therapy options. 1, 5, 14

### Comparative safety of atorvastatin 80 mg versus 10 mg derived from analysis of 49 completed trials in 14, 236 patients [^016d6401]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Atorvastatin has been shown to reduce coronary events and revascularization procedures in patients with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease. Recent studies with atorvastatin 80 mg support the overall safety of this dose during long-term treatment. However, physicians appear reluctant to use high doses of statins. A retrospective analysis of pooled data from 49 clinical trials of atorvastatin in 14,236 patients treated for an average period of 2 weeks to 52 months was conducted. The study compared the safety of atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 7,258), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 4,798), and placebo (n = 2,180) and included analyses on treatment-associated adverse events; nonserious and serious adverse events related to the musculoskeletal, hepatic, and renal systems; the incidence of elevations of creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); and hepatic transaminases > 3 times ULN. Percentages of patients experiencing ≥ 1 adverse event were similar across all 3 groups. Withdrawals due to treatment-related adverse events were observed in 2.4%, 1.8%, and 1.2% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were rare and seldom led to treatment withdrawal with any dose. Treatment-associated myalgia was observed in 1.4%, 1.5%, and 0.7% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in any group. Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases > 3 times ULN were observed in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The incidence of treatment-associated adverse events for atorvastatin 80 mg was similar to that of atorvastatin 10 mg and placebo. In conclusion, the results of this analysis support the positive safety profile of atorvastatin at the highest dose.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^bc77fbc2]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

Representative high-intensity doses include Atorvastatin (40 mg†) 80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20 mg (40 mg). Moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10 mg (20 mg), Rosuvastatin (5 mg) 10 mg, Simvastatin 20–40 mg§, Pravastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Lovastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Fluvastatin XL 80 mg, Fluvastatin 40 mg BID, and Pitavastatin 1–4 mg; a low-intensity example is Fluvastatin 20–40 mg. Boldface type indicates statins and doses evaluated in randomized controlled trials that demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Percent reductions are estimates from large populations and individual responses vary in clinical practice.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety of atorvastatin (10mg) with simvastatin (10mg) at six weeks. ASSET investigators [^dfce9b8f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The 6-week efficacy and safety of atorvastatin versus simvastatin was determined during a 54-week, open-label, multicenter, parallel-arm, treat-to-target study. In all, 1,424 patients with mixed dyslipidemia (triglyceride 200 to 600 mg/dl [2.26 to 6.77 mmol/L]) were stratified to 1 of 2 groups (diabetes or no diabetes). Patients were then randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg/ day (n = 730) or simvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 694). Efficacy was determined by measuring changes from baseline in lipid parameters including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater (p < 0.0001) reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol (37.2% vs 29.6%), total cholesterol (27.6% vs 21.5%), triglycerides (22.1% vs 16.0%), the ratio of LDL cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (41.1% vs 33.7%), and apolipoprotein B (28.3% vs 21.2%), and a comparable increase from baseline in HDL cholesterol (7.4% vs 6.9%). Atorvastatin was also significantly (p < 0.0001) more effective than simvastatin at treating the overall patient population to LDL cholesterol goals (55.6% vs 38.4%). Fewer than 6% of patients in either treatment group experienced drug-attributable adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate in nature. Diabetic patients treated with either statin had safety characteristics similar to nondiabetics, with atorvastatin exhibiting superior efficacy to simvastatin. In conclusion, atorvastatin, at a dose of 10 mg/day, is more effective than simvastatin 10 mg/day at lowering lipids and reaching LDL cholesterol goals in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Both statins are well tolerated with safety profiles similar to other members of the statin class.

An effect of atorvastatin was seen regardless of age, sex, or baseline lipid levels.

Atorvastatin significantly reduced the risk of stroke by 48% (21 events in the atorvastatin group vs. 39 events in the placebo group), HR 0.52, 95% CI (0.31, 0.89) (p = 0.016) and reduced the risk of MI by 42% (38 events in the atorvastatin group vs. 64 events in the placebo group), HR 0.58, 95.1% CI (0.39, 0.86) (p = 0.007). There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for angina, revascularization procedures, and acute CHD death.

There were 61 deaths in the atorvastatin group vs. 82 deaths in the placebo group (HR 0.73, p = 0.059).

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^853a9ff4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^2c53dcc4]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Rationale and panel recommendation for statin choice in people with HIV indicate that pitavastatin was selected in part due to lower drug–drug interaction potential with certain antiretroviral (ARV) medications; evidence among people with HIV shows biomarker reductions with pitavastatin 4 mg daily, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily, and high-dose atorvastatin 80 mg daily, as well as imaging benefits with atorvastatin initiated at 20 mg daily and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily; cumulatively, among those aged 40 to 75 years with ASCVD risk between 5% and < 20%, this motivated the Panel's recommendation for use of at least moderate-intensity statins to include pitavastatin 4 mg daily (AI), atorvastatin 20 mg daily (AII), or rosuvastatin 10 mg daily (AII).

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

For high‐risk individuals who require greater LDL‐C lowering than that achieved with statin therapy alone, some guidelines recommend combination of statin therapy with ≥ 1 other LLT. Guidelines also recommend the use of other LLTs for individuals who are unable to tolerate a statin dose sufficient to reduce LDL‐C to target levels or who are unable to tolerate high‐intensity statin therapy or achieve the desired percent reduction in LDL‐C. 1, 12, 13

Despite these guidelines, however, studies conducted in real‐world settings suggest that the percentage of patients achieving recommended LDL‐C levels is not optimal and can be improved. 6, 7, 8, 28 For example, an observational study assessing treatment practice patterns in high–CV‐risk patients on statin monotherapy found that although greater LDL‐C reductions were seen in patients who received add‐on ezetimibe therapy or underwent a statin dose up‐titration, approximately 30% of these patients were not achieving LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL, 29 suggesting that currently available treatment options are not sufficient for some higher‐risk patients. Furthermore, recent evidence also suggests doubling the dose to that of a high‐intensity statin may provide minimal benefit from additional LDL‐C lowering. 30 For example, it was calculated that increasing the dose from 40 mg to 80 mg of atorvastatin may result in only an approximate 2% reduction in the risk of clinical events. 30 Overall, whereas statins have been shown to be efficacious in lowering LDL‐C, patients at high CV risk may benefit from additional, more intensive LLTs to help them achieve their LDL‐C goals.

### Comparative efficacy study of atorvastatin vs simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin and placebo in type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolaemia [^b979efbc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2000). Low credibility.

Although there is little information from primary or secondary prevention trials on cholesterol-lowering medication in diabetic patients, the reduction of elevated cholesterol is widely recommended for this group. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends drug therapy in diabetic patients if low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol remains at > 130 mg/dl, or > 100 mg/dl in patients with macroangiopathy, after dietary intervention. When cholesterollowering medication is indicated, the choice of the drug must take into account the other lipid abnormalities that are often present and the need to maintain optimal glycaemic control. In the present study we compared the efficacy and safety of the novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin at the dose of 10 mg/day with simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin at doses of 10, 20 and 20 mg/day, respectively, and placebo, in type 2 diabetic patients with moderate elevation of LDL-cholesterol with or without elevation of triglycerides. All the quoted agents are enzyme inhibitors effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol in humans. The efficacy endpoints were the mean per cent changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol (primary), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations from baseline to the end of treatment (24 weeks). Atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day produced: (1) a significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol (-37%) in comparison with equivalent doses of simvastatin (-26%), pravastatin (-23%), lovastatin (-21%), and placebo (-1%); (2) HDL-cholesterol increases (7.4%) comparable to or greater than those obtained with simvastatin (7.1%), pravastatin (3.2%), lovastatin (7.21%), and placebo (-0.5%); (3) a significantly greater reduction in total cholesterol (- 29%) than that obtained with simvastatin (-21%), pravastain (-16%), lovastatin (-18%), and placebo (1%); and (4) a significantly greater reduction in triglycerides than that obtained with all the other drugs and placebo. In all treatment groups no significant variation in fibrinogen concentration was observed. All reductase inhibitors studied had similar levels of tolerance. There were no incidents of persistent elevations of serum aminotransferases or myositis.

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^316f0a16]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Methods and Results

In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to < 250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks; during the following 40 weeks, dosages could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12 weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs 39%, both P < .001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs 73% and 75%, and 86% vs 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs 44%, P < .05 and P < .001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin 10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs 87%), with 82% of patients treated with rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg starting dosage without the need for titration, compared with 59% of patients treated with atorvastatin. Both treatments were well tolerated over 52 weeks.

Conclusion

Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, which may offer advantages in LDL-C goal attainment over existing lipid-lowering therapies.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Randomization

In OPTIONS I, depending on whether they were receiving 20 mg or 40 mg atorvastatin daily at baseline, patients were randomized to 1 of 3 (20 mg atorvastatin daily at baseline) or 1 of 4 (40 mg atorvastatin daily at baseline) treatment arms (Figure 1). In OPTIONS II, patients receiving 10 mg or 20 mg rosuvastatin daily at baseline were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (Figure 1). Screening was stopped once approximately 5% to 10% more patients than specified by the protocol were projected to be randomized for a given baseline statin regimen.

For each study, and within each baseline statin regimen, randomization was stratified according to whether or not the patient has a history of either myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. This stratification contributes to balance patient history of these major atherosclerosis‐associated CV events in treatment arms across the clinical trials program.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Overview

The OPTIONS I and OPTIONS II clinical trials are phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, active‐comparator, and parallel‐group studies that were conducted across North America, Europe, and Australia. OPTIONS I commenced October 2012, was conducted at 91 sites, and completed in June 2014. OPTIONS II commenced November 2012, was conducted at 90 sites, and also completed in June 2014.

The trials were performed in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable amendments laid down by the World Medical Assemblies and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval of the protocols and informed consent forms were obtained from each study site, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Study Objectives

The primary objective of OPTIONS I is to compare the LDL‐C–lowering efficacy and safety of adding alirocumab to the most commonly used doses of atorvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg) with the strategies of adding ezetimibe, doubling the atorvastatin dose, or switching from atorvastatin 40 mg to rosuvastatin 40 mg. Patients were receiving either atorvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg at baseline and had received this stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks.

OPTIONS II focuses on patients receiving rosuvastatin. Here, the LDL‐C–lowering efficacy and safety of adding alirocumab to rosuvastatin will be compared with adding ezetimibe or doubling the rosuvastatin dose. Patients were receiving either rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg at baseline and had received the same dose for ≥ 4 weeks.

Both studies are evaluating these treatment options in high–CV‐risk patients whose LDL‐C levels were greater than or equal to the prespecified levels of 70 mg/dL or 100 mg/dL on their existing statin dose (Table 1). The levels were based on guidelines current at the time the protocols were finalized. 12, 13 In both studies, patients could have been on other lipid‐lowering therapies (LLTs), except for ezetimibe or statins other than atorvastatin (for OPTIONS I) and rosuvastatin (OPTIONS II).

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^aec55ff0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) — statin dosing strategies to optimize tolerability include using a lower dose, switching to a different statin or biotransformation pathway, intermittent dosing with longer half-life statins, evidence-based selection, naturally derived options, choosing the lowest milligram strength, and temporary washout. Consider using the lowest daily dose which will provide the majority of the statin's low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering capacity; for example, a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 80 mg daily may tolerate atorvastatin 10 mg daily. Intermittent dosing is reserved for more severe cases where patients cannot tolerate even the lowest daily dose, and utilizing statins with longer half-lives and greater potency (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) is recommended in this context, such as rosuvastatin 5 mg given three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for a patient with SAMS on atorvastatin 10–80 mg daily. Some patients may be more accepting of statins shown to have reduced rates of SAMS in clinical trials (e.g., consider fluvastatin-XL or pravastatin instead of simvastatin), may prefer a naturally derived statin (e.g., lovastatin is FDA-approved whereas red yeast rice is not), or may accept a drug with a lower milligram strength (e.g., pitavastatin 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg versus 10 to 80 mg for other statins). Some patients may benefit from a washout period or drug holiday, for example a patient taking rosuvastatin 20 mg daily who takes a 1–2 week drug holiday in preparation for a strenuous physical event, and holding the statin for a few days to a few weeks before restarting may improve persistence rates. Although the table emphasizes dosing strategies, optimizing dietary and lifestyle interventions is recommended for all patients.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^7a6a35b1]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Digoxin–statin interactions — quantitative effects and monitoring — are described with atorvastatin as a potential contributor to digoxin exposure. In a study that included 24 healthy volunteers, the addition of atorvastatin 80 mg to digoxin resulted in an average increase of 20% in the Cmax of digoxin and an average 15% increase in the AUC of digoxin, whereas lower doses of atorvastatin (10 mg) did not alter digoxin pharmacokinetics. Atorvastatin is the only statin that appears to be associated with a potential DDI when used in combination with digoxin, and patients on higher doses of atorvastatin may be at increased risk of digoxin toxicity, with closer monitoring recommended; nonetheless, digoxin coadministration with any statin is reasonable if clinically indicated.

### Effect of high-dose atorvastatin on hospitalizations for heart failure: subgroup analysis of the treating to new targets (TNT) study [^4b1642b6]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Statins reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, but their potential benefit as treatment for heart failure (HF) is less clear.

Methods and Results

Patients (n = 10,001) with stable coronary disease were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin 80 or 10 mg/d and followed up for a median of 4.9 years. A history of HF was present in 7.8% of patients. A known ejection fraction < 30% and advanced HF were exclusion criteria for the study. A predefined secondary end point of the study was hospitalization for HF. The incidence of hospitalization for HF was 2.4% in the 80-mg arm and 3.3% in the 10-mg arm (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.94; P = 0.0116). The treatment effect of the higher dose was more marked in patients with a history of HF: 17.3% versus 10.6% in the 10- and 80-mg arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.88; P = 0.009). Among patients without a history of HF, the rates of hospitalization for HF were much lower: 1.8% in the 80-mg group and 2.0% in the 10-mg group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.16; P = 0.34). Only one third of patients hospitalized for HF had evidence of preceding angina or myocardial infarction during the study period. Blood pressure was almost identical during follow-up in the treatment groups.

Conclusions

Compared with a lower dose, intensive treatment with atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease significantly reduces hospitalizations for HF. In a post hoc analysis, this benefit was observed only in patients with a history of HF. The mechanism accounting for this benefit is unlikely to be due primarily to a reduction in interim coronary events or differences in blood pressure.

### Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe / simvastatin combination versus atorvastatin alone in adults ≥ 65 years of age with hypercholesterolemia and with or at moderately high / high risk for coronary heart disease (the VYTELD study) [^a6f1bfa9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Higher than 80% of coronary heart disease-related mortality occurs in patients ≥ 65 years of age. Guidelines recommend low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets for these at-risk patients; however, few clinical studies have evaluated lipid-lowering strategies specifically in older adults. This multicenter, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the usual starting dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 mg) versus atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg and the next higher dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/40 mg) versus atorvastatin 40 mg in 1,289 hypercholesterolemic patients ≥ 65 years of age with or without cardiovascular disease. Patients randomized to ezetimibe/simvastatin had greater percent decreases in LDL cholesterol (-54.2% for 10/20 mg vs -39.5% and -46.6% for atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg, respectively; -59.1% for 10/40 mg vs -50.8% for atorvastatin 40 mg; p < 0.001 for all comparisons) and the number attaining LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dl (51.3% for 10/20 mg, 68.2% for 10/40 mg) and < 100 mg/dl (83.6% for 10/20 mg; 90.3% for 10/40 mg) was significantly larger compared to those receiving atorvastatin for all prespecified dose comparisons (p < 0.05 to < 0.001). A significantly larger percentage of high-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dl on ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (54.3%) versus atorvastatin 10 mg (10.9%, p < 0.001) or 20 mg (28.9%, p < 0.001) and ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg (69.2%) versus atorvastatin 40 mg (38.2%, p < 0.001), and a significantly larger percentage of intermediate-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl on ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (82.1%) versus atorvastatin 10 mg (59.3%, p < 0.05). Improvements in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein ratios were significantly greater with ezetimibe/simvastatin than atorvastatin for all comparisons (p < 0.01 to < 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride results were variable. All treatments were generally well tolerated. In conclusion, ezetimibe/simvastatin provided significantly greater improvements in key lipid parameters and higher attainment of LDL cholesterol targets than atorvastatin, with comparable tolerability.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^5c960d1c]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients considered at high enough risk to warrant treating to a goal of LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L and a greater than 50% decrease from baseline levels include, as in case 1 (figure 3), those who are asymptomatic but have a cardiometabolic disorder or high LDL-C due to inherited conditions such as FH. On combination therapy, case 1 should achieve both goals. Patients at very high risk, such as case 2, are recommended to reach an LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L and a greater than 50% decrease from baseline levels. In this example, statin-associated muscle symptoms limited the dose of statin used, and while the patient should be maintained on the maximum tolerated dose, the LDL-C goal will likely only be achieved with combination therapy. A clinical judgement has to be made whether to (1) accept the slightly higher than optimal predicted LDL-C of 1.8 mmol/L on statin plus ezetimibe, while achieving a greater than 50% decrease from the notional baseline of 4.0 mmol/L (estimated from the measured LDL-C on statin monotherapy and the average LDL-C decrease on that statin dose), or (2) prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor to achieve the more aggressive goal. The additional 0.9 mmol/L drop is predicted to deliver a further 20% reduction in riskand the cost–benefit decision will be dependent on the perceived ongoing ASCVD risk for this patient. Case 3 is an example of ASCVD that follows an aggressive course with a major coronary event occurring a relatively short time after the initial clinical presentation. Despite recommendations to use the maximum dose of a statin, the patient (as is common) was on a less than optimal dose of atorvastatin after angioplasty, which was only increased in steps to 80 mg after the second event. While the new guidelines set experiencing a second vascular event 'within 2 years' as the benchmark for defining this highest risk category, application of clinical judgement would again lead to the adoption of the most aggressive goal of LDL-C < 1.0 mmol/L.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^0a0f525c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — many patients ultimately tolerate statins, and strategies include lower-dose statin, different statin, supplementation, and/or non-statins with defined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) effects at specific doses and in combination therapy. The text states that approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen and lists management strategies consisting of 1) same statin but lower dose, 2) different statin, 3) supplementation, and/or 4) non-statins. LDL-C lowering with statins is greatest at the lowest daily dose, which may achieve 2/3 of maximum effect with an additional 5–6% reduction from baseline with each doubling of dose; starting with atorvastatin 10 mg or rosuvastatin 5 mg offers a moderate intensity response that can result in a 33–45% reduction in LDL-C. Over 50% reduction in LDL-C can be achieved by adding ezetimibe or other non-statin pharmacotherapies to low to moderate-intensity statin treatment. In RACING, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus rosuvastatin 20 mg daily was associated with lower drug discontinuation (4.8% vs 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and greater achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at years 1, 2, and 3 (73%, 75%, 72% vs 55%, 60%, 58%, all p < 0.0001). For persistent intolerance during low-dose therapy, intermittent (non-daily) dosing may be needed, and it is recommended to use statins with a longer half-life; there are accounts of 20–40% LDL-C lowering depending on dose and dosing interval.

If the current statin is atorvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin, reduce statin dose to atorvastatin 10 mg daily, pitavastatin 1 mg daily, or rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, with no dose adjustment required for fluvastatin. If the patient is tolerating therapy after 2–3 months, if needed, titrate statin in 2–3 months to a maximum dose of atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, or pitavastatin 2 mg; if not tolerating, reduce statin dose or switch to fluvastatin.

### Effect of individualizing starting doses of a statin according to baseline LDL-cholesterol levels on achieving cholesterol targets: the achieve cholesterol targets fast with atorvastatin stratified titration (ACTFAST) study [^af4c1c9d]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate whether selecting the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target (< 2.6 mmol/L) LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) values would allow high-risk subjects to achieve target LDL-C concentration within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or a single uptitration.

Methods and Results

Twelve-week, prospective, open-label trial that enrolled 2117 high-risk subjects (statin-free [SF] or statin-treated [ST]). Subjects with LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L (100mg/dL) but ≤ 5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40 or 80 mg/day) based on LDL-C and status of statin use at baseline, with a single uptitration at 6 weeks, if required. There was no washout for ST subjects. At study end, 80% of SF (82%, 82%, 83% and 72% with 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) and 59% of ST (60%, 61% and 51% with 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) subjects reached LDL-C target. In the ST group, an additional 21–41% reduction in LDL-C was observed over the statin used at baseline. Atorvastatin was well tolerated.

Conclusion

This study confirms that individualizing the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-C values (i.e. the required LDL-C reduction), allows a large majority of high-risk subjects to achieve target safely, within 12 weeks, with the initial dose or with a single titration.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^bdfd63bf]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dyslipidemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In particular, elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels, are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. According to the meta‐analysis, the lowering of LDL‐C by about 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) with statin regimens safely reduced the major coronary events about a 23%. Consequently, lipid‐lowering therapies are key components in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely prescribed for their effectiveness in reducing LDL‐C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Importantly, aggressive LDL‐C lowering has been shown to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce inflammation, and ultimately prevent clinical events. However, despite the proven efficacy of statins, some patients do not achieve their target LDL‐C levels or experience side effects associated with higher doses. The most common adverse effects of high‐intensity statins include myopathy, an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, and new‐onset diabetes.

### Expanding options with a wider range of rosuvastatin doses [^b69dfb44]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The dose range for rosuvastatin in Europe has recently been expanded to 5 to 40 mg and is now in line with the dose range currently available in the United States.

Objective

The goal of this article was to review the efficacy and safety data available for the rosuvastatin 5-mg dose and discuss these data in the context of the full 5- to 40-mg dose range.

Methods

Articles referring to clinical efficacy or safety data for the 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin were identified and reviewed after a search of the MEDLINE database (2000-August 2006; English language only) using the search term rosuvastatin. Proceedings from major cardiology congresses (2000–2006) were also searched for additional information.

Results

Rosuvastatin 5 mg is significantly (P < 0.001) more effective at reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (42% and 30%) levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg (36% and 27%), simvastatin 20 mg (36% and 25%), and pravastatin 20 mg (27% and 19%). Rosuvastatin 5 mg allows significantly more patients to reach their LDL-C goals as recommended by the 2003 European guidelines and the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) (49%-52% and 67%-71%) than atorvastatin 10 mg (36%, P < 0.001; 53%, P < 0.01), simvastatin 20 mg (37%, P < 0.001; 64%, P < 0.05), and pravastatin 20 mg (12%, P < 0.001; 49%, P < 0.001). Rosuvastatin is well tolerated across the 5- to 40-mg dose range, with a type and incidence of adverse events similar to the other commonly available, but less effective, statins. The introduction of a 5-mg dose offers greater flexibility to prescribing physicians in that it provides an additional dosing option for those patients who are at a lower cardiovascular risk or who have an increased potential for developing myopathy with statin therapy.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin 5 mg is well tolerated and has beneficial effects across the atherogenic lipid profile by reducing LDL-C and total cholesterol, raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and helping a greater proportion of patients reach their LDL-C goals.

### Intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease [^19f12238]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Previous trials have demonstrated that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below currently recommended levels is beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes. We prospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD).

Methods

A total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident CHD and LDL cholesterol levels of less than 130 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter) were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy and received either 10 mg or 80 mg of atorvastatin per day. Patients were followed for a median of 4.9 years. The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from CHD, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke.

Results

The mean LDL cholesterol levels were 77 mg per deciliter (2.0 mmol per liter) during treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin and 101 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter) during treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin. The incidence of persistent elevations in liver aminotransferase levels was 0.2 percent in the group given 10 mg of atorvastatin and 1.2 percent in the group given 80 mg of atorvastatin (P < 0.001). A primary event occurred in 434 patients (8.7 percent) receiving 80 mg of atorvastatin, as compared with 548 patients (10.9 percent) receiving 10 mg of atorvastatin, representing an absolute reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events of 2.2 percent and a 22 percent relative reduction in risk (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.89; P < 0.001). There was no difference between the two treatment groups in overall mortality.

Conclusions

Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin per day in patients with stable CHD provides significant clinical benefit beyond that afforded by treatment with 10 mg of atorvastatin per day. This occurred with a greater incidence of elevated aminotransferase levels.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided statin decisions — in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk) adults or selected borderline-risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults in whom a CAC score is measured for the purpose of making a treatment decision, if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years so long as higher-risk conditions are absent; if the CAC score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the CAC score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Additionally, in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents: gaining decades of life by optimizing detection and treatment [^0f2e41cb]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia

Statins are the cornerstone of FH management. Simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin are approved in the USA and Europe for use in children with FH. In the USA, these are approved from age 10 years, except for pravastatin which is approved from age 8 years. Prescribing information is broadly similar in Europe, although rosuvastatin is approved from the age of 6 years. Atorvastatin is approved from age 6 years in Australia. Treatment may be started earlier in severe cases. The short-term efficacy and safety of these statins, including during puberty, have been confirmed.

Treatment should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose and up-titrated according to the LDL-C lowering response and tolerability. Evidence for an absolute target for LDL-C in children with FH does not exist. Expert consensus recommends a target LDL-C level < 3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) from age 10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from pre-treatment levels for children 8–10 years, particularly in those with high-risk conditions or other major risk factors. In patients with chronic kidney disease, a statin that is not excreted by the kidney, such as atorvastatin or simvastatin, should be used. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for drug-drug interactions with statins, notably, for drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 with simvastatin and atorvastatin, and for drugs metabolised by CYP 2C9 with rosuvastatin and fluvastatin. Pravastatin, although a weak statin, does not interfere with CYP enzymes and is therefore a safe drug for initiating treatment in children.

### Comparative effectiveness of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in acute ischemic stroke treatment [^b2309ced]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

For secondary prevention after ischemic stroke, especially when poststroke low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels exceed 100 mg/dL, 80 mg atorvastatin is indicated based on findings from the SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels) trial. However, unlike the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines, the European Stroke Organization guidelines and Korean dyslipidemia guidelines did not specify the use of particular statins like atorvastatin.

Recent studies of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases have demonstrated that moderate‐intensity rosuvastatin (10 mg) plus ezetimibe (10 mg) treatment was not inferior to high‐intensity rosuvastatin (20 mg) monotherapy. In addition, previous comparative studies revealed that compared with atorvastatin or other statins, rosuvastatin exhibited a superior LDL‐C lowering effect, but it did not significantly reduce the risk of vascular events. But these studies did not focus on patients with ischemic stroke. Research specifically addressing the use of rosuvastatin in patients with stroke remains insufficient. As a result, atorvastatin seems to be commonly preferred for secondary prevention in the acute phase of ischemic stroke.

Therefore, using a large stroke registry, we aimed to investigate whether 2 commonly used statins, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, differ in their effectiveness in reducing the risk of vascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, we explored whether the effects of the 2 statins varied or remained consistent when outcomes were stratified by statin treatment intensity, stroke subtypes, admission LDL‐C levels, or prior statin use.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

14.2 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

Atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apo B, and TG, and increases HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb). Therapeutic response is seen within 2 weeks, and maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Atorvastatin is effective in a wide variety of patient populations with hyperlipidemia, with and without hypertriglyceridemia, in men and women, and in the elderly.

In two multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin given as a single dose over 6 weeks, significantly reduced total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG. (Pooled results are provided in Table 9.)

In patients with Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia pooled from 24 controlled trials, the median (25thand 75thpercentile) percent changes from baseline in HDL-C for atorvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg were 6.4 (-1.4, 14), 8.7 (0, 17), 7.8 (0, 16), and 5.1 (-2.7, 15), respectively. Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in total-C, LDL-C, TG, total-C/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C.

In three multicenter, double-blind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 10).

The impact on clinical outcomes of the differences in lipid-altering effects between treatments shown in Table 10 is not known. Table 10 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The drugs compared in the studies summarized in the table are not necessarily interchangeable.

14.3 Hypertriglyceridemia

The response to atorvastatin in 64 patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson Type IV) treated across several clinical trials is shown in the table below (Table 11). For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267 to 1,502).

### The effects of atorvastatin on emotional processing, reward learning, verbal memory and inflammation in healthy volunteers: an experimental medicine study [^043c7271]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intriguingly, a previous clinical trial of the anti-inflammatory drug infliximab in a depressed sample did not identify any effect on mood scores until participants were stratified according to their serum CRP: those with CRP > 5.0 mg/L improved during infliximab treatment, whereas those with CRP below that threshold even showed a deterioration of their depressive symptoms. On the basis of several animal studies, it has been hypothesised that a degree of 'healthy inflammation' is necessary to maintain homeostatic processes of neuronal integrity, such as neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, that are involved in the pathophysiology of depression; in other words, any undue curbing of natural inflammatory processes in the CNS might be as detrimental as an excessive amount of neuroinflammation. It should be noted that our sample of healthy and mostly young volunteers, perhaps unsurprisingly, presented with overall quite low (mean = 1.58 mg/L) levels of hs-CRP across the two visits. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that younger depressed patients administered a statin may encounter less benefit on depressive symptoms, whereas a step-wise reduction in the risk of emerging depressive episodes with increasing age was observed for statin users. Although peripheral CRP and young age may not necessarily reflect baseline inflammation in the CNS, this raises the possibility that atorvastatin produced a worsening negative bias in our young participants because it impaired physiological homeostatic processes involved in emotional processing. Furthermore, the use of atorvastatin doses other than the 20 mg employed in this study could variably affect such homeostasis, and therefore lead to more positive or negative effects on emotional processing. Atorvastatin is safely administered to patients with cardiometabolic conditions in dose ranges between 10 and 80 mg according to guidelines. Therefore, further studies investigating these other dosages may help clarify whether there is any dose–response relationship between atorvastatin use, anti-inflammatory effects and emotional processing.
