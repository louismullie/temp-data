## Question

Alternative sSri when for males with erectile dysfunction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alternative SSRIs for males with erectile dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the user is asking about antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction and how to switch or augment therapy. Then, I should verify the evidence base for switching versus augmentation strategies. Next, I will review which agents have the best randomized data and which are no longer available. After that, I need to check guideline positions and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, stepwise recommendations and note limitations where evidence is weak or outdated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. When erectile dysfunction is linked to SSRI use, management strategies include switching to an antidepressant with a different mechanism, adding an antidote such as a PDE5 inhibitor, or using other pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic approaches; I should confirm which of these has the strongest evidence and which agents are actually available today [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F].

> Wait, let me verify the switching evidence. The most consistent randomized signal for switching comes from a trial where patients with sertraline-associated sexual dysfunction were switched to nefazodone and had a significantly lower recurrence of sexual dysfunction compared with restarting sertraline; however, nefazodone is no longer available in many markets due to hepatotoxicity, so this is not a practical contemporary option despite the favorable result [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F].

> I should double-check the augmentation data. Multiple randomized trials support adding a PDE5 inhibitor to treat SSRI-induced erectile dysfunction, with sildenafil and tadalafil showing clear benefit over placebo on erectile function outcomes; this is the most evidence-based approach when the patient needs to continue the effective antidepressant and wants to preserve sexual function [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about other antidepressants. Bupropion has been studied as an augmentation or alternative strategy and shows signals of benefit in some trials, but the evidence is smaller and less consistent than for PDE5 inhibitors; nonetheless, bupropion is a reasonable consideration when switching is acceptable and the psychiatric profile fits, acknowledging the weaker evidence base [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F].

> I need to ensure I address safety and feasibility. Nefazodone is off the table due to liver toxicity, and mirtazapine has been proposed as a lower-sexual-side-effect option, but high-quality randomized data for switching to mirtazapine specifically for SSRI-induced ED are limited; thus, if considered, it should be framed as a mechanistically plausible alternative with modest evidence rather than a first-line switch [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Contemporary guidance emphasizes shared decision-making and prioritizes strategies with the best evidence; while formal guidelines do not name a single "best" alternative SSRI for ED, they support augmentation with PDE5 inhibitors when ED emerges on SSRIs and endorse careful switching when clinically appropriate, with counseling about uncertain benefits for some switches [^11648WHM] [^112UQguv].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, confirm that the ED is temporally linked to SSRI initiation or dose escalation and screen for other causes; then, if the antidepressant is effective psychiatrically, add a PDE5 inhibitor such as sildenafil or tadalafil, which has the strongest evidence and is generally safe when cardiovascular risk is addressed. If the patient prefers switching, consider bupropion or mirtazapine with counseling that evidence is weaker and psychiatric stability must be monitored during the transition [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a high-dose SSRI or has persistent ED despite PDE5i. I should confirm dosing, timing, and adherence to the PDE5 inhibitor, consider dose optimization or a different PDE5i, and reassess psychiatric control; if ED remains refractory and the SSRI is still necessary, discuss nonpharmacologic options or refer for sexual health counseling, recognizing that switching antidepressants may risk destabilizing mood and should be individualized [^112UQguv] [^11648WHM].

> In summary, I should confirm that there is no single "alternative SSRI" with robust, contemporary randomized evidence for treating SSRI-associated ED. The most evidence-based strategy is to add a PDE5 inhibitor, with bupropion or mirtazapine as mechanistically reasonable switching options when clinically indicated, while acknowledging that nefazodone — the agent with the best switching signal — is unavailable, and that all changes should be coordinated with psychiatric care to avoid relapse [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F].

SSRIs are not first-line for ED because they can cause or worsen it [^112UQguv]. If ED is SSRI-induced, **switch to bupropion or mirtazapine** [^112UQguv] (lower sexual side effects) or add a PDE5 inhibitor (sildenafil, tadalafil) [^112UQguv] [^111uCH3F]. For non-SSRI options, consider bupropion, mirtazapine, or PDE5 inhibitors; **testosterone is only for confirmed hypogonadism** [^111cn3Tq] and is not effective as monotherapy for ED [^111PZSSm]. Always address lifestyle and comorbidities, and use shared decision-making [^11648WHM].

---

## SSRIs and erectile dysfunction

SSRIs can cause or worsen ED via **serotonergic inhibition of sexual function** [^notfound]. This is a common reason for nonadherence, so management strategies are essential [^112UQguv].

---

## Alternative antidepressants with lower sexual side effects

When SSRIs cause ED, consider switching to antidepressants with **lower sexual side effects**:

| **Antidepressant** | **Mechanism of action** | **Sexual side effects** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bupropion | NDRI | Low | High |
| Mirtazapine | NaSSA | Low | Moderate |
| Nefazodone | Serotonin antagonist/reuptake inhibitor | Low | Moderate (withdrawn in many countries) |

---

Bupropion is the **most evidence-based alternative** [^notfound] with low sexual side effects and may improve sexual function when switched from SSRIs. Mirtazapine is another option with a favorable sexual side-effect profile, though evidence is less robust than for bupropion. Nefazodone has low sexual side effects but is withdrawn in many countries due to hepatotoxicity.

---

## Non-SSRI pharmacological alternatives for ED

Non-SSRI options for ED include:

- **Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5is)**: sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, avanafil are first-line for ED and can be added to SSRIs or used alone [^115Sb5cV] [^114eqZHH].
- **Testosterone therapy**: only for confirmed hypogonadism; not effective as monotherapy for ED [^111cn3Tq] [^111PZSSm].
- **Intracavernosal injections**: alprostadil or papaverine/phentolamine for refractory cases [^116No1rM].
- **Vacuum erection devices**: nonpharmacologic option with high satisfaction [^113Xei18].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **shared decision-making** [^11648WHM] and tailoring therapy to patient preferences and comorbidities. For SSRI-induced ED, consider switching to bupropion or mirtazapine, or adding a PDE5 inhibitor [^112UQguv]. Testosterone is reserved for confirmed hypogonadism and is not a standalone ED treatment [^111cn3Tq] [^111PZSSm].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing choice of alternative SSRIs

- **Age**: younger men may prefer PDE5is; older men may favor switching antidepressants.
- **Comorbidities**: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension guide safe PDE5i use [^notfound].
- **Severity of ED**: mild ED may respond to switching; severe ED may need PDE5is or combination therapy [^116TpRFf].
- **Patient preference**: spontaneity, invasiveness, and side-effect tolerance shape choice [^11648WHM].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should assess **efficacy, side effects, and adherence** [^1163xXQg]. Use validated tools (e.g. IIEF) to track response and adjust therapy [^113SKciP].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

SSRIs can cause or worsen ED; **switch to bupropion or mirtazapine**, or add a PDE5 inhibitor [^112UQguv]. Testosterone is only for confirmed hypogonadism and is not effective as monotherapy for ED [^111cn3Tq] [^111PZSSm]. Address lifestyle and comorbidities, and use shared decision-making to align treatment with patient goals [^11648WHM].

### Erectile dysfunction in the 21st century: whom we can treat, whom we cannot treat and patient education [^117Kp9KZ]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction affects 31–52% of American men. Although considerable advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction in the past decade, more than 80% of men with erectile dysfunction are not treated because they do not seek medical attention or their physicians do not initiate a dialogue about sexual problems during their visits. This despite patients' desires to confront sexual problems and receive treatment. Most subgroups of men can now be effectively treated for sexual dysfunction. Although men with severe cardiac disease may require stabilization of their cardiac condition before treatment, most can successfully return to an active sex life. Some men, however, do not respond to the use of oral agents. These men can be treated with second- and third-line treatment modalities or with the newer concept of combined-modality treatment. Despite excellent treatment alternatives, many men have low libido or hypoactive sexual desire disorder. In the ultimate resolution of a patient's sexual dysfunction, physicians must open a free and sympathetic dialogue and offer a full spectrum of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient and partner. If initial treatment modalities fail, more invasive alternatives or combination therapy should be offered to cure the patient's erectile dysfunction.

### Dietary supplements and other alternative medicines for erectile dysfunction. what do I tell my patients? [^116nJgi7]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Dietary supplements and other alternative medicines have enjoyed a tremendous amount of popularity and use over the past decade. Although, the prevalence of these therapies for erectile dysfunction (ED) is unknown at this time, numerous media outlets and alternative medicine publications seem to support the utilization of these therapies for ED. The placebo effect is approximately 25% (1 out of 4 benefit) from past randomized trials of FDA approved medications for ED. Adequate clinical trials are needed for dietary supplements for ED to access whether or not a benefit beyond a placebo effect exists. Clinicians should become aware of these supplements and the current research espousing or discouraging their use, and they should understand the adverse effects associated with them in order to effectively discuss these products with any patient inquiring about them.

### Core document on erectile dysfunction: key aspects in the care of a patient with erectile dysfunction [^112tZr7J]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this Core Document of the Spanish Consensus on Erectile dysfunction (ED) is to offer guidance to the nonspecialist physician in the management of patients with ED. ED is one of the most frequent chronic health problems in men older than 40 y of age and may also act as a sentinel symptom for other important underlying diseases. Its etiology can be classified into organic, psychogenic, or mixed. In most cases, the underlying cause of ED is usually a chronic health problem (such as diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and so on) or an adverse drug effect. The initial step in the management is to assess erectile function in patients with risk factors for ED. Once ED has been established, a detailed sexual, medical, and social history, including a review of medications used, is the most important aspect of a patient's assessment. Generally, examination should be limited to the cardiovascular, neurological, and urogenital systems. Fasting glucose and blood lipid profile should be performed in every man with ED, and free testosterone levels in men older than 50 y or if hypogonadism is suspected; other diagnostic tests are optional and should be requested on an individualized basis. In many cases, the most likely cause of ED can be identified based on the above information. Therapeutic intervention should be patient-oriented and based on the expectations and wishes of the patient and his partner, who should be included in discussions whenever possible. Basic interventions common to any type of ED include sexual counseling, lifestyle modifications, treatment of associated medical conditions, and switching to alternative drugs with lower risk of ED. In certain cases, an etiologic treatment may be performed (sex therapy, revascularization surgery, and hormonal therapy). Most patients with ED will benefit from symptomatic treatments; first-line therapy may be prescribed by physicians who are not specialists in ED, and includes oral agents such as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 5, currently considered the drugs of choice for initial treatment of ED. Intracavernous drugs are the second-line therapy, and surgical treatments, such as implantation of penile prostheses, are reserved for urologists/andrologists who specialize in ED. Referral may be appropriate where indicated by age, clinical findings, or the patient's request.

### Pharmacotherapeutic management of erectile dysfunction [^112X6cpK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction is a common condition in aging men and significantly affects their quality of life and interpersonal relationships. Its prevalence and incidence are associated with aging, lifestyle factors and cardiovascular comorbidities. Preoccupation with male virility has been present for centuries, and a wide variety of herbs and potions have been used to treat any sexual deficiencies. Recent major advances in understanding of erectile physiology and pathophysiology led to development of currently available systemic and local pharmacotherapies. They are designed to work either centrally or peripherally and to either suppress anti-erectile mechanisms, enhance the pro-erectile ones or influence both. Since all the current formulations have variable safety and efficacy profiles, the search for highly specific, simple, convenient and clinically effective impotence treatments or prophylactics continues.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^116bhGKj]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — psychological and psychosexual contributors to ED and counseling note that psychological factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, relationship conflict) and psychosexual issues may be primary or secondary contributors to ED. Thoughtful discussion of these issues with men and their partners is a key component of patient education and can promote acceptance of incorporating a mental health/sexuality expert into the treatment plan. Psychotherapy and psychosocial counseling focus on helping patients and their partners improve communication about sexual concerns, reducing anxiety related to entering and during a sexual situation, and introducing strategies for integrating ED treatments into their sexual relationship. For men with predominantly psychogenic ED, providers should offer a referral to a psychotherapist as either an alternative or adjunct to medical treatment to ED.

### Testosterone replacement in men with sexual dysfunction [^111cn3Tq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men with sexual dysfunction and testosterone deficiency. However, TRT is commonly promoted in men without testosterone deficiency and existing trials often do not clearly report participants' testosterone levels or testosterone-related symptoms. This review assesses the potential benefits and harms of TRT in men presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction.

Objectives

To assess the effects of testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo or other medical treatments in men with sexual dysfunction.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status, up to 29 August 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in men (40 years or over) with sexual dysfunction. We excluded men with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We compared testosterone or testosterone with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDEI5I) to placebo or PDE5I alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the literature, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADE using a minimally contextualized approach. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to standard Cochrane methodology. Predefined primary outcomes were self-reported erectile dysfunction assessed by a validated instrument, sexual quality of life assessed by a validated instrument, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawal due to adverse events, prostate-related events, and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). We distinguished between short-term (up to 12 months) and long-term (> 12 months) outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 43 studies with 11,419 randomized participants across three comparisons: testosterone versus placebo, testosterone versus PDE5I, and testosterone with PDE5I versus PDE5I alone. This abstract focuses on the most relevant comparison of testosterone versus placebo. Testosterone versus placebo (up to 12 months) Based on a predefined sensitivity analysis of studies at low risk of bias, and an analysis combing data from the similar International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and IIEF-5 instruments, TRT likely results in little to no difference in erectile function assessed with the IIEF-EF (mean difference (MD) 2.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 3.08; I² = 0%; 6 RCTs, 2016 participants; moderate CoE) on a scale from 6 to 30 with larger values reflecting better erectile function. We assumed a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of greater than or equal to 4. TRT likely results in little to no change in sexual quality of life assessed with the Aging Males' Symptoms scale (MD -2.31, 95% CI -3.63 to -1.00; I² = 0%; 5 RCTs, 1030 participants; moderate CoE) on a scale from 17 to 85 with larger values reflecting worse sexual quality of life. We assumed a MCID of greater than or equal to 10. TRT also likely results in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.26; I² = 0%; 10 RCTs, 3525 participants; moderate CoE). Based on two cardiovascular deaths in the placebo group and an assumed MCID of 3%, this would correspond to no additional deaths per 1000 men (95% CI 1 fewer to 4 more). TRT also likely results in little to no difference in treatment withdrawal due to adverse events, prostate-related events, or LUTS. Testosterone versus placebo (later than 12 months) We are very uncertain about the longer-term effects of TRT on erectile dysfunction assessed with the IIEF-EF (MD 4.20, 95% CI -2.03 to 10.43; 1 study, 42 participants; very low CoE). We did not find studies reporting on sexual quality of life or cardiovascular mortality. We are very uncertain about the effect of testosterone on treatment withdrawal due to adverse events. We found no studies reporting on prostate-related events or LUTS.

Authors' Conclusions

In the short term, TRT probably has little to no effect on erectile function, sexual quality of life, or cardiovascular mortality compared to a placebo. It likely results in little to no difference in treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, prostate-related events, or LUTS. In the long term, we are very uncertain about the effects of TRT on erectile function when compared to placebo; we did not find data on its effects on sexual quality of life or cardiovascular mortality. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate (signaling that we are confident that the reported effect size is likely to be close to the true effect) to very low (indicating that the true effect is likely to be substantially different). The findings of this review should help to inform future guidelines and clinical decision-making at the point of care.

### Treatment options for erectile dysfunction [^116No1rM]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

A wide variety of medications, devices, and surgical interventions are available to patients who have ED. These range from first-line oral agents to second-line therapy with injections or vacuum devices to third-line options, such as penile prosthesis implantation. In this article, we cover available treatments for erectile dysfunction, ranging from first-line to third-line therapies.

### What are the benefits and harms of testosterone therapy for male sexual dysfunction?-a systematic review [^115X98ap]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The role of Testosterone Therapy (TTh) in the management of male sexual dysfunction remains unclear. Objective of the authors was to systematically review the relevant literature assessing the benefits and harms of TTh in men with sexual dysfunction. EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Systematic Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane HTA, DARE, HEED), Google Scholar, WHO international Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, CINAHL databases and clinicaltrial.gov were searched systematically in March 2015 and an updated search was performed in March 2016. Randomized and non-randomized comparative studies assessing the benefits and harms of TTh in hypogonadal, borderline eugonadal and eugonadal men suffering from sexual dysfunction were included. Risk of bias and confounding assessments were performed. A narrative synthesis was undertaken. Of the 6410 abstracts identified, 36 studies were judged to be eligible for inclusion, including 25 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 non-randomized comparative studies (NRCSs), recruiting a total of 4944 patients. RCTs were judged to have low or unclear risk of bias, while NRCSs had high risk of bias and thus, overall quality of evidence was judged to be at least unclear. Based on the evidence mainly provided by the RCTs included in this systematic review, TTh could be considered for men with low or low-normal testosterone levels and problems with their sexual desire, erectile function and satisfaction derived from intercourse and overall sexual life. The exact testosterone formulation, dosage and duration of treatment remain to be clarified, while the safety profile of TTh also remains unclear. TTh could be used with caution in hypogonadal and most probably borderline eugonadal men to manage disorders of sexual desire, erectile function and sexual satisfaction. The overall low-to-moderate evidence quality highlights the need for robust and adequately designed clinical trials.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^112qUU3o]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — guideline statements for erectile dysfunction (ED) state: Men presenting with symptoms of ED should undergo a thorough medical, sexual and psychosocial history, a physical examination, and selective laboratory testing (Clinical Principle). For the man with ED, validated questionnaires are recommended to assess the severity of ED, to measure treatment effectiveness, and to guide future management (Expert Opinion). Men should be counseled that ED is a risk marker for underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other health conditions that may warrant evaluation and treatment (Clinical Principle). In men with ED, morning serum total testosterone levels should be measured (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For some men with ED, specialized testing and evaluation may be necessary to guide treatment (Expert Opinion). For men being treated for ED, referral to a mental health professional should be considered to promote treatment adherence, reduce performance anxiety, and integrate treatments into a sexual relationship (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^11661Yxh]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Comparing different interventions for the same condition is often difficult. Large direct comparisons are uncommon, and usually represent only a fraction of the total randomised trial data available. Instead we often have large numbers of randomised trials comparing different interventions with the same or similar comparators, like placebo or an active comparator. These may be direct comparisons, but not the direct comparisons we want.

Indirect comparison of interventions using a common comparator is a valuable alternative because it uses more of the published data, and has been done before for analgesics in acute pain and migraine treatments. Even this approach can be devalued because clinical trials in published papers are not consistent in the outcomes they report, or the way they report them.

The ideal should be to compare interventions of equivalent intensities or dose, in the same condition, at similar disease severity, using the same outcomes properly reported, over the same period of time. In this study we use the example of published studies of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors for male erectile dysfunction to examine the problems of comparing therapies. PDE-5 inhibitors were chosen because they have been introduced within the past decade, by three different pharmaceutical companies, and in an era of good clinical trial practice. There are no good quality trials directly comparing PDE-5 inhibitors at equivalent doses.

### Ginseng for erectile dysfunction [^116nUjFK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We used the GRADE approach to present the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome based on the following five GRADE criteria: internal validity (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision and publication bias) and external validity (e.g. the direction of results) (Guyatt 2008).

For each comparison, two review authors (MSL, THK) independently rated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome as 'high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low' using GRADEpro GDT. We resolved any discrepancies by consensus or, if needed, by having a third review author arbitrate. For each comparison, we presented a summary of the evidence for the main outcomes in a 'Summary of findings for the main comparison', which provided key information about the best estimate of the magnitude of the effect in relative terms and absolute differences for each relevant comparison of alternative management strategies; numbers of participants and studies addressing each important outcome; and the rating of the overall confidence in effect estimates for each outcome (Guyatt 2011b; Schünemann 2019a).

### Ginseng for erectile dysfunction [^1143yNM9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dietary supplements with ginseng, or ginseng alone, are widely used for a broad range of conditions, including erectile dysfunction. Ginseng is particularly popular in Asian countries. Individual studies assessing its effects are mostly small, of uneven methodological quality and have unclear results.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ginseng on erectile dysfunction.

Search Methods

We conducted systematic searches on multiple electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and loco-regional databases of east Asia, from their inceptions to 30 January 2021 without restrictions on language and publication status. Handsearches included conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of any type of ginseng as a treatment for erectile dysfunction compared to placebo or conventional treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently classified studies and three authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. We rated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included nine studies with 587 men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction, aged from 20 to 70 years old. The studies all compared ginseng to placebo. We found only short-term follow-up data (up to 12 weeks). Primary outcomes Ginseng appears to have a trivial effect on erectile dysfunction when compared to placebo based on the Erectile Function Domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-15 instrument (scale: 1 to 30, higher scores imply better function; mean difference [MD] 3.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.79 to 5.25; I² = 0%; 3 studies; low certainty evidence) assuming a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4. Ginseng probably also has a trivial effect on erectile function when compared to placebo based on the IIEF-5 instrument (scale: 1 to 25, higher scores imply better function; MD 2.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.88; I² = 0%; 3 studies; moderate certainty evidence) assuming a MCID of 5. Ginseng may have little to no effect on adverse events compared to placebo (risk ratio [RR] 1.45, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.03; I² = 0%; 7 studies; low certainty evidence). Based on 86 adverse events per 1000 men in the placebo group, this would correspond to 39 more adverse events per 1000 (95% CI 27 fewer to 174 more). Secondary outcomes Ginseng may improve men's self-reported ability to have intercourse (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.76 to 3.69; I² = 23%; 6 studies; low certainty evidence). Based on 207 per 1000 men self-reporting the ability to have intercourse in the placebo group, this would correspond to 321 more men (95% CI 158 more to 558 more) per 1000 self-reporting the ability to have intercourse. Ginseng may have a trivial effect on men's satisfaction with intercourse based on the Intercourse Satisfaction Domain of the IIEF-15 (scale: 0 to 15, higher scores imply greater satisfaction; MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.97; I² = 0%; 3 studies; low certainty evidence) based on a MCID of 25% improvement from baseline. It may also have a trivial effect on men's satisfaction with intercourse based on item 5 of the IIEF-5 (scale: 0 to 5, higher scores imply more satisfaction; MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.18; 1 study; low certainty evidence) based on a MCID of 25% improvement from baseline. No study reported quality of life as an outcome. We found no trial evidence to inform comparisons to other treatments for erectile dysfunction, such as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. We were unable to conduct any predefined subgroup analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on mostly low certainty evidence, ginseng may only have trivial effects on erectile function or satisfaction with intercourse compared to placebo when assessed using validated instruments. Ginseng may improve men's self-reported ability to have intercourse. It may have little to no effect on adverse events. We found no trial evidence comparing ginseng to other agents with a more established role in treating erectile dysfunction, such as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.

### New treatments for erectile dysfunction [^111LrZQs]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an increasingly common problem, affecting up to 30 million American men. This largely results from increased risk factors and an aging population. ED is now also recognized as a marker for cardiovascular disease. The ED patient should be thoroughly evaluated for coexisting vascular disease. The pathophysiology of ED is becoming better understood, largely as a result of the development of new therapies. Once the underlying processes are known, more selective targeting of these will lead to novel "designer drugs".

### Strategies for managing sexual dysfunction induced by antidepressant medication [^112UQguv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sexual dysfunction (including altered sexual desire, orgasmic and ejaculatory dysfunction, erectile and other problems) is a relatively common side effect of antidepressant medication. These sexual side effects may compromise a person's lifestyle and result in a lack of compliance with the prescribed antidepressant to the detriment of the person's mental health. A wide range of management strategies are possible to address this problem, including behavioural, psychological and pharmacological approaches.

Objectives

1. To determine the effectiveness of management strategies for sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants.2. To determine the adverse effects and acceptability of the different management strategies.

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 1 January 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Additional searches were carried out by the author team on the same biomedical databases (using terms for 'sexual dysfunction' only) together with CINAHL (1982 to Jan 2012). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared management strategies for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction versus placebo or any alternative strategy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

We included 23 trials involving 1886 people in this updated review. Twenty-two of these trials investigated the addition of medication to treat the identified dysfunction, with most agents studied in only single studies. One study investigated switching to an alternative antidepressant. In men, data for the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil (three studies, 255 participants) and tadalafil (one study, 54 participants) indicated they led to a greater improvement in erectile function than placebo. Combined data from three sildenafil studies found benefit over placebo on International Index of Erectile Function ratings of ability to achieve (MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.44), and maintain erections (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59). A single point improvement on these ratings is equivalent to an improvement in frequency from 'sometimes' to 'most times'. Men receiving tadalafil were more likely to report improved erectile function (RR 11.50, 95% CI 3.03 to 43.67). For women it remains uncertain whether sildenafil is more effective than placebo. Unpublished data could reduce this uncertainty. Data from three studies in men and women of bupropion 150 mg twice daily indicate a benefit over placebo on rating scale scores (SMD 1.60, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.81), but response rates in two studies of bupropion 150 mg once daily demonstrated no statistically significant difference in effect (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.41). Other augmentation strategies failed to demonstrate significant improvements in sexual dysfunction compared with placebo. One trial involving 75 people with sexual dysfunction due to sertraline assessed the effect of changing antidepressant. Switching to nefazodone was significantly less likely to result in the re-emergence of sexual dysfunction than restarting sertraline (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60), however, nefazodone is no longer available for clinical use. There is an absence of randomised trials assessing the effects of switching to currently-available antidepressant agents with lower rates of adverse sexual effects, the role of psychological or mechanical interventions, or of techniques such as drug holidays. We identified no data for any of the strategies included in the trials assessed that indicated that they led to a worsening of psychiatric symptoms. However, the relatively small numbers assessed for many of the interventions studied means that the possibility of such an effect cannot confidently be excluded in all cases. Given the small numbers of studies assessing most of the strategies assessed, the presence of any unpublished trials could have substantial effects on estimates of effect. In some cases, only results from particular items or subscales within ratings scales are available. It is likely that this could act to bias estimates of effect obtained, increasing apparent effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence currently available is rather limited. For men with antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil or tadalafil appears to be an effective strategy. For women with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction the addition of bupropion at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far.

### Ginseng for erectile dysfunction [^115qafg5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Dietary supplements with ginseng, or ginseng alone, are widely used for a broad range of conditions, including erectile dysfunction. Ginseng is particularly popular in Asian countries. Individual studies assessing its effects are mostly small, of uneven methodological quality and have unclear results.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ginseng on erectile dysfunction.

Search methods

We conducted systematic searches on multiple electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and loco‐regional databases of east Asia, from their inceptions to 30 January 2021 without restrictions on language and publication status. Handsearches included conference proceedings.

Selection criteria

We included randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of any type of ginseng as a treatment for erectile dysfunction compared to placebo or conventional treatment.

Data collection and analysis

Two authors independently classified studies and three authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. We rated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included nine studies with 587 men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction, aged from 20 to 70 years old. The studies all compared ginseng to placebo. We found only short‐term follow‐up data (up to 12 weeks).

Primary outcomes

Ginseng appears to have a trivial effect on erectile dysfunction when compared to placebo based on the Erectile Function Domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)‐15 instrument (scale: 1 to 30, higher scores imply better function; mean difference [MD] 3.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.79 to 5.25; I² = 0%; 3 studies; low certainty evidence) assuming a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4.

Ginseng probably also has a trivial effect on erectile function when compared to placebo based on the IIEF‐5 instrument (scale: 1 to 25, higher scores imply better function; MD 2.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.88; I² = 0%; 3 studies; moderate certainty evidence) assuming a MCID of 5.

Ginseng may have little to no effect on adverse events compared to placebo (risk ratio [RR] 1.45, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.03; I² = 0%; 7 studies; low certainty evidence). Based on 86 adverse events per 1000 men in the placebo group, this would correspond to 39 more adverse events per 1000 (95% CI 27 fewer to 174 more).

Secondary outcomes

Ginseng may improve men's self‐reported ability to have intercourse (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.76 to 3.69; I² = 23%; 6 studies; low certainty evidence). Based on 207 per 1000 men self‐reporting the ability to have intercourse in the placebo group, this would correspond to 321 more men (95% CI 158 more to 558 more) per 1000 self‐reporting the ability to have intercourse.

Ginseng may have a trivial effect on men's satisfaction with intercourse based on the Intercourse Satisfaction Domain of the IIEF‐15 (scale: 0 to 15, higher scores imply greater satisfaction; MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.97; I² = 0%; 3 studies; low certainty evidence) based on a MCID of 25% improvement from baseline. It may also have a trivial effect on men's satisfaction with intercourse based on item 5 of the IIEF‐5 (scale: 0 to 5, higher scores imply more satisfaction; MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.18; 1 study; low certainty evidence) based on a MCID of 25% improvement from baseline.

No study reported quality of life as an outcome.

We found no trial evidence to inform comparisons to other treatments for erectile dysfunction, such as phosphodiesterase‐5 inhibitors. We were unable to conduct any predefined subgroup analyses.

Authors' conclusions

Based on mostly low certainty evidence, ginseng may only have trivial effects on erectile function or satisfaction with intercourse compared to placebo when assessed using validated instruments. Ginseng may improve men's self‐reported ability to have intercourse. It may have little to no effect on adverse events. We found no trial evidence comparing ginseng to other agents with a more established role in treating erectile dysfunction, such as phosphodiesterase‐5 inhibitors.

### Microvascular complications in diabetic erectile dysfunction: do we need other alternatives? [^115xwiW9]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The unique mechanism of action and high efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors has generated immense interest among researchers dealing with sexual dysfunction. From the launch of sildenafil, which occurred > 10 years ago, a new focus for basic and clinical research had emerged regarding the safety profile and effect on other organs (vascular, pulmonary, and urinary system) of PDE5 inhibitors because of their potential to treat other chronic diseases. Moreover, use of PDE5 inhibitors, which have been established as an efficacious and safe class of drugs when prescribed to most men with ED, restored sexual function to normal. One of the major breakthroughs recently achieved is probably the accumulating evidence that chronically administered PDE5 inhibitors can improve endothelial and sexual function. Daily treatment with PDE5 inhibitors is now the preferred method of treatment in several groups of men with ED due to radical prostatectomy and with severe endothelial and vascular dysfunction such as diabetes. This treatment regimen has also been shown to benefit younger men, in whom this new treatment approach is able to restore their sexual habits to normal, thereby removing the stigma of having a disease. Nevertheless, lack of knowledge regarding detailed mechanisms, safety and tolerability concerns, and costs may prevent a broad application of this regimen.

### Erectile dysfunction [^113pfy8J]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction is a multidimensional but common male sexual dysfunction that involves an alteration in any of the components of the erectile response, including organic, relational and psychological. Roles for nonendocrine (neurogenic, vasculogenic and iatrogenic) and endocrine pathways have been proposed. Owing to its strong association with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, cardiac assessment may be warranted in men with symptoms of erectile dysfunction. Minimally invasive interventions to relieve the symptoms of erectile dysfunction include lifestyle modifications, oral drugs, injected vasodilator agents and vacuum erection devices. Surgical therapies are reserved for the subset of patients who have contraindications to these nonsurgical interventions, those who experience adverse effects from (or are refractory to) medical therapy and those who also have penile fibrosis or penile vascular insufficiency. Erectile dysfunction can have deleterious effects on a man's quality of life; most patients have symptoms of depression and anxiety related to sexual performance. These symptoms, in turn, affect his partner's sexual experience and the couple's quality of life. This Primer highlights numerous aspects of erectile dysfunction, summarizes new treatment targets and ongoing preclinical studies that evaluate new pharmacotherapies, and covers the topic of regenerative medicine, which represents the future of sexual medicine.

### Sexual dysfunction in the elderly: age or disease? [^111tMDVB]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

Sexuality is an important component of emotional and physical intimacy that men and women experience through their lives. Male erectile dysfunction (ED) and female sexual dysfunction increase with age. About a third of the elderly population has at least one complaint with their sexual function. However, about 60% of the elderly population expresses their interest for maintaining sexual activity. Although aging and functional decline may affect sexual function, when sexual dysfunction is diagnosed, physicians should rule out disease or side effects of medications. Common disorders related to sexual dysfunction include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lower urinary tract symptoms and depression. Early control of cardiovascular risk factors may improve endothelial function and reduce the occurrence of ED. Treating those disorders or modifying lifestyle-related risk factors (eg obesity) may help prevent sexual dysfunction in the elderly. Sexuality is important for older adults, but interest in discussing aspects of sexual life is variable. Physicians should give their patient's opportunity to voice their concerns with sexual function and offer them alternatives for evaluation and treatment.

### Diabetes-induced erectile dysfunction: epidemiology, pathophysiology and management [^115kE19W]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2010). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability of the male to attain and maintain erection of penis sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse. Prevalence of impotence in diabetic men is ≥ 50%. The pathophysiology of diabetes-induced erectile dysfunction (DIED) is multifactorial and no single etiology is at the forefront. The proposed mechanisms of erectile dysfunction in diabetic patients includes elevated advanced glycation end-products, increased levels of oxygen free radicals, impaired nitric oxide synthesis, increased endothelin B receptor binding sites and up-regulated RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway, neuropathic damage and impaired cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase-1. The treatment of DIED is multimodal. Treatment of the underlying hyperglycemia and comorbidities is of utmost importance to prevent or halt the progression of disease. Oral medications are considered as the first line therapy for management of DIED. If oral agents cannot be used or have insufficient efficacy despite appropriate dosing and education, second-line treatments should be addressed. When there is lack of efficacy or when there is dissatisfaction with other modalities, penile prostheses are often the best alternative for ED and are considered as the third line therapy for DIED. Future strategies in the evolution of the treatment of DIED are aimed at correcting or treating the underlying mechanisms of DIED.

### Treatments for erectile dysfunction in spinal cord patients: alternatives to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors? A review study [^114F3nKP]. Spinal Cord (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review study.

Objectives

Alternative treatments to oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) in individuals with spinal cord lesions (SCLs) and erectile dysfunction (ED).

Setting

Italy.

Methods

Research clinical trials (1999–2014).

Results

Twelve studies were selected. One article documented that 76% of subjects reached satisfactory sexual intercourse (SI) using intracavernosal injection of vasoactive medications (papaverine and prostaglandin E1). One study regarding perineal training showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in penile tumescence in 10 individuals with preserved sacral segment. Two studies reported contrasting results on erectile function (EF) using various dosages of oral fampridine (25-40mg). Furthermore, 95.1% of patients on fampridine 25mg experienced drawbacks. Disappointing findings were found with intraurethral alprostadil (125–1000μg) and sublingual apomorphine 3mg. Two studies concerning penile prosthesis reported valid SI more than 75% of the time with a mean follow-up of 11 years, although around 15% of individuals showed side effects. As for surgical treatments, 88% of males submitted to Brindley sacral anterior root stimulator after sacral dorsal rhizotomy achieved valid erection up to 8 years following the procedure. Three studies documented the impact of definitive sacral neuromodulation implant (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) also on EF. After surgery, 20–37.5% of patients with ED recovered normal EF.

Conclusions

Data are scant on the efficacy of ED treatments for SCL subjects who did not respond to PDE5Is. Further research should investigate the effects of any SCL treatments even when they are not strictly used for neurogenic sexual dysfunction.

### Is there a common pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction and how does this relate to new pharmacotherapies? [^114UGRQc]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

Many basic and clinical studies show erectile dysfunction (ED) to be caused by a wide variety of factors. Although these factors can be divided into psychological and organic origins and these too can further be subdivided, many patients will show complex patterns of causes for ED ('mixed ED'). Many of these factors will have a direct or indirect impact on the efficacy of centrally and peripherally acting drugs, thus necessitating a variety of drugs with different modes of action and different modes of application to ensure appropriate therapy for many patients. However, some factors will render all imaginable forms of pharmacological options totally inefficient, thus necessitating forms of treatment other than pharmacotherapy.

The panel underscores that shared decision-making "is the cornerstone of the treatment and management of ED" and that "it is also a process in which the patient and the clinician together determine the best course of therapy based on a discussion of the risks, benefits and desired outcome".

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^1116r1kQ]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Male sexual dysfunction in infertility — conclusion statements include that psychological distress from infertility contributes to male sexual dysfunction. Studies show that significant, but treatable, medical co-morbidities may be identified during evaluation. Aspermia caused by retrograde ejaculation may be treated medically, or sperm can be collected from postejaculatory urine samples, and aspermia caused by failure of emission can be circumvented by a testicular sperm extraction attempt. Exogenous testosterone has the potential to suppress spermatogenesis and higher doses of testosterone are more likely to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis. Alternative therapies for testosterone optimization in men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency who are attempting to conceive include selective estrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors, and human chorionic gonadotropin. Erectile dysfunction is a common, correctable problem that may occur in infertile men, and evaluation and treatment of male sexual dysfunction serve as an opportunity to improve a man's somatic health. For men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency who are attempting to conceive, exogenous testosterone use should be avoided.

### Physical activity as an adjunct treatment for erectile dysfunction [^113oXLgb]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2019). High credibility.

Increasing data are available to suggest that physical activity and lifestyle modification in general can benefit erectile function, with effect sizes comparable with established treatment options such as testosterone therapy and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Despite this evidence, primary-care physicians are rarely afforded critical information on the underlying mechanisms through which physical activity works as a treatment, severely hampering treatment credibility for both physician and patient. Physical activity is associated with psychological and metabolic adaptations that are compatible with the adaptations required for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). These adaptations include increased expression and activity of nitric oxide synthase, strengthened endothelial function, acute rises in testosterone, decreased stress and anxiety, and improved body image. Use of physical activity as a first-line treatment option for ED is limited, and explicit physical activity guidelines for the treatment of ED are required. Such guidelines should include not only a suggested exercise programme but also guidelines for physician-patient communication that might enhance patient receptivity and therapy continuation. An understanding of how physical activity affects erectile function, as well as its effectiveness in treating ED compared with other established treatments, can benefit urologists and primary-care physicians searching for noninvasive treatment options for men presenting with poor erectile function.

Trials have not demonstrated that early PDE5i use (i.e., within 45 days of prostate cancer therapy) improves unassisted EF, and ED remains common after pelvic radiation, with approximately 36% of patients reporting new-onset ED at 2 years post-treatment; clinicians should educate men regarding the sexual effects of prostate cancer treatments and set realistic expectations regarding functional recovery.

### Research links E-cigarette use to erectile dysfunction… [^116C5Vg6]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

A new paper scheduled for publication in the Jan. 1, 2022, issue of the strongly suggests that e-cigarette use is associated with another negative health effect. The study, first published online Nov. 30, found clear links between frequent e-cigarette use and erectile dysfunction in adults, with the risk of ED occurring independent of other risk factors such as age or cardiovascular disease. American Journal of Preventive Medicine. "Given that many people use e-cigarettes as a form of smoking harm reduction or to help them quit smoking, we need to fully investigate the relationship between vaping products and erectile dysfunction and thus better understand the potential implications for men's sexual health, " said Omar El Shahawy, M. D. M. P. H. Ph. D., an assistant professor in the Department of Population Health Section on Tobacco, Alcohol and Drug Use at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, and the study's corresponding author, in a.

Compared with those who never used e-cigarettes, current daily e-cigarette users were significantly more likely to report having ED. In the full sample, participants who used e-cigarettes daily were 2. 24 times more likely to report ED; in the restricted sample, they were
2. 41 times more likely. In addition, the analysis found a strong association between physical activity levels and ED. Compared with those who reported no physical activity, people who were physically active at any weekly frequency level were between 42% and 56% less likely to report having ED. The analysis also showed that the more often a person engaged in physical activity, the lower that person's odds of reporting ED. "The study findings indicate that electronic nicotine delivery system use may be associated with ED independent of age, risk factor profile and the presence of CVD, " the study authors concluded.

"While ENDS use is still being evaluated for its harm reduction and smoking-cessation potential, ENDS users need to be informed about the possible harms associated with ENDS use and particularly ENDS current daily use, including ED". Fisher said that he does not recommend e-cigarettes as a way of reducing tobacco use, but suggests different approaches. "I talk with patients about medication options for cessation and the use of quit lines and tobacco counselors. If a patient came to me and was using e-cigarettes as a stepdown approach for stopping tobacco use, I would want to counsel my male patients about the associations with ED, " Fisher said.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114cmtLu]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We sought randomised trials of three PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil), with placebo or active comparator, in men with erectile dysfunction of any causation. Previous systematic reviews were used to source trials or trial data, supplemented by electronic searches of PubMed (to June 2005) and the Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2005) using drug names and randomis(z)ed trial.

For inclusion a trial had to be randomised and double blind, use one of the three oral PDE-5 inhibitors in men with erectile dysfunction, be conducted in the home setting, last three weeks or longer, have a minimum of 10 men per group, and report useful information on efficacy or adverse events. Abstracts were read, and potentially useful reports retrieved in full paper copy. Decisions on inclusion or exclusion were made by consensus. No information was taken from posters or abstracts, and studies were read carefully to avoid including duplicate material. Studies were scored for reporting quality using a common method utilising reporting of randomisation, blinding and withdrawals. The maximum score possible was 5 points, and no study could be included with fewer than 2 points.

Information extracted from studies included the number of men studied, the cause of erectile dysfunction, and country where the study was performed. Any type of outcome was initially extracted from the studies, in continuous or dichotomous form, and with any dispersion information available. Outcomes could be reported in tables, in graphs, or in text. The following outcomes were sought particularly:

Efficacy

- Improved erections ("Has the treatment you have been taking over the past four weeks improved your erections?")

- Erections per week

- Successful attempts at sexual intercourse

- More than 60% or 75% successful

- More than 40% successful

- Final score or change from baseline on question 3 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) ("Over the past four weeks, when you attempted sexual intercourse, how often were you able to penetrate your partner?")

- Final score or change from baseline on question 4 of the IIEF ("Over the past four weeks, during sexual intercourse, how often were you able to maintain your erection after you had penetrated your partner?")

- Final score or change from baseline on the IIEF erectile function domain score

- Normal erectile function at end of study (IIEF total score of 22 or more out of 30)

Withdrawal

- All cause

- Lack of efficacy

- Adverse event

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^115TzjwF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Male hypogonadism is a biochemical and clinical testosterone deficiency syndrome with a prevalence of symptomatic hypogonadism ranging between 2.1% and 5.7% in males aged above 30 years of age.,

Prevalence increases with age and certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity and malignancies. Decreased libido, lack of energy, mood changes, decreased muscle mass, and erectile dysfunction are common hypogonadal symptoms. Testosterone therapy (TTh) is the treatment of first choice for male hypogonadism. However, exogenous testosterone leads to negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis, causing suppression of endogenous testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Other side effects are, changed lipid serum, polycythaemia and gynecomastia.

Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off‐label pharmacological treatment for a certain group of males with hypogonadism. CC is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, occupying oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to increased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and so, stimulating testicular endogenous testosterone production and preserving spermatogenesis.

Since the 1960s, CC has been often used for ovulation induction in females. For males, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not approve the medicine with reason of unclear clinical effect because of the lack of well‐controlled and well‐powered controlled trials. However, CC is described over more than 30 years off‐label to hypogonadal men, especially those with an active or future child wish, or hypogonadal males who do not want to use TTh. Compared to TTh, CC is easy in usage and comes with little costs. For example, in our country, costs of CC are about 12 times lower than regular TTh.

To support the outcomes in the scarce literature on the efficacy of CC therapy, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC therapy for male hypogonadism.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^115Sb5cV]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction — Men with ED should be informed regarding the treatment option of an FDA-approved oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), including discussion of benefits and risks/burdens, unless contraindicated. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). When men are prescribed an oral PDE5i for the treatment of ED, instructions should be provided to maximize benefit/efficacy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For men who are prescribed PDE5i, the dose should be titrated to provide optimal efficacy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The FDA-approved oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) available for management of ED in the U.S. include sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil. PDE5i medications have been extensively studied, with nearly a quarter of a million men evaluated from the general ED population and approximately 25,000 men evaluated from various special populations; analyses and systematic reviews suggest that sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil have similar efficacy in the general ED population, dose-response effects across PDE5i are small and non-linear, and on-demand dosing versus daily dosing for tadalafil appears to produce the same level of efficacy; the data suggest that men with diabetes and men who are post-prostatectomy respond less robustly to PDE5i. The most frequently reported adverse events in men using PDE5i are dyspepsia, headache, flushing, back pain, nasal congestion, myalgia, visual disturbance, and dizziness; average rates are similar across medications with the exception of dyspepsia (lowest with avanafil), flushing (lowest with tadalafil), and myalgia (lowest with vardenafil and avanafil), and most AEs followed a dose-response pattern such that men who were randomized to active treatment reported statistically significantly higher rates of AEs than did men who were randomized to placebo.

Regarding specific circumstances for erectile dysfunction, more specifically with respect to patients with Parkinson's disease, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to offer the following in patients with Parkinson's disease and ED:

- discontinue drugs associated with ED such as α-blockers, or anorgasmia such as SSRIs; recognize that dopaminergic therapy can have both negative and positive effects on this symptom

- consider offering sildenafil 50–100 mg 1 hour before sex in patients with Parkinson's disease with ED

- consider offering other drugs, such as tadalafil 10 mg 30 min-12 hours before sex, or vardenafil 10 mg 1 hour before sex as alternative choices

- consider administering apomorphine injections 5–10 min before sex as an alternative option in some patients

- consider administering intracavernous injections of papaverine or alprostadil in selected patients.

### Opinions, attitudes, and perceptions in relation to erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation in the undiagnosed Spanish male population. results of the PANDORA project [^114SyCn7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 43% of Spanish men report experiencing premature ejaculation (PE) at some point in their lives and 12.1% suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED), of whom only 16.5% have seen a doctor. Despite this, ED and PE remain undiagnosed among a supposedly healthy segment of the population.

Aim

To assess the general knowledge of a representative population of healthy Spanish males of the symptoms, treatment, and expectations related to ED and PE.

Methods

This was a descriptive study based on an online questionnaire in which 2,515 males aged 25–75 years with no history of ED and/or PE presented their perception of aspects related to symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and expectations in ED and PE.

Main Outcome Measures

The study provided an evaluation of the knowledge, attitude, and underdiagnosis of ED and/or PE in healthy males and the approach taken by urology specialists and other disciplines.

Results

The survey was completed by 2,515 healthy males, including over 80% of those who had completed secondary or higher education. 60% of the sample had never seen a urologist and 59% and 62% of the participating men responded correctly to the statements about PE and ED, respectively. Their lack of knowledge of the therapeutic alternatives was clear (74% and 76% of the panel were unaware of the existence of effective treatments for ED and PE, respectively). Despite the initiative shown by some participants in seeking information about each condition (10.3% for ED; 16.7% for PE), only 4.7% of them had been questioned about ED by a medical practitioner (1.9% for PE). The underdiagnosis rate stood at 3.5% for ED (5.6% participants > 65 years) and at about 10% for PE.

Clinical Implications

These results will represent a point of departure for establishing some recommendations to improve the detection and treatment of these disorders.

Strengths & Limitations

This is the first study of its kind in Spain to analyze the underdiagnosis of ED and/or PE inferred from data reported by a population of healthy males. Screening for ED was performed with a validated questionnaire. However, the rest of the research was conducted using adaptations of validated questionnaires or a self-designed questionnaire based on and in consultation with a group of experienced andrologists.

Conclusion

People need to have greater knowledge of both the conditions and the related false myths to make sure that they are familiar with the existence of drug treatments and socio-sanitary interventions. Primary care physicians and urologists should also be more proactive in routine visits in order to achieve better management of ED and PE.

### Restorative therapies for erectile dysfunction: position statement from the Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) [^115qGb6F]. Sexual Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) — epidemiology and rationale for restorative therapies — Recent estimates suggest the overall prevalence of ED in North America to be between 22 and 58%, and ED is strongly associated with older age and comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Initial treatments include couples therapy, phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, intra-urethral suppositories, and intracavernosal injections, yet some men cannot tolerate medications, have contraindications, or are hard-to-treat. Restorative therapies are based on repairing or replacing diseased tissue by stimulating endogenous repair and regeneration, encompassing stem cell therapy (SCT), platelet rich plasma (PRP), and low-intensity shock wave therapy (LiSWT) which stimulate endogenous stem cell mobilization; however, randomized controlled trials with appropriately powered placebo arms are severely lacking, limiting widespread acceptance.

### History of penile implants: from implants made of bone to modern inflatable penile implants [^11146vJj]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Penile prostheses are implantable devices used to definitively treat erectile dysfunction when previous forms of treatment have failed. The first example of a penile implant dates to 1935, when a rib was inserted in a neo-phallus reconstructed after a traumatic amputation. Since then, alternative artificial devices were adopted as penile prosthetic implants. The evolution of prosthetic devices had a dramatic thrust in 1973 when the first inflatable penile prosthesis was worldwide presented. Thanks to advances in device materials, design, surgical implant techniques, and perioperative management, nowadays inflatable penile prostheses are one of the most adopted definitive therapy for patients with drug-refractory erectile dysfunction or refusing alternative forms of treatments. Moreover, the clinical indications for inflatable penile prosthesis have also expanded, including female-to-male transmen or men underwent penile reconstruction due to congenital aphallia or traumatic or surgical penile amputation. In order to summarise the process behind the development and evolution of penile prosthesis, we aimed at performing a historical review of the currently available literature to provide an easy and comprehensive overview of the topic. The understanding of the historical process behind the evolution of inflatable penile prostheses will drive further innovation to increase efficiency and the rate of patients satisfaction.

### A clinical guide to rare male sexual disorders [^111whcuy]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Conditions referred to as 'male sexual dysfunctions' usually include erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders and male hypogonadism. However, some less common male sexual disorders exist, which are under-recognized and under-treated, leading to considerable morbidity, with adverse effects on individuals' sexual health and relationships. Such conditions include post-finasteride syndrome, restless genital syndrome, post-orgasmic illness syndrome, post-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sexual dysfunction, hard-flaccid syndrome, sleep-related painful erections and post-retinoid sexual dysfunction. Information about these disorders usually originates from case-control trials or small case series; thus, the published literature is scarce. As the aetiology of these diseases has not been fully elucidated, the optimal investigational work-up and therapy are not well defined, and the available options cannot, therefore, adequately address patients' sexual problems and implement appropriate treatment. Thus, larger-scale studies - including prospective trials and comprehensive case registries - are crucial to better understand the aetiology, prevalence and clinical characteristics of these conditions. Furthermore, collaborative efforts among researchers, health-care professionals and patient advocacy groups will be essential in order to develop evidence-based guidelines and novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively address these disorders. By advancing our understanding and refining treatment strategies, we can strive towards improving the quality of life and fostering healthier sexual relationships for individuals suffering from these rare sexual disorders.

### Guidelines on male sexual dysfunction: erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation [^117AsAUV]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) are the two most prevalent male sexual dysfunctions.

Objective

To present the updated version of 2009 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on ED and PE.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic review of the recent literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ED and PE was performed. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were assigned.

Evidence Synthesis

ED is highly prevalent, and 5–20% of men have moderate to severe ED. ED shares common risk factors with cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis is based on medical and sexual history, including validated questionnaires. Physical examination and laboratory testing must be tailored to the patient's complaints and risk factors. Treatment is based on phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is), including sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. PDE5-Is have high efficacy and safety rates, even in difficult-to-treat populations such as patients with diabetes mellitus. Treatment options for patients who do not respond to PDE5-Is or for whom PDE5-Is are contraindicated include intracavernous injections, intraurethral alprostadil, vacuum constriction devices, or implantation of a penile prosthesis. PE has prevalence rates of 20–30%. PE may be classified as lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary). Diagnosis is based on medical and sexual history assessing intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, perceived control, distress, and interpersonal difficulty related to the ejaculatory dysfunction. Physical examination and laboratory testing may be needed in selected patients only. Pharmacotherapy is the basis of treatment in lifelong PE, including daily dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and topical anaesthetics. Dapoxetine is the only drug approved for the on-demand treatment of PE in Europe. Behavioural techniques may be efficacious as a monotherapy or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Recurrence is likely to occur after treatment withdrawal.

Conclusions

These EAU guidelines summarise the present information on ED and PE. The extended version of the guidelines is available at the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/nc/professional-resources/guidelines/online/).

### Restorative therapies for erectile dysfunction: position statement from the Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) [^117Ufixx]. Sexual Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Restorative therapies for erectile dysfunction (ED) — the Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) cites a "current lack of regulatory agency approval for any restorative (regenerative) therapies for the treatment of ED" and states that "the use of shock waves or stem cells/SVF are investigational and unproven"; it also specifies that "platelet rich plasma is experimental and should only be conducted under research protocols in compliance with Institutional Review Board approval at little or no cost to the patient". The SMSNA "does not feel that it is appropriate or ethical for providers to advertise or otherwise make implicit or explicit claims of efficacy for these therapies pending further data", advises that "patients considering such therapies should be fully informed as to the lack of data", and concludes that "at the current time, the SMSNA does not advocate for restorative therapies to be offered or used in routine clinical practice".

Erectile dysfunction (ED), defined as the inability to develop or maintain an erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse, is a common urologic condition that increases in prevalence with age but can affect men of any age. As the discovery of the role of the nitric oxide pathway in inducing and maintaining erections, there have been numerous pharmacologic advancements for the treatment of ED. Here, we will review the mainstays of the pharmacologic treatment of ED: OTC/herbal supplements, phosphodiesterase type V inhibitors (PDE5I), intraurethral suppositories (MUSE), and intracorporal injections (ICI).

### Restorative therapies for erectile dysfunction: position statement from the Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) [^111cjCzy]. Sexual Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Restorative therapies for erectile dysfunction (ED) — Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) position statement aims to examine existing clinical trial data for restorative therapies and identify elements that require further research before widespread adoption, based on a literature review to identify all clinical trials performed with regenerative therapy for ED including treatments such as stem cell therapy (SCT), platelet rich plasma (PRP), and low-intensity shockwave therapy (LiSWT). Most clinical trials in restorative therapies were assessed for safety, feasibility, or efficacy, including recording adverse events, changes in sexual function and erectile function questionnaires, and diagnostics measures. To date there is an absence of robust clinical data supporting the efficacy of restorative therapies regarding ED, though technologies such as LiSWT have established relative safety. Restorative therapies are described as a promising therapy that represents a new frontier of treatment focused toward reversing disease pathology rather than just treating symptoms, but current published clinical studies are limited and future work needs to be adequately powered, multi-center, randomized, sham/placebo-controlled trials in well-characterized patient populations to ensure safety and demonstrate efficacy. Until these studies are done, restorative therapies should be reserved for clinical trials and not offered in routine clinical practice.

### Investigating women's preference for sildenafil or tadalafil use by their partners with erectile dysfunction: the partners' preference study [^115Bdpk3]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several preference studies comparing a short-acting with a longer-acting phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor have been conducted in men. Most men in those studies preferred tadalafil rather than sildenafil, and recent post hoc analysis of one study described several factors associated with men's treatment preference. No prospective studies have investigated the woman partners' preferences.

Aim

To investigate the treatment preference of women who were partners of men using oral medications for erectile dysfunction (ED) in a single-center open-label crossover study.

Methods

One hundred heterosexual couples in stable relationships, with male partners having ED based on the erectile function subscale of the International Index of Erectile Function, were randomly assigned to receive sildenafil or tadalafil for a 12-week phase, followed by another 12-week period using the alternate drug. Male and female participants completed sexual event diaries during both study phases, and the female participants were interviewed at baseline, midpoint, and end of study.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome data were the women's final interviews during which they were asked which drug they preferred and their reasons for that preference.

Results

A total of 79.2% of the women preferred their partners' use of tadalafil, while 15.6% preferred sildenafil. Preference was not affected by age or treatment order randomization. Women preferring tadalafil reported feeling more relaxed, experiencing less pressure, and enjoying a more natural or spontaneous sexual experience as reasons for their choice. Mean number of tablets used, events recorded, events per week, and days between events were not significantly different during each study phase.

Conclusion

Women's preferences were similar to men when using these two drugs. While the women's reasons for preferring tadalafil emphasized relaxed, satisfying, longer-lasting sexual experiences, those preferring sildenafil focused on satisfaction and drug effectiveness for their partner.

### Antidepressant-related erectile dysfunction: management via avoidance, switching antidepressants, antidotes, and adaptation [^112yWSoY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The ideal antidepressant would control depression with no adverse effect on sexual function. Erectile dysfunction and other sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant medication treatment are problems with many antidepressants and can lead to patient dissatisfaction and decreased compliance with treatment. A computerized MEDLINE search (English language, 1966–2003) was performed using the terms antidepressive agents, erectile dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. Emphasis was placed on studies with specific sexual function measurements taken before and after treatment and placebo control. Mixed mediator, nonserotonergic antidepressants that block postsynaptic serotonin type 2 receptors (nefazodone, mirtazapine) or that primarily increase dopamine or norepinephrine levels (bupropion) were thought to be good choices for avoiding antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction or for switching patients in whom antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction emerged. Comparisons with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) have revealed less desire and orgasm dysfunction with nonserotonergic bupropion, less orgasm dysfunction with nefazodone, and superior overall satisfaction with sexual functioning with bupropion or nefazodone. However, most of these studies have design flaws that make evidence-based claims of efficacy difficult to substantiate. Agents proposed for antidote use in antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction have either not been studied in men or not proved efficacious in randomized placebo-controlled trials. Switching to and augmentation with bupropion or nefazodone have also not clearly shown efficacy in controlled trials and require care and monitoring to avoid SRI discontinuation symptoms and loss of antidepressant efficacy. Few proposed treatment options, apart from avoidance, have proved effective for antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction, which can have negative consequences on depression management.

### Lack of awareness of erectile dysfunction in many men with risk factors for erectile dysfunction [^113dbeM9]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

All men who were screened had comorbidities associated with erectile dysfunction. Pharmaceutical treatments for many of these erectile dysfunction-associated disorders are associated with sexual side effects, including erectile dysfunction. For example, fibrate derivatives used to treat hypercholesterolemia and diuretics and β-blockers for treatment of hypertension have been associated with erectile dysfunction. Drugs for LUTS and depression can also impact sexual health. Men who first experience erectile dysfunction after beginning medication to treat a comorbidity may not consider that they have erectile dysfunction, but may feel that their erectile dysfunction is an adverse effect of their treatment.

### Prevention and treatment of erectile dysfunction using lifestyle changes and dietary supplements: what works and what is worthless, part I [^112MrrgB]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Clinicians working in urology should adhere to the same guidelines that are observed in cardiovascular medicine when dealing with a patient with ED. A golden opportunity exists to discuss lifestyle changes with any man with or concerned about ED. Providing heart-healthy recommendations to men with minimal to extensive ED may produce a twofold impact: (1) patients may be able to affect the future extent of their disease, and (2) patients may become healthier overall. Patients following a heart-healthy lifestyle after a diagnosis of ED or to prevent ED should enjoy increased quality or quantity of life. The time is more than ripe for patients to understand that heart health is tantamount to erectile health.

### Restorative therapies for erectile dysfunction: position statement from the Sexual Medicine Society of North America (SMSNA) [^1136Th77]. Sexual Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Aspects for future studies — restorative therapies for ED: priorities include "standardizing measurable validated outcome instruments which would quantify therapy efficacy as well as allow for comparison between studies", ensuring LiSWT studies "address efficacy across different devices, dosing regimens, and the duration of treatment", and conducting SCT/SVF trials that are "larger, double blind, RCT powered for both safety and efficacy". The text states that "PRP simply does not have enough clinical evidence to support any current application" and calls for "additional well-designed clinical trials with PRP". Operational needs include addressing "costs and patient recruitment", using "double blinding" to "minimize provider bias", recognizing "small patient cohorts in current published literature", and improving accrual by "opening up study design (ie, cross over with appropriate delayed interval) and multi-institutional collaborations", concluding that "appropriately powered studies by increased patient volume and eliminating bias through study design are critical to advancing this technology".

### Treatment of infertility in men with spinal cord injury [^113kY3kf]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Most men with spinal cord injury (SCI) are infertile. Erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction and semen abnormalities contribute to the problem. Treatments for erectile dysfunction include phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, intracavernous injections of alprostadil, penile prostheses, and vacuum constriction devices. In anejaculatory patients who wish to father children, semen retrieval is necessary. Penile vibratory stimulation is recommended as the first line of treatment. Patients who fail penile vibratory stimulation can be referred for electroejaculation. If this approach is not possible, prostate massage is an alternative. Surgical sperm retrieval should be considered as a last resort when other methods fail. Most men with SCI have a unique semen profile characterized by normal sperm count but abnormally low sperm motility. Scientific investigations indicate that accessory gland dysfunction and abnormal semen constituents contribute to the problem. Despite abnormalities, sperm from men with SCI can successfully induce pregnancy. In selected couples, the simple method of intravaginal insemination is a viable option. Another option is intrauterine insemination. The efficacy of intrauterine insemination increases as the total motile sperm count inseminated increases. In vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection are options in cases of extremely low total motile sperm count. Reproductive outcomes for SCI male factor infertility are similar to outcomes for general male factor infertility.

Regulatory approval — restorative therapies for ED: "there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approval for any restorative therapies for the treatment of ED", and "any use of these 'restorative' therapies is considered off-label and does not fit the current traditional regulatory pathways". While some components "have been approved, such as the LiSWT devices themselves (albeit for treatment of alternative disease states), or clinical separators/centrifuges used in the preparation of PRP", PRP "falls under HCT/P361 exemption" allowing autologous reinjection of "minimally manipulated" tissue, and for SCT/SVF "many isolates involve heterogeneous cell sources and formulations", so "each component would need to be evaluated individually as a drug or device before approval could be granted".

### Male sexual and reproductive health in multiple sclerosis: a scoping review [^114gR48R]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our scoping review based on male sexual and reproductive health in MS included 34 original studies published over the last 2 decades (2002–2023). Most studies broadly focused on sexual dysfunction, followed by specific focus on erectile dysfunction, fertility, and family planning, respectively. Despite the growing availability of DMT options in recent years, including newer high-efficacy treatments, comorbidity management which includes sexual and reproductive health, remains one of the cornerstones to improve quality of life and minimize direct or indirect disability due to MS.

### IL-17A exacerbates corpus cavernosum fibrosis and neurogenic erectile dysfunction by inducing CSMC senescence via the mTORC2-ACACA pathway [^113FYvCv]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Impotence, also referred to as erectile dysfunction (ED), is a condition characterized by the inability to attain or sustain a penile erection for satisfactory sexual intercourse. The leading causes of ED are vascular risk factors, neurological abnormalities, and hormonal disorders. Neurotraumatic ED is more common in clinical practice and occurs in 50–90% of male patients who undergo pelvic floor organ surgery due to unavoidable damage to the pelvic autonomic nerve branch, the cavernous nerve (CN). An erectile response may still occur in patients with neurogenic ED, but this takes months or even years, and functional rehabilitation characterized by the completion of sexual intercourse and ejaculation is nearly impossible to achieve.

In surgeries involving pelvic organs, neurogenic ED caused by colorectal and prostate cancers is the most common. Currently, with the improvement of multimodal cancer treatments worldwide, overall survival rates and disease-free survival rates have significantly increased. Studies show that the 5-year relative survival rate for colorectal cancer patients is 65%, and when detected at a localized stage (accounting for 39% of cases), the 5-year relative survival rate reaches 90%. Therefore, in addition to the treatment of the disease itself, ensuring quality of life has become a more sought-after goal for patients. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network has recently included sexual function in its clinical practice survival guidelines, highlighting the importance of sexual function among an increasing number of cancer survivors.

Currently, the protection of erectile function after pelvic organ surgery primarily involves improving surgical techniques. Our previous studies have shown that preserving the Denonvilliers fascia in male patients with rectal cancer at specific stages and locations has a protective effect on postoperative urogenital function, but it still cannot completely prevent the occurrence of postoperative ED. Additionally, drugs such as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are commonly used as first-line treatments for erectile dysfunction, but they are less effective for patients with neurogenic ED. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are being explored, such as penile prosthesis implantation, or the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells as options. However, the invasiveness, uncertain efficacy, and unclear mechanisms of these methods limit their broader application in clinical practice. Thus, it is urgent to clarify the exact mechanisms of neurogenic ED and to identify new treatment options.

### Patients' and urologists' preferences for prostate cancer treatment: a discrete choice experiment [^115GWu3U]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

The DCE was analysed by taking each choice among two PC treatment alternatives as an observation. Using the Nlogit software, the observations were analysed by panel-mixed logit models in error component form to take into account the possibility of correlation between unobserved utilities of treatment modalities (AS, surgery, and radiotherapy), as well as the possibility of panel effects (i.e. correlation between different choices made by the same individual). More specifically, we allowed the constant for 'treatment modality' to be randomly (normally) distributed across individuals; the s.d. of the normal distribution was estimated together with the other parameters.

We selected the utility function with the best fit based on the Akaike information criterion after testing a number of different specifications for the utility (stated preference) function; for example, categorical or numerical attribute main effects, two-way interactions between attributes, several attribute transformations, and interaction between treatment modality and patients' characteristics (e.g. age, educational level, household, and having anxious/depressed feelings). As a result, the final specification of the utility function used was:

where

V represents the observable utility (stated preference score) that a respondent has for a PC treatment scenario;

β 0, β 4 represent alternative specific constants for a treatment modality (AS acts as the reference level);

β 1,2, β 5,6 represent alternative specific parameter weights (or coefficients) linearly associated with the attributes 'risk of urinary incontinence' and 'risk of erectile dysfunction'

β 3, β 7 represent interaction effects between patients' characteristic 'anxious/depressed feelings' and the treatment modality.

It is noteworthy that the attributes 'risk of other permanent side effects due to treatment', 'frequency of PSA testing', and 'treatment aim', all had one fixed level for each treatment modality (Table 1). Therefore, the weights associated with these attributes are captured in the alternative specific constants (i.e. β 0 or β 4).

### Strategies for managing antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction: a review [^113pkPKz]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of most antidepressants. Lower rates are reported with some newer agents such as reboxetine and bupropion. The evidence base for its management is limited but growing, with most approaches only tested in a small number of trials. Available strategies include watchful waiting, the use of short drug holidays, and a change of antidepressant. Many specific antidotes have been trialed but with lack of convincing benefit in most cases. However, where antidepressants cause erectile dysfunction, the use of sildenafil has the largest and most consistent evidence base.

### Prevention and treatment of erectile dysfunction using lifestyle changes and dietary supplements: what works and what is worthless, part II [^111KmJMQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

It seems naïve to believe that some plants or herbs do not contain specific compounds that could benefit patients with ED. Many supplements have not been investigated in a laboratory or clinical research setting before commercial sale, however, which creates a complex situation. If efficacy is or is not demonstrated through adequate research, then the benefit or lack thereof cannot be mentioned on the label. Furthermore, clinicians and the public cannot be made aware of which compounds or supplements are effective because no general standards for sale exist under the current guidelines. Dietary supplements have received a tremendous amount of publicity. The large and growing market for ED treatment seems to have contributed partly to the promotion of numerous supplements and their apparent benefits. Whether these dietary supplements have merit is questionable. Some supplements may produce results opposite to those advertised. Other supplements may be enjoying the benefits of the placebo effect. Because a placebo response of 25% to 50% has been recorded in clinical trials with effective agents, it is understandable that some supplements enjoy financial success despite the limited research espousing their use. If one to two of four individuals or one of three individuals who try a dietary supplement gain some benefit for their ED, the market for these supplements will remain extraordinary. On a larger scale, of 100,000 men who try a supplement, approximately 25,000 to 50,000 will claim some success. The challenge for clinicians is to discuss the placebo response properly and the need for good research before any intervention, especially supplements, can be advocated for general use. Table 2 summarizes some popular ED supplements and general conclusions that can be drawn from clinical investigations. Some dietary supplements may have an active ingredient that benefits patients with certain types of ED. An exciting area of future dietary supplement research is the ability of certain agents to have a synergistic effect with prescription agents for ED, thereby improving response rates in men that have failed approved ED therapy initially, especially with oral agents. Randomized clinical trials are the best method of determining which dietary supplements will become a part of conventional medicine. Therefore, more randomized trials for dietary supplements are needed so that they may have the opportunity to become a part of the mainstream milieu, which means that more funding needs to be made available for ED research. The coming years of research should bring enormous excitement and objectivity to this area of medicine.

### International guidelines for the treatment of Huntington's disease [^112RFFTB]. Frontiers in Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for erectile dysfunction, more specifically with respect to patients with Huntington's disease, EHDN 2019 guidelines recommend to consider offering treatment for impotence and consult with an endocrinologist and/or a specialist in psychosexual disorders in case of ED. Consider offering PDE5 inhibitors for impotence when asked for by the patient and his sexual partner.

### Strategies for managing antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction: systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^111uCH3F]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

This review was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of management strategies for sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressant medication.

Methods

Electronic databases and reference lists were searched, and pharmaceutical companies and experts contacted to identify randomised controlled trials comparing management strategies for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.

Results

Fifteen trials involving 904 people were included. One trial involving 75 people with sexual dysfunction due to sertraline assessed changing antidepressant. Switching to nefazodone was significantly less likely to result in the re-emergence of sexual dysfunction than restarting sertraline (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.6). Meta-analysis of two trials involving 113 men with erectile dysfunction found that the addition of sildenafil resulted in less sexual dysfunction at endpoint on rating scales including the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (WMD 19.36, 95% CI 15.00 to 23.72). Another trial found the addition of bupropion led to improved scores on the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire desire-frequency subscale (WMD 0.88, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.55). In a further study the addition of tadalafil was associated with greater improvement in the erectile function domain of the IIEF than placebo (WMD 8.10; 95% CI 4.62 to 11.68). Other augmentation strategies failed to show statistically significant improvements in sexual dysfunction compared with placebo.

Discussion

The currently available evidence is rather limited, with small numbers of trials assessing each strategy. However, while further randomised data is awaited, for men with antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil appears to be an effective strategy.

### Erectile dysfunction [^113EV38q]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Male sexual health has taken on increased importance as the United States population ages, develops coexisting medical conditions and undergoes interventions that can affect sexual function. We characterized the burden and severity of disease, treatment patterns and economic consequences of erectile dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

The analytical methods used to generate these results were described previously.

Results

Erectile dysfunction was self-reported by almost 1 of 5 men and it increased with age. Erectile dysfunction may have been more commonly reported in Hispanic men and in those with a history of diabetes, obesity, smoking and hypertension. In most databases black American men had rates of use for office visits and inpatient hospital care that were twice those of other racial groups, although these rates were not controlled for comorbid conditions or other regional and socioeconomic factors. The use of diagnostic tests markedly decreased, while pharmacological therapy, especially with oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, markedly increased. Penile implant surgery continued to be performed with most patients electing inflatable devices. Extrapolating from the population based estimates of erectile dysfunction prevalence and current use trends showed that the cost of treatment nationwide could reach $15 billion if all men sought treatment.

Conclusions

The burden of disease due to erectile dysfunction in the United States will increase with the aging of the male population, increasing prevalence of comorbid conditions, expanded treatment seeking behavior and costs of pharmaceutical therapy. Accurate estimates of economic cost will require better understanding of pathogenesis, treatment seeking behavior, patient preference for therapies, success of treatments and relative satisfaction with oral pharmacotherapy and penile implants.

### Synchronous surgery for the combined treatment of post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence: a lucrative evolution or an unnecessary complexity? [^113fqNfU]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim of this review is to summarize and evaluate the current literature addressing the synchronous combined surgical treatment approach for co-existent post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. Severity of stress urinary incontinence is the basic element that defines which option of combined surgery will be offered to a patient. So, for cases of severe erectile dysfunction and severe stress urinary incontinence (> 4 pads/day) the only available option is synchronous inflatable penile prosthesis plus artificial urinary sphincter dual implantation. When severe erectile dysfunction coexist with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence synchronous inflatable penile prosthesis plus male sling or ProAct (Uromedica, Plymouth, MN, USA) device are the current available treatment options. Finally, when severe erectile dysfunction along with mild stress urinary incontinence and with or without climacturia are present, a new surgical technique of simultaneous inflatable penile prosthesis plus urethral mini-sling, named "Andrianne mini-jupette", implantation has been recently proposed. Synchronous combined surgery for post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence seems to offer similar efficacy and safety results compared with two-stage implantation but in a more cost- and time effective approach. Thus, synchronous surgery, in the hands of experienced prosthetic surgeons, could be potentially a valuable alternative for the management of co-existent post-radical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. Nevertheless, in order to acquire robust scientific data further prospective comparative studies on larger numbers of patients are surely needed.

### Male delayed orgasm and anorgasmia: a practical guide for sexual medicine providers [^114WnagS]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Male sexual function involves complex interactions among psychosocial, neurogenic, vascular, and endocrine factors that contribute to initiation of erection culminating in ejaculation and orgasm. Male sexual dysfunction occurs with disruption of any of these processes and encompasses decreased libido, erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculation disorders, and orgasmic dysfunction. ED receives the most attention and concordantly is the most well-studied and understood by patients and providers. Compared to ED where reliable and well-studied treatments are available, there remains a paucity of standardized treatments for men with ejaculatory and/or orgasmic dysfunction. There are extensive well-studied treatments for ED including multiple phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, vacuum devices, self-injectable drugs, and penile prosthesis; meanwhile, there are no FDA approved pharmacotherapies or invasive non-pharmacological interventions approved for delayed orgasm (DO). However, orgasm and ejaculation represent fundamental aspects of male sexual function, and ejaculatory and orgasmic dysfunction are highly prevalent and tremendously impact on quality of life.

Male orgasmic dysfunction can be dichotomized as two ends of a spectrum: premature ejaculation (PE) versus DO and anorgasmia (AO). Though ejaculation and orgasm are distinct events, they occur simultaneously in men and often are used interchangeably in the literature when discussing delayed ejaculation (DE) vs. DO. In this review, we specifically focus on summarizing the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of DO/AO. Recently, the American Urological Association (AUA) released the Disorders of Ejaculation guidelines that we will also highlight.

### Assessment of combination therapies vs monotherapy for erectile dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oJVTv]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Risk of Bias and Publication Bias

The overall risk of bias was low in 12 RCTs, with some concerns found in 16 RCTs, and high risk of bias in 8 RCTs, (eAppendix 4 in the Supplement). Accordingly, 3 non-RCTs, were considered as having low risk of bias and 5 non-RCTs, as having moderate risk of bias (eAppendix 5 in the Supplement). Funnel plot inspection and Egger test indicated potential publication bias and small-study bias (eAppendix 6 in the Supplement).

### A systematic review on mindfulness meditation-based interventions for sexual dysfunctions [^112XAX8X]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mindfulness-based therapies (MBT) are more and more frequently used in the treatment of sexual dysfunctions; therefore, it seems very important to assess evidence-based data on the clinical efficacy of these interventions.

Aim

To provide a systematic review of published studies into the efficacy of MBT in the treatment of sexual dysfunctions.

Methods

The material for the analysis was obtained by searching 3 internet databases: EBSCO, PubMed, and ResearchGate. Articles describing therapeutic interventions on the basis of mindfulness and their efficiency in reducing sexual dysfunction symptoms in men and women were sought.

Main Outcome Measures

15 original research articles were included to the review: 4 articles were devoted to the analysis of the efficiency of the mindfulness-based therapy in the reduction of sexual dysfunction related to pain in the genital-pelvic area, 10 to desire or sexual arousal disorders or both in women, and 1 to erectile dysfunction in men.

Results

Studies indicate that MBT led to improvement in subjectively evaluated arousal and desire, sexual satisfaction, and a reduction of fear linked with sexual activity, as well as improving the consistency between the subjectively perceived arousal and genital response in women. The research indicated that MBT did not make a significant change in a reduction of pain during sexual activities. Evidence-based data were found on the efficacy of MBT in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction in 1 study.

Clinical Implications

MBT could be effectively used in the treatment of female sexual dysfunction, specifically to improve sexual arousal/desire and satisfaction and to reduce sexual dysfunction associated with anxiety and negative cognitive schemas.

Strengths & Limitations

The few studies available are affected by several methodologic limitations, including small numbers of participants, patient selection, application of complex therapeutic interventions, and a lack of homework assessment, which makes definite conclusions difficult to draw.

Conclusion

The effects of MBT in female sexual dysfunctions are promising. In future studies, the mindfulness-based monotherapies should be implemented to verify their potential in reducing symptoms of sexual dysfunction. More research is needed to explore the potential of MBT in the treatment of male sexual dysfunction. Jaderek I, Lew-Starowicz M.

### Clinical efficacy of intracavernous injection of platelet lysate for erectile dysfunction [^117FBmuX]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, while our study and others highlight the potential benefits of PRP and PL therapies in managing ED, further investigations are needed to standardize treatment protocols, assess long-term efficacy and safety, evaluate synergy with other treatments, and analyze cost-effectiveness. As these therapies continue to evolve, they may offer new hope for patients with ED, particularly those for whom conventional treatments are ineffective, contraindicated, or unwanted.

### Lack of awareness of erectile dysfunction in many men with risk factors for erectile dysfunction [^116oQwAE]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our screening for erectile dysfunction among men with an erectile dysfunction-associated comorbidity and risk factors showed a high prevalence of erectile dysfunction diagnosed with the IIEF-EF (71%), with more than half of these (54%) having moderate or severe dysfunction, 23% having mild-to-moderate dysfunction, and 23% having mild dysfunction. This supports recently reported results showing that even mild erectile dysfunction is an important indicator of risk for underlying disease associated with erectile dysfunction, results from the first prospective, randomized, double-blind trial to assess treatment with a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor in a population of sexually dissatisfied men selected for mild ED diagnosed with the IIEF-EF. That landmark trial also showed that sildenafil treatment was efficacious and well tolerated and the men were highly satisfied with their treatment — thus validating both early intervention and the IIEF-EF diagnostic classification of mild erectile dysfunction in men who (per the inclusion criteria) have normal gonadal function, have regular sexual activity, and are sexually dissatisfied. Sexual dissatisfaction or "bother", which can be assessed using the Erection Distress Scale or the Overall Satisfaction domain of the IIEF, may be an important part of the equation in a man's self-perception of erectile dysfunction, regardless of the severity of the dysfunction.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^112eCUFT]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction — venous surgery (Recommendation 22): For men with ED, penile venous surgery is not recommended. (Moderate Recommendation, Evidence Level: Grade C) Penile venous surgery is not recommended because of the lack of compelling evidence that it constitutes an effective ED management strategy in most men, and randomized trials indicate penile venous ligation surgery is unlikely to result in long-term successful management for the overwhelming majority of men and delays treatment with other more reliable options such as penile prosthesis surgery.
