## Question

Prostate cancer treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prostate cancer treatment decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratification and life expectancy anchoring. Then, I should verify management pathways for localized disease, including active surveillance, surgery, and radiation. Next, I will examine advanced disease states, including mHSPC and mCRPC, and the role of biomarkers and sequencing. After that, I need to ensure quality-of-life and shared decision-making are integrated throughout. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and how to incorporate evolving evidence and clinical trials into practice [^116BEAfp].

> Let me first confirm the foundational step of risk stratification and life expectancy, because treatment selection hinges on these two axes. The NCCN framework uses clinical stage, PSA, and Gleason score to assign risk groups, and then layers in comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy to guide intensity of therapy; for example, men with less than a 5-year life expectancy generally should not receive curative-intent treatment, whereas those with greater than 10 years and higher-risk disease should be offered definitive therapy with curative intent [^111XX8Nb] [^113bfzVP] [^114t9PmU]. Wait, let me verify the role of newer tools: imaging and gene expression biomarkers can refine risk beyond the classic triad, but they should be ordered only when results will change management, which prevents overuse and unnecessary cost [^113bfzVP].

> I will now examine low-risk localized disease, where overtreatment is a major concern. The AUA/ASTRO guideline issues a strong, Grade A recommendation for active surveillance as the preferred option for low-risk patients, supported by ProtecT-era data showing no significant difference in all-cause mortality between surgery, radiation, and active monitoring, and by meta-analyses demonstrating very low rates of metastasis and prostate cancer death under surveillance protocols [^116fQZ7C] [^1145gWDR] [^114t9PmU]. Hold on, I should verify the surveillance cadence: PSA every 3–6 months, DRE every 6–12 months, a confirmatory biopsy around year 1, and serial biopsies every 1–3 years are standard, with MRI and targeted re-biopsy triggered by progression signals such as upgrading or increased volume, which aligns with contemporary NCCN and AUA/ASTRO guidance [^114t9PmU] [^115LxB6u].

> Next, I should review intermediate-risk disease, where nuance matters. For favorable intermediate-risk disease, active surveillance can be reasonable in carefully selected men, but I need to ensure we do not overgeneralize; long-term data suggest worse 15-year outcomes for some intermediate-risk patients on surveillance, so selection and counseling are critical [^112NpDpW]. For unfavorable intermediate-risk disease, definitive therapy is generally recommended; surgery and radiation plus ADT are both acceptable, and the choice should be individualized based on baseline urinary, sexual, and bowel function, as well as patient preferences and institutional expertise [^111XX8Nb].

> For high-risk localized disease, I should confirm that multimodal therapy is the standard. The AUA/ASTRO guideline strongly recommends offering either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy plus ADT for men with unfavorable intermediate- or high-risk disease and life expectancy greater than 10 years, reflecting randomized evidence that ADT combined with radiation improves survival in high-risk disease [^111XX8Nb]. Wait, I should double-check the role of extended ADT durations; multiple trials support 2–3 years of ADT with high-dose radiation, and dose escalation to at least 78 Gy is standard in intermediate- and high-risk settings, which is consistent with EAU-era guidance and contemporary practice [^115LLyFF].

> Let me consider locally advanced disease, where cure is less certain but long-term control is achievable. Multimodality therapy with radiation and prolonged ADT is a cornerstone, and in selected patients, surgery with adjuvant or salvage radiation may be appropriate; however, I need to ensure careful nodal and distant staging with advanced imaging when indicated, as this can alter the treatment paradigm and sequencing [^1178RGHJ] [^115LLyFF]. Hold on, I should verify that expert consensus supports individualized decisions in this space given heterogeneity; APCCC documents consistently emphasize tailoring to disease extent, prior therapy, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113uJWJ5].

> Now, I will examine metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, where treatment intensification has reshaped outcomes. For high-volume mHSPC, chemohormonal therapy with ADT plus docetaxel improves survival, and for low-volume disease, ADT plus an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide is standard; darolutamide plus ADT and docetaxel is also a recommended triplet option across volumes in updated guidelines [^115et1rE] [^1162Ku5c] [^112W2KFv]. Wait, I should confirm that these recommendations are consistent internationally; Canadian guidance similarly endorses darolutamide-based triplets and ARPI combinations, reinforcing the move toward intensified upfront therapy in mHSPC [^112W2KFv] [^115bNmYh].

> Turning to nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, I need to check that ARPI therapy is the backbone. Apalutamide, enzalutamide, or darolutamide added to ongoing ADT improve metastasis-free and overall survival, and selection among agents should consider prior exposure, comorbidities, and patient preference, with attention to fatigue, hypertension, and falls risk profiles [^1162Ku5c]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines caution against routine use of chemotherapy in nmCRPC; indeed, cytotoxic therapy is not standard here, and ARPIs remain preferred [^1162Ku5c].

> For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, I should confirm the emphasis on sequencing and biomarker-driven options. Continued ADT with sequential ARPIs, taxane chemotherapy, and radiopharmaceuticals such as radium-223 or PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy are key options, and PARP inhibition is indicated for tumors with DNA repair defects such as BRCA1/2 or ATM alterations; immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T has a niche role, and clinical trials should be prioritized whenever feasible [^1162Ku5c] [^115EoiU4]. Wait, let me verify the sequencing dilemma; real-world and genomic datasets like PROMISE highlight that most patients cannot receive all lines, so early choices matter and sequencing should be individualized to mutation status, prior ARPI exposure, and symptom burden [^114xfZXm].

> I need to ensure quality-of-life and shared decision-making are not afterthoughts. Baseline urinary, sexual, and bowel function strongly predict post-treatment outcomes, so standardized patient-reported measures such as EPIC-26 should be obtained and used to counsel patients on expected functional changes with surgery, radiation, or surveillance; decision aids and structured SDM processes improve alignment with patient values and reduce decisional regret [^115yrD3T] [^117CFhS7]. But wait, what if a patient prioritizes avoiding incontinence over marginal oncologic differences? In that case, radiation may be favored over surgery, whereas a younger man prioritizing rapid cancer eradication might prefer surgery; these trade-offs must be explicitly discussed and documented [^115yrD3T].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In older adults, chronological age alone is inadequate; geriatric assessment to classify fitness and vulnerability guides whether to offer standard therapy or adapted regimens, and frail patients may benefit from dose-modified or noncurative approaches; in resource-limited settings, consensus statements emphasize cost-effectiveness and access, often favoring observation or ADT-based strategies when curative modalities are unavailable [^1142ZfGd] [^113nmehy]. Hold on, I should verify that these recommendations align with global guidance; yes, multiple APCCC-derived global consensus documents reinforce individualized, resource-aware care and the importance of equitable access to evidence-based options [^111CDWUr].

> I will now examine follow-up and biochemical recurrence, because timing of salvage therapy affects both outcomes and toxicity. After definitive local therapy, PSA surveillance is standard; in biochemical recurrence without metastases, observation or clinical trial enrollment is preferred, and ADT should not be initiated routinely; if ADT is used, intermittent therapy can mitigate long-term adverse effects, and PSADT helps stratify risk and timing of intervention [^116StLEP] [^111mGjS8]. Wait, let me verify the role of early salvage radiation after prostatectomy; contemporary guidance supports early salvage rather than routine adjuvant radiation in most patients, reserving adjuvant therapy for those at highest risk, which balances oncologic benefit with overtreatment [^115LxB6u].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan incorporates evolving evidence and clinical trials. The APCCC series repeatedly identifies knowledge gaps where expert consensus is limited, underscoring the need for trial participation; likewise, NCCN and AUA/SUO guidelines emphasize integrating new data, molecular biomarkers, and advanced imaging into care while avoiding reflex testing that will not change management [^113uJWJ5] [^1178RGHJ] [^113bfzVP]. Hold on, I should verify that this includes radioligand and PARP inhibitor integration; yes, ongoing studies and updated guideline sections reflect rapid adoption of PSMA-targeted therapies and biomarker-selected targeted agents, reinforcing the importance of staying current and referring patients to trials when appropriate [^1162Ku5c] [^116BEAfp].

Prostate cancer treatment is **individualized** based on risk, life expectancy, and patient preferences, with **active surveillance** for low-risk disease, and **surgery or radiation** for intermediate/high-risk or symptomatic patients [^116fQZ7C] [^111XX8Nb]. For metastatic disease, **androgen deprivation therapy** is the backbone, with intensification using docetaxel or androgen receptor pathway inhibitors improving survival [^115et1rE] [^112W2KFv]. Emerging options include **PARP inhibitors**, **immunotherapy**, and **PSMA-targeted radioligands** for advanced disease [^1162Ku5c] [^111wMGrE]. Shared decision-making is essential to balance oncologic outcomes with quality of life and side effects [^115yrD3T].

---

## Localized prostate cancer

### Low-risk disease

For low-risk disease, **active surveillance** is preferred, involving regular PSA monitoring, digital rectal exams, and periodic biopsies to detect progression [^116fQZ7C] [^1145gWDR]. Definitive therapy — either **radical prostatectomy** or **radiation therapy** — is reserved for patients who prefer treatment or show signs of progression [^113soXWv] [^115PCixM].

---

### Intermediate-risk disease

For intermediate-risk disease, **active surveillance** may be considered in carefully selected favorable intermediate-risk patients, though most undergo definitive therapy [^112NpDpW]. Definitive therapy — **radical prostatectomy** or **radiation therapy** (external beam or brachytherapy), often with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) — is standard for intermediate-risk disease [^111XX8Nb] [^115LLyFF].

---

### High-risk disease

For high-risk disease, **multimodal therapy** — combining radiation therapy with prolonged ADT — is standard due to higher recurrence risk [^111XX8Nb] [^115wfCPc]. Radical prostatectomy may be considered in selected patients, often with adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy [^111XX8Nb] [^1156FyAr].

---

## Locally advanced prostate cancer

In locally advanced prostate cancer, **combined modality therapy** — radiation therapy with prolonged ADT — is standard [^115LLyFF]. Radical prostatectomy may be considered in highly selected patients with extensive pelvic lymph node dissection and adjuvant radiation [^notfound].

---

## Metastatic prostate cancer

### Hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (mHSPC)

In hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (mHSPC), **androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)** is the cornerstone of treatment [^114EFa1H]. Treatment intensification with **docetaxel** or **androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs)** such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide significantly improves survival [^115et1rE].

---

### Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)

In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), **androgen receptor pathway inhibitors** such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide are standard options [^1162Ku5c]. Chemotherapy with **docetaxel** or **cabazitaxel** is used for progressive disease despite hormonal therapy [^115EoiU4]. Immunotherapy with **sipuleucel-T** may be considered in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients [^notfound]. PARP inhibitors such as **olaparib** or **rucaparib** are options for patients with DNA repair defects (e.g. BRCA1/2 mutations) [^notfound]. PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy with **lutetium-177-PSMA-617** is an emerging option for advanced CRPC [^notfound].

---

## Side effects and quality of life considerations

- **Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction** are common after radical prostatectomy, while radiation therapy may cause urinary irritation and erectile dysfunction [^114V32Vp] [^111iXjAv].
- **Androgen deprivation therapy** is associated with fatigue, osteoporosis, metabolic changes, and cardiovascular risks [^notfound].
- **Shared decision-making** is essential to balance oncologic outcomes with patient preferences and quality of life [^117CFhS7].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Immunotherapy**: Ongoing research explores checkpoint inhibitors and combination strategies to overcome immune suppression in prostate cancer [^111wMGrE].
- **Personalized medicine**: Advances in genomic profiling and biomarkers enable tailored treatment strategies [^113bfzVP].
- **Focal therapy**: Minimally invasive approaches targeting localized lesions are under investigation for selected patients [^1122jTiJ].

---

Prostate cancer treatment spans active surveillance, surgery, radiation, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies, with **selection guided by risk, stage, and patient preferences**. Ongoing research and personalized approaches continue to improve outcomes and quality of life.

### Advancing prostate cancer: treatment options for the urologist [^115qsWK9]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Today's urologists often face the dilemma of how to treat patients who have advancing prostate cancer. The diversity of this patient population makes treatment decisions challenging. For over 60 years the mainstay of treatment for patients who have advancing prostate cancer has been androgen deprivation therapy. Now there are new chemotherapeutic options, novel hormone manipulations, and other adjunctive therapies available. Based on a case presentation, the authors have attempted to outline for the practicing urologist, a logical progression of treatment options for advancing prostate cancer.

### Current prostate cancer treatments: effect on quality of life [^114y41tp]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with prostate cancer (PCa) are presented with multiple therapeutic options. However, the evidence supporting a survival benefit with current PCa therapies is often limited and data directly comparing the available options are lacking. Although dramatic improvements have been made in the treatment methods available for PCa and there has been a decline in death rates for the disease, each active intervention has potential side effects and long-term complications that can adversely affect quality of life (QOL). The cancer diagnosis and management strategies can also negatively affect the QOL of patients and their families. The healthcare costs associated with cancer treatment are another factor to consider. When determining treatment options, patients and physicians should consider the efficacy of the therapy, as well as the safety, effect on QOL, and cost. As a part of a risk reduction strategy, effective screening programs, along with possible therapeutic agents, could have a positive effect on QOL and offer a preemptive benefit to patients at increased risk of PCa.

### National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of prostate cancer [^117BD2HT]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of prostate cancer issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide a basis for rational treatment decisions. These guidelines represent consensus recommendations by a panel of experts that are evidence based and are designated according to the degree of consensus within the expert panel. The initial stratification point is the patient's life expectancy (> 5 or < 5 years). If life expectancy is > 5 years, the recommended intervention is based on clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score, as well as the presence of symptoms. These assessments establish the patient's risk of recurrence after therapy. Specific initial therapies are then recommended according to whether the risk category is low, intermediate, high, or very high. The guidelines also describe the appropriate use of observation ("watchful waiting") versus active intervention in certain patients. After definitive therapy, patients should be monitored with PSA determinations, digital rectal examination, and bone scans, as outlined in the guidelines. Patients who exhibit increasing PSA levels after prostatectomy are candidates for salvage therapy with androgen ablation, radiotherapy, or observation. If PSA levels begin to increase after radiotherapy, surgery may then be an additional option. Systemic salvage therapy generally consists of androgen ablation; the benefit of total androgen blockade versus initial monotherapy remains controversial. Relapse after initial androgen ablation is treated with an antiandrogen, if none had been administered previously. Patients refractory to further hormonal manipulations are observed or receive palliative therapy, including chemotherapy. The treatment of prostate cancer is complex. Optimal treatment is risk-adapted to the specific characteristics of the cancer and the expected longevity and personal preferences of the patient.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer: report of the advanced prostate cancer consensus conference 2019 [^113uJWJ5]. European Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Innovations in treatments, imaging, and molecular characterisation in advanced prostate cancer have improved outcomes, but there are still many aspects of management that lack high-level evidence to inform clinical practice. The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2019 addressed some of these topics to supplement guidelines that are based on level 1 evidence.

Objective

To present the results from the APCCC 2019.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Similar to prior conferences, experts identified 10 important areas of controversy regarding the management of advanced prostate cancer: locally advanced disease, biochemical recurrence after local therapy, treating the primary tumour in the metastatic setting, metastatic hormone-sensitive/naïve prostate cancer, nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, bone health and bone metastases, molecular characterisation of tissue and blood, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, and adverse effects of hormonal therapy and their management. A panel of 72 international prostate cancer experts developed the programme and the consensus questions.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 123 predefined questions, which were developed by both voting and nonvoting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process.

Results and Limitations

Panellists voted based on their opinions rather than a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions had varying degrees of support by the panel, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results reported in the Supplementary material.

Conclusions

These voting results from a panel of prostate cancer experts can help clinicians and patients navigate controversial areas of advanced prostate management for which high-level evidence is sparse. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient-specific factors, such as disease extent and location, prior lines of therapy, comorbidities, and treatment preferences, together with current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic constraints. Clinical trial enrolment for men with advanced prostate cancer should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2019 once again identified important questions that merit assessment in specifically designed trials.

Patient Summary

The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference, which has been held three times since 2015, aims to share the knowledge of world experts in prostate cancer management with health care providers worldwide. At the end of the conference, an expert panel discusses and votes on predefined consensus questions that target the most clinically relevant areas of advanced prostate cancer treatment. The results of the voting provide a practical guide to help clinicians discuss therapeutic options with patients as part of shared and multidisciplinary decision making.

### Early prostate cancer: clinical decision-making [^114nvEhg]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases for which health-care intervention is sought worldwide, and in many developed countries it is the most common. Some patients with early-stage prostate cancer, especially those who are elderly and have comorbidities, can be observed without treatment. Surgery (radical prostatectomy) and radiotherapy (external-beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, or both) are the most widely accepted curative options for patients with early-stage disease who need intervention. All these local treatments have been refined, resulting in comparable cure rates; however, they all have different side-effect profiles. Adjuvant systemic treatments (hormones or chemotherapy), which are effective for advanced-stage disease, might have a greater role in early-stage disease. Selecting the best option for individuals from the available options is challenging — the decision on whether and how to treat is based on many disease and patient factors. Here, we review the major treatment options, discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages, and provide a general approach to management of patients with early-stage prostate cancer.

### The contemporary management of prostate cancer [^112um7Zn]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Prostate cancer encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, ranging from low‐risk disease, in which treatment can only harm and not extend life, to a fatal disease, which still claims too many lives globally. Appropriate risk stratification and individualized treatment are keys to good management. Emerging data and new therapies will continue to refine therapeutic paradigms and improve outcomes for individuals with prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer screening and the management of clinically localized disease [^1154dUWc]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

What treatments should I recommend for clinically localized prostate cancer?

Treatment options for clinically localized prostate cancer include watchful waiting or observation, active surveillance, radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiation therapy, interstitial radiation implants (brachytherapy), cryoablation, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), high intensity focused ultrasound, and focal therapy. Treatment recommendations and selection involve patients' values and their weighting of the trade-offs in benefits and harms, as well as physician preferences. A multidisciplinary approach that includes the patient's primary care provider and incorporates the latest findings from randomized trials or higher quality observational studies can help a patient make a well informed decision. Comparative effectiveness remains controversial, partly because few randomized treatment trials with mortality outcomes (only one in the PSA era) have been completed. Trials have been difficult to complete owing to the large size and long term follow-up needed, as well as patients' and clinicians' reluctance to participate. Despite evidence indicating excellent long term disease specific survival with observation, nearly 90% of men with PSA detected prostate cancer in the US receive early treatment. In the UK, 3000–4000 RPs are carried out each year, and two to three times this number of men undergo radiotherapy. In the UK, 60% of men diagnosed with low risk disease undergo immediate treatment; this figure is 70–90% in the US.

### Current decision-making in prostate cancer therapy [^1159SRqr]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate cancer continues to be the most prevalent cancer among American men. Localized prostate cancer is commonly diagnosed because of improved screening practices nationwide. Several options exist for the treatment of localized prostate cancer, and this review discusses the decision-making process facing patients diagnosed with this disease.

Recent Findings

No one treatment for localized prostate cancer has proven superior to date. For this reason patients have been found to use a number of resources to make an informed decision. These include physicians, spouses, family, friends, and different media. Urologists serve as the primary and most influential physicians and play an important role in the decision-making process. Patients, however, are assuming a more active role in this process as time evolves, especially with ease of access to multiple information resources.

Summary

In deciding on a treatment for localized prostate cancer, patients must weigh the risks and benefits of each option. Urologists must provide patients with up-to-date information on these options and be aware of the different influences that surround these men during the decision-making process.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer: report from the advanced prostate cancer consensus conference 2021 [^1178RGHJ]. European Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Innovations in treatments, imaging, and molecular characterisation in advanced prostate cancer have improved outcomes, but various areas of management still lack high-level evidence to inform clinical practice. The 2021 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) addressed some of these questions to supplement guidelines that are based on level 1 evidence.

Objective

To present the voting results from APCCC 2021.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The experts identified three major areas of controversy related to management of advanced prostate cancer: newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), the use of prostate-specific membrane antigen ligands in diagnostics and therapy, and molecular characterisation of tissue and blood. A panel of 86 international prostate cancer experts developed the programme and the consensus questions.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 107 pre-defined questions, which were developed by both voting and non-voting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process.

Results and Limitations

The voting reflected the opinions of panellists and did not incorporate a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions received varying degrees of support from panellists, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results reported in the Supplementary material.

Conclusions

These voting results from a panel of experts in advanced prostate cancer can help clinicians and patients to navigate controversial areas of management for which high-level evidence is scant. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised according to patient characteristics, such as the extent and location of disease, prior treatment(s), comorbidities, patient preferences, and treatment recommendations, and should also incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic constraints. Enrolment in clinical trials should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2021 once again identified salient questions that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials.

Patient Summary

The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference is a forum for discussing current diagnosis and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. An expert panel votes on predefined questions focused on the most clinically relevant areas for treatment of advanced prostate cancer for which there are gaps in knowledge. The voting results provide a practical guide to help clinicians in discussing treatment options with patients as part of shared decision-making.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112mFNpg]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer guideline intent — these guidelines aim to provide a framework on which to base treatment decisions, noting that prostate cancer is a complex disease, with many controversial aspects of management and with limited data to support some of the treatment recommendations, and that several variables (including adjusted life expectancy, disease characteristics, predicted outcomes, and patient preferences) must be considered by the patient and physician to tailor prostate cancer therapy for the individual patient.

### Evolution of a CDC public health research agenda for low-risk prostate cancer [^1167QpG3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Men with prostate cancer face difficult choices when selecting a therapy for localized prostate cancer. Comparative data from controlled studies are lacking and clinical opinions diverge about the benefits and harms of treatment options. Consequently, there is limited guidance for patients regarding the impact of treatment decisions on quality of life. There are opportunities for public health to intervene at several decision-making points. Information on typical quality of life outcomes associated with specific prostate cancer treatments could help patients select treatment options. From 2003 to present, the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at CDC has supported projects to explore patient information-seeking behavior post-diagnosis, caregiver and provider involvement in treatment decision making, and patient quality of life following prostate cancer treatment. CDC's work also includes research that explores barriers and facilitators to the presentation of active surveillance as a viable treatment option and promotes equal access to information for men and their caregivers. This article provides an overview of the literature and considerations that initiated establishing a prospective public health research agenda around treatment decision making. Insights gathered from CDC-supported studies are poised to enhance understanding of the process of shared decision making and the influence of patient, caregiver, and provider preferences on the selection of treatment choices. These findings provide guidance about attributes that maximize patient experiences in survivorship, including optimal quality of life and patient and caregiver satisfaction with information, treatment decisions, and subsequent care.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1162Ku5c]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). Medium credibility.

The NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer provide a framework on which to base decisions for patients with prostate cancer across the disease spectrum. The Guidelines sections included in this article focus on metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). For patients with mCSPC, disease characteristics, such as whether metastases arose synchronously or metachronously and the degree of metastatic burden, impact therapy decisions, including how much treatment intensification is appropriate and when prostate-directed and/or metastasis-directed therapy should be considered. In the mCRPC setting, androgen deprivation therapy is continued with the sequential or concurrent addition of certain androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, chemotherapies, immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel emphasizes a shared decision-making approach in all disease settings based on patient preferences, prior treatment exposures, biomarkers, the extent and location of metastases, symptoms, and potential side effects.

### The diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review [^115et1rE]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis made in men with more than 160 000 new cases each year in the United States. Although it often has an indolent course, prostate cancer remains the third-leading cause of cancer death in men.

Observations

When prostate cancer is suspected, tissue biopsy remains the standard of care for diagnosis. However, the identification and characterization of the disease have become increasingly precise through improved risk stratification and advances in magnetic resonance and functional imaging, as well as from the emergence of biomarkers. Multiple management options now exist for men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Active surveillance (the serial monitoring for disease progression with the intent to cure) appears to be safe and has become the preferred approach for men with less-aggressive prostate cancer, particularly those with a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 10 ng/mL and Gleason score 3+3 tumors. Surgery and radiation continue to be curative treatments for localized disease but have adverse effects such as urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction that can negatively affect quality of life. For metastatic disease, chemotherapy as initial treatment now appears to extend survival compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone. New vaccines, hormonal therapeutics, and bone-targeting agents have demonstrated efficacy in men with metastatic prostate cancer resistant to traditional hormonal therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer have improved the ability to stratify patients by risk and allowed clinicians to recommend therapy based on cancer prognosis and patient preference. Initial treatment with chemotherapy can improve survival compared with androgen deprivation therapy. Abiraterone, enzalutamide, and other agents can improve outcomes in men with metastatic prostate cancer resistant to traditional hormonal therapy.

### Active surveillance for intermediate-risk prostate cancer: yes, but for whom? [^112NpDpW]. Current Opinion in Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Active surveillance is becoming more widely accepted as an initial management option for carefully selected men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa). As prospective active surveillance cohorts mature sufficiently to begin evaluating longer-term outcomes, consensus on more precise evidence-based guidelines is needed to identify the patient cohorts who may be safely managed with active surveillance and what the ideal surveillance protocol entails.

Recent Findings

Long-term outcomes updates have suggested a trend toward worse 15-year survival outcomes for intermediate-risk patients on active surveillance compared with definitive treatment, but 'intermediate-risk' is a broad category and there is a subset of favorable intermediate-risk patients for whom survival outcomes remain equivalent. Promising updates to current risk stratification include consideration of genomic classifiers, advanced imaging and more nuanced interpretation of biopsy results.

Summary

Despite widespread acknowledgement of the pitfalls of overtreatment in clinically localized PCa, utilization of active surveillance in the intermediate-risk population remains marginal, in part due to the absence of easily interpretable consensus recommendations. As more long-term outcomes data become available for this subgroup, the field is now poised to refine the definition of favorable intermediate-risk patients for whom active surveillance is a safe, evidence-based first-line management option.

### The need for a personalized approach for prostate cancer management [^115ZHbZE]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In current urology practice, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with local or locally advanced disease. They will be candidates for curative treatment with either radical surgery or radiation therapy. Despite this shift towards diagnosis at a more favorable clinical stage of prostate cancer, between 20% and 30% of these patients will have a biochemical relapse and need additional therapy. At that point, most patients will first receive some form of salvage therapy, although a considerable number of patients will eventually need androgen deprivation therapy to treat metastasized prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy is not a curative option in the treatment of prostate cancer, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer and eventually death from prostate cancer in most cases.

The description of this clinical history is not uncommon, and underlines the limitations we encounter in determining the prognosis of individuals with prostate cancer. There is a clear, unmet need for reliable and reproducible prognostic biomarkers that can stratify patients on prognosis and identify who could benefit from early adjuvant treatment instead of salvage treatment.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer: the report of the advanced prostate cancer consensus conference APCCC 2017 [^114KP7TZ]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In advanced prostate cancer (APC), successful drug development as well as advances in imaging and molecular characterisation have resulted in multiple areas where there is lack of evidence or low level of evidence. The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017 addressed some of these topics.

Objective

To present the report of APCCC 2017.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Ten important areas of controversy in APC management were identified: high-risk localised and locally advanced prostate cancer; "oligometastatic" prostate cancer; castration-naïve and castration-resistant prostate cancer; the role of imaging in APC; osteoclast-targeted therapy; molecular characterisation of blood and tissue; genetic counselling/testing; side effects of systemic treatment(s); global access to prostate cancer drugs. A panel of 60 international prostate cancer experts developed the program and the consensus questions.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 150 predefined questions, which have been developed following a modified Delphi process.

Results and Limitations

Voting is based on panellist opinion, and thus is not based on a standard literature review or meta-analysis. The outcomes of the voting had varying degrees of support, as reflected in the wording of this article, as well as in the detailed voting results recorded in Supplementary data.

Conclusions

The presented expert voting results can be used for support in areas of management of men with APC where there is no high-level evidence, but individualised treatment decisions should as always be based on all of the data available, including disease extent and location, prior therapies regardless of type, host factors including comorbidities, as well as patient preferences, current and emerging evidence, and logistical and economic constraints. Inclusion of men with APC in clinical trials should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2017 again identified important areas in need of trials specifically designed to address them.

Patient Summary

The second Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference APCCC 2017 did provide a forum for discussion and debates on current treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer. The aim of the conference is to bring the expertise of world experts to care givers around the world who see less patients with prostate cancer. The conference concluded with a discussion and voting of the expert panel on predefined consensus questions, targeting areas of primary clinical relevance. The results of these expert opinion votes are embedded in the clinical context of current treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer and provide a practical guide to clinicians to assist in the discussions with men with prostate cancer as part of a shared and multidisciplinary decision-making process.

### The role of active surveillance in the management of prostate cancer [^113DAtPh]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

In 2010, NCCN incorporated active surveillance (AS) into the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Prostate Cancer, and the 2012 update serves as an excellent resource with the most current evidence regarding treatment options for men with all stages of disease. However, the lack of clinical trials that directly compare various treatment modalities or identify the best management, especially for men with low-risk prostate cancer, makes the decision-making process difficult for both patients and physicians. Although general agreement exists on definitions of candidates for AS-men with low-volume and low-grade disease thought to be at low risk for rapid progression-several key issues remain in establishing and supporting the role of AS in the management of prostate cancer, such as optimal timing and appropriate triggers for active treatment. The decision to initially pursue AS rather than active treatment after prostate cancer diagnosis is complex and involves myriad factors, including estimation of life expectancy, consideration of quality of life, and assessment of ultimate oncologic outcome.

### Consensus on the screening, staging, treatment, and surveillance of localized, recurrent, and metastatic prostate cancer: the first global prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries [^113nmehy]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE OF THE SERIES

To provide valuable information for physicians and healthcare professionals who work in areas with limited resources, we sought to provide a global consensus including screening, diagnosis, staging tools, treatment, and follow-up for various stages of PCa for developing countries. The information provided in the consensus posing different scenarios will help to choose, when the gold standard options are not available, the best option possible considering a resource-limited scenario. We hope that the series will help physicians who work treating patients with prostate cancer in areas of limited resources to establish the best possible standard of care for the patients in these countries and help in guiding and educating responsible groups in these countries of the limitations faced by these professionals in the treatment of PCa.

### The contemporary management of prostate cancer [^1132M7o3]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in two thirds of the world, with an expected doubling in both incidence and mortality in the next two decades. No strong environmental associations exist for the development of prostate cancer; therefore, lifestyle measures are unlikely to mitigate this increasing burden. The last three decades have seen rapid developments in the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of prostate cancer, including multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, robotic surgery, image‐guided hypofractionated and stereotactic radiotherapy, novel anti‐androgens and radioligand therapies. Prostate cancer is unique in that not everyone with a diagnosis needs treatment, and active surveillance is the preferred option for some. This review discusses the contemporary management of all stages of prostate cancer in the light of these modern developments, enabling holistic individualization of treatment, and describes the promise of future research to further improve outcomes.

### EAU guidelines on prostate cancer [^114cYvWD]. European Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The first summary of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on prostate cancer was published in 2001. These guidelines have been continuously updated since many important changes affecting the clinical management of patients with prostate cancer have occurred over the past years. The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2005 update of the EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Methods

A literature review of the new data has been performed by the working panel. The guidelines have been updated and level of evidence/grade of recommendation added to the text. This enables readers to better understand the quality of the data forming the basis of the recommendations.

Results

A full version is available at the EAU Office or at. Systemic prostate biopsies under ultrasound guidance is the preferred diagnostic method and the use of periprostatic injection of a local anaesthetic can significantly reduce pain/discomfort associated with the procedure. Active treatment (surgery or radiation) is mostly recommended for patients with localized disease and a long life expectancy with radical prostatectomy being the only treatment evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Follow-up is at large based on prostate specific antigen (PSA) and a disease-specific history with imaging only indicated when symptoms occur. Cytotoxic therapy has become an option for selected patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.

Conclusion

The knowledge in the field of prostate cancer is rapidly changing. These EAU guidelines on prostate cancer summarize the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice.

### Prostate cancer: the new landscape [^11612pVu]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights current features of the changing landscape of the US population with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and discusses new treatment options utilizing noninvasive or minimally invasive management.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence of significant changes in the current prostate cancer landscape is based on clinical data and pathological specimens after radical prostatectomy that suggest a further increase of the low-risk patient population that may require reconsideration of treatment options. For a select cohort of patients with low-risk features, based on the D'Amico definition, active surveillance or focal ablative therapy may be a rational alternative to surgical prostatectomy or whole-gland radiation therapy that still dominate as the main treatment approaches for localized prostate cancer.

Summary

As the prostate-specific antigen era continues to mature, we continue to witness stage migration. A growing segment of the localized prostate cancer patient population has very low-volume, low-grade disease. Although active surveillance may be an appropriate approach for a selected group of patients, the progression requiring whole-gland therapy remains a challenge. Organ-sparing focal therapy might ideally fill the gap between a surveillance strategy and whole-gland treatment providing a reasonable balance between cancer control and quality of life.

### The management of localized prostate cancer [^114jL3S9]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

At this point in time, the only possibility of curing prostate cancer is through the early detection and treatment of localized disease. The large number of treatment options available for localized prostate cancer, including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy (either external beam or interstitial), hormone therapy and watchful waiting, can be confusing for the patient. These treatments are associated with different adverse effects, further complicating the treatment decision. As there will inevitably be a trade-off between expected cure and acceptable adverse effects, it is important to discuss all options with the patient. The doctor and patient must together decide the appropriate treatment for him and his tumor.

### PROMISE: a real-world clinical-genomic database to address knowledge gaps in prostate cancer [^114xfZXm]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Current challenges in prostate cancer and potential solutions

The last two decades have seen significant new advancements in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Much wider availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels has made it possible to individualize treatment options for a subset of prostate cancer patients with specific tumor markers or alterations. These developments have created a plethora of new questions, many of which may be answered though accumulation of clinical and genomic data in a "real-world" dataset. The following examples highlight current challenges in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer as well as potential solutions and strategies to overcome barriers to the realization of the true promise of precision medicine in prostate cancer.

Sequencing of therapies in prostate cancer

With the evolution of multiple novel treatment options in mCRPC, including novel hormonal agents and PARP inhibitors, as well as the emergence of novel therapeutic classes such as PSMA-targeted radioligand therapies, there is increasingly a wealth of options to offer patients in a disease space where only a couple of decades ago there were relatively few. In this setting, the questions about appropriate sequencing of therapies become especially relevant, especially as most patients will not be able to receive all available treatment options and decisions of which therapies to prioritize earlier as opposed to later in the disease course must be made by the treating physician. For instance, in molecularly selected patients able to receive PARP inhibitors, what is the most optimal way to sequence these agents with taxane chemotherapy and should the sequencing of therapies be impacted by mutation status? The PROMISE clinical-genomic platform can help to generate initial data on potential positive and negative predictive biomarkers to guide these types of therapeutic questions.

### Localized prostate cancer: treatment options [^116CqNLh]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, prostate cancer will be diagnosed in one out of seven men in his lifetime. Most cases are localized, and only one in 39 men will die from the disease. Prostate cancer is most often detected using serum prostate-specific antigen testing. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines use four main factors to stratify risk of disease progression or recurrence and to determine the recommended treatment: clinical stage, pathologic grade, prostate-specific antigen level, and comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy. Radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy should be considered for patients with high-risk prostate cancer regardless of comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy. These treatments are almost equivalent in effectiveness but have different adverse effect profiles. Patients who undergo radical prostatectomy are more likely to experience urinary incontinence and trouble obtaining or sustaining an erection compared with patients who opt for radiation therapy. Brachytherapy is an option for patients with low-risk disease and some patients with intermediate-risk disease. Active surveillance is an option for patients with low-risk and very low-risk disease. With active surveillance, patients are closely followed and undergo invasive treatments only if the cancer progresses. Prostate cancer progression may be indicated by an increase in the pathologic grade, a significant rise in serum prostate-specific antigen level, or an abnormality on digital rectal examination.

### Clinically localized prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO / SUO guideline. part II: recommended approaches and details of specific care options [^113soXWv]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

This guideline is structured to provide a clinical framework stratified by cancer severity to facilitate care decisions and guide the specifics of implementing the selected management options. The summary presented herein represents Part II of the two-part series dedicated to Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: AUA/ASTRO/SUO Guideline discussing risk stratification and care options by cancer severity. Please refer to Part I for discussion of specific care options and outcome expectations and management.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and through additional supplementation by ECRI Institute. This review included articles published between January 2007 and March 2014 with an update search conducted through August 2016. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. Additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 2 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/).

Results

The AUA (American Urological Association), ASTRO, and SUO (Society of Urologic Oncology) formulated an evidence-based guideline based on a risk stratified clinical framework for the management of localized prostate cancer.

Conclusions

This guideline attempts to improve a clinician's ability to treat patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, but higher quality evidence in future trials will be essential to improve the level of care for these patients. In all cases, patient preferences should be considered when choosing a management strategy.

### Treatment options for localized prostate cancer [^112Yrrnx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

In the United States, more than 90 percent of prostate cancers are detected by serum prostate-specific antigen testing. Most patients are found to have localized prostate cancer, and most of these patients undergo surgery or radiotherapy. However, many patients have low-risk cancer and can follow an active surveillance protocol instead of undergoing invasive treatments. Active surveillance is a new concept in which low-risk patients are closely followed and proceed to intervention only if their cancer progresses. Clinical guidelines can help in selecting between treatment or active surveillance based on the cancer's stage and grade, the patient's prostate-specific antigen level, and the comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy. Radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy is recommended for higher-risk patients. These treatments are almost equivalent in effectiveness, but have different adverse effect profiles. Brachytherapy is an option for low- and moderate-risk patients. Evidence is insufficient to determine whether laparoscopic or robotic surgery or cryotherapy is superior to open radical prostatectomy.

### High-risk prostate cancer-classification and therapy [^113YrAge]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Approximately 15% of patients with prostate cancer are diagnosed with high-risk disease. However, the current definitions of high-risk prostate cancer include a heterogeneous group of patients with a range of prognoses. Some have the potential to progress to a lethal phenotype that can be fatal, while others can be cured with treatment of the primary tumour alone. The optimal management of this patient subgroup is evolving. A refined classification scheme is needed to enable the early and accurate identification of high-risk disease so that more-effective treatment paradigms can be developed. We discuss several principles established from clinical trials, and highlight other questions that remain unanswered. This Review critically evaluates the existing literature focused on defining the high-risk population, the management of patients with high-risk prostate cancer, and future directions to optimize care.

### Eliciting patient preferences for hormonal therapy options in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer [^115NfiFG]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment choices for metastatic prostate cancer are complex and can involve men balancing survival versus quality of life. The present study aims to elicit patient preferences with respect to the attributes of treatments for metastatic prostate cancer through a discrete choice experiment (DCE) questionnaire. Men with recently diagnosed localized prostate cancer were asked to envisage that they had metastatic disease when completing a survey. As expected, men with prostate cancer placed considerable importance on gains in survival; however, avoiding side effects of treatment was also clearly important. Survival gains should be considered alongside side effects when discussing treatment options in metastatic disease.

### Survival and complications following surgery and radiation for localized prostate cancer: an international collaborative review [^114V32Vp]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evaluation of treatment options for localized prostate cancer (PCa) remains among the highest priorities for comparative effectiveness research. Surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are the two interventions most commonly used.

Objective

To provide a critical narrative review of evidence of the comparative effectiveness and harms of surgery and RT in the treatment of localized PCa.

Evidence Acquisition

A collaborative critical narrative review of the literature was conducted.

Evidence Synthesis

Evidence to clearly guide treatment choice in PCa remains insufficient. Randomized trials are underpowered for clinically meaningful endpoints and have demonstrated no difference in overall or PCa-specific survival. Observational studies have consistently demonstrated an absolute survival benefit for men treated with radical prostatectomy, but are limited by selection bias and residual confounding errors. Surgery and RT are associated with comparable health-related quality of life following treatment in three randomized trials. Randomized data regarding urinary, erectile, and bowel function show few long-term (> 5 yr) differences, although short-term continence and erectile function were worse following surgery and short-term urinary bother and bowel function were worse following RT. There has been recent recognition of other complications that may significantly affect the life trajectory of those undergoing PCa treatment. Of these, hospitalization, the need for urologic, rectoanal, and other major surgical procedures, and secondary cancers are more common among men treated with RT. Androgen deprivation therapy, frequently co-administered with RT, may additionally contribute to treatment-related morbidity. Technological innovations in surgery and RT have shown inconsistent oncologic and functional benefits.

Conclusions

Owing to underpowered randomized control studies and the selection biases inherent in observational studies, the question of which treatment provides better PCa control cannot be definitively answered now or in the near future. Complications following PCa treatment are relatively common regardless of treatment approach. These include the commonly identified issues of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, and others including hospitalization and invasive procedures to manage complications and secondary malignancies. Population-based outcome studies, rather than clinical trial data, will be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the relative benefits and risks of each therapeutic approach.

Patient Summary

Surgery and radiotherapy are the most common interventions for men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Comparisons of survival after these treatments are limited by various flaws in the relevant studies. Complications are common regardless of the treatment approach.

### Advances in the multimodality management of high-risk prostate cancer [^115yUwkH]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with marked variability in its natural progression and response to therapeutic interventions. It is the most commonly diagnosed visceral cancer of men living in western countries, yet it is life-threatening in only a minority of cases. Thus, appropriate patient selection for treatment based on tumor as well as patient characteristics is essential to achieve optimal outcomes. The combination of early cancer detection and technical improvements in local treatment has led to a reduction in disease burden and an increase in cancer survivorship. However, treatment failure remains common among high-risk cases.

### Summary of the standards, options and recommendations for the management of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer (2001) [^11333GGz]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The type of evidence underlying any ' Standard ', ' Option ' or ' Recommendation ' is indicated using a classification developed by the FNCLCC based on previously published models. The level of evidence depends not only on the type and quality of the studies reviewed, but also on the concordance of the results (Table 2

Table 2
Definition of level of evidence). When no clear scientific evidence exists, judgement is made according to the professional experience and consensus of the expert group ('expert agreement').

The document containing the Standards, Options and Recommendations was then reviewed by a group of independent experts (see Appendix) and after taking into consideration their comments, the guidelines were validated by the working group.

This is a translation of the summarised version based on the full text (in French) which has been published as a monograph and which is also available on the FNCLCC web site. These clinical practice guidelines will be updated when new evidence becomes available or if there is a new consensus among the experts.

### Measuring health-related quality of life consequences from primary treatment for early-stage prostate cancer [^114VGbNA]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Radical prostatectomy, external radiation therapy, and brachytherapy are all mainstay treatment options for clinically localized prostate cancer. Over time, each of these treatments has been modified so as to maximize percent cancer-free survival while minimizing health-related risks such as urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. With these efforts, there is still not one superior single treatment that is devoid of side effects. Concurrently, efforts have been made to generate validated health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measurement scales to aid in the decision making by both physician and patient. HRQOL measurement scales enable physicians to have informed discussions with patients about potential likelihood of a given set of side effects with the various prostate cancer treatment options. This review will highlight prostate cancer HRQOL outcomes and delineate further areas of study necessary to optimize evidence-based decision making for prostate cancer patients.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114a5coV]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society guideline — shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening emphasizes involving men in whether to initiate and continue testing and states that men must have a basic understanding of the potential benefits of early detection, the strengths and limitations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer. Health care providers can and should play a critical role, and we encourage providers and patients to use prostate cancer screening decision aids; for men who are unable to decide, the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider, who should factor into the decision his or her knowledge of the patient's general health preferences and values. In view of the delay between diagnosis through screening and the expected mortality benefit, we continue to recommend that men whose life expectancy is less than 10 years not pursue prostate cancer early detection, noting that the likelihood of benefit in these men is sufficiently low to be outweighed by the risk of harms from treatment in the near term.

### Will active surveillance for clinically localized prostate cancer survive in the era of individualized medicine? [^116LycCX]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The challenge for the next few years will be to individualize prostate cancer treatment and to determine whether or not a cancer will be lethal based on molecular characteristics at the time of diagnosis. In this view, the need for active treatment would represent a failure of any conservative approach.

### Approach to the patient with high-risk prostate cancer [^1156FyAr]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Men classified as having high-risk prostate cancer warrant treatment because durable outcomes can be achieved. Judicious use of imaging and considerations of risk factors are essential when caring for men with high-risk disease. Radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and androgen deprivation therapy all play pivotal roles in the management of men with high-risk disease, and potentially in men with metastatic disease. The optimal combinations of therapeutic regimens are an evolving area of study and future work looking into therapies for men with high-risk disease will remain critical.

### High-risk prostate cancer: from definition to contemporary management [^1124VE8o]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

High-risk prostate cancer (PCa) is a potentially lethal disease. It is clinically important to identify patients with high-risk PCa early on because they stand to benefit the most from curative therapy. Because of recent advances in PCa management, a multimodal approach may be advantageous.

Objective

Define high-risk PCa, and identify the best diagnostic and treatment patterns for patients with clinically localized and locally advanced disease. A critical analysis of published results following monomodal and/or multimodal therapy for high-risk PCa patients was also performed.

Evidence Acquisition

A review of the literature was performed using the Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases as well as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Evidence Synthesis

High-risk PCa accounts for ≤ 15% of all new diagnoses. Compared with patients with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, patients with high-risk PCa are at increased risk of treatment failure. Unfortunately, no contemporary randomized controlled trials comparing different treatment modalities exist. Evaluation of the results published to date shows that no single treatment can be universally recommended. Most often, a multimodal approach is warranted to optimize patient outcomes.

Conclusions

A significant minority of patients continue to present with high-risk PCa, which remains lethal in some cases. Outcomes following treatment of men with high-risk tumors have not substantially improved over time. However, not all high-risk patients are at the same risk of PCa progression and death. At present, a multimodal approach seems the best way to achieve acceptable outcomes for high-risk PCa patients.

### Targeted prostate cancer ablation: energy options [^1122jTiJ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate cancer screening practices are providing new opportunities for earlier diagnosis, and for identifying smaller tumours with low probability of regional involvement and high likelihood of curability. Simultaneous innovations in tissue ablation technologies offer the potential for effective targeted treatments to discrete areas within the prostate, with negligible side-effects. This review provides an overview of recent data on developing options for prostate cancer ablation, the mechanisms of action of these modalities and results to date of these treatments.

Recent Findings

Advances in diagnostic imaging and image-guided biopsy techniques hold the promise of more accurate localization of cancers within the prostate and a shift in the field of prostate cancer treatment towards an interest in less invasive, localized treatment options. Several energy ablative technologies, currently being tested in clinical trials, are likely to play a greater role in the treatment of patients with smaller, earlier stage tumours.

Summary

Although none of the advances in cancer detection, targeted imaging or focal treatment have yet proven to be game-changing, together, they have contributed to a movement towards less invasive, focal treatment for prostate cancer and a growing awareness of the potential clinical benefits of this form of therapy.

### Focal therapy for prostate cancer: revolution or evolution? [^117KRK7B]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

The face of prostate cancer has been dramatically changed since the late 1980s when PSA was introduced as a clinical screening tool. More men are diagnosed with small foci of cancers instead of the advanced disease evident prior to PSA screening. Treatment options for these smaller tumors consist of expectant management, radiation therapy (brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy) and surgery (cryosurgical ablation and radical prostatectomy). In the highly select patient, cancer specific survival employing any of these treatment options is excellent, however morbidity from these interventions are significant. Thus, the idea of treating only the cancer within the prostate and sparing the non-cancerous tissue in the prostate is quite appealing, yet controversial. Moving forward if we are to embrace the focal treatment of prostate cancer we must: be able to accurately identify index lesions within the prostate, image cancers within the prostate and methodically study the litany of focal therapeutic options available.

European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

APCCC provides a unique opportunity to gather the opinions of recognised prostate cancer experts who meet to discuss and vote on open questions that are not fully addressed by the existing literature and therefore remain topics with weak evidence, including in guidelines. APCCC also identifies priority areas where research should focus to help fill critical gaps in knowledge. In a field that is rapidly changing, such as the management of locally advanced and biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, it is important to recognise that the voting at APCCC reflects what experts currently think based on their experience and knowledge of the literature and existing evidence. For the majority of questions, it was assumed that all diagnostic and therapeutic options were available without restrictions. However, experts with little or no experience with newer tests and modalities, such as next-generation imaging or genomic classifiers, may hesitate to vote for answers that include such options. As mentioned in our report of the APCCC 2019, expert opinion statements may be criticised, which remains a limitation of a consensus approach. APCCC has worked to address these issues by considerably expanding the number of voting panel members from 61 experts in 2019 to > 105 experts in 2022.

Finally, although this report captures what experts in the field think today, it should be interpreted and integrated into clinical practice with the same scrutiny that any other major paper would receive, and with the knowledge that consensus does not constitute or substitute for evidence.

### Spotlight on prostate cancer: the latest evidence and current controversies [^1128t1kt]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Owing to the heterogeneity of the disease, risk stratification has become an important aspect of screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of prostate cancer. With personalized medicine, we attempt to tailor the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time. Modern management of prostate cancer now includes active surveillance, that is, monitoring the disease and delaying curative intervention until signs of disease progression. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is now more commonly performed than open procedures. Our approach to high-risk disease is multidisciplinary, and we continue to make progress in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer with the advent of new drugs for castration-resistant disease, and finding the most effective sequence in which to administer them. Reports on prostate cancer management and treatment are encouraged and will be welcome in Spotlight on prostate cancer.

### Enzalutamide therapy for advanced prostate cancer: efficacy, resistance and beyond [^115rxCbQ]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion and future perspectives

The introduction of enzalutamide as a second-line hormonal therapy for patients with mCRPC has led to significant improvements in the management of the disease. Due to tumor heterogeneity, the duration of benefit to enzalutamide interventions varies between patients. While some men do respond extremely well and continue treatment for several years, others progress rapidly as a result of treatment resistance. The increasing number of ongoing clinical trials reflects the successful preclinical advances in understanding enzalutamide resistance mechanisms and in discovering novel therapeutic targets to maximize clinical outcome. However, the disease continues to be terminal and current treatment options, including enzalutamide and its alternatives, have only a modest impact on survival, highlighting that many aspects of the disease remain poorly understood. Only by understanding which mechanisms underlie treatment resistance, robust molecular or clinical biomarkers can be developed to guide therapeutic decision-making and to identify patient subpopulations that benefit thereof mostly. That way, well thought-out therapeutic strategies can be designed, comprising optimal patient-tailored therapy sequencing and combination.

### EAU guidelines on prostate cancer. part 1: screening, diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent-update 2013 [^115LLyFF]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The most recent summary of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on prostate cancer (PCa) was published in 2011.

Objective

To present a summary of the 2013 version of the EAU guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent of clinically organ-confined PCa.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature review of the new data emerging from 2011 to 2013 has been performed by the EAU PCa guideline group. The guidelines have been updated, and levels of evidence and grades of recommendation have been added to the text based on a systematic review of the literature, which included a search of online databases and bibliographic reviews.

Evidence Synthesis

A full version of the guidelines is available at the EAU office or online (www.uroweb.org). Current evidence is insufficient to warrant widespread population-based screening by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for PCa. Systematic prostate biopsies under ultrasound guidance and local anesthesia are the preferred diagnostic method. Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy. A biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention, whereas the role of PSA doubling time is controversial. In men with locally advanced PCa for whom local therapy is not mandatory, watchful waiting (WW) is a treatment alternative to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), with equivalent oncologic efficacy. Active treatment is recommended mostly for patients with localized disease and a long life expectancy, with radical prostatectomy (RP) shown to be superior to WW in prospective randomized trials. Nerve-sparing RP is the approach of choice in organ-confined disease, while neoadjuvant ADT provides no improvement in outcome variables. Radiation therapy should be performed with ≥ 74 Gy in low-risk PCa and 78 Gy in intermediate- or high-risk PCa. For locally advanced disease, adjuvant ADT for 3 yr results in superior rates for disease-specific and overall survival and is the treatment of choice. Follow-up after local therapy is largely based on PSA and a disease-specific history, with imaging indicated only when symptoms occur.

Conclusions

Knowledge in the field of PCa is rapidly changing. These EAU guidelines on PCa summarize the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

A summary is presented of the 2013 EAU guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent of clinically organ-confined prostate cancer (PCa). Screening continues to be done on an individual basis, in consultation with a physician. Diagnosis is by prostate biopsy. Active surveillance is an option in low-risk PCa and watchful waiting is an alternative to androgen-deprivation therapy in locally advanced PCa not requiring immediate local treatment. Radical prostatectomy is the only surgical option. Radiation therapy can be external or delivered by way of prostate implants. Treatment follow-up is based on the PSA level.

### Prostate cancer: a dynamic illness with shifting targets [^1149P8tS]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Despite high response rates and palliative clinical benefits, androgen ablation does not cure advanced prostate cancer because of the inevitable emergence of resistant cells. Many new therapies under development for prostate cancer target pathways and molecules that contribute to the growth and survival of these cells. The rational and effective use of targeted therapies to eradicate resistant populations of tumour cells should be grounded on the premise that prostate cancer is a dynamic disease that evolves as it progresses, and that specific molecular determinants mediating sensitivity and resistance may be relevant only during specific states of the disease. Directed approaches must account for this changing dynamic so that clinical outcomes may be improved.

### Patients' perceptions of the negative effects following different prostate cancer treatments and the impact on psychological well-being: a nationwide survey [^117UyPmJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Various treatment options for prostate cancer follow specific guidelines such as the European Association of Urology Prostate Cancer Guidelines and the American Urological Association Guidelines, which are based on the risk classification of the disease. However, the best treatment for long-term survival is still unknown. Specifically, no randomised controlled trial has compared prostatectomy with external beam radiotherapy. Patients usually participate in choosing their own treatments. This choice is important because different treatments can impair different areas of well-being and QoL. Differences in professional opinion concerning the best treatment option might complicate the situation for the patient at diagnosis. Both the prognosis and effect of the treatment on QoL should be considered when choosing a treatment for prostate cancer. Many men with localised prostate cancer do not benefit from definitive treatment (European Association of Urology Prostate Cancer Guidelines), and not all early local or locoregional prostate cancers require active treatment. In addition, the harms and benefits of population PSA screening are currently widely discussed. Screening with PSA detects some early prostate cancers that would never cause significant clinical problems during a man's lifetime. More information is needed to minimise the negative effects of prostate cancer and its treatments.

Using a population-based sample of men with prostate cancer diagnosis, we collected comprehensive information concerning the patient-reported negative effects (i.e. occurrence, perceived level and the perceived bother of the symptoms at any time, 'ever' and 'current') of different prostate cancer treatments 5 years after diagnosis. We also measured patient satisfaction with the outcome of the treatment and their psychological well-being (i.e. psychological symptoms and satisfaction with life) 5 years after diagnosis. The negative effects of the different treatments were compared, and the association among these negative effects, patient satisfaction and well-being was investigated.

### Supportive care needs of men living with prostate cancer in england: a survey [^112zpTQK]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumour malignancy in men. In 2004, 29 406 new cases were diagnosed in England, and comprised 25% of all male cancer diagnoses that year. Fortunately, the 5-year survival rate for this male cancer is encouraging, reflecting the slow growing nature of the disease in many men and its successful treatment in others. Seventy-one per cent of men are alive 5 years after diagnosis.

Various treatment options are available; management of men with prostate cancer is generally determined by their stage of disease, age and comorbidity. Unsurprisingly, men with localised disease have more treatment options, including opportunity for radical treatments including prostatectomy and radiotherapy, than men with locally advanced or metastatic disease. However, there are wide variations in management practices for localised prostate cancer in the United Kingdom, reflecting the lack of consensus over what constitutes best treatment. Different primary treatments for localised treatments typically confer comparative cancer control. Some urologists and oncologists take account of baseline urological and sexual function in optimising treatment options, usually in discussion with the men themselves. Logically, patient experience will be optimised if the enduring side effects associated with the various treatments, and consequential supportive care needs, are also taken into account.

### Consensus on the screening, staging, treatment, and surveillance of localized, recurrent, and metastatic prostate cancer: the first global prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries [^111CDWUr]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

QUESTIONNAIRE

The questionnaire was developed by a panel of seven experts to provide relevant real-world physician recommendations for nonfrail patients (as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2) and for patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (unless otherwise stated). A total of 321 questions were constructed to investigate (1) screening, (2) diagnosis, (3) staging tools, (4) treatment, and (5) follow-up of PCa and the impact of limited resources on those treatment recommendations by panelists. For some topic, the questions were based on the APCCC 2017. Following each question, there were five to seven answers options including the option to abstain and/or to identify that they felt unqualified to answer. These options allowed for physicians to opt out of questions that they may not contend with in their specific specialty. Questions were designed to include recommendations of therapies or treatments that are approved and available, and no treatment contraindications exist, unless otherwise stated in the question. An answer was deemed to have reached consensus if 75% or more of the full panel selected a particular answer. For the questions referring to an area of limited resources, the clinicians were instructed to consider both cost-effectiveness and access.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113bfzVP]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — risk stratification for clinically localized disease: The NCCN scheme uses a minimum of stage, Gleason grade, and PSA to assign patients to risk groups; these risk groups are used to select options that should be considered and to predict the probability of biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy, and they have been published widely and validated, providing a better basis for treatment recommendations than clinical stage alone. Newer risk classification schemes and tools (imaging, gene expression biomarkers, germline testing) have been shown to outperform NCCN risk groups and improve risk stratification; these tools should not be ordered reflexively and are recommended only when they will have the ability to change management (for example, active surveillance vs. radical treatment). Improved risk stratification can better identify patients who may derive greater or lesser absolute benefit from a given treatment.

### New agents for prostate cancer [^115yvj22]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Given the poor results with currently available therapies, it is imperative that new treatments be developed for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The next generation of therapies will include many novel biologic agents targeted at molecular defects in the cancer cell. Investigating the efficacy and safety of these compounds and evaluating their utility in combination with traditional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy are major goals of prostate cancer clinical research for the next decade.

### Consensus on the screening, staging, treatment, and surveillance of localized, recurrent, and metastatic prostate cancer: the first global prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries [^111yWKFT]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The consensus was developed on the basis of a modified Delphi approach (Fig 1). In a modified Delphi process, questions based on the sections were created and in the first round sent to all panel members. Questions and options for answers were later revised and sent a second time to all panel members, including all inputs received shown in an anonymized fashion, so all the panelists could see every comment from their colleagues. The comments from the second round were included in the third version that was then circulated. After the third round, only critical changes were accepted for the fourth and definitive version of the questions. This process was analogous to the one used for the APCCC 2017. The conference included presentations and debates from participants who reviewed evidence relevant to the above questions. On the last day of the conference, all questions were presented with options for answers in a multiple-choice format. The questions were voted on publicly but anonymously. In some cases, discussions and revoting occurred. Each question had five to seven answer options including two nonanswers (abstain and unqualified to answer). Each question was deemed consensus if 75% or more of the full panel selected a particular answer. The two nonanswers were provided for quality control. Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that for the specific recommendation (type of surgery, type of radiation therapy, and drug), therapies are approved and available, no treatment contraindications exist, and no clinical trial is currently ongoing. If consensus is not achieved, then the Steering Committee may opt to leave a clinical question unanswered and state, "Consensus could not be achieved". All the questions can be accessed in the Data Supplement. For the questions that refer to an area of limited resources, the recommendations consider cost-effectiveness and the possible therapies with easier access. In addition, recommendations are for nonfrail patients and for patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (unless stated otherwise). Their answers are annotated and discussed in the following manuscripts that address screening, diagnosis, and staging tools, and treatments for the topics are stated in Table 1.

### Prostate cancer chemotherapy in the era of targeted therapy [^1172mE16]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men accounting for around 24% of all male cancers in United Kingdom. The role of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting is still unclear despite considerable progress in this area. Chemotherapy for advanced prostate cancer has become the standard of care, however options of treatment following taxotere failure are still limited. This review summarizes recent advances in chemotherapy treatment options for early as well as advanced prostate cancer.

### Radiation therapy summary of the AUA / ASTRO guideline on clinically localized prostate cancer [^115LxB6u]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our purpose was to develop a summary of recommendations regarding the management of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer based on the American Urologic Association/ ASTRO Guideline on Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.

Methods

The American Urologic Association and ASTRO convened a multidisciplinary, expert panel to develop recommendations based on a systematic literature review using an a priori defined consensus-building methodology. The topics covered were risk assessment, staging, risk-based management, principles of management including active surveillance, surgery, radiation, and follow-up after treatment. Presented are recommendations from the guideline most pertinent to radiation oncologists with an additional statement on health equity, diversity, and inclusion related to guideline panel composition and the topic of clinically localized prostate cancer.

Summary

Staging, risk assessment, and management options in prostate cancer have advanced over the last decade and significantly affect shared decision-making for treatment management. Current advancements and controversies discussed to guide staging, risk assessment, and treatment recommendations include the use of advanced imaging and tumor genomic profiling. An essential active surveillance strategy includes prostate-specific antigen monitoring and periodic digital rectal examination with changes triggering magnetic resonance imaging and possible biopsy thereafter and histologic progression or greater tumor volume prompting consideration of definitive local treatment. The panel recommends against routine use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for patients with prostate cancer after prostatectomy with negative nodes and an undetectable prostate-specific antigen, while acknowledging that patients at highest risk of recurrence were relatively poorly represented in the 3 largest randomized trials comparing adjuvant RT to early salvage and that a role may exist for adjuvant RT in selected patients at highest risk. RT for clinically localized prostate cancer has evolved rapidly, with new trial results, therapeutic combinations, and technological advances. The recommendation of moderately hypofractionated RT has not changed, and the updated guideline incorporates a conditional recommendation for the use of ultrahypofractionated treatment. Health disparities and inequities exist in the management of clinically localized prostate cancer across the continuum of care that can influence guideline concordance.

Quality of life and shared decision-making in localized prostate cancer — treatments "have risks and side effects that must be considered in the context of the risk posed by the disease". Baseline urinary, sexual, and bowel function are "strongly associated with functional outcomes among patients undergoing treatment", so "it is important to measure baseline disease-specific function (urinary, sexual, and bowel function), preferably using a standardized patient-reported outcomes instrument (eg, EPIC-26)". Shared decision-making "should include an explanation of the potential benefits and potential harms of each option". The provider "should explain the likelihood of cure, recurrence, disease progression, and disease-specific mortality" and the clinician "should discuss the side effects of each treatment and predicted impact on quality of life, including urinary, sexual, and bowel function". "Patient preferences should be elicited and should be incorporated into the disease management decision". "Consider geriatric assessment" with "tools to aid optimal assessment and management of disease in older adults". "Refer to the NCCN Distress Thermometer and Problem List, which includes social determinants of health" and "See NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management (DIS-A)".

### Androgen deprivation and immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer [^114EFa1H]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common newly diagnosed malignancy in men, and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The primary treatment for recurrent prostate cancer is androgen deprivation, and this therapy is typically continued lifelong for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Androgens and androgen deprivation have profound effects on the immune system, a finding that has become more appreciated in an era where immune-based treatments for cancer are being increasingly explored. Preclinical studies suggest that androgen deprivation could potentially positively or negatively affect the use of approved immunotherapies, or those that are being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the different types of androgen deprivation treatments used in the management of prostate cancer, discuss their effects on prostate tumors and the immune system and how they are being explored in combination with immunotherapy. Finally, we address some of the critical questions in the field that must be answered to identify the best approaches to combine androgen deprivation with immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer. report from the 2024 advanced prostate cancer consensus conference (APCCC) [^116BEAfp]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Innovations have improved outcomes in advanced prostate cancer (PC). Nonetheless, we continue to lack high-level evidence on a variety of topics that greatly impact daily practice. The 2024 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) surveyed experts on key questions in clinical management in order to supplement evidence-based guidelines. Here we present voting results for questions from APCCC 2024.

Methods

Before the conference, a panel of 120 international PC experts used a modified Delphi process to develop 183 multiple-choice consensus questions on eight different topics. Before the conference, these questions were administered via a web-based survey to the voting panel members ("panellists").

Key Findings and Limitations

Consensus was a priori defined as ≥ 75% agreement, with strong consensus defined as ≥ 90% agreement. The voting results show varying degrees of consensus, as discussed in this article and detailed in the Supplementary material. These findings do not include a formal literature review or meta-analysis.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The voting results can help physicians and patients navigate controversial areas of clinical management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting. The findings can also help funders and policymakers in prioritising areas for future research. Diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised on the basis of patient and cancer characteristics, and should incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence, guidelines, and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is always strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2024 once again identified important gaps (areas of nonconsensus) that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials.

### A comment on the International Society of Geriatric Oncology guidelines: evidence-based advice for the clinical setting [^1142ZfGd]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Largely a disease of older men, prostate cancer is likely to become a growing burden in the developed world as the population ages and overall life expectancy increases. Furthermore, prostate cancer management in older men is not optimal, reflecting the lack of training dedicated to senior adults in fellowship programs and the lack of specific guidelines to manage senior adults. The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) convened a multidisciplinary Prostate Cancer Working Group to review the evidence base and provide advice on the management of the disease in senior age groups. The Working Group reported that advancing age, by itself, is not a reliable guide to treatment decision making for men with either localized or advanced prostate cancer. Instead, the SIOG guidelines advise health care teams to assess the patient's underlying health status, which is largely dictated by associated comorbid conditions, but also by dependency in activities of daily living and nutritional status, and to use the findings to categorize the individual into one of four groups: healthy, vulnerable, frail, or terminally ill. The guidelines recommend that a patient categorized as healthy or vulnerable (i.e., with reversible problems following geriatric intervention) should receive the same approach to treatment as a younger patient. Frail patients should be managed using adapted treatment strategies, and the terminally ill should receive symptomatic/palliative care only. The guidelines may have ongoing relevance as the treatment options for prostate cancer expand.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer. part I: intermediate-/ high-risk and locally advanced disease, biochemical relapse, and side effects of hormonal treatment: report of the advanced prostate cancer consensus conference 2022 [^111PZ8VQ]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Innovations in imaging and molecular characterisation and the evolution of new therapies have improved outcomes in advanced prostate cancer. Nonetheless, we continue to lack high-level evidence on a variety of clinical topics that greatly impact daily practice. To supplement evidence-based guidelines, the 2022 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC 2022) surveyed experts about key dilemmas in clinical management.

Objective

To present consensus voting results for select questions from APCCC 2022.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Before the conference, a panel of 117 international prostate cancer experts used a modified Delphi process to develop 198 multiple-choice consensus questions on (1) intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, (2) biochemical recurrence after local treatment, (3) side effects from hormonal therapies, (4) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, (5) nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, (6) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and (7) oligometastatic and oligoprogressive prostate cancer. Before the conference, these questions were administered via a web-based survey to the 105 physician panel members ("panellists") who directly engage in prostate cancer treatment decision-making. Herein, we present results for the 82 questions on topics 1–3.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% agreement, with strong consensus defined as ≥ 90% agreement.

Results and Limitations

The voting results reveal varying degrees of consensus, as is discussed in this article and shown in the detailed results in the Supplementary material. The findings reflect the opinions of an international panel of experts and did not incorporate a formal literature review and meta-analysis.

Conclusions

These voting results by a panel of international experts in advanced prostate cancer can help physicians and patients navigate controversial areas of clinical management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting. The findings can also help funders and policymakers prioritise areas for future research. Diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient and cancer characteristics (disease extent and location, treatment history, comorbidities, and patient preferences) and should incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence, therapeutic guidelines, and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is always strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2022 once again identified important gaps (areas of nonconsensus) that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials.

Patient Summary

The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference aims to share the knowledge of international experts in prostate cancer with health care providers and patients worldwide. At each APCCC, a panel of physician experts vote in response to multiple-choice questions about their clinical opinions and approaches to managing advanced prostate cancer. This report presents voting results for the subset of questions pertaining to intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, biochemical relapse after definitive treatment, advanced (next-generation) imaging, and management of side effects caused by hormonal therapies. The results provide a practical guide to help clinicians and patients discuss treatment options as part of shared multidisciplinary decision-making. The findings may be especially useful when there is little or no high-level evidence to guide treatment decisions.

### Focal therapy: patients, interventions, and outcomes – a report from a consensus meeting [^115B7LQB]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Focal therapy as a treatment option for localized prostate cancer (PCa) is an increasingly popular and rapidly evolving field.

Objective

To gather expert opinion on patient selection, interventions, and meaningful outcome measures for focal therapy in clinical practice and trial design.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Fifteen experts in focal therapy followed a modified two-stage RAND/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Methodology process. All participants independently scored 246 statements prior to rescoring at a face-to-face meeting. The meeting occurred in June 2013 at the Royal Society of Medicine, London, supported by the Wellcome Trust and the UK Department of Health.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Agreement, disagreement, or uncertainty were calculated as the median panel score. Consensus was derived from the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry level.

Results and Limitations

Of 246 statements, 154 (63%) reached consensus. Items of agreement included the following: patients with intermediate risk and patients with unifocal and multifocal PCa are eligible for focal treatment; magnetic resonance imaging-targeted or template-mapping biopsy should be used to plan treatment; planned treatment margins should be 5mm from the known tumor; prostate volume or age should not be a primary determinant of eligibility; foci of indolent cancer can be left untreated when treating the dominant index lesion; histologic outcomes should be defined by targeted biopsy at 1 yr; residual disease in the treated area of ≤ 3 mm of Gleason 3+3 did not need further treatment; and focal retreatment rates of ≤ 20% should be considered clinically acceptable but subsequent whole-gland therapy deemed a failure of focal therapy. All statements are expert opinion and therefore constitute level 5 evidence and may not reflect wider clinical consensus.

Conclusions

The landscape of PCa treatment is rapidly evolving with new treatment technologies. This consensus meeting provides guidance to clinicians on current expert thinking in the field of focal therapy.

Patient Summary

In this report we present expert opinion on patient selection, interventions, and meaningful outcomes for clinicians working in focal therapy for prostate cancer.

Low-risk prostate cancer — management prioritizes active surveillance, as the guideline states, "For patients with low-risk prostate cancer, clinicians should recommend active surveillance as the preferred management option. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)", with intent "to maintain patients' QOL by deferring or delaying definitive treatment… while simultaneously maintaining the potential to implement definitive treatment with curative intent should this become necessary"; supporting data from the ProtecT trial randomized 1,643 patients to surgery, radiation therapy, or active surveillance, with baseline characteristics including 77% Gleason score 6, 76% clinical stage T1c, and approximately two-thirds low-risk, and all-cause mortality incidences of 10.1, 10.3, and 10.9 per 1,000 person-years for radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and active monitoring, respectively (P = 0.87).

### Immunotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer: current and emerging treatment options [^111wMGrE]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment. Prostate cancer has an immunosuppressive microenvironment and a low tumor mutation burden, resulting in low neoantigen expression. The consensus was that immunotherapy would be less effective in prostate cancer. However, recent studies have reported that prostate cancer does have a high number of DNA damage and repair gene defects. Immunotherapies that have been tested in prostate cancer so far have been mainly vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors. A combination of genomically targeted therapies, with approaches to alleviate immune response and thereby make the tumor microenvironment immunologically hot, is promising.

TREATMENT

Curative (radical‐intent) treatment

The overall management of localized prostate cancer is based on risk stratification (Figure 2). When treatment, rather than surveillance, is indicated, individuals should see both a urologic surgeon and a radiation oncologist to discuss the benefits and risks of each suitable treatment modality. Alternatively, for men in whom the cancer is unlikely to become symptomatic or who need treatment during their natural lifespan, watchful waiting can be chosen to avoid treatment in those with a short prognosis (< 5 years).

Active surveillance

Active surveillance refers to a policy of close monitoring with low‐risk or intermediate‐risk disease to defer or avoid curative treatment, balancing cancer control and urinary, bowel, or sexual toxicities. The aim of active surveillance is to detect progression to a higher risk cancer for which radical treatment can be offered. This approach was established in the 1990s after the indolent natural history of many PSA‐detected prostate cancers was recognized. Early classification systems identifying patients suitable for surveillance were developed.

Prospective studies with predefined eligibility criteria in patients with low‐grade disease, based on the studies by Epstein et al.or D'Amico et al.were reported subsequently in the 2000s demonstrating the feasibility of active surveillance. The follow‐up protocol included PSA testing (at three to 12‐month intervals), DRE (six to 12‐month intervals), a confirmatory biopsy within one year, and follow‐up biopsies at intervals of one to three years. Further evidence came from three clinical trials in the 2010s. A meta‐analysis reported only eight prostate cancer‐related deaths and five instances of metastasis during 24,981 person‐years of follow‐up in 7627 men from 26 active surveillance cohorts.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111mGjS8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer M0 biochemical recurrence — timing and selection for early versus delayed ADT — Early ADT is acceptable, but an alternative is close observation until progression of cancer, at which time appropriate therapeutic options may be considered. Earlier ADT may be better than delayed therapy, although the definitions of early and late remain controversial. The Panel believes that the benefit of early ADT is uncertain and must be balanced against the risk of ADT side effects. Patients with an elevated PSA and/or a shorter PSADT (rapid PSA velocity) and an otherwise long life expectancy should be encouraged to consider ADT earlier, and patients who opt for ADT should consider the intermittent approach. The timing of ADT initiation should be individualized according to PSA velocity, patient anxiety, and potential side effects; patients with shorter PSADT or rapid PSA velocity and long life expectancy may be encouraged to consider early ADT, whereas patients with prolonged PSADTs who are older are excellent candidates for observation.

### Consensus on prostate cancer treatment of localized disease with very low, low, and intermediate risk: a report from the first prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries (PCCCDC) [^113jzzpw]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A group of international urology and medical oncology experts developed and completed a survey on prostate cancer (PCa) in developing countries. The results are reviewed and summarized, and recommendations on consensus statements for very low-, low-, and intermediate-risk PCa focused on developing countries were developed.

Methods

A panel of experts developed more than 300 survey questions of which 66 questions concern the principal areas of interest of this paper: very low, low, and intermediate risk of PCa in developing countries. A larger panel of 99 international multidisciplinary cancer experts voted on these questions to create the recommendations for treatment and follow-up for very low-, low-, and intermediate-risk PCa in areas of limited resources discussed in this manuscript.

Results

The panel voted publicly but anonymously on the predefined questions. Each question was deemed consensus if 75% or more of the full panel had selected a particular answer. These answers are based on panelist opinion not a literature review or meta-analysis. For questions that refer to an area of limited resources, the recommendations consider cost-effectiveness and the possible therapies with easier and greater access. Each question had five to seven relevant answers including two nonanswers. The results were tabulated in real time.

Conclusion

The voting results and recommendations presented in this document can be used by physicians to support management for very low, low, and intermediate risk of PCa in areas of limited resources. Individual clinical decision making should be supported by available data; however, as guidelines for treatment for very low, low, and intermediate risk of PCa in developing countries have not been developed, this document will serve as a point of reference when confronted with this disease.

### Reprint of: morphologic spectrum of treatment-related changes in prostate tissue and prostate cancer: an updated review [^1156qmk2]. Human Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

A wide range of treatment options are available to patients with prostate cancer. Some treatments are standard (currently used) while some are emerging therapies. Androgen deprivation therapy is typically reserved for localized or metastatic prostate cancer not amenable to surgery. Radiation therapy may be offered to individuals for local therapy with curative intent in low- or intermediate-risk disease that may have a high probability of progression on active surveillance or where surgery is not suitable. Focal therapy/ablation treatment is an alternative approach for those who prefer to avoid radical prostatectomy for localized disease of low- or intermediate-risk or as salvage therapy after failed radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy remain under investigation and are currently used for androgen-independent disease or hormone-refractory prostate cancer; however, a better understanding of therapeutic efficacy is needed. Histopathologic changes observed in benign and malignant prostate tissue induced by hormonal therapies and radiation therapy are well described, whereas treatment-related effects secondary to novel therapies continue to be documented although their clinical significance is not absolutely clear. An informed and accurate evaluation of post-treatment prostate specimens requires pathologists with diagnostic acumen and knowledge relating to the histopathologic spectrum associated with each treatment option. In situations when clinical history is lacking, but morphologic features are suggestive of prior treatment, pathologists are encouraged to consult clinical colleagues regarding prior treatment history including details of when treatment was initiated and duration of therapy. This review aims to provide a concise update of current and emerging therapies for prostate cancer, histologic alterations and recommendations on Gleason grading.

Nearly three-quarters of a million American men who have been treated with prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy experience an increasing prostate-specific antigen level known as biochemical recurrence. Although androgen-deprivation therapy remains a reasonable option for some men with biochemical recurrence, deferring androgen ablation or offering nonhormonal therapies may be appropriate in patients in whom the risk of clinical or metastatic progression and prostate cancer-specific death is low. A risk-stratified approach informed by the patient's prostate-specific antigen kinetics, comorbidities, and personal preferences is recommended to determine the best management approach.

### Gene therapy for prostate cancer: current strategies and new cell-based approaches [^11614UKU]. The Prostate (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in adult males in the Western world. It accounts for one in ten cancer cases and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, after lung cancer. A number of curative treatments are available for patients with localized prostate cancer such as radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. However, a proportion of these men will develop progressive disease, and some will present de novo with advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, which is amenable to palliation only with androgen-withdrawal therapy. Most of these patients will eventually develop hormone refractory disease which is incurable, and for whom gene therapy, if feasible may develop as an alternative treatment option. In this review we discuss the gene therapy vectors and strategies that are currently in use, new cell-based approaches, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and review the potential or proven pre-clinical and clinical efficacy in prostate cancer models/patients.

### Successful external validation of a model to predict other cause mortality in localized prostate cancer [^111FmjVW]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Life expectancy plays an important role when determining appropriate treatment options for prostate cancer patients. The slow growing nature of the disease complicates treatment decisions because some patients, such as those who are older or who have significant comorbidity, should not be candidates for invasive procedures such as radical prostatectomy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends active surveillance or observation as an alternative treatment option for managing prostate cancer in patients who meet specific guidelines based on tumor characteristics and life expectancy. However, the guidelines make questionable recommendations on how clinicians should estimate life expectancy for prostate cancer patients. The current advice is to adjust the Social Security Administration tables by adding 50% for patients in the top quartile and subtracting 50% for patients in the lowest quartile of health. This is a problematic approach for two reasons. First, the determination of a patient's health quartile is left up to the subjective judgment of the clinician, an approach that is not validated. Second, the method results in some unusual recommendations, such as surgery being an option for 25% of 80-year-olds with low risk cancer: life expectancy for an 80-year-old is 8 years; add 50% for patients in the top quartile of health gives 12 years; and surgery is included as a possibility for patients with a life expectancy of 10 years or more.

### Heterogeneity in high-risk prostate cancer treated with high-dose radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy [^115wfCPc]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Numerous definitions of high-risk prostate cancer exist. Lack of clarity and consensus on a single precise definition represents a potential barrier for patient-specific counselling and comparative assessment of different treatment modalities.

The optimal treatment for men with high-risk disease remains debatable, although treatment options include surgery, radiation, and/or ADT. Currently regardless of the treatment used, there is significant heterogeneity in outcomes from high-risk prostate cancer. One potential way to overcome this heterogenity, is by defining high risk by adding several high-risk factors.

This study sought to report on the outcomes of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated on prospective clinical trials. Numerous randomized trials have established the combination of EBRT and ADT as one of the standards of care for treating high- risk prostate cancer. The optimal duration of hormone therapy remains unknown. However, many trials have shown superior outcomes with a longer duration of ADT. The majority of these earlier clinical trials establishing the value of ADT, used suboptimal radiation doses, typically in the order of 70 Gy. Currently, delivery of high-dose EBRT in high-risk prostate cancer is standard of care.

### Clinically localized prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO guideline, part I: introduction, risk assessment, staging, and risk-based management [^117CFhS7]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Localized prostate cancer shared decision-making (SDM) — components for treatment selection include informing patients about the severity of their cancer (risk level), assessing patients' relevant comorbidities and life expectancy, informing patients about the likelihood of cure, recurrence, and other oncologic endpoints of each management strategy/treatment option (ideally using a risk calculator or nomogram), assessing patients' baseline disease-specific function and the value or utility they place on each (ideally using standardized instruments, with or without decision aids), and informing patients about their likelihood of specific short- and long-term side effects of each management strategy/treatment option.

### Consensus on prostate cancer treatment of localized disease with very low, low, and intermediate risk: a report from the first prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries (PCCCDC) [^115UVRTb]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

In managing PCa, the first step is determining whether treatment is necessary. PCa, especially low-grade tumors, has slow growth rates and often does not require treatment, particularly in older patients with comorbidities that will limit the life expectancy to 10 additional years or less. Active surveillance (AS) is recommended for low-risk cases.

AS is based on the premise that a patient population exists that may not benefit from primary treatment of their PCa and has two goals: (1) to provide definitive treatment for men with localized cancers that are likely to progress and (2) to reduce the risk of treatment‐related complications for men with cancers that are not likely to progress. Conceptually, this form of treatment was developed because of concerns about overtreatment and overdiagnosis of PCa given that patients diagnosed with PCa are more likely to die of non-PCa causes and may be unnecessarily exposed to treatment‐related morbidity with limited long‐term survival advantage. For men with low-risk disease and favorable type of intermediate-risk disease, AS may be the best strategy for a noninvasive management protocol.

Biochemical recurrence without metastatic disease after exhaustion of local treatment options — treatment recommendations specify that for patients with a rising PSA after failure of local therapy and no demonstrated metastatic disease by imaging, clinicians should offer observation or clinical trial enrollment (Clinical Principle). ADT should not be routinely initiated in this population (Expert Opinion). However, if ADT is initiated in the absence of metastatic disease, intermittent ADT may be offered in lieu of continuous ADT (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B).

### Enzalutamide therapy for advanced prostate cancer: efficacy, resistance and beyond [^114vZ1sP]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The androgen receptor drives the growth of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This has led to the development of multiple novel drugs targeting this hormone-regulated transcription factor, such as enzalutamide – a potent androgen receptor antagonist. Despite the plethora of possible treatment options, the absolute survival benefit of each treatment separately is limited to a few months. Therefore, current research efforts are directed to determine the optimal sequence of therapies, discover novel drugs effective in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and define patient subpopulations that ultimately benefit from these treatments. Molecular studies provide evidence on which pathways mediate treatment resistance and may lead to improved treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This review provides, firstly a concise overview of the clinical development, use and effectiveness of enzalutamide in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, secondly it describes translational research addressing enzalutamide response vs resistance and lastly highlights novel potential treatment strategies in the enzalutamide-resistant setting.

### Current challenges in prostate cancer: an interview with prostate cancer UK [^111Bt3GW]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Full interview: edited transcript

1. What are the current challenges in prostate cancer research and policy, and why is it important to address them?

Iain Frame (IF): I think that there are three current challenges in prostate cancer research. The first is risk assessment – assessing a man's risk of developing prostate cancer during his lifetime. The second is differential diagnosis and prognosis of aggressive versus non-aggressive cancer. The third is developing new treatments for advanced disease, but also working out how best to use existing treatments for optimal effect. These three areas are important because they are the three key areas that affect the outcome of a man's diagnosis of having prostate cancer.

Sarah Cant (SC): I think there are quite a few challenges across prostate cancer, both for men with the disease and for the clinicians who are treating them. If we go from the start of the patient journey, the first issue is whether a man should have a test for prostate cancer. As I'm sure most people know, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is not very accurate; it indicates that there is a problem with the prostate, it does not determine whether cancer is present. PSA testing leads to a number of other diagnostic techniques that can say whether a man has cancer, but not necessarily how aggressive it will be, and may lead to a lot of men having treatment that they may not have needed, for a cancer that may not have harmed them.

So men are faced with the decision of whether or not to have an inaccurate test in the first place. In fact, a lot of men don't even know that they may be at risk for prostate cancer. There is quite low awareness of the disease amongst certain groups. For example, men from a black Afro-Caribbean ethnicity or with a family history of the disease may be at high risk. That is the first step: understanding whether or not a man is at high risk of the disease, whether or not he should have the test, and then what the implications are of being diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Then there are questions such as, should prostate cancer be treated? What treatment should a man have; what should he choose? What are the side effects? What are the impacts of particular treatments?

The next question is whether that treatment – and the support for any associated side effects – is actually available to a particular patient where he lives.

### Treatment… [^111iXjAv]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for people with prostate cancer.
- The following types of treatment are used:

- Watchful waiting or active surveillance
- Surgery
- Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy
- Hormone therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Targeted therapy
- Immunotherapy
- Bisphosphonate therapy
- There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical. trials.
- Cryosurgery
- High-intensity focused ultrasound therapy
- Proton beam radiation therapy
- Photodynamic therapy
- Treatment for prostate cancer may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up care may be needed. In some cases, the nerves that control penile erection can be saved with nerve-sparing surgery.

However, this may not be possible in men with large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves. Possible problems after prostate cancer surgery include: The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical therapy are used to treat prostate cancer. Men treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of having bladder and/or gastrointestinal cancer. Radiation therapy can cause impotence and urinary problems that may get worse with age. Hormone therapy for prostate cancer may include:

- Abiraterone acetate can prevent prostate cancer cells from making androgens. It is used in men with advanced prostate cancer that has not gotten better with other hormone therapy. It is also used in men with high-risk prostate cancer that has improved with treatments that lower hormone levels.
- Orchiectomy is a surgical procedure to remove one or both testicles, the main source of male hormones, such as testosterone, to decrease the amount of hormone being made. High-intensity focused ultrasound therapy High-intensity focused ultrasound therapy is a treatment that uses ultrasound to destroy cancer cells. To treat prostate cancer, an endorectal probe is used to make the sound waves. Proton beam radiation therapy Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.

### Prostate cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116CEdX8]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The 5-year relative survival rate for men diagnosed in the United States from 2014 to 2020 with local or regional disease was greater than 99%, and the rate for distant disease was 37%; a 97% survival rate was observed for all stages combined. The approach to treatment is influenced by age and coexisting medical problems. Side effects of various forms of treatment should be considered in selecting appropriate management. There is evidence that, over time, pathologists have tended to award higher Gleason scores to the same histological patterns, a phenomenon sometimes termed. 23, 24] The contemporary Gleason score readings were an average of 0. 85 points higher than the same slides read a decade earlier. As a result, Gleason-score standardized prostate cancer mortality rates for these men were artifactually improved from 2. 08 to

1. 50 deaths per 100-person years — a 28% decrease even though overall outcomes were unchanged.

Extent of tumor When the cancer is confined to the prostate gland, long-term prognosis is excellent. Locally advanced cancer is not usually curable, but 5-year survival is still very good. If prostate cancer has spread to distant organs, current therapy will not cure it. Median survival is usually 1 to 3 years, and most of these patients will die of prostate cancer. Even in this group of patients, indolent clinical courses lasting for many years may be observed. Preliminary data from a retrospective cohort of 8, 669 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy suggested that short posttreatment PSA doubling time fulfills some criteria as a surrogate end point for all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality after surgery or radiation therapy.

Likewise, a retrospective analysis showed PSA declines of 20% to 40% at 3 months and 30% or more at 2 months after initiation of chemotherapy for hormone-independent prostate cancer, and fulfilled several criteria of surrogacy for overall survival. These observations should be independently confirmed in prospective study designs and may not apply to patients treated with hormonal therapy. In addition, there are no standardized criteria of surrogacy or standardized cut points for adequacy of surrogate end points, even in prospective trials.
