## Question

Is a history of pulmonary embolism contraindication for spravato treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a history of pulmonary embolism is a contraindication to intranasal esketamine (Spravato). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled contraindications for Spravato. Then, I should verify whether venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism, is listed among them. Next, I will examine the key safety concern that might intersect with PE — namely, blood pressure effects — and assess whether a remote history of PE meaningfully changes that risk. After that, I should review guideline context for PE management to ensure there isn't a hidden interaction or precaution. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated recommendation and confirm monitoring requirements under REMS.

> Let me first confirm the labeled contraindications. The FDA prescribing information lists three absolute contraindications: aneurysmal vascular disease or arteriovenous malformation, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, and hypersensitivity to esketamine, ketamine, or excipients; venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism, is not included on that list, so a history of PE is not a labeled contraindication to Spravato.

> Wait, let me verify the key safety signal that could intersect with PE. Spravato causes transient increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure that peak around 40 minutes and can persist up to 4 hours; clinically meaningful increases (≥ 40 mmHg systolic and/or ≥ 25 mmHg diastolic) occur in a minority of patients, and the label advises careful assessment in those with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions and mandates pre-dose BP assessment and at least 2 hours of post-dose monitoring under REMS [^1178Gpm6] [^112p2928].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does a remote history of PE inherently make a BP rise unsafe? I should confirm the pathophysiology. PE is primarily a venous thrombotic disease with acute hemodynamic consequences during the event; once stabilized and adequately anticoagulated, the long-term hemodynamic risk profile is generally not one of arterial hypertension or aneurysmal rupture risk, which are the scenarios explicitly contraindicated with Spravato; thus, a remote, stable PE history does not create the same hazard profile as aneurysmal disease or intracerebral hemorrhage, though individualized cardiovascular risk assessment remains prudent [^113HNSso].

> I need to check whether any guideline or review lists PE as a formal contraindication to esketamine. Contemporary reviews and expert guidance emphasize that the main safety exclusions are conditions where a BP increase would be hazardous (e.g., aneurysmal disease, AVM, intracerebral hemorrhage) and hypersensitivity; they do not cite prior PE as a contraindication, reinforcing that PE history should be managed with caution rather than exclusion [^116r9vG8].

> Next, I should review practical risk mitigation. Let me think about baseline BP thresholds and monitoring cadence. The label recommends delaying treatment if baseline BP is elevated (for example, > 140/90 mmHg), reassessing at about 40 minutes post-dose, and extending observation beyond 2 hours if BP remains high or the patient is symptomatic; in patients with a history of PE, I would ensure stable cardiopulmonary status, confirm adequate anticoagulation, and consider tighter BP targets and prolonged monitoring if there is residual right ventricular dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension, even though these are not formal label contraindications [^114w73cR] [^1178Gpm6].

> But wait, what if the PE was recent or complicated by chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension or ongoing right heart strain? I should double-check that such scenarios warrant extra caution rather than a categorical no. In patients with active cardiopulmonary instability or uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension, the hemodynamic reserve may be limited, so a transient pressor effect could theoretically worsen symptoms; in those cases, coordination with cardiology/pulmonology, optimization of comorbidities, and a conservative monitoring plan are reasonable, yet still not a labeled absolute contraindication to Spravato [^1178Gpm6] [^113HNSso].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure I'm not missing anything. A history of pulmonary embolism is not a contraindication to intranasal esketamine; treatment can proceed with standard REMS-compliant monitoring, pre-dose BP assessment, and at least 2 hours of supervised observation, with individualized adjustments for residual cardiopulmonary disease or elevated baseline BP, and with readiness to delay or extend monitoring if clinically indicated [^113HNSso] [^114w73cR].

---

A history of pulmonary embolism is **not a contraindication** to Spravato (esketamine) [^113HNSso]. However, because Spravato can cause transient increases in blood pressure [^1178Gpm6], patients with a history of PE should have their **blood pressure carefully monitored** during treatment [^114w73cR]. If baseline blood pressure is elevated (> 140/90 mmHg), consider delaying or adjusting the dose, and monitor for at least 2 hours post-dose [^1178Gpm6]. Spravato is contraindicated only in patients with aneurysmal vascular disease, arteriovenous malformation, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, or hypersensitivity to esketamine or ketamine [^113HNSso].

---

## Clinical considerations for patients with a history of pulmonary embolism

Patients with a history of PE may have **increased cardiovascular risk**, including recurrent thromboembolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) [^113CFVqY]. Therefore, careful evaluation and monitoring are essential when considering Spravato therapy.

---

## Blood pressure monitoring and management

Spravato can cause **transient increases in blood pressure** [^1178Gpm6], peaking around 40 minutes post-dose and lasting approximately 4 hours. Given the potential cardiovascular strain in patients with a history of PE, the following precautions are recommended:

- **Baseline blood pressure assessment**: Measure blood pressure prior to each Spravato administration [^114w73cR].

- **Delayed administration**: If baseline blood pressure is elevated (> 140/90 mmHg), consider delaying Spravato administration and reassess the risk-benefit balance [^1178Gpm6].

- **Post-dose monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure for at least 2 hours after administration, with particular attention to readings around 40 minutes post-dose [^1178Gpm6].

- **Symptom monitoring**: Watch for symptoms of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, visual disturbances, seizures, or altered consciousness [^1178Gpm6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not list a history of PE as a contraindication** to Spravato therapy [^116r9vG8]. However, they emphasize the importance of individualized risk assessment and close monitoring of cardiovascular parameters during treatment [^1178Gpm6].

---

## Alternative treatments and precautions

If a patient with a history of PE experiences significant cardiovascular instability or uncontrolled hypertension, consider **alternative antidepressant treatments** or additional precautions, such as:

- **Alternative antidepressants**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or bupropion may be considered based on individual patient factors and comorbidities.

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be appropriate alternatives or adjuncts.

- **Enhanced monitoring**: Consider more frequent blood pressure monitoring, ECG assessments, or collaboration with cardiology specialists for high-risk patients.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical consideration** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| History of pulmonary embolism | Not a contraindication to Spravato therapy |
| Baseline blood pressure | - Measure prior to each administration <br/> - Delay if > 140/90 mmHg [^1178Gpm6] |
| Post-dose monitoring | Monitor blood pressure for at least 2 hours after administration [^1178Gpm6] |
| Symptoms of hypertensive crisis | Monitor closely and seek immediate medical attention if present [^1178Gpm6] |
| Alternative treatments | Consider if significant cardiovascular instability or uncontrolled hypertension |

---

A history of pulmonary embolism is **not a contraindication** to Spravato therapy [^notfound]. However, careful cardiovascular assessment, blood pressure monitoring, and individualized risk management are essential to ensure patient safety and optimize treatment outcomes [^114w73cR].

5.7 Increase in Blood Pressure

SPRAVATO causes increases in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP) at all recommended doses. Increases in BP peak approximately 40 minutes after SPRAVATO administration and last approximately 4 hours [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Approximately 3% to 19% of SPRAVATO-treated patients and 1% to 4% of placebo-treated patients experienced an increase of greater than or equal to 40 mmHg in systolic BP and/or 25 mmHg in diastolic BP in the first 1.5 hours after administration at least once during the first 4 weeks of treatment. A substantial increase in blood pressure could occur after any dose administered even if smaller blood pressure effects were observed with previous administrations. SPRAVATO is contraindicated in patients for whom an increase in BP or intracranial pressure poses a serious risk (e.g., aneurysmal vascular disease, arteriovenous malformation, history of intracerebral hemorrhage) [see Contraindications (4)]. Before prescribing SPRAVATO, patients with other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions should be carefully assessed to determine whether the potential benefits of SPRAVATO outweigh its risks.

Assess BP prior to administration of SPRAVATO. In patients whose BP is elevated prior to SPRAVATO administration (as a general guide: > 140/90 mmHg) a decision to delay SPRAVATO therapy should take into account the balance of benefit and risk in individual patients.

BP should be monitored for at least 2 hours after SPRAVATO administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)]. Measure blood pressure around 40 minutes post-dose and subsequently as clinically warranted until values decline. If BP remains high, promptly seek assistance from practitioners experienced in BP management. Refer patients experiencing symptoms of a hypertensive crisis (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) or hypertensive encephalopathy (e.g., sudden severe headache, visual disturbances, seizures, diminished consciousness or focal neurological deficits) immediately for emergency care.

Closely monitor blood pressure with concomitant use of SPRAVATO with psychostimulants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)].

In patients with history of hypertensive encephalopathy, more intensive monitoring, including more frequent blood pressure and symptom assessment, is warranted because these patients are at increased risk for developing encephalopathy with even small increases in blood pressure.

5.5 SPRAVATO Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

SPRAVATO is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the SPRAVATO REMS because of the risks of serious adverse outcomes from sedation, dissociation, respiratory depression, abuse and misuse [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

Important requirements of the SPRAVATO REMS include the following:

Healthcare settings must be certified in the program and ensure that SPRAVATO is:
– Only dispensed and administered in healthcare settings.
– Patients treated in outpatient settings (e.g. medical offices and clinics) must be enrolled in the program.
– Administered by patients under the direct observation of a healthcare provider and that patients are monitored by a healthcare provider for at least 2 hours after administration of SPRAVATO [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
Pharmacies must be certified in the REMS and must only dispense SPRAVATO to healthcare settings that are certified in the program.

Further information, including a list of certified pharmacies is available at www.SPRAVATOrems.com or 1–855–382–6022.

2.1 Important Considerations Prior to Initiating and During Therapy

SPRAVATO must be administered under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider. A treatment session consists of nasal administration of SPRAVATO and post-administration observation under supervision.

Respiratory Status Assessment During Treatment

Monitor patients for changes in respiratory status for at least 2 hours (including pulse oximetry) at each treatment session [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Blood Pressure Assessment Before and After Treatment

Assess blood pressure prior to dosing with SPRAVATO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
If baseline blood pressure is elevated (e.g., > 140 mmHg systolic, > 90 mmHg diastolic), consider the risks of short term increases in blood pressure and benefit of SPRAVATO treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Do not administer SPRAVATO if an increase in blood pressure or intracranial pressure poses a serious risk [see Contraindications (4)].
After dosing with SPRAVATO, reassess blood pressure at approximately 40 minutes (which corresponds with the Cmax) and subsequently as clinically warranted.
If blood pressure is decreasing and the patient appears clinically stable for at least two hours, the patient may be discharged at the end of the post-dose monitoring period; if not, continue to monitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Food and Liquid Intake Recommendations Prior to Administration

Because some patients may experience nausea and vomiting after administration of SPRAVATO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], advise patients to avoid food for at least 2 hours before administration and to avoid drinking liquids at least 30 minutes prior to administration.

Nasal Corticosteroid or Nasal Decongestant

Patients who require a nasal corticosteroid or nasal decongestant on a dosing day should administer these medications at least 1 hour before SPRAVATO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment-Resistant Depression

The recommended dosage of SPRAVATO for the treatment of TRD in adults as monotherapy or in conjunction with an oral antidepressant is shown in Table 1. Dosage adjustments should be made based on efficacy and tolerability. Evidence of therapeutic benefit should be evaluated at the end of the induction phase to determine need for continued treatment.

5.3 Respiratory Depression

In post marketing experience, respiratory depression was observed with the use of SPRAVATO. In addition, there were rare reports of respiratory arrest [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Because of the risks of respiratory depression, patients must be monitored for changes in respiratory status by a healthcare provider for at least 2 hours (including pulse oximetry) at each treatment session, followed by an assessment to determine when the patient is considered clinically stable and ready to leave the healthcare setting [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

SPRAVATO is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

5.4 Abuse and Misuse

SPRAVATO contains esketamine, a Schedule III controlled substance (CIII), and may be subject to abuse and diversion. Assess each patient's risk for abuse or misuse prior to prescribing SPRAVATO and monitor all patients receiving SPRAVATO for the development of these behaviors or conditions, including drug-seeking behavior, while on therapy. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of SPRAVATO. Individuals with a history of drug abuse or dependence are at greater risk; therefore, use careful consideration prior to treatment of individuals with a history of substance use disorder and monitor for signs of abuse or dependence [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

SPRAVATO is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Dissociation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]
Cognitive Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]
Impaired Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]
Ulcerative or Interstitial Cystitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]
Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In Conjunction with an Oral Antidepressant

SPRAVATO was evaluated for safety in 1709 adults diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] from five Phase 3 studies (3 short-term and 2 long-term studies) and one Phase 2 dose-ranging study. Of all SPRAVATO-treated patients in the completed Phase 3 studies, 479 (30%) received at least 6 months of treatment, and 178 (11%) received at least 12 months of treatment.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Sedation, Dissociation, and Respiratory Depression

Inform patients that SPRAVATO has potential to cause sedation, dissociative symptoms (including perception disturbances), dizziness, vertigo, anxiety, and respiratory depression. Advise patients that they will need to be observed by a healthcare provider until these effects resolve [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Potential for Abuse, Misuse, and Dependence

Advise patients that SPRAVATO is a federally controlled substance because it can be abused or lead to dependence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

SPRAVATO Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

SPRAVATO is available only through a restricted program called the SPRAVATO REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Inform the patient of the following notable requirements:

Patients treated in outpatient healthcare settings (e.g. medical offices and clinics) must be enrolled in the SPRAVATO REMS Program prior to administration.
SPRAVATO must be administered under the direct observation of a healthcare provider.
Patients must be monitored by a healthcare provider for at least 2 hours after administration of SPRAVATO.

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Advise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Increases in Blood Pressure

Advise patients that SPRAVATO can cause increases in blood pressure. Inform patients that after treatment sessions they should be advised that they may need to be observed by a healthcare provider until these effects resolve [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Impaired Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery

Caution patients that SPRAVATO may impair their ability to drive or operate machinery. Instruct patients not to engage in potentially hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery until the next day after a restful sleep. Advise patients that they will need someone to drive them home after each treatment session [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Sedation

Patients are at risk for sedation after administration of SPRAVATO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Dissociation

Patients are at risk for dissociative or perceptual changes after administration of SPRAVATO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Respiratory Depression

Respiratory depression has been observed in postmarketing experience [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Because of the risks of sedation, dissociation, and respiratory depression, patients must be monitored for at least 2 hours at each treatment session, followed by an assessment to determine when the patient is considered clinically stable and ready to leave the healthcare setting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Abuse and Misuse

SPRAVATO has the potential to be abused and misused. Consider the risks and benefits of prescribing SPRAVATO prior to use in patients at higher risk of abuse. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of abuse and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Because of the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from sedation, dissociation, respiratory depression, abuse and misuse, SPRAVATO is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the SPRAVATO REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in pediatric and young adult patients in short-term studies. Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. SPRAVATO is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

5.6 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients (SPRAVATO is not approved in pediatric patients), the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing SPRAVATO and/or the concomitant oral antidepressant, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

Nausea and Vomiting

SPRAVATO can cause nausea and vomiting. Most of these events occurred on the day of dosing and resolved the same day, with the median duration not exceeding 1 hour in most subjects across dosing sessions. Rates of reported nausea and vomiting decreased over time across dosing sessions from the first week of treatment in the short-term studies, as well as over time with long-term treatment. Table 9 presents the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting in a short-term study with patients with TRD.

In studies for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior, patients demonstrated similar incidence and severity of reported nausea and vomiting compared to the TRD study results described above.

Sense of Smell

Sense of smell was assessed over time; no difference was observed between patients treated with SPRAVATO plus oral AD and those treated with placebo nasal spray plus oral AD during the double-blind maintenance phase of Study 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SPRAVATO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Cardiac disorders: bradycardia

Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: respiratory depression (including respiratory arrest)

Vascular disorders: hypotension

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Based on published animal reproduction studies, SPRAVATO may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. However, it is not clear how these animal findings relate to females of reproductive potential treated with the recommended clinical dose. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential during treatment with SPRAVATO.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of SPRAVATO in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled short-term clinical studies exposed to SPRAVATO, (N = 2064), 238 (12%) were 65 years of age and older, and 29 (1%) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in the safety profile were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and patients younger than 65 years of age.

The mean esketamine Cmaxand AUC values were higher in elderly patients compared with younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The efficacy of SPRAVATO for the treatment of TRD in geriatric patients was evaluated in a 4-week, randomized, double-blind study comparing flexibly-dosed intranasal SPRAVATO plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared to intranasal placebo plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant in patients ≥ 65 years of age. SPRAVATO was initiated at 28 mg twice weekly and could be titrated to 56 mg or 84 mg administered twice weekly. At the end of four weeks, there was no statistically significant difference between groups on the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to Week 4 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The mean esketamine AUC and t1/2values were higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment compared to those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. SPRAVATO-treated patients with moderate hepatic impairment may need to be monitored for adverse reactions for a longer period of time.

SPRAVATO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). Use in this population is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder with Acute Suicidal Ideation or Behavior

Administer SPRAVATO in conjunction with an oral antidepressant (AD).

The recommended dosage of SPRAVATO for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior is 84 mg twice per week for 4 weeks. Dosage may be reduced to 56 mg twice per week based on tolerability. After 4 weeks of treatment with SPRAVATO, evidence of therapeutic benefit should be evaluated to determine need for continued treatment. The use of SPRAVATO, in conjunction with an oral antidepressant, beyond 4 weeks has not been systematically evaluated in the treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior.

2.4 Administration Instructions

SPRAVATO is for nasal use only. The nasal spray device delivers a total of 28 mg of esketamine. To prevent loss of medication, do not prime the device before use. Use 2 devices (for a 56 mg dose) or 3 devices (for an 84 mg dose), with a 5-minute rest between use of each device. Follow these administration instructions and read the Instructions for Use before administration:

2.5 Post-Administration Observation

During and after SPRAVATO administration at each treatment session, observe the patient for at least 2 hours until the patient is safe to leave [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.7)]. Before SPRAVATO administration, instruct patients not to engage in potentially hazardous activities, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery, until the next day after a restful sleep [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

2.6 Missed Treatment Session(s)

If a patient misses treatment session(s), provided there is no worsening of their depressive symptoms, the patient should continue the current dosing schedule.

For patients who miss treatment session(s) during maintenance treatment and have worsening of depression symptoms, per clinical judgement, consider returning to the previous dosing schedule (e.g., if doses missed during weekly dosing, revert to twice weekly dosing).

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Personalized use of ketamine and esketamine for treatment-resistant depression [^116r9vG8]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Contraindications and potential safety concerns

In addition to markers of greater response to ketamine and esketamine, treatment selection in TRD should also consider contraindications and safety concerns. In some situations, ketamine and esketamine are contraindicated or their safety has not been well-established and, therefore, considering alternative treatments is appropriate (e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), vagus nerve stimulations (VNS), and optimized oral pharmacological regimens). Contraindications to ketamine and esketamine include two main groups of conditions. The first situation is when an increase in blood pressure would be hazardous (e.g. aneurismal vascular disease, arteriovenous malformation, intracerebral hemorrhage). Importantly, in some of these conditions, ECT may be also pose a significant risk in individuals since the transient seizure may also cause significant increases in blood pressure. Another group of contraindications is hypersensitivity either to ketamine, esketamine or any of the excipients in the formulations.

In addition to contraindications, there are some situations where safety has been not well-established. Despite preliminary reports indicating that ketamine may be safe and effective in psychotic depression, the available data are still limited and most clinical trials exclude participants with psychosis. Therefore, other antidepressant treatments should be initially considered if psychotic features are present. In such patients, oral pharmacological regimens that include antipsychotics are generally recommended. ECT may also be a good option since meta-analyses have indicated that pre-treatment psychotic symptoms are a marker of response to ECT. Similarly, initial evidence suggests that patients with AUD and/or substance use disorder may benefit from ketamine and esketamine. However, their safety and efficacy in participants with severe substance use disorders is limited. In patients with clinically significant comorbid substance use or history, ketamine and esketamine should be initially avoided, and treatment plans should include interventions focused on the alcohol and substance misuse.

Dissociation/Perceptual Changes

SPRAVATO can cause dissociative symptoms (including derealization and depersonalization) and perceptual changes (including distortion of time and space, and illusions). In clinical trials, dissociation was transient and occurred on the day of dosing. Dissociation was evaluated by adverse event reports and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). A CADSS total score of more than 4 indicates the presence of dissociative symptoms, and such an increase to a score of 4 or more occurred in a higher number of patients on SPRAVATO compared to placebo during the short-term TRD studies. Dose-related increases in the incidence of dissociative symptoms (CADSS total score > 4 and change > 0) were observed in a fixed-dose TRD study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Table 7 presents the incidence of dissociation (CADSS total score > 4 and change > 0) in a fixed-dose study with adult patients < 65 years of age with TRD and a flexible-dose study with patients ≥ 65 years of age with TRD.

In studies for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior, patients treated with SPRAVATO plus oral AD also demonstrated a higher number (84%) with dissociation (CADSS total score > 4 and change > 0) compared to patients treated with placebo plus oral AD (16%).

Increase in Blood Pressure

The mean placebo-adjusted increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) over time were about 7 to 10 mmHg in SBP and 4 to 6 mmHg in DBP at 40 minutes post-dose and 2 to 5 mmHg in SBP and 1 to 3 mmHg in DBP at 1.5 hours post-dose in patients with TRD receiving SPRAVATO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Table 8 presents increases in blood pressure in short-term trials with patients < 65 years of age and ≥ 65 years of age with TRD.

In studies for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior, patients treated with SPRAVATO plus oral antidepressants demonstrated similar mean placebo-adjusted increases in SBP and DBP compared to patients with TRD, as well as similar rates of increases to SBP ≥ 180 mmHg or ≥ 40 mmHg increases in SBP, and similar rates of increases to DBP ≥ 110 mmHg or ≥ 25 mmHg increases in DBP, compared to the TRD study results in Table 8.

### All contraindications to thrombolysis for life-threatening pulmonary embolus should be considered relative [^1137M9zX]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) can be fatal; however, timely thrombolytic therapy can be life saving. Guidelines advocate the use of thrombolysis for massive PE in patients with an acceptable bleeding-risk profile. Nonetheless, estimating what constitutes an acceptable bleeding risk in those with life-threatening PE is a clinical challenge, and even contraindications considered 'absolute' may present lesser risk than leaving PE untreated. We discuss the case of a 77-year-old man who received thrombolysis for a massive PE 4 weeks following admission with a significant intracerebral bleed. There was rapid resolution of hypotension and hypoxia and he survived to be discharged home. This case is used to illustrate that no potential therapy should be discounted in patients faced with acute life-threatening PE. Decisions to thrombolyse patients with traditional contraindications-even those considered absolute-must be taken by clinicians able to weigh relative risks.

### Ketamine and esketamine in clinical trials: FDA-approved and emerging indications, trial trends with putative mechanistic explanations [^113mC9Vx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug repurposing, that is, exploring novel uses for known drugs, has gained increasing popularity. Modifying the existing formulation to change a dose and/or an administration route is a possible avenue. The intranasal route of administration is interesting for the delivery of drugs in a broad range of therapeutic areas including pain management and CNS disorders. Intranasally administered drugs are rapidly absorbed due to the rich vasculature of nasal cavity and avoidance of the first‐pass effect can lead to a higher bioavailability, promoting a fast onset of action.

Since its approval by the FDA in 1970, the pharmacological properties of ketamine and its enantiomers were of great interest. Anesthetic effect of both enantiomers was examined in healthy volunteers suggesting that esketamine was more potent compared with arketamine. Vollenweider et al. studied psychotic reactions after esketamine and arketamine infusions in healthy volunteers, including depersonalization and hallucinations. Metabolic changes in the brain after esketamine appeared to be similar to an acute psychotic episode in schizophrenia, whereas arketamine produced no psychotic symptoms but relaxation. The authors suggested arketamine may cause minimal or no acute side effects compared with the (S)‐enantiomer of ketamine. The results of a multicenter trial of esketamine in nasal spray form showed a robust antidepressant effect in patients with TRDand major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide. The growing need for new antidepressant compounds resulted in a number of clinical studies on esketamine while the arketamine remained at the level of nonclinical studies. However, preclinical findings showed it is likely that the (R)‐enantiomer of ketamine contributes to the long‐lasting antidepressant effects of racemic ketamine rather than the esketamine. The first clinical study of arketamine in TRD patients was conducted in 2020. Previous clinical studies of arketamine were aimed at studying its analgesic properties, and metabolic features comparing those to (S)‐enantiomer or the racemic ketamine. Although only two of five phase III trials showed positive results for esketamine, on March 5, 2019, esketamine nasal spray (Spravato®) got approval by the FDA for TRD in conjunction with an oral antidepressant. In December, 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Spravato® in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for patients with TRD.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment

In the double-blind treatment phase of the short-term study in adults (Study 3), the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction was 1% in patients who received SPRAVATO 56 mg and 4% in patients who received SPRAVATO 84 mg compared to 1% for patients who received placebo nasal spray. All of the adverse reactions leading to SPRAVATO discontinuation occurred in single subjects.

Most Common Adverse Reactions

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and at least twice that of placebo nasal spray) were dissociation, nausea, dizziness, headache, anxiety, vomiting, feeling drunk, blood pressure increased, and sedation. Table 4 shows the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with SPRAVATO and greater than patients treated with placebo nasal spray.

Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder with Acute Suicidal Ideation or Behavior

SPRAVATO was evaluated for safety in 262 adults for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with acute suicidal ideation or behavior [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] from two Phase 3 studies (Study 4 and Study 5) and one Phase 2 study. Of all SPRAVATO-treated patients in the completed Phase 3 studies, 184 (81%) received all eight doses over a 4-week treatment period.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment

In short-term studies in adults (pooled Study 4 and Study 5), the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction was 6.2% for patients who received SPRAVATO plus oral AD compared to 3.6% for patients who received placebo nasal spray plus oral AD. Adverse reactions leading to SPRAVATO discontinuation in more than 1 patient were (in order of frequency): dissociation-related events (2.6%), blood pressure increased (0.9%), dizziness-related events (0.9%), nausea (0.9%), and sedation-related events (0.9%).

Most Common Adverse Reactions

The most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with SPRAVATO plus oral AD (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice that of placebo nasal spray plus oral AD) were dissociation, dizziness, sedation, blood pressure increased, hypoesthesia, vomiting, euphoric mood, and vertigo. Table 5 shows the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with SPRAVATO plus oral AD and greater than patients treated with placebo nasal spray plus oral AD.

### The effects of intranasal esketamine on on-road driving performance in patients with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder [^111t6M7V]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a commonly occurring neuropsychiatric condition which affected over 264 million people worldwide in 2017 and is associated with excess mortality with an estimated median years of potential life loss of 10 years. Although several evidence-based pharmacological treatments for MDD are available, up to 50–60% of patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). These patients do not benefit from available antidepressant medications despite an adequate therapeutic dose and duration of therapy. Moreover, most registered antidepressant drugs modulate central monoaminergic neurocircuits and typically are effective after only 4–7 weeks. Together, this illustrates the need to develop antidepressant drugs with novel mechanisms of action and improved efficacy profiles that attain rapid symptomatic relief.

In 2019, nasal esketamine was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and other health authorities worldwide to be used in conjunction with an oral antidepressant for the treatment of TRD in adults. Compared to existing antidepressants esketamine has a different mechanism of action and onset of antidepressant effects occurs as early as 2 h after administration. In the United States, nasal esketamine is also approved for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behaviour. In the European Union, nasal esketamine together with an oral antidepressant is approved as acute short-term treatment, for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in adults with a moderate to severe episode of MDD, which according to clinical judgement constitute a psychiatric emergency (SPRAVATO SmPC).

### The antidepressant effect and safety of non-intranasal esketamine: a systematic review [^115gGs3p]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials

Acute psychiatric adverse events were assessed in one trial, showing a dose-dependent peak at 30 to 40 min after IV infusion started and a return to baseline within 2 h. Psychotomimetic adverse events were assessed in two trials, showing a similar dose-dependent pattern and no differences between esketamine and racemic ketamine groups. Dissociation was the only cited adverse event causing withdrawal (in one patient).

The most common neurological adverse events were dizziness and headache. Rates were comparable between esketamine, racemic ketamine, and placebo groups.

The most common gastrointestinal adverse events were nausea and vomiting. Again, rates were comparable between the three groups.

Vital functions were assessed in two trials. According to, no clinically significant vital sign abnormalities were observed with esketamine, except for one case of transient irregular breathing and one case of transient high blood pressure. According toincreased blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were mild, self-limiting, and equally distributed among the esketamine and ketamine patients.

Other cited adverse events of esketamine were dry mouth (n = 3), nasopharyngitis (n = 2), oropharyngeal pain (n = 2), paresthesia (n = 2), vertigo (n = 2), rash (n = 1), and thrombophlebitis (n = 1). The only reported serious adverse event (cancer) occurred during the post-treatment phase and was considered unrelated to esketamine treatment.

In summary, these results indicate that esketamine elicits dose-dependent and transient acute psychiatric and psychotomimetic adverse events, and transient increased BP and HR. When compared to ketamine, these adverse events were generally found to be similar in frequency and intensity. No treatment-related serious adverse events have occurred, and withdrawal due to adverse events was limited to one case of the 813 patients included in the RCTs. More details are provided in Table 1.

Intranasal esketamine has regulatory approval in the United States and European Union. Intravenous ketamine is often administered off-label as an antidepressant, though no standard operating procedures exist. Repeated administrations and the use of a concurrent standard antidepressant may maintain antidepressant effects of ketamine/esketamine. Possible adverse effects of ketamine and esketamine include psychiatric, cardiovascular, neurologic and genitourinary effects, and the potential for abuse.

Emergency physicians must be prepared to rapidly diagnose and resuscitate patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Certain aspects of PE resuscitation run counter to typical approaches. A specific understanding of the pathophysiology of PE is required to avoid cardiovascular collapse potentially associated with excessive intravenous fluids and positive pressure ventilation. Once PE is diagnosed, rapid risk stratification should be performed and treatment guided by patient risk class. Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of PE treatment, emergency physicians also must understand the indications and contraindications for thrombolysis and should be aware of new therapies and models of care that may improve outcomes.

### Progress in the management of acute pulmonary embolism [^1143qNS1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary embolism is a major contributor to global disease burden worldwide. The 2014 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology, endorsed by the European Respiratory Society, emphasize the need for initial and advanced risk stratification as well as risk-adapted treatment to ensure the highest quality of care. This review summarizes the progress in pulmonary embolism diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment.

Recent Findings

Major advances of the past 12 months include age-related biomarker cutoff levels for optimising pulmonary embolism diagnosis and risk stratification; detection of (isolated) subsegmental pulmonary embolism by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography, raising the question of appropriate treatment in these cases; benefits versus risks of systemic thrombolytic therapy in normotensive patients at intermediate-high risk of an adverse early outcome; catheter-directed reperfusion with low-dose thrombolytics for patients at high bleeding risk; lack of efficacy of retrievable vena cava filters in the prevention of pulmonary embolism recurrence; and specific antidotes for nonvitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants.

Summary

Recent advances in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism now permit, for the first time, the implementation of an integrated risk-adapted approach to the disease such as recommended by the recent European guidelines.

Indications and contraindications to invasive haemodynamic monitoring

Current 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HF state that the CardioMEMS system may be considered to measure and monitor PAP in symptomatic patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction in order to improve clinical outcomes with a class IIb recommendation and a level of evidence B, as based on only the CHAMPION trial. However, the ESC guidelines were published before the results of GUIDE‐HF became available and, similarly, the 2023 ESC guideline focused update was also finalized before MONITOR‐HF was published.

The CardioMEMS HF system represents a significant advance in HF management, offering a tailored treatment for patients with HF. However, it is crucial to consider both medical indications and contraindications, as well as the patient's overall health profile, compliance with medical care, and the potential benefits of remote monitoring (Table 2). Higher risk groups, such as NYHA class III patients and patients with a recent HF hospitalization, will most likely receive the larger absolute risk reductions. Results demonstrate consistent benefits from PAP‐guided remote patient management across the LVEF spectrum with elevated PAP despite being already on GDMT. Subgroup analyses have demonstrated that the CardioMEMS system has beneficial effects across different subgroups, including patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD), patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and patients with pulmonary hypertension, regardless of the subtype. Both male and female patients experienced similar reductions in HF‐related hospitalizations, which is reassuring given known disparities in HF treatment by sex. The efficacy was also independent of LVEF.

Table 2
Indications and contraindications to invasive haemodynamic monitoring with the CardioMEMS system

Contraindications include patients who cannot take antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy post‐implantation and those with conditions like active infections, history of recurrent pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. Additionally, the treatment is not advised for patients with severe kidney dysfunction, congenital heart disease, coagulation disorders, hypersensitivity to certain medications, recent CRT implantation, or those who present certain physical parameters such as a high body mass index and chest circumference.

Based on the available data, the CardioMEMS system is useful for patients with symptomatic HF at moderate to high risk of new worsening HF events as shown by one or more worsening HF events in the previous year (Figure 1). The characteristics of the ideal candidate for remote invasive PAP monitoring are depicted in Figure 2.

### Catheter-based therapies for massive pulmonary embolism [^115o3td8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Massive pulmonary embolism carries a high mortality rate as a result of right ventricular failure. In addition to anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis is the standard first line of therapy for patients with life-threatening massive pulmonary embolism. Surgical embolectomy is often considered in patients with contraindications to receiving systemic thrombolysis or when thrombolysis has failed. Surgical embolectomy is not without inherent risk and limitations. Although there is a paucity of large clinical trials, available data suggests catheter-based treatment of massive pulmonary embolism restores hemodynamic stability and thus is an alternative to surgical therapy.

Table 3.
Most Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported

There were no deaths. Serious adverse events were reported for 1 participant (1.0%) in the 56-mg group (ankle fracture) and 2 participants (1.7%) in the 84-mg group (suicide attempt, ophthalmic migraine), with none of these events considered to be related to esketamine by investigators, and for 3 participants (1.2%) in the placebo group (self-injurious ideation, suicidal ideation, and acute myocardial infarction) (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). One participant (1.0%), 5 participants (4.1%), and 3 participants (1.2%) in the respective groups (56 mg, 84 mg, and placebo) discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse event(s).

There were no unexpected vital sign findings. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values increased at the 40-minute postdose time point and returned close to predose values at 1.5 hours postdose (eFigure 9 in Supplement 2).

There were no unexpected C-SSRS findings. The percentage of participants with no events of suicidal ideation or behavior increased from baseline to day 28 in all groups: from 71 of 105 (67.6%) to 71 of 96 (74.0%) for esketamine, 56 mg; 78 of 121 (64.5%) to 90 of 106 (84.9%) for esketamine, 84 mg; and from 171 of 250 (68.4%) to 177 of 230 (77.0%) for placebo. Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was reported at least once during the double-blind phase for 7 of 105 participants (6.7%) in the 56-mg esketamine group, 8 of 121 participants (6.6%) in the 84-mg esketamine group, and 24 of 250 participants (9.6%) in the placebo group. Two participants (1 in each esketamine dose group) had suicidal behavior. Consistent with C-SSRS results, few participants reported adverse events potentially related to suicidality (ie, suicide ideation, suicide attempt, or self-injurious ideation) during the double-blind phase (esketamine, 56 mg: 2 participants [1.9%]; esketamine, 84 mg: 3 participants [2.5%]; placebo: 3 participants [1.2%]).

### Ketamine and esketamine in clinical trials: FDA-approved and emerging indications, trial trends with putative mechanistic explanations [^1112MHjx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Ketamine has beneficial effects in neurosurgical and cardiological patients due to its neuroprotective properties. Ketamine ability to antagonize glutamate‐mediated excitotoxicity and inflammation may offer protection from cellular mechanisms of neuronal death during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in cardiac arrest (NCT04360070, NCT04009759) and stroke (NCT03223220) with minimal influence on hemodynamic status in therapeutic doses. In patients with traumatic brain injury, ketamine combined with midazolam was not associated with increased intracranial pressure or decreased cerebral perfusion pressure. Early studies have also shown the reduced production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and immune response after ketamine administration in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC).

Certain trials aimed at investigating the effects of ketamine in ICUs, that is, duration of mechanical ventilation, total opioid consumption, hemodynamic changes in mechanically ventilated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, and elimination of sleep disturbances in the perioperative period. Ketamine alone or in combination with other sedatives has appeared as an option for procedural sedation: it successfully attenuates propofol‐induced hypotension, so it may be advantageous for traumatic injuries, hypovolemia or sepsis. Moreover, ketamine is suitable for intubation due to its pharmacokinetic properties: quick onset (< 60 seconds), short duration (~10 minutes), and minimal impact on the cardiovascular system. Thus, in several trials, ketamine was a drug of choice for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) (NCT03545503, NCT00440102, NCT06179485, NCT04291521).

Box 1 Key clinical trials paving the way for esketamine approval

The TRANSFORM and SUSTAIN studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray (Spravato) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and led to esketamine nasal spray FDA and EMA approval. TRANSFORM-2(n = 223) demonstrated a significant reduction in MADRS scores at Day 28, with adverse events like dissociation and nausea resolving within 1.5 h. TRANSFORM-3focused on older adults (≥ 65 years, n = 138), showing mixed results; the 65–74 age group responded better than those ≥ 75 years. Long-term open-label follow-up indicated sustained improvement for most patients. SUSTAIN-1involved 705 adults and evaluated the time to relapse after maintenance treatment. Esketamine reduced the risk of relapse by 51% in patients achieving remission and by 70% in those with stable response. Common adverse events included dysgeusia and somnolence. SUSTAIN-2was a long-term (up to 1 year) open-label study (n = 802) showing continued efficacy, with cognitive performance remaining stable. Adverse events like dizziness and nausea were mild, resolving within 1.5 h post-dose. Overall, esketamine showed sustained efficacy with manageable side effects.

### Pulmonary hypertension: a contraindication to the use of { beta }-adrenoceptor blocking agents [^115QQoCh]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a rare but important complication of pulmonary arterial hypertension. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents are commonly used to treat SVT, but they are potentially dangerous in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects are poorly tolerated in this condition, where cardiac reserve is compromised by a reduced and fixed stroke volume, and their administration can result in significant cardiorespiratory compromise. This is not a new discovery, but it is nonetheless poorly recognised in day-to-day clinical practice.

### Benefit-risk assessment of esketamine nasal spray vs. placebo in treatment-resistant depression [^111QSZbG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, in patients with TRD, esketamine nasal spray as induction and maintenance treatment along with a newly initiated oral AD provides an advantage in rapid onset of effect and sustained efficacy over the transient adverse effects that are medically manageable and resolved mainly on the day of treatment when there is medical supervision or there are driving restrictions. Taken together, the evidence supports a positive benefit–risk balance for esketamine + AD as a novel therapeutic option for this difficult‐to‐treat, potentially life‐threatening condition of TRD.

### The effects of intranasal esketamine on on-road driving performance in patients with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder [^117DtSnF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of nasally administered esketamine have been characterized and summarized in product labelling (, SPRAVATO SmPC). The maximum plasma concentration (C max) of esketamine following intranasal administration is reached within 20–40 min. After reaching C max, there is a biphasic decline in plasma concentration for the first 2–4 h and a mean terminal half-life (t 1/2) ranging from 7 to 12 h. Esketamine is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly 3A4 and 2B6. N-demethylation of esketamine to form noresketamine is the major metabolic pathway. Noresketamine has a similar elimination profile with a mean t 1/2 of approximately 8 h.

Intranasal esketamine is generally well tolerated, but adverse reactions of dissociation, dizziness, nausea, sedation and vertigo commonly occur after dosing. Furthermore, ketamine, the racemic mixture of arketamine and esketamine, is a medicinal product that has been reported to be abused. Withdrawal symptoms of cravings, anxiety, shaking, sweating and palpitations have been reported in individuals dependent on ketamine. To minimize the risk of abuse, misuse and diversion of intranasal esketamine, administration must take place under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional. The adverse events (AEs) of dissociation, dizziness, nausea, sedation and vertigo generally resolve the same day and attenuate with repeated dosing. Symptoms of dissociation and sedation have been shown to resolve within 1.5–2 h. However, considering the sedative and dissociative effects associated with intranasal esketamine (, SPRAVATO SmPC), it was deemed crucial to investigate its effects on driving ability.

Study selection

Overall, 1126 records were identified through database search. One additional record was identified by the hand search of reference lists. After adjusting for duplicates, 648 records remained. Of these, 590 were discarded after reviewing titles and abstracts. Of the remaining 58 full-text articles, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Nine articles included the same four cohorts of patients. Furthermore, two reports appear to have included two overlapping patients. Nonetheless, since all 11 articles provided complementary results, all were included in the systematic review. Only original and novel results were presented. Patients were counted once, except for the two patients of whom overlap was not confirmed. The steps involved in the selection of studies are illustrated in a flowchart given in Figure 1.

### Pulmonary embolism: update on management and controversies [^113CFVqY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must be promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of pulmonary embolism have evolved with a better understanding of efficient use of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The use of either clinical probability adjusted or age adjusted D-dimer interpretation has led to a reduction in diagnostic imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulation therapies are safe, effective, and convenient treatments for most patients with acute venous thromboembolism, with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe outpatient management of pulmonary embolism in selected patients. Recent clinical trials exploring the use of systemic thrombolysis in intermediate to high risk pulmonary embolism suggest that this therapy should be reserved for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The role of low dose systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in other patient subgroups is uncertain. After a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, all patients should be assessed for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism to guide duration of anticoagulation. Patients with a venous thromboembolism associated with a strong, transient, provoking risk factor can safely discontinue anticoagulation after three months of treatment. Patients with an ongoing strong risk factor, such as cancer, or unprovoked events are at increased risk of recurrent events and should be considered for extended treatment. The use of a risk prediction score can help to identify patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can benefit from extended duration therapy. Despite major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism, up to half of patients report chronic functional limitations. Such patients should be screened for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but only a small proportion will have this as the explanation of their symptoms. In the remaining patients, future studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and explore interventions to improve quality of life.

### History of respiratory stimulants [^114CdHem]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Another compound tested in humans is esketamine, which is the S (+) enantiomer of ketamine. Esketamine is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist and is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, but it does not bind significantly to σ receptors. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover-design study in healthy young male and female volunteers, esketamine effectively countered remifentanil-induced respiratory depression. The most common adverse effect was nausea. The authors speculate about possible mechanisms of action, including: a sympathomimetic action, since esketamine increases sympathetic outflow and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine; antagonism of NMDA receptors; and an action of the esketamine metabolite hydroxynorketamine on AMPA receptors, in a manner possibly similar to that of the ampakines.

The most recent respiratory stimulant entrant is ENA-001, which is currently in development. It has received attention as an "agnostic" respiratory stimulant for a number of disease states, as well as for opioid-induced respiratory depression. It inhibits large-conductance Ca 2+ /voltage-activated "big" K + channels, BK Ca. It has been shown to increase minute ventilation in a dose-dependent manner, and to reverse opioid, benzodiazepine, isoflurane and propofol-induced respiratory depression. The original research that established ENA-001 as a respiratory stimulant without reversing analgesia came from animal studies. It has now been shown to antagonize opioid-induced respiratory depression in healthy volunteers. Since it has been shown to stimulate respiration in both benzodiazepine and opioid excess, it offers a potential agent for the care of "polysubstance" patients. A further benefit of ENA-001 is "rapid onset time/offset time" which has been claimed to make "this drug an attractive alternative to naloxone".

Ketamine and esketamine treatment

IV ketamine and esketamine treatment were offered to patients with TRD defined by a history of two or more treatment failures with standard anti-depressants at adequate dosing and duration (as best could be determined in a naturalistic, clinical setting and in collaboration with their outpatient referring provider). Patients with a history of psychosis, current substance use disorder, and relevant uncontrolled medical (i.e. arteriovenous malformation, uncontrolled HTN, aneurysmal disease) were deemed ineligible. Prior to initiation of treatment, each patient is evaluated by an affiliated Internal Medicine physician or NP to obtain medical clearance. At each treatment, patients were evaluated and monitored by a ketamine-trained staff psychiatrist, and a ketamine-trained nurse. Patients were monitored with pulse oximetry, automated Blood Pressure monitoring and one:one nursing care in private, low-stimulation treatment rooms. An Anesthesia physician was available if needed.

Patients treated with I.V racemic ketamine began at a standard initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg administered over 40 min. Patients who failed do demonstrate clinically meaningful response by integrated subjective report, objective clinical assessment, and evaluation of QIDS scores were advised to cease further treatment following treatment #3-#4. The dose was adjusted at the staff psychiatrist's clinical discretion (but could not exceed 1.0 mg/kg) over the course of the treatment series according to clinical response. A full course of IV racemic ketamine was defined as 8 total treatments.

Esketamine was delivered in accordance with the 3-phase protocol with REMS monitoring mandated by the product label. All participants received training and practiced using the intranasal device before the first administration. Participants self-administered intranasal study drug at the clinical site under the direct supervision of the esketamine-trained nurse. Most participants received the first dose of 56 mg with the possibility of increasing the dose to 84 mg contingent on patient tolerability to the index dose and according to the patient's response. All participants were monitored at the clinic for to 2 h following treatment.

During the treatments, other pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments were continued as part of the usual regimen. During and after the procedure, patients who experienced nausea could receive ondansetron. Metoprolol or Versed was available for blood pressure control. Criteria for discharge readiness included a return to baseline mental status, absence of gait disturbance and nausea, and normal blood pressure. Any administration required the patient to be discharged to the care of an adult escort.

Ketamine and esketamine for major depressive disorder (MDD) — Ketamine infusion of a single 0.5 mg/kg dose produced a 10 point greater reduction in symptoms versus control 24 hours after treatment, with effects extending out to six weeks; esketamine has a second FDA indication for depressive symptoms in MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior, but effectiveness in preventing suicide or reducing suicidal ideation or behavior has not been established. Most patients are willing to accept adverse event risks, yet administration poses resource and feasibility challenges (intravenous access, clinical treatment space, and post‑treatment monitoring), durability is limited necessitating repeated visits, access is limited in some regions, and evidence for efficacy is lacking for people over age 65. The Work Group's confidence in evidence was low with high risk of bias, benefits slightly outweighed largely transient adverse events, and thus the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

There is an increased incidence of thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, during tamoxifen therapy. When tamoxifen is coadministered with chemotherapy, there is a further increase in the risk of thromboembolic events.

For treatment of breast cancer, carefully consider the risks and benefits of tamoxifen in women with a history of thromboembolic events. For women with DCIS and for the reduction in breast cancer incidence in women at high risk, tamoxifen is contraindicated in women who require concomitant warfarin-type anticoagulant therapy or in women with a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. Advise patients to seek medical attention immediately if signs or symptoms of a thromboembolic event occur.

Data from the NSABP P-1 trial in women at high risk for breast cancer show that participants receiving tamoxifen without a history of pulmonary emboli (PE) had a statistically significant increase in pulmonary emboli (events: 18 tamoxifen, 6 placebo; incidence rate per 1,000 women-years: 0.75 tamoxifen versus 0.25 placebo; RR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.15 to 9.27) [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Three of the pulmonary emboli, all in the tamoxifen arm, were fatal. Eighty-seven percent of the cases of pulmonary embolism occurred in women at least 50 years of age at randomization. Among women receiving tamoxifen, PE events occurred between 2 and 60 months (average = 27 months) from the start of treatment.

### Intranasal esketamine: from origins to future implications in treatment-resistant depression [^112sByKC]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The approval of intranasal esketamine for treatment-resistant depression marks the next step in our understanding of and ability to treat treatment-resistant depression. The origin of ketamine is rooted in the search for a phencyclidine analog that could be used as a pre-surgical anesthetic with less emergence delirium. Following its inception, ketamine has been used in a variety of contexts. However, it was the seminal Berman et al., 2000 study, which published positive findings from the first human trial using subanesthetic intravenous ketamine for depression. Since then, a large body of research has investigated ketamine's various proposed antidepressant mechanisms of action, and the role its pharmacokinetic properties and route of administration play in producing its antidepressant effects. The results of this research were the eventual approval of intranasal esketamine for treatment-resistant depression by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2019. By identifying and utilizing predictors of response, we can continue to refine our approach to treating treatment-resistant depression and optimize patient response to intranasal esketamine. In this article, we look at the history, pharmacology, landmark studies, and future implications of intranasal esketamine for treatment-resistant depression.

Venous thromboembolic events — For women at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) who request menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), we recommend a nonoral route of ET at the lowest effective dose, if not contraindicated (1|⊕⊕○○); for women with a uterus, we recommend a progestogen (for example, progesterone and dydrogesterone) that is neutral on coagulation parameters. (1|⊕⊕⊕○). Obesity, age, and thrombophilia are associated with increased risk of VTE, and an approximately 2-fold increased risk of VTE (both deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]) with oral MHT is similar among women at low, intermediate, or high risk. A prior history of VTE confers the highest risk, and if the patient has a known inherited coagulation defect, such as Factor V Leiden, oral ET or EPT should be avoided because research has shown a high risk of VTE recurrence. A history of VTE due to pregnancy, oral contraceptives, unknown etiology, or blood clotting disorders poses a contraindication to any ET, whereas VTE due to past immobility, surgery, or bone fracture is a contraindication to oral but not necessarily transdermal MHT; in some countries, a history of any VTE is a contraindication to oral but not low-dose transdermal ET.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) outpatient management — selection criteria and recommendation: Patients suitable for treatment of acute PE out of the hospital should meet all of the following — clinically stable with good cardiopulmonary reserve; no contraindications such as recent bleeding, severe renal or liver disease, or severe thrombocytopenia (ie, < 70,000/mm3); expected to be compliant with treatment; and the patient feels well enough to be treated at home. Clinical decision rules such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), either the original form with score < 85 or the simplified form with score 0, can help identify low-risk candidates; however, prediction rules are aids and a predefined score is not required, and the presence of right ventricular dysfunction or increased cardiac biomarker levels should discourage treatment out of the hospital. The updated recommendation has been modified to state that appropriately selected patients may be treated entirely at home, rather than just be discharged early, and specifically states: "we suggest treatment at home or early discharge over standard discharge (eg, after the first 5 days of treatment) (Grade 2B)" in patients with low-risk PE whose home circumstances are adequate.

Efficacy and Safety Assessments

To minimize the risk of functional unblinding, efficacy assessment (MADRS) raters differed from safety (eg, adverse events, vital signs) assessors.

Site-based assessors rated depressive symptoms using the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA). Participants rated their depressive symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-9). Investigators rated severity of depressive illness using the Clinical Global Impression–Severity(CGI-S).

Adverse events were monitored throughout the study and vital signs were measured at dosing sessions. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale(C-SSRS) was used to assess suicidal ideation and behavior at every visit. To evaluate the participant's assessment of study blinding, participants were asked on day 28 (or at early withdrawal from the study) to respond to the question "Which medication did you receive?"

Statistical Analysis

Efficacy Analyses

For the double-blind phase, the efficacy analysis dataset included all randomized participants who received 1 or more doses of study drug and met MADRS-defined severity criteria during screening. The safety analysis dataset included all randomized participants who received 1 or more doses of study drug. The open-label phase dataset included all participants who received 1 or more doses of open-label esketamine.

Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). The statistical approach for sample size determination and significance level with control for multiplicity are provided in eMethods 3 in Supplement 2.
