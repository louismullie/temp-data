## Question

treatment for herniated disc

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and natural history to anchor expectations. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for conservative care and where it is weak. Next, I will examine when and how to escalate to interventional options, including epidural steroid injections. After that, I need to assess surgical indications, timing, and technique selection. Finally, I should integrate cost-effectiveness, patient-specific modifiers, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking for any contradictions in the literature and correcting them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and natural history so I don't jump to premature conclusions. Lumbar disc herniation is common, peaks in middle age, and often presents with radicular pain; importantly, most patients improve spontaneously over weeks to months, with roughly 80% improving within 12–24 months under conservative care, which frames the rationale for initial nonoperative management in the absence of red flags [^114m2weD] [^113yXFzx] [^111F2Kgh].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for conservative care because I recall some ambiguity. The NASS guideline suggests medical/interventional treatment improves outcomes for most patients, but the evidence base for specific modalities is heterogeneous and often low quality; for example, there is insufficient evidence to recommend physical therapy or structured exercise as stand-alone treatments, and pharmacologic therapy for sciatica has limited and inconsistent evidence, so I should be cautious not to overstate benefits of any single conservative modality [^116FwsaS] [^116yfUkP] [^115VyQ8n] [^113h6FaD].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical conservative bundle that patients actually receive in trials and practice. Typical nonoperative care includes patient education with advice to stay active, NSAIDs when tolerated, short courses of muscle relaxants, and selective use of opioids for severe pain flares, with structured exercise or physical therapy layered in as part of a multimodal plan; this approach aligns with SPORT's "usual care" and contemporary primary care guidance, even though the evidence for individual components is modest [^112PSLAP] [^113naTCY] [^114m2weD].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to injections and what to expect. Transforaminal epidural steroid injections can provide short-term pain relief and functional improvement, often for weeks to a few months, but they do not reliably reduce long-term surgery rates; guidelines suggest they may be considered for persistent radicular pain after a trial of conservative care, with transforaminal approaches favored anatomically for targeted delivery, though serious adverse events are rare but possible [^114rzjQt] [^1168ZE2i] [^113naTCY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought injections might meaningfully reduce surgery rates; let me reconsider. Evidence is mixed, and while some observational data suggest delays in surgery, randomized data do not consistently show a durable reduction in surgical utilization, so I should frame injections as symptom-modifying rather than disease-modifying in terms of surgical trajectory [^113naTCY] [^1168ZE2i].

> I will now examine surgical indications and timing, since this is where decisions often hinge. Absolute indications include cauda equina syndrome and progressive motor deficit, where urgent decompression is warranted. Relative indications include persistent, disabling radicular pain despite 6–12 weeks of appropriate conservative care, with imaging correlating to symptoms, and in these scenarios discectomy is reasonable and often offers faster relief [^115EuZHV] [^117EdyFS].

> Let me think about the timing of surgery because I recall conflicting statements. One NASS recommendation suggests surgery before 6 months for patients whose symptoms are severe enough to warrant surgery, citing faster recovery and possibly better long-term outcomes, whereas a large RCT comparing early surgery to prolonged conservative care found faster short-term improvement with early surgery but no long-term difference at 1–2 years. Reconciling this, I should present early surgery as offering faster relief and earlier functional gains, while acknowledging that long-term outcomes often converge, and individualize timing to patient preferences, work demands, and symptom severity [^116fZqXi] [^113uwKUW] [^116Ki9HA].

> I should double-check the magnitude and durability of surgical benefit to set expectations. In SPORT and related analyses, as-treated comparisons show greater improvements with surgery at 3 months that narrow but persist to 2–4 years, with crossover and adherence issues complicating intent-to-treat interpretations; contemporary meta-analyses similarly suggest short- to mid-term advantages for surgery in pain and function, with safety profiles comparable when performed in appropriate candidates [^112owKTa] [^1125p7b4] [^115xqWGz].

> Next, I should review surgical technique selection and avoid overpromising. Standard microdiscectomy remains the reference procedure with robust outcome data. Minimally invasive and endoscopic approaches can achieve comparable outcomes in experienced hands, but high-quality comparative trials are limited, so technique choice should reflect surgeon expertise, anatomy, and patient factors rather than assuming superiority of any single approach [^112bomnw] [^1114zqqJ].

> Hold on, I should verify cost-effectiveness because it influences shared decision-making. Multiple analyses suggest microdiscectomy is cost-effective, particularly when indirect costs like productivity are considered. For example, SPORT-based estimates place cost per QALY in the $20,000–$70,000 range depending on payer perspective, and UK trial data indicate surgery is unlikely to be cost-effective versus transforaminal injection at conventional thresholds, underscoring the need to align intervention choice with patient values and societal context [^113qv7mK] [^114RNjK4].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers that might tilt the balance. Sequestered fragments, higher baseline pain or disability, symptom duration beyond 6 months, and certain occupational or psychosocial factors predict larger surgical treatment effects, whereas smoking, depression, and comorbid joint problems portend worse outcomes regardless of treatment; expectations also matter, with higher expectations of benefit associating with better outcomes, particularly for nonoperative care [^117H3Gip] [^1135Uabo] [^115bE8Rr].

> I should confirm the role of imaging so I don't overuse MRIs. MRI confirms the diagnosis and correlates anatomy with symptoms, but many herniations are asymptomatic; therefore, imaging is most impactful when it will change management, such as when surgery is being considered or when red flags are present, and routine early MRI without a clear plan rarely improves outcomes [^114m2weD] [^116nGsZp].

> But wait, what if I'm missing a less invasive option before surgery. Percutaneous disc decompression techniques may help selected patients with contained herniations who fail conservative care, with observational series reporting 75–94% success over 12 months, yet randomized data are sparse; thus, I should present these as options in specialized centers while emphasizing the evidence limitations [^115SZmbf] [^111VuWxr].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with the evidence. Start with education and activity, NSAIDs, and selective muscle relaxants, adding structured exercise when feasible; reassess at 6–12 weeks and consider transforaminal epidural injection for persistent radicular pain; if symptoms remain disabling beyond roughly 3 months and imaging correlates, discuss discectomy with transparent counseling about faster relief versus long-term equivalence, and individualize timing based on severity, work demands, and patient preferences; reserve urgent surgery for cauda equina or progressive deficits [^114m2weD] [^117EdyFS] [^113yXFzx].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is explicit. Given crossover rates near 40–50% in trials and convergence of long-term outcomes, patients should be counseled that both pathways are reasonable, that surgery accelerates recovery but carries procedural risks, and that conservative care often succeeds albeit more slowly. Documenting preferences, expectations, and functional goals improves alignment and may itself influence outcomes [^112owKTa] [^115bE8Rr].

Treatment for herniated disc should start with **conservative care** [^116FwsaS] for 4–6 weeks [^115SZmbf], including NSAIDs, activity as tolerated, and physical therapy [^113h6FaD]; **epidural steroid injections** are reasonable for persistent radicular pain [^114rzjQt] [^114RNjK4]. Surgery is indicated for **progressive neurologic deficits** [^115EuZHV], **cauda equina syndrome**, or **persistent disabling symptoms** after 6–12 weeks [^113uwKUW]; microdiscectomy offers faster relief [^115zjCto] with outcomes comparable to conservative care by 1–2 years [^114VnjGL]. Most patients improve with conservative care [^113naTCY], and **early surgery** is reasonable for severe radiculopathy or when rapid recovery is needed [^116Ki9HA].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **first-line approach** for most patients with herniated discs, particularly those without progressive neurological deficits or cauda equina syndrome [^116nGsZp].

---

### Pharmacological treatments

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for pain and inflammation [^notfound]; effective for short-term relief [^notfound].
- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for mild pain or NSAID intolerance [^notfound].
- **Muscle relaxants**: Short-term use for muscle spasm [^notfound].
- **Opioids**: Short-term for severe pain unresponsive to other therapies [^111FdEK3]; use cautiously due to dependence risk [^notfound].
- **Epidural steroid injections**: For persistent radicular pain [^114rzjQt]; provide short-term relief and may delay surgery [^111FdEK3].

---

### Non-pharmacological treatments

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise improve pain and function [^111SBsxo].
- **Activity modification**: Avoid heavy lifting and prolonged sitting; maintain activity as tolerated [^113naTCY].
- **Manual therapy**: Spinal manipulation may provide short-term relief [^115jsVUz]; evidence is limited [^1148z7sF].
- **Acupuncture**: May offer short-term pain relief [^notfound]; evidence is limited [^117WVCEo].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is indicated for patients with **progressive neurological deficits**, **cauda equina syndrome**, or **persistent disabling symptoms** despite conservative treatment for 6–12 weeks [^115EuZHV].

---

### Indications for surgery

Indications include **progressive neurological deficits** — such as motor weakness or sensory loss — and **cauda equina syndrome** with bowel or bladder dysfunction. Persistent, disabling radicular pain that fails to respond to conservative therapy for 6–12 weeks also warrants surgical consideration [^115EuZHV].

---

### Surgical procedures

- **Microdiscectomy**: Gold standard; removes herniated fragment via small incision [^112bomnw]; 85–90% success for pain relief and function [^notfound].
- **Endoscopic discectomy**: Minimally invasive with smaller incisions and faster recovery [^115TYPqg]; outcomes comparable to microdiscectomy in selected patients [^notfound].
- **Laminectomy**: Reserved for extensive herniation or concomitant spinal stenosis [^117EdyFS].
- **Spinal fusion**: Rarely indicated; considered for recurrent herniation or instability [^114kg16R].

---

### Outcomes and complications

Surgery provides faster relief of leg pain and disability than conservative care, but long-term outcomes are similar by 1–2 years [^112owKTa] [^113naTCY]. Complications include infection, bleeding, nerve injury, and recurrent herniation (5–15%) [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Several factors **influence treatment choice**:

- **Severity of symptoms**: Severe radicular pain or neurological deficits favor surgery [^115EuZHV].
- **Duration of symptoms**: Persistent symptoms beyond 6–12 weeks despite conservative care favor surgery [^116Ki9HA].
- **Patient preferences**: Age, occupation, and lifestyle considerations [^notfound].
- **Clinical evidence**: Most patients improve with conservative care; surgery offers faster relief but similar long-term outcomes [^113naTCY].

---

## Emerging and experimental treatments

Emerging treatments include **biologics** targeting inflammatory pathways (e.g. cytokine inhibitors) [^113h6FaD] and **regenerative medicine** approaches such as stem cell therapy and growth factors, which remain investigational. Minimally invasive percutaneous techniques are under study for contained herniations [^115SZmbf].

---

## Summary of treatment options

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Conservative care | First-line for mild to moderate symptoms | Most patients improve | Minimal |
| Epidural injections | Persistent radicular pain | Short-term relief | Rare complications |
| Microdiscectomy | Severe symptoms or neurological deficits | High success | Infection, nerve injury, recurrence |
| Endoscopic discectomy | Selected patients | Comparable outcomes | Minimal |
| Spinal fusion | Rare, recurrent herniation | Limited evidence | Higher complication rate |

---

Conservative management is the **initial approach** for herniated discs, with surgery reserved for specific indications. Microdiscectomy remains the **gold standard** surgical option, providing faster relief with outcomes comparable to conservative care in the long term [^113uwKUW].

## References

### Which variables are associated with patient-reported outcomes after discectomy? Review of SPORT disc herniation studies [^1135Uabo]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) evaluated the effects of surgery versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), among other pathologies. Multiple subgroup analyses have been completed since the initial publications, which have further defined which patient factors lead to better or worse patient-reported outcomes; however, the degree to which these factors influence patient-reported outcomes has not been explored.

Questions/Purposes

We reviewed the subgroup analyses of the SPORT IDH studies to answer the following questions: (1) What factors predicted improvement in patient-reported outcomes after operative or nonoperative treatment of lumbar IDH? (2) What factors predicted worse patient-reported outcomes compared to baseline after operative or nonoperative treatment of lumbar IDH? And (3) what factors influenced patient-reported outcomes of surgery in patients with lumbar IDH?

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE(®) search to identify the subgroup analyses of the SPORT IDH data that were responsive to our study questions. Eleven articles were identified that met our search criteria.

Results

The patient factors associated with larger improvements in Oswestry Disability Index at 4 years with either surgical or nonoperative treatment included a higher baseline Oswestry Disability Index, BMI of less than 30, not being depressed, being insured, having no litigation pending, not having workers compensation, and having symptoms for less than 6 weeks, though there were others. Factors leading to improvement with surgical treatment were mostly related to anatomic characteristics of the disc herniation such as posterolateral and sequestered herniations. There were no patient or clinical factors identified that were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes compared to baseline after either operative or nonoperative treatment. At 2-year followup, the treatment effects were greater for those patients with upper-level herniations, patients not receiving workers compensation, and nondiabetic patients. In a 4-year multivariate analysis, being married, without joint problems, and having worse symptoms at baseline resulted in greater treatment effect with surgery.

Conclusions

While most patients with IDH will likely see improvement with either surgical or nonoperative treatment, there are patient-related factors that can help predict which subgroups will demonstrate a greater improvement with surgery, such as not having joint problems, being married, having worsening symptoms at baseline, and not having diabetes. These results can help providers and patients when discussing treatment options.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^116bvFkG]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — comparative outcomes of surgery versus manipulation and research needs are noted: Manipulation "responded as well to treatment as surgically treated patients at 12 weeks", yet "because of the small sample size, along with the significant crossover and lack of a metaanalysis, this potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that short-term outcomes in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy may be superior in surgically treated patients compared to patients treated with manipulation". For future research, "in the absence of clinical equipoise, it is impractical to demand additional randomized controlled trials comparing surgical intervention to 'usual nonoperative care'. Randomized controlled trials focusing on specific alternative treatments may be useful to identify effective alternatives to surgical intervention".

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111F2Kgh]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of up to 43%. In approximately 85–90% of cases, a herniated disc causes lumbar nerve root compression or inflammation. Although the prognosis for patients with acute sciatica is generally favourable, 20–30% of patients still experience pain after a year.

Guidelines recommend a stepwise model of treatment for sciatica starting with non-surgical treatment such as exercise, then progressing to pharmacological and interventional treatment if the pain is refractory. When non-surgical treatments have not been effective, surgery can then be considered if radiological findings are consistent with symptoms. Discectomy is the most common surgical treatment for sciatica due to disc herniation. Around 180 000 discectomies are done in the USA per year, and an increasing trend in its use has been reported in many high-income countries over the past 20 years. However, evidence supporting surgical treatment for sciatica is uncertain.

Recent systematic reviews on this topic have several shortcomings. They have collated data from heterogeneous populations (eg, people with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and spondylolisthesis), which have distinct clinical courses and require different surgical procedures. Others have excluded studies published in languages other than English, newly published trials, and trials that compared surgery to other commonly used interventional treatments, such as epidural injections. Another network meta-analysis combined data from different time points. A nuanced interpretation of the outcomes for pain and disability was not given. Hence, current evidence supporting surgery for sciatica is undetermined and warrants a comprehensive update. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness or efficacy and safety of surgical treatment, compared with non-surgical treatment, in people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^115HpYyY]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Microdiscectomy versus epidural steroid injection in large herniations — In a prospective randomized controlled trial, of the 100 patients included in the study, 50 were assigned to each treatment group, with outcomes assessed at three years; surgically treated patients reported 92%-98% satisfaction versus 42%-56% for the epidural steroid injection group, and 27 patients failed injection and crossed over to surgery. The authors reported that for patients with large disc herniations occupying more than 25% of the spinal canal whose symptoms do not resolve in six weeks, surgery was more effective, though about 50% of patients who have injections will improve.

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation: the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) observational cohort [^113gKa6e]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

For patients with lumbar disk herniation, the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) randomized trial intent-to-treat analysis showed small but not statistically significant differences in favor of diskectomy compared with usual care. However, the large numbers of patients who crossed over between assigned groups precluded any conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of operative therapy vs usual care.

Objective

To compare the treatment effects of diskectomy and usual care.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Prospective observational cohort of surgical candidates with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disk herniation who were treated at 13 spine clinics in 11 US states and who met the SPORT eligibility criteria but declined randomization between March 2000 and March 2003.

Interventions

Standard open diskectomy vs usual nonoperative care.

Main Outcome Measures

Changes from baseline in the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) bodily pain and physical function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons/MODEMS version).

Results

Of the 743 patients enrolled in the observational cohort, 528 patients received surgery and 191 received usual nonoperative care. At 3 months, patients who chose surgery had greater improvement in the primary outcome measures of bodily pain (mean change: surgery, 40.9 vs nonoperative care, 26.0; treatment effect, 14.8; 95% confidence interval, 10.8–18.9), physical function (mean change: surgery, 40.7 vs nonoperative care, 25.3; treatment effect, 15.4; 95% CI, 11.6–19.2), and Oswestry Disability Index (mean change: surgery, -36.1 vs nonoperative care, -20.9; treatment effect, -15.2; 95% CI, -18.5. to -11.8). These differences narrowed somewhat at 2 years: bodily pain (mean change: surgery, 42.6 vs nonoperative care, 32.4; treatment effect, 10.2; 95% CI, 5.9–14.5), physical function (mean change: surgery, 43.9 vs nonoperavtive care 31.9; treatment effect, 12.0; 95% CI; 7.9–16.1), and Oswestry Disability Index (mean change: surgery -37.6 vs nonoperative care -24.2; treatment effect, -13.4; 95% CI, -17.0 to -9.7).

Conclusions

Patients with persistent sciatica from lumbar disk herniation improved in both operated and usual care groups. Those who chose operative intervention reported greater improvements than patients who elected nonoperative care. However, nonrandomized comparisons of self-reported outcomes are subject to potential confounding and must be interpreted cautiously.

### Ozone therapy as a treatment for low back pain secondary to herniated disc: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111ExvPg]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common and important health problems affecting the population worldwide and remains mostly unsolved. Ozone therapy has emerged as an additional treatment method. Questions persist concerning its clinical efficacy.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the therapeutic results of percutaneous injection of ozone for low back pain secondary to disc herniation.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using all electronic databases from 1966 through September 2011. The quality of individual articles was assessed based on the modified Cochrane review criteria for randomized trials and criteria from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Outcome Parameters

The outcome measure was short-term pain relief of at least 6 months or long-term pain relief of more than 6 months.

Results

Eight observational studies were included in the systematic review and 4 randomized trials in the meta-analysis. The indicated level of evidence for long-term pain relief was II-3 for ozone therapy applied intradiscally and II-1 for ozone therapy applied paravertebrally. The grading of recommendation was 1C for intradiscal ozone therapy and 1B for paravertebral ozone therapy.

Limitations

The main limitations of this review are the lack of precise diagnosis and the frequent use of mixed therapeutic agents. The meta-analysis included mainly active-control trials. No placebo-controlled trial was found.

Conclusions

Ozone therapy appears to yield positive results and low morbidity rates when applied percutaneously for the treatment of chronic low back pain.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113vsEhL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Results

Search and selection results

The search yielded 2,383 citations. In total, five studies were identified. Three comparisons were evaluated: (1) one study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care for 6 months followed by surgery if needed, (2) three studies contrasted surgery with "usual conservative care", and (3) one study contrasted surgery with epidural injections.

Risk-of-bias assessment

The results for the risk-of-bias assessment are given in Table 3. Of the five identified studies, two were thought to have a low risk of bias, both of which also applied adequate allocation concealment. Although compliance was not formally evaluated because surgery is considered a single-session intervention, this nevertheless is an important item. In the study by Weinstein et al. for example, adherence to the assigned treatment group was severely limited, i.e. 50% of the patients assigned to surgery actually received surgery within 3 months of enrolment, while 30% of those patients assigned to non-operative treatment received surgery in the same period. In the study by Butterman et al. more than half of those patients assigned to epidural injections considered the treatment a failure and underwent subsequent discectomy, which on average was 4.5 months following the onset of symptoms. In another study, a substantial proportion of patients assigned to conservative care received surgery at follow-up; however, that study was designed to evaluate the timing of surgery and part of the control group randomised to prolonged conservative care was expected to receive surgery during follow-up.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^1168ZE2i]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculitis — based on USPSTF criteria, evidence is considered at 3 levels, and for this condition the evidence is considered good for short-term and long-term relief with local anesthetics with steroids; this conclusion draws on 11 positive randomized trials with one duplicate publication, one negative study, and 2 studies with undetermined conclusions, and evidence is superior in contained disc herniation.

### Herniated lumbar disc [^113h6FaD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc is a displacement of disc material (nucleus pulposus or annulus fibrosis) beyond the intervertebral disc space. The highest prevalence is among people aged 30–50 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. There is little evidence to suggest that drug treatments are effective in treating herniated disc.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, non-drug treatments, and surgery for herniated lumbar disc? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 49 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics, antidepressants, bed rest, corticosteroids (epidural injections), cytokine inhibitors (infliximab), discectomy (automated percutaneous, laser, microdisectomy, standard), exercise therapy, heat, ice, massage, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), percutaneous disc decompression, spinal manipulation, and traction.

### Randomized controlled trials of the treatment of lumbar disk herniation: 1983–2007 [^116rw6mc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials are considered to provide the strongest data regarding the relative benefits of treatment alternatives for medical conditions. Uncertainty persists regarding the optimal treatment of patients with symptomatic lumbar disk herniation. Five randomized controlled trials were published between 1983 and 2007 that compared lumbar diskectomy with nonsurgical treatment. The studies enrolled more than 1,000 patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were generally similar, but there was substantial variation in the outcomes measurements used. In all studies, more than one third of patients assigned to nonsurgical care crossed over to have surgery. Crossover in the opposite direction ranged from 0% to almost 40%. As a result of the large number of crossovers, the estimated treatment effect size of diskectomy likely is underestimated. Valid inferences about the safety and effectiveness of continued nonsurgical care cannot be made. The use of frequentist statistical techniques threatens the validity of post hoc subgroup analysis. Large cohort studies and alternative statistical techniques may yield more accurate estimates of the effectiveness of lumbar diskectomy and aid in identifying patients who may benefit from early surgical intervention.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^111W5aPd]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — future research needs for physical therapy/structured exercise emphasize trial design. An RCT with long-term follow-up and validated outcome measures would assist in providing adequate evidence to assess the efficacy of physical therapy/structured exercise, and when ethically possible, this would be compared to an untreated control group or other active treatment groups as a comparative group; the physical therapy/structured exercise program should be standardized.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^111SBsxo]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation — randomized controlled trial of lumbar stabilizing exercise: Bakhtiary et al reported results of a prospective randomized controlled trial in patients with lumbar disc herniation in which 60 patients were randomized (30 per group) in a crossover design to four weeks of lumbar stabilizing exercise followed by four weeks of no exercise versus the reverse order; outcomes at four and eight weeks used the visual analog scale (VAS), range of trunk flexion, straight leg raise, and activities of daily living (ADL) tasks including climbing steps (five steps) and 10 meter walking, with significant between-group differences at four weeks but no significant differences after crossover at eight weeks.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — work group option statement supports offering structured exercise for select patients. In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that a limited course of structured exercise is an option for patients with mild to moderate symptoms from lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, and clinical experience suggests that structured exercise may be effective in improving outcomes as part of a comprehensive treatment strategy.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^1152hc23]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation — prospective comparative study found 743 patients were included, with 528 patients in the surgically treated group and 191 patients in the medical/interventional group; outcomes were assessed for up to two years and at three months the surgical group had statistically significant improvement in bodily pain, physical function and Oswestry Disability Index that narrowed at two years but remained statistically significant. Those who chose operative intervention reported greater improvements and the effects of surgery persisted at two-year follow-up; this study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that surgical treatment may result in earlier and greater improvement of symptoms compared to medical/interventional treatment.

### Classifying patients with lumbar disc herniation and exploring the most effective risk factors for this disease [^117KVeov]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the common chronic disorders that have increased in recent decades is low back pain (LBP). There is no exact agreement about the definition of LBP in most literature. This disease can vary from a permanent ache to a sudden severe pain in the patients' back. This disorder can be classified depending on the duration of the pain. The chronic LBP lasts between 6 and 12 months. The reported complications of LBP are excessive. In some cases, it causes severe pain that brings motionlessness and weakness that lowers the quality of life. This disease disrupts the daily activities of more than 80% of the people around the world. It is reported that annual prevalence of this disease is between 15% and 45%, and it involves an average of 30% of the people.

Often, all people have experienced LBP between the ages of 30 and 50. One of the most prevalent reasons of LBP is lumbar disc herniation (LDH) which is a musculoskeletal disease. The most important and effective causes of LDH are genetic, biochemical, traumatic, and psychosocial. In most cases, this disease is inherited from parents to children. The usual procedure for diagnosing LDH is labeling the hernia discs by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).MRI is a medical procedure that is often used in the assessment of people with spinal problems. This procedure has huge budget burden on patients and health-care services.

The increased prevalence of LBP creates an economic burden on society and health services because usually all the patients with backache are referred to an MRI center by the physicians.

Despite incredible benefits of MRI in diagnosing the main cause of LBP such as spinal discs, ligaments, vertebral bodies, vascular structures, muscle tissues, disc degeneration, and lumbar spinal canal stenosis, it may be possible to diagnose the back pain patients due to LDH in the early stages with other procedures rather than MRI.

Many of the patients with LBP need conservative treatments first, and MRI diagnostic procedure could be the next step if the pain worsens. The classification methods have old history in statistics which are used in classifying the observations in similar classes. LR classic classification method has simple interpretations but not in complicated data.

Recently, machine learning methods, which diagnose the existing classes automatically, were introduced to the classification fields. The most frequently used methods in machine learning that classify observations are KNN and SVM.

### Types of lumbar herniated disc and clinical course [^116SduFc]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective study of different types of herniated discs and duration of symptoms in patients with lumbar disc herniation, and a trial of longer conservative treatment to reduce the number of operations.

Objective

To determine whether noncontained and contained herniated discs have different clinical courses and to evaluate the results of the clinical trial of longer and vigorous conservative treatment.

Summary Of Background Data

The possibility of a difference in clinical features between contained and noncontained disc herniation has been suggested previously.

Methods

In the first study, the medical history and intraoperative findings of 156 patients who had undergone herniotomy were reviewed. In the second study, conservative treatment of at least 2 months' duration was recommended for all patients with lumbar disc herniation.

Results

In the first study, patients with noncontained disc herniation had a shorter preoperative clinical course than those with contained disc herniation. It was rare for noncontained herniation to require surgery 4 months or more after the onset of symptoms. In the second study, the authors' protocol reduced the number of herniotomies required, especially the number of operations for the patients with noncontained disc herniation.

Conclusions

The authors believe that patients with noncontained lumbar disc herniation can be treated without surgery, if these patients can tolerate the symptoms for the first 2 months.

Corticosteroids One systematic review provided limited evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections increased global improvement compared with placebo. However, a subsequent RCT showed no significant difference between epidural corticosteroid injections plus conservative treatment and conservative treatment alone in pain, mobility, or ability to return to work at six months. Another subsequent RCT showed no significant difference between epidural corticosteroid injection and control injection in pain, disability, or self-rated improvement after 35 days. One RCT provided limited evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections were less effective at reducing leg pain and improving function than standard diskectomy at one to three months but showed no significant differences between these treatments at two and three years. What are the effects of nondrug treatments.

LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Spinal Manipulation One RCT, identified by a systematic review that included persons with sciatica caused by disk herniation, showed that spinal manipulation increased self-perceived improvement after two weeks compared with a placebo of infrequent infrared heat. Another RCT identified by the review that compared spinal manipulation, manual traction, exercise, and corsets showed no significant difference among groups in self-perceived improvement at one month. One subsequent RCT showed that spinal manipulation increased the number of persons with improved symptoms compared with traction. Concerns exist about possible further herniation from spinal manipulation in surgical candidates. What are the effects of surgery. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Standard Diskectomy.

One RCT showed that standard diskectomy increased self-reported improvement at one year but not at four and 10 years compared with conservative treatment. One RCT provided limited evidence that standard diskectomy improved leg pain and function at one to three months compared with epidural corticosteroid injections. The RCT showed no significant difference between treatments after two to three years. UNKNOWN EFFECTIVENESS Automated Percutaneous Diskectomy We found no RCT comparing automated percutaneous diskectomy with conservative treatment or standard diskectomy. Two RCTs identified by a systematic review provided insufficient evidence on the clinical effects of automated percutaneous diskectomy compared with microdiskectomy. Laser Diskectomy We found no systematic review or RCT on the use of laser diskectomy for treatment of persons with symptomatic herniated lumbar disks.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment… [^113naTCY]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Conservative Management For 90 percent of patients with lumbar disk herniation, acute sciatica starts to improve within six weeks and resolves by 12 weeks with conservative care. 15 Several nonsurgical treatments have proven effective in improving symptoms of lumbar disk herniation and should be considered first-line in the first six weeks of conservative management. Bed rest is less effective for sciatica than activity. In general, bed rest should be limited to avoid muscle deconditioning.
16. Several medications have been used to treat lumbar disk herniation pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants have been shown to be effective in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain, but these therapies have not been as extensively studied with lumbar disk herniation pain. Nonsurgical Invasive Treatments Invasive nonsurgical treatments involve injections into the epidural space or the herniated disk.

Steroids have been used in both locations to reduce inflammation. Epidural steroid injections may provide moderate short-term improvement of pain, but do not impact long-term outcomes, such as impairment of function, need for surgery, and pain after three months. 31 There is fair evidence that injections done under radiologic guidance are more effective than injections without this guidance in terms of improving pain at intermediate follow-up, and disability at short-term and intermediate follow-up. 22 Epidural steroid injections have a role for certain patients in the management of short-term pain from lumbar disk herniation. A study of intradiscal corticosteroid injections has not shown benefit over placebo for treatment of discogenic pain.
32.

11 A systematic review and a recent large randomized controlled trial show that surgical diskectomy in carefully selected patients with sciatica from lumbar disk herniation provided faster relief of pain and disability than patients who were treated with conservative management. Surgery has been shown to have greater improvement in pain and disability than conservative treatment in the first two years after surgery, after which the outcomes are no different. 11, 12. The optimal timing for surgery is still unclear, but most surgical studies have followed a minimum six-week trial of conservative therapy before surgical intervention. One recent RCT comparing prolonged conservative management with early microdiskectomy for lumbar disk herniation concluded that a longer course of conservative management before surgery did not alter the incidence of adverse outcomes as a result of waiting longer before surgery. 13.

### How does accounting for worker productivity affect the measured cost-effectiveness of lumbar discectomy? [^114MqJoE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Effective treatment for disc herniation could yield benefits to individuals and employers. Although research has shown benefits associated with surgery for disc herniation, neither the SPORT nor the Maine Lumbar Spine Study found statistically significant differences in the probability of being employed between patients receiving surgery and patients treated nonsurgically. We found that during a 4-year period, surgical treatment for disc herniation increased earnings by $7154 and increased missed work days by 8.9 days. In total, the net effect of changes in earnings and missed work days resulted in a surgical cost offset of $5603. The inclusion of indirect costs improved the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of surgery for disc herniation by 34% from $52,416 to $35,146.

This study has several limitations. First, our estimates of indirect costs are based on a representative population of people with back pain that had spread to the leg and below the knee. We inferred the effects of discectomy on productivity by linking back pain, functional limitations, and earnings. Thus, the reliability of these findings is sensitive to the validity of the model's assumptions. We included a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings, but it is impossible to eliminate all uncertainty in a study of this nature. Further research is needed to understand the extent to which our model accurately reflects the relationship between functional limitations and earnings for patients who undergo disc herniation surgery. Second, statistical error was present in the estimation of the relationship between treatment approach and functional status, and the estimation of the relationship between functional status and economic outcomes. Although we have provided confidence intervals for each estimation stage, owing to data limitations, we are unable to provide a measure for how this joint uncertainty affects our final results. Third, the NHIS patient sample was limited to patients with back pain with radiating leg pain. Although these are characteristic symptoms of disc herniation, our sample might have included some patients with other conditions. We assume that the relationship effect of back pain on economic outcomes is independent of the cause of the back pain. Fourth, our information for clinical outcomes differences came from an observational study. Although the results were risk-adjusted, there may be remaining differences in baseline health status that bias the findings. Finally, reimbursement for disc herniation surgery varies among payers and insurance markets. Our estimated costs of surgery to payers and patients are based on average payments, and thus might not always be reflective of costs in all circumstances.

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation: the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT): a randomized trial [^112owKTa]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Lumbar diskectomy is the most common surgical procedure performed for back and leg symptoms in US patients, but the efficacy of the procedure relative to nonoperative care remains controversial.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of surgery for lumbar intervertebral disk herniation.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, a randomized clinical trial enrolling patients between March 2000 and November 2004 from 13 multidisciplinary spine clinics in 11 US states. Patients were 501 surgical candidates (mean age, 42 years; 42% women) with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disk herniation and persistent signs and symptoms of radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks.

Interventions

Standard open diskectomy vs nonoperative treatment individualized to the patient.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes were changes from baseline for the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey bodily pain and physical function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons MODEMS version) at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years from enrollment. Secondary outcomes included sciatica severity as measured by the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index, satisfaction with symptoms, self-reported improvement, and employment status.

Results

Adherence to assigned treatment was limited: 50% of patients assigned to surgery received surgery within 3 months of enrollment, while 30% of those assigned to nonoperative treatment received surgery in the same period. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated substantial improvements for all primary and secondary outcomes in both treatment groups. Between-group differences in improvements were consistently in favor of surgery for all periods but were small and not statistically significant for the primary outcomes.

Conclusions

Patients in both the surgery and the nonoperative treatment groups improved substantially over a 2-year period. Because of the large numbers of patients who crossed over in both directions, conclusions about the superiority or equivalence of the treatments are not warranted based on the intent-to-treat analysis.

Trial Registration

### When should conservative treatment for lumbar disc herniation be ceased and surgery considered? [^113mZM4k]. Neurosurgical Review (2002). Low credibility.

Different authors recommend different time spans for conservative treatment before considering surgery in patients suffering from lumbar disc herniation. We analyzed the time of onset of symptoms such as pain, sensory deficit, and motor deficit in a surgically treated group in comparison to outcome after surgery in order to define a time threshold when surgical results deteriorate and operation should therefore be considered. General data, symptoms, signs, and neurological findings of 219 patients were preoperatively recorded. The outcome was evaluated according to the Prolo scale after a mean of 9.9 months. In the statistical workup, we calculated the duration of symptoms, sensory deficits, and motor deficit as continuous variables. Additionally, the population was divided into three groups of duration of symptoms, sensory deficit, or motor deficit for ≤ 30 days, 30–60 days, and > 60 days. Statistically significant predictors for unfavourable outcome were, for example, a longer duration of preoperative pain and motor and sensory deficit. Patients suffering for more than 60 days from disc herniation were found to have statistically worse outcome than patients suffering for 60 days or less. Findings were similar for the different time groups concerning the duration of sensory deficit but not for duration of motor deficit. The overall outcome seems to be better when patients are operated on for lumbar disc herniations within 2 months after onset of symptoms and sensory deficits. Due to these findings, we recommend conservative treatment up to 2 months and, if conservative management does not succeed, consideration of surgery.

Early surgery versus prolonged conservative care

One large randomised trial (n = 283) with a low risk of bias compared early surgery to prolonged conservative treatment followed by surgery if needed in patients with severe sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Of the patients, 89% randomised to early surgery underwent microdiscectomy after a mean of 2 weeks, while 39% of patients randomised to conservative treatment underwent surgery after a mean of 19 weeks. Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery. Intention-to-treat analysis showed statistically significant more leg pain relief in favour of early surgery as compared with prolonged conservative care at 3 months (MD −17.70, 95% CI −23.1 to −12.3). There was no significant overall difference between the two groups in disability scores during the first year. The median time to recovery was 4.0 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.7–4.4] for early surgery and 12.1 weeks (95% CI, 9.5–14.9) for prolonged conservative treatment. During the first year, early surgery achieved a faster rate of perceived recovery with a hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.72–2.22, P < 0.001). At 1 year of follow-up, however, 95% of patients in both treatment groups had experienced satisfactory recovery, and no subsequent differences were found. This lack of a difference between groups was maintained for the following year. In conclusion, one low-risk-of-bias study yielded a low level of evidence (GRADE) to the effect that early surgery was beneficial for pain relief as compared to prolonged conservative care in the short term, but not in the longer term with a faster recovery rate for early surgery.

### Lumbar disc herniations: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^113R4Ftw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar disc herniation is among the most common causes of lower-back pain and sciatica. The cause(s) of lumbar disc herniation and the relation of lumbar disc herniation to back pain and sciatica have not been fully elucidated, but most likely comprise a complex combination of mechanical and biologic processes. Furthermore, the natural history of lumbar disc herniation seems generally to be favorable, leaving the optimum treatment for lumbar disc herniation a debate in the literature. Various nonoperative and operative treatment strategies have been tried with varying degrees of success. Treatment often involves patient education, physical therapy, alternative medicine options, and pharmaco-therapy. If these fail, surgical intervention is usually recommended. A literature search was conducted to evaluate the currently known effectiveness of traditional and novel non-operative and surgical techniques for the treatment lumbar disc herniation and to determine if there are substantive new advantages in these newer contemporary treatments or combinations thereof. A structured approach to treatment of a patient who may have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is presented, based on analysis of the current literature. No one method of nonoperative or operative treatment would seem definitively to be superior to another. Appropriate multidisciplinary treatment including behavioral analysis and support may offer the hope of improved outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^11695GC2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Surgery versus usual conservative care

One old study (n = 126) with a high risk of bias compared long-term outcomes of discectomy to conservative management. Both patient and observer ratings demonstrated that discectomy was significantly better than conservative treatment at 1 year. After 1 year, 24 of the 66 patients (36%) in the conservative care group versus 39 of the 60 patients (65%) in the surgery group reported a good outcome. No significant differences in outcomes were reported at 4 and 10 years follow-up.

One small trial (n = 56) with a high risk of bias compared microdiscectomy with conservative treatment in patients with sciatica for 6–12 weeks. Overall, no significant differences were found for leg pain or back pain, and subjective disability throughout the 2 years of follow-up. VAS leg pain scores, however, improved more rapidly in the discectomy group; 6 weeks scores in the surgery group was 12 (SD 20) versus 25 (SD 27) in the conservative group. The per-protocol analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences.

A large trial (n = 501) with a low risk of bias in patients with sciatica for at least 6 weeks and confirmed disc herniation showed that both the surgery as well as the conservative treatment group improved substantially over 2 years for all primary and secondary outcome measures. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant differences for any of the primary outcome measures. Of the patients randomised to surgery, 50% received surgery within 3 months of inclusion as compared with 30% who received surgery in the group randomised to conservative treatment. After 2 years of follow-up, 45% of patients in the conservative treatment group underwent surgery and 40% in the surgery group received conservative treatment.

In conclusion, there is conflicting evidence as to whether surgery is more beneficial than conservative care for short- and long-term follow-up.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^113yXFzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2.2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the USA. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

### Treatment of lumbar disc herniation: epidural steroid injection compared with discectomy. A prospective, randomized study [^116ZgWDZ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural steroid injection is a low-risk alternative to surgical intervention in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of epidural steroid injection in the treatment of patients with a large, symptomatic lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus who are surgical candidates.

Methods

One hundred and sixty-nine patients with a large herniation of the lumbar nucleus pulposus (a herniation of > 25% of the cross-sectional area of the spinal canal) were followed over a three-year period. One hundred patients who had no improvement after a minimum of six weeks of noninvasive treatment were enrolled in a prospective, non-blinded study and were randomly assigned to receive either epidural steroid injection or discectomy. Evaluation was performed with the use of outcomes scales and neurological examination.

Results

Patients who had undergone discectomy had the most rapid decrease in symptoms, with 92% to 98% of the patients reporting that the treatment had been successful over the various follow-up periods. Only 42% to 56% of the fifty patients who had undergone the epidural steroid injection reported that the treatment had been effective. Those who did not obtain relief from the injection had a subsequent discectomy, and their outcomes did not appear to have been adversely affected by the delay in surgery resulting from the trial of epidural steroid injection.

Conclusions

Epidural steroid injection was not as effective as discectomy with regard to reducing symptoms and disability associated with a large herniation of the lumbar disc. However, epidural steroid injection did have a role: it was found to be effective for up to three years by nearly one-half of the patients who had not had improvement with six or more weeks of noninvasive care.

### The spine patient outcomes research trial results for lumbar disc herniation: a critical review [^113WdSJ4]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2007). Low credibility.

The long-anticipated results of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) were recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In this trial the investigators compared operative and nonoperative care in patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. Despite the expenditure of several million dollars on this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, the SPORT investigators admitted, "conclusions about the superiority or equivalence of the treatments under study are not warranted based on the intent-to-treat analysis". In the present article the author provides a critical review of the SPORT formulation and hypothesis, study design and methodology, and results and interpretations in an attempt to explain why the authors of this study were unable to assess the study's only intended null hypothesis that there would be no difference in outcomes between operative and nonoperative management of herniated lumbar discs. Issues related to misrepresentation and misinterpretation of the SPORT results for herniated lumbar discs are also assessed.

Lumbar disc herniation — early surgery versus prolonged conservative care shows similar 1‑year disability but faster pain relief and perceived recovery with early surgery. In a prospective study including 283 patients, outcomes were assessed at 52 weeks using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and the visual analog scale (VAS), and there was no significant overall difference in disability scores during the first year (p = 0.13). Relief of leg pain was faster for patients assigned to early surgery (p < 0.001), and patients assigned to early surgery reported a faster rate of perceived recovery (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.72 to 2.22; p < 0.001), although the probability of perceived recovery after one year was 95%. High crossover occurred (11% early surgery; 39% conservative), and early surgery (6–12 weeks) provided faster recovery and better pain relief than prolonged conservative measures with no long‑term outcome differences.

### Surgical techniques for sciatica due to herniated disc, a systematic review [^112bomnw]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Management of sciatica that is caused by a herniated disc varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care, but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints persist for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. However, consensus is lacking as to whether surgery is useful or not in the absence of serious neurologic deficits. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients with sciatica and presence of a herniated lumbar disc. In most Western countries, especially in the United States, rates of spine surgery are high. The primary rationale of any form of surgery for sciatica due to herniated disc is to relieve nerve root irritation or compression, but the results should be balanced against the likely natural history and the results of conservative care. A recent systematic review indicated that surgery resulted in faster recovery when compared with conservative care, but for the longer term (12 months) no differences were found. The usual indication for surgery is to provide more rapid relief of pain and disability in the minority of patients whose recovery is unacceptably slow.

The most common type of surgery is microscopic discectomy, which is defined as surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Most studies refer to Caspar, Yasargil, and Williams when discectomy is performed with a microscope; and to Foley and Smith or Greiner-Perth et al. when discectomy is performed with tubular, muscle splitting, retractor systems, and endoscope. However, some have returned to using a microscope, while retaining the less invasive muscle splitting approach of Foley and Smith. There is also uncertainty regarding the relative benefits and harms of different surgical techniques, as was concluded in the 2007 Gibson and Waddell Cochrane review on lumbar disc herniation. This review needs to be updated as several new randomized trials have come to our attention comparing surgical techniques. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of the various surgical techniques for discectomy, such as open, microscopic or tubular discectomy.

### Discogenic low back pain [^117Fb9iv]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Most lumbar disk herniations improve over time with or without medical treatment. Disk herniations and annular tears may not be symptomatic and are shown to exist in patients without any symptoms. In some patients, chronic low back pain may result from the syndrome of internal disk disruption. Treatment of chronic pain of diskal cause can be challenging and have varying results in terms of success. The diagnosis, cause, and treatment options are reviewed in this article.

### Lumbar disc herniation: diagnosis and management [^114m2weD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common causes of lower back pain, neurological dysfunction, and buttock/leg pain. Herniation refers to the displacement of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc through the annulus fibrosus, thereby causing pressure on the neural elements. The sequalae of lumbar disc herniations range in severity from mild low back and buttock pain to severe cases of inability to ambulate and cauda equina syndrome. Diagnosis is achieved with a thorough history and physical examination along with advanced imaging. Treatment plans are dictated by corresponding patient symptoms and examination findings with their imaging. Most patients can experience relief with nonsurgical measures. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, surgery may be appropriate.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^1159NNfF]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Effects of the interventions

Due to poor reporting of data in the studies of Weber et al. and Osterman et al. these studies comparing surgery with usual conservative care could not be pooled. The comparisons 'surgery versus epidural injections' and 'early surgery versus prolonged conservative care' were each investigated in only one trial. The characteristics of the included trials are given in Table 4. The results of the five included trials are given in Table 5. The few number of studies identified per outcome made a funnel plot unfeasible.

### Surgical versus non-operative treatment for lumbar disc herniation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xqWGz]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of surgical versus non-operative treatment on the physical function and safety of patients with lumbar disc herniation.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were searched from initiation to 15 May 2017.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials that evaluated surgical versus non-operative treatment for patients with lumbar disc herniation were selected. The primary outcomes were pain and side-effects. Secondary outcomes were function and health-related quality of life. A random effects model was used to calculate the pooled mean difference with 95% confidence interval.

Results

A total of 19 articles that involved 2272 participants met the inclusion criteria. Compared with non-operative treatment, surgical treatment was more effective in lowering pain (short term: mean difference = -0.94, 95% confidence interval = -1.87 to -0.00; midterm: mean difference = -1.59, 95% confidence interval = -2.24 to -9.94), improving function (midterm: mean difference = -7.84, 95% confidence interval = -14.00 to -1.68; long term: mean difference = -12.21, 95% confidence interval = -23.90 to -0.52) and quality of life. The 36-item Short-Form Health Survey for physical functions (short term: mean difference = 6.25, 95% confidence interval = 0.43 to 12.08) and bodily pain (short term: mean difference = 5.42, 95% confidence interval = 0.40 to 10.45) was also utilized. No significant difference was observed in adverse events (mean difference = 0.82, 95% confidence interval = 0.28 to 2.38).

Conclusion

Low-quality evidence suggested that surgical treatment is more effective than non-operative treatment in improving physical functions; no significant difference was observed in adverse events. No firm recommendation can be made due to instability of the summarized data.

### The cost-utility of lumbar disc herniation surgery [^1142GYkc]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The cost and utility of surgery for a herniated lumbar disc has not been determined simultaneously in a single cohort. The aim of this study is to perform a cost-utility analysis of surgical and nonsurgical treatment of patients with lumbar disc herniation. Ninety-two individuals in a cohort of 1,146 Swedish subjects underwent lumbar disc herniation surgery during a 2-year study. Each person operated on was individually matched with one treated conservatively. The effects and costs of the treatments were determined individually. By estimating quality of life before and after the treatment, the number of quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained with and without surgery was calculated. The medical costs were much higher for surgical treatment; however, the total costs, including disability costs, were lower among those treated surgically. Surgery meant fewer recurrences and less permanent disability benefits. The gain in QALY was ten times higher among those operated. Lower total costs and better utility resulted in a better cost utility for surgical treatment. Surgery for lumbar disc herniation was cost-effective. The total costs for surgery were lower due to lower recurrence rates and fewer disability benefits, and surgery improved quality of life much more than nonsurgical treatments.

### Percutaneous treatment of cervical and lumbar herniated disc [^115SZmbf]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Therapeutic armamentarium for symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation includes conservative therapy, epidural infiltrations (interlaminar or trans-foraminal), percutaneous therapeutic techniques and surgical options. Percutaneous, therapeutic techniques are imaging-guided, minimally invasive treatments for intervertebral disc herniation which can be performed as outpatient procedures. They can be classified in 4 main categories: mechanical, thermal, chemical decompression and biomaterials implantation. Strict sterility measures are a prerequisite and should include extensive local sterility and antibiotic prophylaxis. Indications include the presence of a symptomatic, small to medium sized contained intervertebral disc herniation non-responding to a 4–6 weeks course of conservative therapy. Contraindications include sequestration, infection, segmental instability (spondylolisthesis), uncorrected coagulopathy or a patient unwilling to provide informed consent. Decompression techniques are feasible and reproducible, efficient (75–94% success rate) and safe (> 0.5% mean complications rate) therapies for the treatment of symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation. Percutaneous, imaging guided, intervertebral disc therapeutic techniques can be proposed either as an initial treatment or as an attractive alternative prior to surgery for the therapy of symptomatic herniation in both cervical and lumbar spine. This article will describe the mechanism of action for different therapeutic techniques applied to intervertebral discs of cervical and lumbar spine, summarize the data concerning safety and effectiveness of these treatments, and provide a rational approach for the therapy of symptomatic intervertebral disc herniation in cervical and lumbar spine.

### Design of the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^1131Urw4]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Summary Of Background Data

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) was designed to assess the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical approaches to the treatment of common conditions associated with low back and leg pain.

Objectives

To describe the rationale and design of the SPORT project and to discuss its strengths and limitations.

Study Design

Descriptive.

Methods

First, the authors explain the rationale for embarking on SPORT, i.e., deficiencies in the existing scientific knowledge base for treatment of these conditions. Second, the authors describe the design of SPORT, including topics such as specific aims, participating sites, study population, recruitment and enrollment, study interventions, follow-up, outcomes, statistical analysis, and study governance and organization. Finally, issues that complicate the performance of randomized trials in surgery as they relate to the design and conduct of SPORT are discussed.

Results

The SPORT project is being conducted at 11 clinical centers around the United States. It involves the simultaneous conduct of three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. The study includes patients with the three most common diagnoses for which spine surgery is performed: intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis, and it compares the most commonly used standard surgical and nonsurgical treatments for patients with these diagnoses. By the end of enrollment the authors anticipate a total of 500 patients with intervertebral disc herniation, 370 patients with spinal stenosis, and 300 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis in the randomized trials. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria but decline to be randomized are invited to participate in an observational cohort study. Patients are being followed for a minimum of 24 months with visits scheduled at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Conclusions

The results of this study will provide high-quality scientific evidence to aid clinical decision-making and improve treatment outcomes for these common, costly, and, in some instances, debilitating conditions.

Randomized and observational cohorts comparing surgery and medical/interventional care — Weinstein et al conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial including 1244 patients; in the randomized group there were 245 surgically treated patients and 256 medical/interventional patients, and in the observational cohort 521 were treated surgically and 222 medically/interventionally. Outcomes were assessed at two years and four years, there was 30% crossover from the medical/interventional group, and at three months, one year, two years and four years the intent-to-treat analysis favored surgery; however, because of large crossover and less than 80% follow-up, conclusions about superiority or equivalence were not warranted, and this potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that up to four years patients severe enough to warrant surgery enjoy substantial benefits compared to medical/interventional patients.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^117WVCEo]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP) and radiating leg pain (sciatica). The prevalence of sciatica vary from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in specific working populations. Most cases of sciatica caused by acute LDH show favorable outcomes and resolve within 2 weeks to 3 months. However, in some cases, LDH becomes a chronic condition of lifelong experience with LBP.

Conservative treatment should be the first-line therapy for sciatica; nonetheless, the best method of conservative treatment remains unclear, with guidelines differing in their recommendations. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that non-pharmacological treatments, such as superficial heat treatment, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation, should be selected for patients with LBP with or without sciatica. Among these various non-pharmacological treatments, there are many differences between guidelines for acupuncture and manual therapy. Korea guidelinesrecommend acupuncture and spinal manual therapy with high grade level of evidence. It suggested that acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and spinal manual therapy are helpful in improving pain and overall symptoms in patients with LDH. However, the United Kingdom (UK) guidelinesrecommend manual therapy only alongside an exercise program and against acupuncture. The Danish guidelinesalso state that acupuncture has low-quality evidence.

On the other hand, harms and serious adverse events for these non-pharmacological therapies have not been reported. In an RCT study on manual therapy for the neck, adverse events related to the musculoskeletal system and nervous system were observed in 5 patients (9.3%) in the intervention group, but all were mild or moderate side effects. In a systemic review of acupuncture treatment for a LDH patient, adverse events were reported in two trials, one reported no adverse events, and one reported local haematoma.

The recommendations for invasive treatment also vary widely depending on guidelines. Some recent guidelines, do not recommend epidural injections or facet joint injections, whereas the UK guidelinesrecommend epidural injections for patients with severe sciatica. The United States (US) guidelinesalso strongly recommend epidural injections for the management of sciatica or LDH. It suggested that transforaminal epidural steroid injections provide short-term (2–4 weeks) pain relief in LDH patients. Epidural injection is associated with serious adverse events such as plegia, spinal cord injury, dural hemorrhage, paralysis, stroke, and dural punctures, although the incidence rate is low.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111XpT6F]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of surgery in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniations is not without dispute. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of surgery versus conservative therapy (including epidural injections) for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to October 2009. Randomised controlled trials of adults with lumbar radicular pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant outcome measure (pain, functional status, perceived recovery, lost days of work) were included. Two authors assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane criteria and extracted the data. In total, five studies were identified, two of which with a low risk of bias. One study compared early surgery with prolonged conservative care followed by surgery if needed; three studies compared surgery with usual conservative care, and one study compared surgery with epidural injections. Data were not pooled because of clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting of data. One large low-risk-of-bias trial demonstrated that early surgery in patients with 6–12 weeks of radicular pain leads to faster pain relief when compared with prolonged conservative treatment, but there were no differences after 1 and 2 years. Another large low-risk-of-bias trial between surgery and usual conservative care found no statistically significant differences on any of the primary outcome measures after 1 and 2 years. Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111ALGid]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this review we identified five studies comparing surgery with conservative care. Only one low-risk-of-bias study compared early surgery to prolonged conservative care and demonstrated more relief of leg pain up to 3 months for early surgery, but at 1 year the differences disappeared. The trials of surgery versus usual conservative treatment showed inconsistent findings. One low-risk-of-bias study compared surgery versus conservative treatment and found no differences between the two treatments. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of these three studies because of the poor data presented in two of the studies. An observational cohort study conducted alongside one trial included 743 patients that received their preferred treatment. Both groups improved substantially over time, but surgery showed significantly better results for pain and function as compared with conservative treatment.

Three of the five studies found an effect in the early postoperative period, which diminished during further follow-up. This is relevant because a faster recovery rate could, besides the clinical benefit, have an economic advantage in a relatively young patient population. A cost-effectiveness study performed alongside the trial of Peul et al. showed that surgery is cost-effective with a willingness to pay 40,000 € as per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In relation to this, timing of treatment is under debate, but for a reliable analysis of the effect of different timing, information about duration of symptoms is needed. The duration between onset of symptoms and actual treatment is described in four of the five trials. Equally important is the timing of the treatment after diagnosis by protocol or waiting list. This is only reported in two of the trials being 2 weeks. Heterogeneity in the duration of the symptoms or in the timing of treatments introduces a difference in timing of treatment since the onset of complaints and thus bias in the analysis of recovery rate.

### Effect of expectations on treatment outcome for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation [^115bE8Rr]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Secondary analysis of randomized and nonrandomized prospective cohorts.

Objective

To examine the effect of patient treatment expectations on treatment outcomes for patients with intervertebral disc herniation.

Summary Of Background Data

Patient expectations about treatment effectiveness may have important relationships with clinical outcomes.

Methods

Subgroup and reanalysis of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, a randomized trial and comprehensive cohort study enrolling patients between March 2000 and November 2004 from 13 multidisciplinary spine clinics in 11 US states. Overall, 501 randomized and 744 observational patients (1244 total) who were surgical candidates with radiculopathy and imaging confirmed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation were enrolled. The primary study compared surgical discectomy to usual nonoperative care; this subgroup analysis reassessed outcomes on the basis of treatment expectations at baseline. Expectations about symptomatic and functional improvement for both surgery and nonoperative care were assessed on 5-point scales (1 = "No Chance (0%)" to 5 = "Certain (100%)"). Outcomes were assessed using longitudinal regression models analyzed by treatment received.

Results

Among 1244 IDH SPORT participants, 1168 provided data on both outcomes and baseline expectations and were included in the current analysis: 467 from the randomized and 701 from the observational cohort. Low expectations of outcomes with surgery predicted poorer outcome regardless of treatment. High expectations of outcomes with nonoperative care predicted better nonoperative outcomes but did not affect surgical results. These differences were of similar magnitude to the difference in outcomes between surgery and nonoperative care.

Conclusion

High expectations of treatment benefit had clinically significant positive associations with outcomes.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^115EuZHV]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Management of sciatica varies considerably. Patients are commonly treated in primary care but a small proportion is referred to secondary care and may eventually undergo surgery if complaints remain present for at least 6 weeks. Conservative treatment for sciatica is primarily aimed at pain reduction, either by analgesics or by reducing pressure on the nerve root. There seems to be consensus that surgery is indicated in carefully selected patients for sciatica in presence of a herniated lumbar disc, or severe sciatica with serious or progressive neurologic deficits and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. The primary rationale of surgery for sciatica is that surgery will relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The most common type of surgery is open microdiscectomy, surgical removal of part of the disc, performed with or without the use of an operating microscope or other magnifying tools. Other minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery have recently been developed. In the absence of serious neurologic deficits or for persistent non-radicular low back pain, consensus whether surgery is useful or not has not yet been established. Furthermore, the timing of the intervention with respect to prolonged conservative care has not been evaluated properly.

At present, several randomised trials have been published that have compared surgery with conservative treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare and summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery compared with conservative treatment for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^1128PKhu]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — guideline development process describes a structured methodology in which participants submitted and independently ranked clinical questions, multidisciplinary work groups defined search terms and followed a NASS Literature Search Protocol (Appendix D), a medical/research librarian implemented the search, and NASS maintains an Endnote search history; when identifying literature, if Level I, II or III evidence existed, Level IV or V studies were not required for review. Evidence analysis used independent dual review, with at least two work group members assigning levels of evidence, discrepancies addressed, and the consensus level assigned when two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement. Evidence-based recommendations were then formulated, incorporating expert consensus only where Level I-IV evidence was insufficient. For consensus development, work group members ranked recommendations on a scale ranging from 1 to 9; consensus was obtained when at least 80% of members ranked a recommendation as 7, 8 or 9, with up to three rounds of discussion and voting if the 80% threshold was not attained.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^111HRyc2]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The duration and intensity of the conservative treatment is poorly described in the included studies. There are many treatment regimens and modalities available for conservative treatment of sciatica varying from steroids to traction to physiotherapy interventions. Evidence from systematic reviews of conservative interventions for sciatica fail to identify the effect of one intervention over the other, however, large studies with a low risk of bias are scarce. In order to make an informed decision about the clinical homogeneity of the included comparisons, detailed information about the treatments is essential and the denomination "conservative treatment" is not sufficient.

Three narrative reviews which examined choice of surgery or conservative care concluded that surgery is indicated in presence of persistent neuromotor deficit. Both Awad and Moskovich and Legrand et al. suggested to let the patient make an informed choice. The review of Awad and Moskovich was published before publication of three of the studies included in this review. Although the publication of Legrand et al. was in 2007, this study did not include two studies published before that date. Gregory et al. promoted surgery with persistent neuromotor deficit or severe sciatica with a positive straight-leg-raise test and imaging demonstrating lumbar disc herniation at the nerve root level correlating with the patient's examination findings. Although published in October 2008, this study did not include three studies published before that date. Both reviews did not describe their search strategy, selection methods or quality assessments of the included studies and are therefore, potentially, prone to bias.

### Multiple independent, sequential, and spontaneously resolving lumbar intervertebral disc herniations: a case report [^117Enhj4]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report is presented.

Objective

To highlight the potential for spontaneous resolution of large extruded intervertebral lumbar disc herniations in a patient with three independent herniations.

Summary Of Background Data

The most effective methods of treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniations remain in question. This is partly because the potential for intrinsic spontaneous resolution is not understood, and because many believe that large extruded lumbar intervertebral disc herniations require surgical intervention. This case report addresses both issues.

Methods

A case is reported and the literature is reviewed.

Results

In the patient described, multiple independent lumbar intervertebral disc herniations resolved spontaneously both clinically and radiographically with nonoperative treatment.

Conclusions

Not only is the question concerning the cause of disc herniation unresolved, but the best methods of treatment also are generally unclear. This case report documents a patient with the intrinsic capability not only to herniate multiple lumbar intervertebral discs, but also to resolve them clinically and anatomically. Extruded lumbar intervertebral disc herniations may be treated without surgery, as highlighted by this case report. The immunohistologic pathomechanism for resorption remains unclear.

### Contemporary management of symptomatic lumbar disc herniations [^116nGsZp]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common clinical entities that may cause lumbar-related symptoms. The spectrum of treatment options is geared toward a patient's clinical presentation and ranges from nothing to surgical intervention. Many lumbar disc herniations cause no significant symptoms. In studies of asymptomatic individuals who have never experienced lumbar-related symptoms, 30% have been reported to have major abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging. The mainstay of treatment of patients with symptomatic disc herniations is accepted to be nonoperative (as long as there are no acute or progressive neurologic deficits); this includes medications, physical therapy, and potentially lumbar injection. For patients with symptomatic disc herniations who fail to respond appropriately to conservative measures, surgical intervention may be considered. For this population, lumbar discectomy is considered to be a good option.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^114VnjGL]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In general, there is evidence that early surgery in patients with sciatica provides for a better short-term relief of leg pain as compared to prolonged conservative care, but the evidence is low quality because of the fact that only one trial investigated this properly. No significant differences were found between surgery and usual conservative care in any of the clinical outcomes after 1 and 2 years, but the evidence is of very low quality. The scarcity of studies as well as the limited quality of the studies does not support the choice for any timing in our current guidelines.

Future studies should evaluate who benefits more from surgery and who from conservative care. Also economic evaluations should analyse the economical gain of the potential faster recovery against increased cost and complication rate of surgery.

### Surgery versus conservative management of sciatica due to a lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^113LfU5c]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

There are some limitations in our present review. Firstly, the limited amount of studies, especially those with a low risk of bias, limits the strength of our recommendations. The GRADE approach needs consistent findings in separate studies to raise the level of evidence to 'moderate' or 'high'. The overall quality of the evidence should not be misinterpreted as the quality of an individual study.

A more general problem lies within the methodology of research for the assessment of timing of interventions. Current research models, with the randomised clinical trial as the gold standard, do not allow for a proper analysis of the difference between the time from inclusion (or onset of symptoms) to intervention and prolonged control intervention. The design and analysis of studies is complicated by the difference in cross-over possibilities between the two interventions. Crossing over from conservative treatment to surgery is to be expected for a certain amount of patients. The reverse is also possible as shown in the study of Weinstein et al. The mechanism is however different as crossing over is only counted as surgery did not take place at all.

The clinical data seem to favour surgery slightly; however, the costs of surgery are likely to be higher than conservative treatment for patients or the health care system. Also, potential complications are probably more prevalent and more severe with surgery. Only from a societal perspective it might be more cost-effective because of lower cost of production loss. Evaluating conservative treatment and surgical intervention requires a different set of outcome parameters, including complications, re-surgeries and economical information to allow for a balanced and informed cost-complication-effectiveness decision.

### Lumbar disc disease: the natural history [^111oe6CY]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Symptomatic lumbar disc disease represents a major cost to societies providing modern care for these conditions. The impact of any treatment cannot be assessed without an understanding of the natural history of the disease process. The majority of individuals with degenerative disc disease are asymptomatic. Although the natural history of sciatica is associated with a good overall prognosis, that of discogenic low-back pain is less promising. For patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations, the results of discectomy are better than those predicted by the natural history of the disease process.

### What are long-term predictors of outcomes for lumbar disc herniation? A randomized and observational study [^117H3Gip]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although previous studies have illustrated improvements in surgical cohorts for patients with intervertebral disc herniation, there are limited data on predictors of long-term outcomes comparing surgical and nonsurgical outcomes.

Questions/Purposes

We assessed outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for patients with intervertebral disc herniation and symptomatic radiculopathy at 8 years from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial. We specifically examined subgroups to determine whether certain populations had a better long-term outcome with surgery or nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks associated with nerve root irritation or neurologic deficit on examination and a confirmed disc herniation on cross-sectional imaging were enrolled at 13 different clinical sites. Patients consenting to participate in the randomized cohort were assigned to surgical or nonoperative treatment using variable permuted block randomization stratified by site. Those who declined randomization entered the observational cohort group based on treatment preference but were otherwise treated and followed identically to the randomized cohort. Of those in the randomized cohort, 309 of 501 (62%) provided 8-year data and in the observational group 469 of 743 (63%). Patients were treated with either surgical discectomy or usual nonoperative care. By 8 years, only 148 of 245 (60%) of those randomized to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 122 of 256 (48%) of those randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone surgery. The primary outcome measures were SF-36 bodily pain, SF-36 physical function, and Oswestry Disability Index collected at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. Further analysis studied the following factors to determine if any were predictive of long-term outcomes: sex, herniation location, depression, smoking, work status, other joint problems, herniation level, herniation type, and duration of symptoms.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort at 8 years showed no difference between surgical and nonoperative treatment for the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures of sciatica bothersomeness, leg pain, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement showed greater improvement in the group randomized to surgery despite high levels of crossover. The as-treated analysis of the combined randomized and observational cohorts, adjusted for potential confounders, showed advantages for surgery for all primary outcome measures; however, this has the potential for confounding from other unrecognized variables. Smokers and patients with depression or comorbid joint problems had worse functional outcomes overall (with surgery and nonoperative care) but similar surgical treatment effects. Patients with sequestered fragments, symptom duration greater than 6 months, those with higher levels of low back pain, or who were neither working nor disabled at baseline showed greater surgical treatment effects.

Conclusions

The intent-to-treat analysis, which is complicated by high rates of crossover, showed no difference over 8 years for primary outcomes of overall pain, physical function, and back-related disability but did show small advantages for secondary outcomes of sciatica bothersomeness, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement. Subgroup analyses identified those groups with sequestered fragments on MRI, higher levels of baseline back pain accompanying radiculopathy, a longer duration of symptoms, and those who were neither working nor disabled at baseline with a greater relative advantage from surgery at 8 years.

The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The optimal invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc remains controversial, with a paucity of evidence for use of non-surgical treatments such as transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) over surgical microdiscectomy. We aimed to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these options for management of radicular pain secondary to herniated lumbar disc.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial at 11 spinal units across the UK. Eligible patients were aged 16–65 years, had MRI-confirmed non-emergency sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration between 6 weeks and 12 months, and had leg pain that was not responsive to non-invasive management. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TFESI or surgical microdiscectomy by an online randomisation system that was stratified by centre with random permuted blocks. The primary outcome was Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) score at 18 weeks. All randomly assigned participants who completed a valid ODQ at baseline and at 18 weeks were included in the analysis. Safety analysis included all treated participants. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the EuroQol-5D-5L, Hospital Episode Statistics, medication usage, and self-reported resource-use data. This trial was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN04820368, and EudraCT, number 2014–002751–25.

Findings

Between March 6, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, 163 (15%) of 1055 screened patients were enrolled, with 80 participants (49%) randomly assigned to the TFESI group and 83 participants (51%) to the surgery group. At week 18, ODQ scores were 30.02 (SD 24.38) for 63 assessed patients in the TFESI group and 22.30 (19.83) for 61 assessed patients in the surgery group. Mean improvement was 24.52 points (18.89) for the TFESI group and 26.74 points (21.35) for the surgery group, with an estimated treatment difference of −4.25 (95% CI −11.09 to 2.59; p = 0.22). There were four serious adverse events in four participants associated with surgery, and none with TFESI. Compared with TFESI, surgery had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £38 737 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and a 0.17 probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Interpretation

For patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc, with symptom duration of up to 12 months, TFESI should be considered as a first invasive treatment option. Surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI.

Surgery versus epidural steroid injections

One trial (n = 100) with a high risk of bias was identified that compared results following microdiscectomy with results after epidural steroid injection. Patients undergoing discectomy had the most rapid decrease in their symptoms. The decrease in leg pain in the discectomy group was significantly greater than in the epidural steroid injection group at 3- and 6-month follow-up intervals, but not beyond 1 year. There were no significant differences between groups for back pain throughout the follow-up. Of the 50 patients, 27 who received a steroid injection had a subsequent microdiscectomy. Outcomes in this cross-over group were similar to those of the surgery group. In conclusion, there is very low quality evidence (high risk of bias) that discectomy was beneficial over epidural steroid injections for the short term only.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — cost-effectiveness of surgical options is supported, with microdiscectomy showing favorable value across multiple analyses; the committee "felt that there was strong and consistent evidence supporting the cost effectiveness of microdiscectomy for patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation who desired surgical treatment". In the SPORT cohort, Tosteson et al evaluated outcomes "at two and four years", finding that "at two years, lumbar discectomy compared to nonsurgical management was felt to be cost effective with a cost per QALY of between $35,000 and $70,000 depending upon the payer", and with continued follow-up "the cost per QALY of surgical intervention dropped to approximately $20,000 per QALY". In a prospective registry of "1822 workers", Hansson et al "estimated the cost per QALY of surgical intervention to be $4,648.00 and reported that surgical treatment had better cost utility than nonsurgical treatment". Malter et al reported that microdiscectomy was cost effective "with an estimated cost per QALY of $12,000–$30,000 depending upon the payer".

### Effectiveness of microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation: a randomized controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up [^115zjCto]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial.

Objective

To assess effectiveness of microdiscectomy in lumbar disc herniation patients with 6 to 12 weeks of symptoms but no absolute indication for surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

There is limited evidence in favor of discectomy for prolonged symptoms of lumbar disc herniation. However, only one randomized trial has directly compared discectomy with conservative treatment.

Methods

Fifty-six patients (age range, 20–50 years) with a lumbar disc herniation, clinical findings of nerve root compression, and radicular pain lasting 6 to 12 weeks were randomized to microdiscectomy or conservative management. Fifty patients (89%) were available at the 2-year follow-up. Leg pain intensity was the primary outcome measure.

Results

There were no clinically significant differences between the groups in leg or back pain intensity, subjective disability, or health-related quality of life over the 2-year follow-up, although discectomy seemed to be associated with a more rapid initial recovery. In a subgroup analysis, discectomy was superior to conservative treatment when the herniation was at L4-L5.

Conclusions

Lumbar microdiscectomy offered only modest short-term benefits in patients with sciatica due to disc extrusion or sequester. Spinal level of the herniation may be an important factor modifying effectiveness of surgery, but this hypothesis needs verification.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyQ8n]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### Treatment of chronic low back pain-new approaches on the horizon [^111FdEK3]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

Given that many people with intervertebral lumbar disc herniation have a high likelihood of recovery spontaneously without surgical interventions, and the fact that some people are not good surgical candidates, there are many other methods that are used to manage pain from this condition. The areas of treatment can be divided into conservative management and invasive treatments. When starting conservative management, most people begin with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. Pharmacological interventions include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, tramadol, corticosteroids, and even short courses of opioids for moderate-to-severe pain, in accordance with the World Health Organization's stepladder approach to managing chronic pain. Pharmacological strategies are mainly aimed at symptom control until pain abates. Non-pharmacological strategies include physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, or therapies such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation. The majority of people improve with conservative treatments exclusively or in conjunction with a multimodal analgesic regimen as mentioned previously.,

If conservative treatment does not provide symptom relief, more invasive treatments are generally considered. Epidural glucocorticoid injections have long been touted as the first step in invasive interventional management of symptomatic intervertebral herniated discs. Whether by a lumbar interlaminar, caudal, or transforaminal approach, epidural injections have been shown to reduce pain scores and disability mainly in the short term (usually at 2 weeks) as well as delay the need for surgical intervention for as long as 13–28 months. Patients may experience relief for a period of time but may require additional repeat injections following pain recurrence. Whereas the efficacy of steroids in epidural injections is controversial, a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials of epidural injections for the treatment of radicular low back pain confirmed that epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids resulted in significant improvement in pain and functionality, as well as decreased opioid consumption. However, epidural injections have not been shown to decrease the need for eventual subsequent surgery in patients with chronic pain secondary to herniated intervertebral disc. Are there any other treatment options for patients who fail both conservative and interventional procedures before undergoing surgical procedures (discectomy, disc arthroplasty, spinal fusion, etc.) in the management of symptomatic lumbar radicular low back pain (Figure 3)?

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation… [^112PSLAP]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Patients were considered for inclusion if they were 18 years and older and diagnosed by participating physicians during the study enrollment period as having intervertebral disk herniation and persistent symptoms despite some nonoperative treatment for at least 6 weeks. The content of preenrollment nonoperative care was not prespecified in the protocol but included education/counseling, physical therapy, epidural injections, chiropractic therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and opioid analgesics. The nonoperative treatment group received "usual care, " with the study protocol recommending that the minimum nonsurgical treatment include at least active physical therapy, education/counseling with home exercise instruction, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if tolerated. Other nonoperative treatments were listed, and physicians were encouraged to individualize treatment to the patient; all nonoperative treatments were tracked prospectively.

13, 17. A variety of nonoperative treatments were used during the study. Most patients received education/counseling and anti-inflammatory medications; 46% received opiates; more than 50% received injections; and 29% were prescribed activity restriction. Forty-four percent received active physical therapy during the trial; however, 67% had received it prior to enrollment. SPORT findings are consistent with clinical experience in that relief of leg pain was the most striking and consistent improvement with surgery. Importantly, all patients in this trial had leg pain with physical examination and imaging findings that confirmed a disk herniation. There was little evidence of harm from either treatment. No patients in either group developed cauda equina syndrome; 95% of surgical patients had no intraoperative complications.

The observed improvements with nonoperative treatment in SPORT were greater than those in the MLSS, resulting in the small estimated treatment effect. The nonoperative improvement of 37, 35, and 9 points in bodily pain, physical function, and sciatica bothersomeness, respectively, were much greater than the improvements of 20, 18, and 3 points reported in the MLSS. The greater improvement with nonoperative treatment in SPORT may be related to the large proportion of patients who underwent surgery in this group.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### Herniated lumbar disc [^115dnJBD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc is a displacement of disc material (nucleus pulposus or annulus fibrosis) beyond the intervertebral disc space. The highest prevalence is among people aged 30 to 50 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. There is little evidence to suggest that drug treatments are effective in treating herniated disc.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, non-drug treatments, and surgery for herniated lumbar disc? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 37 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics, antidepressants, bed rest, corticosteroids (epidural injections), cytokine inhibitors (infliximab), discectomy (automated percutaneous, laser, microdiscectomy, standard), exercise therapy, heat, ice, massage, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), percutaneous disc decompression, spinal manipulation, and traction.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111RNn9Z]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We prospectively registered this review on PROSPERO (CRD42021269997) and have followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines.

Data sources and searches

We searched Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from their database inception to June 2022 (supplemental file 1). We also tracked citations on relevant systematic reviews and included studies. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, then full text articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus (supplemental file 2).

Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in adults with sciatica of any duration due to a herniated disc (diagnosed through radiological examination). Eligible interventions were any surgical treatment using any approach, including open, micro, or endoscopic discectomy; percutaneous (plasma) disc decompression; and chemonucleolysis. Comparators were any non-surgical treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, interventional treatments (eg, epidural injection), or combinations of these. We deemed studies using placebo or sham surgeries as comparators as also eligible. Trials that reported data for pain, disability, or other outcomes of interest (see outcomes section for full details) were included. We did not restrict by language, geography, or publication date.

We excluded studies with mixed populations (eg, lumbar disc herniation and lumbar stenosis) if separate data for lumbar disc herniation could not be obtained. We also excluded studies that enrolled participants with lumbar disc herniation combined with spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis or with any serious spinal pathologies (eg, infection, tumour, fractures, major trauma, systemic inflammatory diseases, or pregnancy related sciatica).

### Surgical versus nonoperative treatment for lumbar disc herniation: four-year results for the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) [^1125p7b4]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Concurrent, prospective, randomized, and observational cohort study.

Objective

To assess the 4-year outcomes of surgery versus nonoperative care.

Summary Of Background Data

Although randomized trials have demonstrated small short-term differences in favor of surgery, long-term outcomes comparing surgical to nonoperative treatment remain controversial.

Methods

Surgical candidates with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation meeting SPORT eligibility criteria enrolled into prospective, randomized (501 participants), and observational cohorts (743 participants) at 13 spine clinics in 11 US states. Interventions were standard open discectomy versus usual nonoperative care. Main outcome measures were changes from baseline in the SF-36 Bodily Pain (BP) and Physical Function (PF) scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI - AAOS/Modems version) assessed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and annually thereafter.

Results

Nonadherence to treatment assignment caused the intent-to-treat analyses to underestimate the treatment effects. In the 4-year combined as-treated analysis, those receiving surgery demonstrated significantly greater improvement in all the primary outcome measures (mean change surgery vs. nonoperative; treatment effect; 95% CI): BP (45.6 vs. 30.7; 15.0; 11.8 to 18.1), PF (44.6 vs. 29.7; 14.9;12.0 to 17.8) and ODI (-38.1 vs. -24.9; -13.2; -15.6 to -10.9). The percent working was similar between the surgery and nonoperative groups, 84.4% versus 78.4% respectively.

Conclusion

In a combined as-treated analysis at 4 years, patients who underwent surgery for a lumbar disc herniation achieved greater improvement than nonoperatively treated patients in all primary and secondary outcomes except work status.

Large lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — randomized comparison of microdiscectomy versus epidural steroid injection reported that of the 100 patients included in the study, 50 were assigned to each treatment group, outcomes were assessed at three years, surgically treated patients showed significant motor improvement at one and three months but not at two years, the surgically treated group expressed 92%–98% satisfaction versus 42%–56% for the epidural steroid injection group, and 27 patients failed injections and crossed over. This potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that patients with large disc herniations, occupying more than 25% of the spinal canal, with symptoms that do not resolve in six weeks, do better with surgery than epidural injections, although about 50% of patients who have injections will improve.

Assessment of risk of bias for the included studies

Two review authors (SR and MM) working independently of each other conducted the risk-of-bias assessment and data extraction. Risk of bias of the individual studies was assessed using the criteria list advised by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG), which consists of 11 items that assess internal validity. Items and operationalisation are given in Table 2. Items were scored as positive if they fulfilled the criteria, negative when bias was likely or marked as inconclusive if there was insufficient information. Differences in the scoring of the risk-of-bias assessment and data extraction were discussed during a consensus meeting. The item for compliance was not scored because this item was irrelevant for single-session interventions, such as surgery. A study with a low risk of bias was defined as fulfilling six or more of the validity items.

Table 2
Items from the risk-of-bias tool and criteria for operationalisation

Data collection and analysis

Included studies were categorised under separate comparisons with clinically homogeneous characteristics. An a priori list of items was used for the data extraction, consisting of both descriptive data (e.g. study population, type of interventions) and quantitative data regarding the primary and secondary outcome measures. With sufficient clinically and statistically homogeneous and comparable reported outcomes, data was planned to be pooled with the aid of Revman 5. To identify publication bias, funnel plots were planned to be examined. In case meta-analysis was not feasible, a best evidence synthesis was anticipated using low-risk-of-bias studies. The overall quality of the evidence was graded as "High", "Moderate", "Low", or "Very low", according to the GRADE approach by Furlan et al. Single studies were considered imprecise (i.e. sparse data) and provide "low quality evidence", which could be further downgraded to "very low quality evidence" if there were also limitations in design or indirectness.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^112qaGEN]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the application of clinical methodology and decision-making thoroughly tested by duly controlled peer-reviewed studies. With the exponentially increasing number of publications, EBM aims to shift the traditional paradigm of making decisions based purely on the judgment of the physician or the experience of senior doctors to the use of results obtained from systematic and unbiased research in a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment model with the highest available evidence. The definition of EBM has evolved, but the most widely accepted definition was from Sackett et al. in 1996 and revised in 2000. In summary, it stated that clinicians should use the best, unbiased, clinically sound, and up-to-date data available on a patient basis in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery are the pioneers of spine surgery throughout the world. Neurosurgeons have utilized EBM and clinical guidelines to make sound decisions for the last three decades. However, the increasing number of guidelines have questioned the validity of these recommendations as they may stray away from the rigorous process outlined by The Institute of Medicine (IOM). Orthopedic Surgery also recognized the importance of EBM in the early 2000s, and journal sections reserved for "Evidence-Based Orthopedics" emerged. The classical paradigm of trying non-operative treatment first and operative treatment, if the first step fails, has shifted towards surgical treatment vs. other treatment options.

Evidence-Based Spine Surgery (EBSS) has also emerged parallel to the development of EBM. The North American Spine Society (NASS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) frequently publish guidelines with evidence-based suggestions to provide the highest evidence-based decisions in spinal pathologies. For example, EBSS supported by randomized controlled trials has shown discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), decompression of spinal stenosis, and decompression with fusion of degenerative spondylolisthesis offer clinical benefit in relieving lower back and radicular pain compared to conservative treatment. However, pursuing EBSS as the sole deciding factor for diagnosing and treating spinal pathologies is unrealistic. Most of the publications on spine surgery are case-controlled retrospective cohorts or case series. Thus, the number of high-quality evidence parallel to spine surgery development is lacking. Considering the value of EBM and the probability of further implementation into decision-making, this study sheds light on the reception and application of EBM by spinal surgeons and the use of evidence-based modalities in their clinical practice.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114kg16R]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against fusion for specific patient populations with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy whose symptoms warrant surgery, and Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence); the best evidence available suggests that outcomes are equivalent in patients with radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation whether or not a fusion is performed.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (NASS) define how study quality informs recommendation wording and strength. Levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus), and levels are assigned to studies prior to developing recommendations; recommendations are then graded based on the level of evidence. Grades of Recommendation pair evidence tiers with language: A uses Level I studies with consistent findings and the recommendation wording "is recommended"; B uses Level II or III studies with consistent findings and the wording "suggest"; C uses Level IV or V studies and indicates a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option"; I denotes insufficient or conflicting evidence and states that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against". The guideline notes that significant shortcomings in study execution can downgrade a study's potential level of evidence.
