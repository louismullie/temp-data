## Question

What is the recommended treatment for complex regional pain syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of care and whether interdisciplinary management is truly the cornerstone. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and acknowledge uncertainty. Next, I will examine functional restoration and physical therapy, including graded motor imagery and mirror therapy. After that, I need to review pharmacologic options and their evidence base. Then, I will consider psychological and behavioral therapies. Next, I should evaluate interventional procedures and neuromodulation. I will also address special populations such as pediatrics and orofacial CRPS. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, staged algorithm and close with key takeaways and caveats, ensuring I continuously check claims against the cited literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle. The most consistent theme across contemporary guidelines and reviews is that CRPS is best managed with an interdisciplinary, functionally focused program rather than any single-modality therapy, and that functional restoration is the primary goal with pain control as a facilitator of activity, not the sole endpoint [^115VjCr3] [^116BE912] [^114h1xX6].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence strength before overcommitting. High-certainty evidence for any specific CRPS therapy remains limited. The 2023 Cochrane overview found no high-certainty evidence for any intervention, with only low- to moderate-certainty signals for a few modalities, so recommendations must integrate guideline consensus, mechanism-based reasoning, and pragmatic clinical judgment while being transparent about uncertainty [^111YC6Mw] [^1113hYR8].

> I will now examine functional restoration and physical therapy as the cornerstone. Physical therapy emphasizing desensitization, graded loading, and reactivation is repeatedly described as first-line, with the caveat that programs should be individualized and paced to avoid pain flares; evidence quality is low but consistent across guidelines and observational data, and some trials show improvements in function even when pain changes are modest [^116Qj84G] [^1142ugw3].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of cortically directed therapies. Graded motor imagery and mirror therapy show signals for clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function in small RCTs and meta-analyses, though the certainty is very low; nonetheless, they are commonly integrated into rehabilitation protocols and may be particularly helpful for body perception disturbances and learned disuse patterns [^1142ugw3] [^115eHqmY] [^111yG24H].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic options and their evidentiary footing. Bisphosphonates have the most consistent signal for short-term pain reduction in early CRPS, but with increased adverse events and uncertain durability. Ketamine infusions can provide transient relief in selected patients. Calcitonin may help short term in some contexts. Neuropathic pain agents such as gabapentinoids, TCAs, and SNRIs are frequently used with extrapolation from general neuropathic pain evidence, though CRPS-specific data are limited. NSAIDs may help inflammatory components or comorbid myofascial pain but have not shown robust CRPS-specific benefit [^111YC6Mw] [^112fRjsA] [^112pjk8P] [^116Hc5ZC].

> Let me consider psychological and behavioral therapies carefully. Although high-quality CRPS-specific RCTs are sparse, CBT, ACT, and graded exposure to address pain-related fear, catastrophizing, and learned disuse are recommended as core elements within interdisciplinary programs. Indirect evidence from chronic pain broadly supports moderate benefits on pain, mood, and function, and CRPS-specific uncontrolled series and RCTs suggest improvements in fear, disability, and pain when integrated with rehabilitation [^111u4GPQ] [^111sAcG1] [^113WXjs3].

> I should double-check the role of interventional procedures. Sympathetic blocks have longstanding clinical use but contemporary systematic reviews show no consistent analgesic benefit over placebo or other active treatments, so they should not be considered routine; neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or dorsal root ganglion stimulation can be considered for refractory cases after conservative care, with emerging RCT data and meta-analyses suggesting meaningful responder rates, though evidence quality and access vary and trials are ongoing [^111CMc6s] [^113SCH7c] [^115HwgRq].

> But wait, what about special populations and phenotypes. In pediatrics, early mobilization, CBT-informed rehabilitation, and family engagement are emphasized, with most children improving; surveillance suggests underuse of evidence-aligned modalities like graded motor imagery and overuse of simple analgesics, highlighting a gap between evidence and practice; for orofacial CRPS, structured models such as STEPS integrate education, GMI, sensory exposure, and targeted exercises and have shown promise in case-based evidence [^113a7XNk] [^114PZr7s] [^115R6k7x].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged approach while acknowledging uncertainty. Early CRPS should prioritize rapid education, desensitization, and graded reactivation with concurrent, carefully selected pharmacologic adjuncts to enable function. Persistent CRPS warrants formal interdisciplinary pain programs with embedded psychological care, with escalation to neuromodulation only after failure of optimized conservative therapy. Throughout, treatment should be individualized to pain phenotype, comorbidities, and goals, and expectations should be set that complete pain resolution is uncommon but functional gains are achievable [^114h1xX6] [^112TcZ29] [^113SCH7c].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that vitamin C is a proven preventive after fractures; I should correct that. Earlier small studies suggested benefit, but a large RCT found vitamin C increased early CRPS incidence without longer-term benefit, so routine vitamin C prophylaxis should not be recommended outside of research or specific protocols [^1154hnBE].

> I need to ensure we address measurement and monitoring. Given the multidimensional nature of CRPS, outcomes should span pain, function, emotional well-being, self-efficacy, and global impression of change. The COMPACT core set provides a standardized framework to harmonize research and clinical tracking, which can guide iterative adjustments in care plans [^113sbvjV] [^117YBxgf].

> Finally, let me reconsider the key takeaways and make sure they align with the evidence. There is no single proven cure for CRPS. Interdisciplinary, function-first care is the most defensible approach. Evidence for specific modalities is limited and often low certainty, so shared decision-making, careful selection of therapies based on mechanism and patient goals, and vigilant reassessment are essential. Early, coordinated intervention likely improves outcomes, and even modest functional gains can translate into meaningful quality-of-life improvements for patients [^115VjCr3] [^1113hYR8] [^114h1xX6].

The best treatment for CRPS is a **multidisciplinary, function-first approach** [^115VjCr3] that combines early physical therapy [^116Qj84G], psychological support [^115JdBTG], and targeted pharmacologic therapy [^111YC6Mw], with escalation to interventional options if needed [^113SCH7c]. Early, **aggressive rehabilitation** is essential to prevent disability and chronicity [^114KywRo], while psychological interventions address fear-avoidance and catastrophizing [^111sAcG1]. Pharmacologic options such as bisphosphonates [^114rAhwc], ketamine [^112fRjsA], and gabapentinoids [^112pjk8P] may be used selectively, and neuromodulation (SCS/DRG) [^115HwgRq] is considered for refractory cases [^113SCH7c]. There is no single cure, and treatment must be individualized and adjusted over time [^112e8fP9].

## Multidisciplinary care and functional restoration

- **Interdisciplinary approach**: Coordinated care by pain specialists, physical and occupational therapists, psychologists, and rehabilitation physicians is recommended [^116BE912] [^112TcZ29].

- **Functional restoration**: Emphasis on restoring function and mobility through graded exercise, desensitization, and mirror therapy [^1142ugw3] [^115eHqmY].

- **Patient education**: Early education on self-management, pacing, and activity modification is critical [^116Ze8Rn].

---

## Pharmacological management

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bisphosphonates | - Pamidronate <br/> - Neridronate | Moderate | - Reduce pain and inflammation <br/> - Particularly effective in early CRPS [^114e15K3] |
| Ketamine | IV ketamine infusions | Moderate | - NMDA antagonist <br/> - Useful for refractory pain [^112fRjsA] [^115pVjXc] |
| Gabapentinoids | - Gabapentin <br/> - Pregabalin | Low | - Neuropathic pain management <br/> - Commonly used [^113QkBjh] |
| Antidepressants | - Duloxetine <br/> - Amitriptyline | Low | - Neuropathic pain and mood stabilization [^112pjk8P] [^112e8fP9] |
| Corticosteroids | Prednisolone | Low | Short-term use for acute inflammatory flares [^116HK2D9] |

---

## Psychological interventions

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Reduces pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance, and improves function [^113WXjs3] [^1146PfSR].

- **Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)**: Enhances pain acceptance and quality of life [^114xgQbn].

- **Graded exposure therapy**: Targets pain-related fear and improves mobility [^111sAcG1].

---

## Interventional and advanced therapies

- **Sympathetic nerve blocks**: May provide short-term relief in selected patients, though evidence is limited [^111CMc6s].

- **Spinal cord stimulation (SCS)**: Considered for refractory cases, with moderate evidence supporting pain reduction and functional improvement [^115HwgRq] [^113SCH7c].

- **Dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRG)**: Emerging option with promising results in focal pain syndromes [^115HwgRq] [^113SCH7c].

---

## Emerging and experimental therapies

Emerging options include **repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)** [^112Ts67M], which is under investigation for non-invasive neuromodulation, and **low-dose naltrexone (LDN)**, which is being studied for its anti-inflammatory and neuromodulatory effects [^117NKFEm].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Early diagnosis and intervention significantly improve outcomes [^114LE4W4]; however, **chronic CRPS** often persists and requires ongoing multidisciplinary management [^115VjCr3]. Individualized treatment plans are essential, as responses vary widely [^114rqzbn].

---

## Conclusion

The best treatment for CRPS is a **multidisciplinary approach** that prioritizes functional restoration, psychological support, and targeted pharmacologic therapy, with escalation to interventional options as needed. Early, aggressive rehabilitation and individualized care are key to optimizing outcomes [^113buSpK].

### Complex regional pain syndrome or limb pain: a plea for a critical approach [^111sJnWk]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Most frequently, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) develops after a trauma and affects distal parts of the limbs. Early recognition and initiation of adequate treatment is crucial for a favorable outcome. On the other hand, misdiagnosing other disorders as CRPS is detrimental because more appropriate treatment may be withheld from the patients. Despite intensive research, a specific biomarker or paraclinical measure for CRPS diagnosis is still lacking. Instead, clinical criteria approved by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and latest adapted in 2019 are central for diagnosing CPRS. Thus, the CRPS diagnosis remains challenging with the risk of a "deliberate diagnosis" for unexplained pain, while at the same time a delayed CRPS diagnosis prevents early treatment and full recovery. CRPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. To clinically diagnose CRPS, a vigorous exclusion of "other diseases that would better explain the signs and symptoms" are needed before the patients should be referred to tertiary centers for specific pain treatment. We highlight red flags that suggest "non-CRPS" limb pain despite clinical similarity to CRPS. Clinical and neurological examination and paraclinical evaluation of a probably CRPS patient are summarized. Finally, we pinpoint common differential diagnoses for CRPS. This perspective might help CRPS researchers and caregivers to reach a correct diagnosis and choose the right treatment, regardless whether for CRPS mimics or CRPS itself.

Figure 3
Current CRPS treatment paradigm based upon the HCPs in this study.

As HCPs move into second- and third-line treatments, side effects, such as weight gain, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal issues, become a bigger concern. Medications are combined and substituted until a balance between efficacy and tolerable side effects is achieved. If the patient has a history of depression or anxiety, HCPs may prescribe duloxetine or another anti-depressant early during treatment and may consult with a psychiatrist to help with management.

When second-line treatments fail to relieve pain, HCPs may try alternative, non-traditional treatments. These are often suggested by patients, vary greatly between cases and are guided by patients' financial means, ability to travel and hesitation to resort to more extreme measures. Opioids, though rarely considered an effective treatment for CRPS, may be considered as last-line treatments, once all other options have been exhausted. Spinal cord stimulators and ketamine are considered the most risky and costly options. A psychological evaluation must be performed to authorize a spinal cord stimulator, and because of the emotional impact of living with CRPS, many patients do not pass the evaluation. Unfortunately, once patients reach this point, adherence to physical therapy is more likely to suffer.

### Body perception disturbance and pain reduction in longstanding complex regional pain syndrome following a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program [^111yG24H]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome recommend multidisciplinary rehabilitation, yet limited evidence exists to support the effectiveness of this approach. Body perception disturbance, a common and debilitating feature of complex regional pain syndrome, is recommended by guidelines as important to treat. However, no study has yet explored whether disturbances change in response to multidisciplinary rehabilitation. We aimed to determine whether there is a change in body perception disturbance and pain following a two-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for complex regional pain syndrome.

Methods

Retrospective clinical data from complex regional pain syndrome patients who completed the program between September 2014 and December 2016 were extracted and anonymized. Data collected pre- and post rehabilitation comprising the Bath Body Perception Disturbance scale and a pain intensity numerical rating scale were analyzed.

Results

Thirty complete data sets were analyzed from a sample of 50 consecutive patient records. After the program, there was a significant reduction in body perception disturbance (P < 0.0001), strength of negative emotional feelings (P < 0.0001), and pain (P = 0.0038). There was a significant correlation between a change in disturbance and pain (r = 0.44, P = 0.024). No relationship was found between the duration of symptoms and changes in disturbance (r = 0.04, P = 0.82).

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that both body perception disturbance and pain reduce after rehabilitation. Findings suggest that targeting these disturbances may be important in reducing pain and may be a potentially useful measure for recovery. Controlled trials are required to confirm the effectiveness of rehabilitation and determine what factors are responsible for these reductions.

### Recommendations for a first core outcome measurement set for complex regional PAin syndrome clinical sTudies (COMPACT) [^113sbvjV]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a persistent pain condition that remains incompletely understood and challenging to treat. Historically, a wide range of different outcome measures have been used to capture the multidimensional nature of CRPS. This has been a significant limiting factor in the advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms and management of CRPS. In 2013, an international consortium of patients, clinicians, researchers, and industry representatives was established, to develop and agree on a minimum core set of standardised outcome measures for use in future CRPS clinical research, including but not limited to clinical trials within adult populations. The development of a core measurement set was informed through workshops and supplementary work, using an iterative consensus process. "What is the clinical presentation and course of CRPS, and what factors influence it?" was agreed as the most pertinent research question that our standardised set of patient-reported outcome measures should be selected to answer. The domains encompassing the key concepts necessary to answer the research question were agreed as follows: pain, disease severity, participation and physical function, emotional and psychological function, self-efficacy, catastrophizing, and patient's global impression of change. The final core measurement set included the optimum generic or condition-specific patient-reported questionnaire outcome measures, which captured the essence of each domain, and 1 clinician-reported outcome measure to capture the degree of severity of CRPS. The next step is to test the feasibility and acceptability of collecting outcome measure data using the core measurement set in the CRPS population internationally.

### Pharmacotherapy of complex regional pain syndrome [^111xfxme]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome has both nociceptive/inflammatory and neuropathic elements and is always (by definition) associated with abnormal activity of the sympathetic nervous system. There is good evidence that complex regional pain syndrome, as currently conceptualized, ultimately includes central sensitization and has motor abnormalities. The lack of a standard diagnostic test or a specific mechanistically based diagnostic scheme has hindered the conduct of well-designed trials, and to date, there is very little evidence supporting an effective treatment. Fortunately, some randomized, controlled trials of drug therapies have been conducted, and systematic reviews have been published of related neuropathic conditions, from which the results have been extrapolated to clinical use in complex regional pain syndrome. The following article presents an overview of available data regarding drug and interventional treatment options for complex regional pain syndrome and of those relevant pharmacotherapies we can derive from the neuropathy literature. As with most chronic pain syndromes, pharmacotherapy coupled with functional restoration and an interdisciplinary approach to treatment are essential to a successful outcome.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^117NzziS]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare, chronic pain disorder. It is challenging for patients and physicians because it leads to significant morbidity due to chronic pain that may last for years. CRPS typically develops four to six weeks after direct trauma, such as an injury or surgery, and causes pain that is out of proportion to the inciting injury. It is associated with multiple physiologic mechanisms, affecting skin texture or localized sensory, motor, sudomotor, and vasomotor pathways. The diagnosis is made clinically using standardized diagnostic criteria. Ancillary testing is not necessary for the diagnosis of CRPS but can be useful to rule out alternative diagnoses. There are two types of CRPS, type 1 and type 2, although treatment is the same for both. There is no single proven treatment modality for CRPS, and there have been no large randomized controlled studies of CRPS treatments. Most treatments are based on studies of their use for other types of neuropathic pain. The mainstay of treatment is to improve function of the affected body part and to decrease pain; therefore, treatment requires multiple modalities, including medications, behavioral health interventions, and referral to a pain specialist.

Introduction

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic and debilitating pain condition that typically develops following trauma, operation, or limb immobilization, with a reported prevalence of 5.46 to 26.2 per 100,000 individuals annually.CRPS occurs more commonly in females than in males, with reported female-to-male ratios ranging from 2:1 to 4:1. Patients with CRPS often experience substantial socioeconomic challenges. Approximately 30%–40% of affected patients with CRPS are unable to return to their jobs, and 27%–35% require workplace adaptations. At diagnosis, total healthcare and pain medication prescription costs are 2.17 and 2.56 times higher than baseline, respectively, peaking within the first year and gradually decreasing over time. Overall, their healthcare costs are approximately 20% higher than those of non-CRPS patients. Consequently, CRPS is associated with significantly reduced quality of life and represents a notable societal burden.

It is characterized by disproportionate pain not confined to a single peripheral nerve distribution, accompanied by varying combinations of sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, trophic, and motor abnormalities. CRPS has previously been referred to by several names, including reflex sympathetic dystrophy, causalgia, Sudeck's atrophy, algoneurodystrophy, and shoulder-hand syndrome. In 1994, a consensus conference in Orlando standardized the terminology as CRPS. The diagnosis of CRPS lacks specific confirmatory tests and is primarily clinical, based on patient history and symptomatology. In 2003, the Budapest criteria were introduced by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)to improve diagnostic consistency and were revised in 2012. In 2019, the IASP CRPS Special Interest Group convened a workshop in Valencia and proposed pragmatic updates to diagnostic instructions and taxonomy (Table 1). These revisions refined the definitions of CRPS type II (CRPS II) and CRPS Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), added a third CRPS subtype — CRPS with Remission of Some Features, and clarified symptom assessment procedures, while retaining the original phrasing to preserve criterion validity.

### Multidisciplinary approach and the self-training educative pain sensation (STEPS) model for managing orofacial complex regional pain syndrome [^115R6k7x]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Treatment

The diagnosis and treatment of O-CRPS can be complex due to the rarity of the condition. Designing randomised controlled trial studies, the gold standard for evaluating treatment efficacy, proves challenging because of the limited number of diagnosed cases. This scarcity of research makes it difficult to establish a single accepted treatment approach for O-CRPS.

However, adhering to current best practices offers valuable guidance in managing patients with this condition. In this case, the patient's treatment programme followed established protocols for non-invasive management of O-CRPS type 1. This programme adopted the STEPS model, a comprehensive and patient-centred approach outlined by Parkitny et al. The STEPS model incorporates four key components detailed in table 2: pain education, graded motor imagery (GMI), sensory exposure and facial muscle exercises. The overall goals are to reduce pain intensity and improve function, increase self-efficacy and confidence in managing pain, improve mood, and the patient's quality of life.

Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Given their anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2 inhibitors, corticosteroids, and free-radical scavengers are potentially useful for addressing pain that may be related to the inflammatory component of CRPS. However, CRPS inflammation may be largely neurogenic (initiated by inflammatory mediators from the terminals of afferent nociceptors), and no drugs have proven effective for this type of inflammation. Many patients may have spontaneous improvement in inflammatory features over time — even those patients whose pain does not get better.

This class of drugs would appear to be potentially useful for both prophylaxis and rescue, although this has not been directly evaluated in clinical trials. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase and prevent the synthesis of prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and hyperalgesia and thus may inhibit nociceptive processing. Our clinical experience finds NSAIDs effective for some CRPS patients (level 4 evidence). In addition to treating CRPS, NSAIDs have also been used to treat other neuropathic pain conditions, particularly when associated with inflammation (level 3 evidence). CRPS usually affects distal extremities, while more proximal muscle groups, such as in the shoulder, frequently hurt (in response to persistent guarding of the limb) without directly being affected by CRPS. This type of myofascial pain/muscle pain may respond to NSAIDs.

Research support for NSAID utility in CRPS is lacking, with one study showing no analgesic value in treating CRPS. Specific NSAIDs may be more useful than others. Ketoprofen, for example, may have substantial anti-bradykinin and anti-prostacyclin effects in addition to the typical anti-prostaglandin effect. Inhibitors selective for cyclooxygenase-2 (e.g. celecoxib) have not been tested in CRPS, although are reported anecdotally to be of some use (level 4 evidence). Highly publicized concerns of cardiac risk somewhat limit the widespread use of COX-2 inhibitors. We note that acetaminophen is currently not recommended for treatment of chronic disease due to the potential for liver toxicity with regular or high dose use.

Efficacy of Psychological Interventions in CRPS Patients

A PubMed literature review reveals a number of studies that have addressed efficacy of psychological interventions for CRPS, although nearly all of these reflect uncontrolled designs that permit only limited conclusions to be drawn. An additional caveat regarding these studies is that the criteria used to diagnose CRPS were often not adequately described and in all likelihood varied substantially across studies. This lack of consistent or specified diagnostic criteria limits the ability to generalize these results to patients diagnosed according to current IASP criteria for CRPS.

A summary of studies specifically reporting on efficacy of psychological treatments for CRPS is presented in Appendix A1. This reveals few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically testing psychological interventions in CRPS patients. Fialka et al. (level 2) randomized 18 CRPS patients to receive either home PT or home PT plus once-weekly autogenic relaxation training for ten weeks. Both groups showed similar improvements in pain, range of motion, and edema, although patients in the PT+Autogenics group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in limb temperature. Although low statistical power due to the small sample limited the ability to adequately evaluate intervention efficacy, these results suggest that relaxation-based interventions may have some benefit in management of CRPS.

Challenge 3: defining subtypes of CRPS

Just as there is controversy regarding subtyping CRPS into types 1 and 2, based on the presence or absence of significant neural damage as described above, so is there little consensus on staging CRPS according to duration or severity. At one time CRPS was empirically staged according to specific characteristics that occurred in a suggested time-frame (Table 4). This staging provided at best only very limited prognostic information on a small group of patients with very severe CRPS and has not been found to be clinically useful in the majority. Other suggested ways of subtyping CRPS have been examined but not achieved universal acceptance. The CRPS severity score provides grading of severity of CRPS but cutoff scores for various outcome measures have not yet been established.

In clinical practice it is hard to predict the outcome at first presentation in any one patient with CRPS. It is also hard to predict response to different treatment interventions and hence to predict overall prognosis in CRPS. Certain age groups, such as adolescents, seem to have better and more positive predictive outcomes than others. In general, early diagnosis and early intervention with a variety of strategies, including education, psychological support, and mobilization, remain a hallmark of standard care. Additionally, early intervention with evidence-based treatments will improve outcomes across a range of clinical presentations.

Comment

Better classification of subtypes of CRPS may aid choice of management strategies and clinical outcomes.

### Treatment of complex regional pain syndrome of the lower extremity [^1147Rwse]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome, formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or causalgia, is a difficult therapeutic problem for the orthopaedic surgeon treating an affected lower extremity. Despite many divergent and often conflicting theories, the cause of the severe pain, alterations in regional blood flow, and edema is unknown. Interventions that have proved successful for treating similar conditions in the arm and hand frequently do not relieve pain similarly in the lower extremity. Common treatment regimens target individual components of this symptom complex, namely, sympathetic or afferent nerve hyperactivity, vasomotor instability, or regional osteoporosis. Despite widespread use of some of these treatments, few controlled clinical trials quantify their effectiveness. This challenging syndrome is best managed by a multidisciplinary team, including chronic pain management specialists, physical therapists, and orthopaedic surgeons.

### Randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of soticlestat as adjunctive therapy in adults with complex regional pain syndrome [^113ncvWi]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare pain condition with an estimated incidence of 26.2 per 100,000 person-years, and women are two to four times more likely to be affected than men. CRPS typically develops 4–6 weeks after direct trauma and involves sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, trophic, and/or motor abnormalities. Severely affected individuals experience chronic pain and multiple system dysfunctions, which are associated with substantial impairment to daily functioning and degradation of quality of life (QoL).

Given the multifaceted nature of CRPS, an integrated multidisciplinary treatment approach is recommended. Pharmacotherapy and/or interventional procedures are often recommended to manage specific signs and symptoms, together with appropriate physical therapy and psychological interventions to help to ameliorate symptoms. However, the condition remains difficult to treat and, with few treatments formally tested in randomized controlled trials, an evidence‐based approach to managing CRPS is difficult.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^111sAcG1]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Another application of behavioral therapy for CRPS management noted previously is graded exposure therapy, an intervention that directly targets pain-related fears and learned disuse. In an initial trial of this intervention, in vivo graded exposure therapy was used to target fear of movement in eight CRPS patients in a series of well-controlled single subject experiments (level 3 evidence). This exposure therapy resulted in significant reductions in pain-related fear of movement, with pain, disability, and other symptoms of CRPS also decreasing significantly in parallel fashion. A subsequent RCT (level 2) showed that compared to treatment as usual (pain-contingent therapy), in vivo exposure led to significantly greater improvements in pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, perceived harmfulness of activities, and disability at 6 month follow-up. These results are consistent with findings based on per protocol (but not intent-to-treat) analyses in a separate RCT (level 2). Recent work suggest that exposure therapy may be more effective for CRPS when it targets a greater variety of feared activities.

Prevention

Analysis and meta-analysis of the first four published studies on the use of vitamin C for prevention of CRPS suggested that vitamin C significantly reduced the likelihood of CRPS developing after limb fracture or surgery with 500 mg vitamin C daily recommended for at least 45 days after injury or surgery. However, a more recent large RCT that used this protocol for the prevention of post-fracture CRPS found that vitamin C was associated with an increased incidence of CRPS at 6 weeks after fracture relative to placebo, with no effect at subsequent time points The potential utility of vitamin C in the prevention of CRPS therefore remains unproven".

To summarize, there are few therapeutic drug trials in CRPS patients that meet criteria for level 1 or level 2 evidence. Clinicians must thus be guided by the results of RCTs for neuropathic pain, smaller specific CRPS trials, and clinical experience. A methodical and patient-centered empirical approach is essential (see Figure 3). New drugs should be trialed one at a time, up to maximum dose, and discontinued if not clearly helpful or where adverse effects are intolerable. The goal is as much to allow progress in functional restoration and rehabilitation as to relieve pain.

The following strategies are suggested for patients who have been diagnosed with CRPS but who cannot begin or progress in the functional restoration algorithm (level 4)*.*It is important to remember that these general suggestions are overruled by individual patient presentation. # It is important to note that certain drugs (e.g. calcitonin), may be associated with analgesia as well as the more primary action.

Summary of Pharmacological Treatment

Currently, no universally accepted pharmacological treatment is considered optimal for CRPS. However, current evidence allows a tentative ranking of available pharmacological treatments according to their efficacy and the quality of supporting research findings.

Bisphosphonates and ketamine demonstrate the most consistent analgesic efficacy in meta-analyses, reporting no serious adverse events, therefore making them preferred treatment options. Systemic corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice and are generally regarded as safe; however, their analgesic effectiveness remains controversial across studies.

Neuropathic pain medications — including anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin, pregabalin), TCAs, and SNRIs — are commonly prescribed for CRPS, but evidence supporting their use in CRPS is limited and is primarily extrapolated from studies on broader neuropathic pain conditions.

Opioids are occasionally prescribed for CRPS, and the evidence supporting their effectiveness is sparse and insufficient to recommend routine use.

Meta-analyses show that NSAIDs, magnesium sulfate, and free radical scavengers (eg, DMSO and NAC) lack significant analgesic benefit and are therefore not recommended as core treatment options.

BTX-A, particularly when administered to the stellate ganglion or other sympathetic regions, demonstrates efficacy and safety in a limited number of studies. However, supporting evidence remains scarce. Calcitonin has yielded conflicting results across studies and is infrequently used in clinical practice. Similarly, alpha-adrenergic modulators are not routinely recommended owing to limited research and a higher risk of adverse effects.

Topical agents, including ketamine cream and lidocaine, remain under-investigated but may offer localized symptom relief.

Finally, emerging therapies, such as immunomodulatory approaches (eg, IVIG and PE) and cytokine or glial cell modulation (eg, TNF-α antagonists and LDN), show preliminary promise in small studies and case reports, but high-quality clinical trials are needed to validate their efficacy and safety.

Future pharmacological research in CRPS should prioritize high-quality RCTs to confirm the efficacy and safety of promising agents such as bisphosphonates and ketamine. Additionally, further studies are needed to better define the role of routinely used medications such as systemic corticosteroids and neuropathic pain medications (anticonvulsants, TCAs, and SNRIs). Emerging therapies — including immunomodulatory agents (eg, IVIG and PE) and cytokine or glial modulators (eg, TNF-α antagonists and LDN) — also warrant further investigation. Future trials should also be designed to account for different CRPS subtypes and disease stages, facilitating the identification of patient groups most likely to benefit from targeted treatment approaches. Additionally, greater attention should be given to evaluating the long-term efficacy of pharmacological treatments.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^111Kqk8F]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a syndrome that is initiated by trauma to an extremity. This results in continuous regional pain that is disproportionate to the extent and healing of the trauma. Besides continuous pain, patients have additional clinical signs such as disturbed blood flow or abnormal sudomotor activity, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes in the affected CRPS extremity. CRPS is a clinical diagnosis based on the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS, that were validated in 2010 and adopted by the IASP in 2012. Nowadays, CRPS is considered a multi-mechanism syndrome, and the experienced continuous pain can be linked to mechanisms such as inflammation, vasomotor disturbances, and peripheral and central sensitization. The presentation of symptoms and signs of CRPS patients can be heterogeneous, because a combination of the underlying mechanisms may be more prominent. Rather than a one-size-fits-all treatment approach, pain specialists nowadays specifically determine the most prominent underlying mechanism(s). These mechanisms are targeted with different pharmacologic treatment categories in order to improve treatment efficacy.

To personalize the management of CRPS, several subgroups have been suggested. The subgroups CRPS type 1 (without nerve lesion) and CRPS type 2 (with nerve lesion) are recognized by the IASP. In addition, different subgroups have been proposed based on clinical presentation (warm/cold), syndrome duration (early/persistent), and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (peripheral/centraland florid/sensory/vasomotor). Recently, our research group suggested creating subgroups on the mechanisms that are targeted by the pharmacotherapeutic options for CRPS: 1) inflammation; 2) peripheral and central sensitization; 3) vasomotor disturbances and 4) motor disturbances. Unfortunately, there is no consensus yet on which classification of CRPS subtypes is best to use.

Different presentations of symptom pain in CRPS can potentially also identify possible subgroups of CRPS that require a distinct treatment strategy. The IASP recognizes nociceptive (tissue damage), neuropathic (nerve injury), and nociplastic pain (sensitized nervous system) as distinct pain types driven by different mechanisms. In this article, we describe a strategy to phenotype CRPS patients based on the three types of chronic pain defined by the IASP because this classification affects the work-up and treatment decisions in chronic pain. Diagnostic tests and biomarkers are developed for nociceptive and neuropathic pain. However, especially to differentiate nociplastic pain, diagnostic tests have to be further developed.

### Diagnostic guidance for chronic complex regional pain syndrome type I and type II from the American society of interventional physicians (ASIPP) [^111ysqiB]. Pain Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a challenging and often disabling condition marked by persistent pain, most commonly in a limb following injury or surgery. It presents with a wide array of symptoms, including intense pain, swelling, alterations in skin color and temperature, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes such as skin and tissue atrophy. While the precise cause of CRPS is not fully understood, it is thought to stem from abnormal nervous system activity, leading to heightened pain sensitivity and inflammatory responses. A thorough understanding of CRPS is essential for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and enhancing patients' quality of life. Although attempts have been made to distinguish between acute and chronic CRPS, there are currently no established diagnostic criteria specific to chronic CRPS in medical literature.

Objective

This ASIPP guidance document offers updated, evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Chronic Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), with a primary focus on introducing novel, time-based diagnostic criteria specific to the chronic phase. These proposed criteria address significant gaps in the current literature, where existing standards, such as the Budapest Criteria, do not sufficiently differentiate between the acute and chronic stages of the condition.

Methods

An expert panel convened by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) conducted a comprehensive literature review and employed a structured consensus process to develop recommendations. Acknowledging that the clinical and pathological characteristics of CRPS change significantly beyond 12 months, the panel proposed chronic-specific diagnostic criteria based on disease duration, clinical history, physical examination findings, and optional diagnostic tests. These draft criteria were refined through multidisciplinary input and expert consensus.

Results

The diagnostic framework for chronic CRPS consists of four key components:General Criteria - Require fulfillment of the Budapest Criteria for at least 12 months, continued recognition of CRPS as a diagnosis of exclusion, and differentiation from generalized nociplastic pain syndromes. History-Based Criteria - Mandate the presence of at least three out of five specific historical features. Physical Examination Criteria - Include asymmetric limb findings, sensory disturbances, and musculoskeletal changes. Optional Diagnostic Testing - May involve assessments such as intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and imaging evidence of regional bone demineralization. This framework builds upon the Budapest Criteria by incorporating time-dependent features of chronic CRPS, including musculoskeletal dystrophy, neurogenic inflammation, and sympathetic dysfunction. Emerging objective tools-such as quantitative sensory testing (QST), skin biopsy for IENFD, functional MRI, and serum biomarkers of neuroinflammation-may further support diagnosis in complex or uncertain cases. Treatment recommendations highlight a multimodal strategy that integrates physical rehabilitation, pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain, sympathetic nerve blocks, and advanced neuromodulation. Emphasis is placed on individualized care pathways tailored to disease stage and patient-specific characteristics.

Conclusions

This article presents the first structured, time-sensitive diagnostic criteria for chronic CRPS, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy and informing treatment strategies. Adoption of these criteria may enhance clinical outcomes and promote further research into the natural history and pathophysiology of CRPS progression.

Physical Therapy

Physical therapy (PT) clearly plays a critical role in functional restoration, and PT activities are designed to complement those of occupational, recreational, and vocational therapy. According to the experienced Mayo Clinic pain management group, "Physical therapy is the cornerstone and first line treatment for CRPS". The physical therapist can help patients increase their range of motion, flexibility, and later strength, through the use of gentle progressive exercise. The physical therapist tries to improve all functional tasks, such as gait training (in lower extremity CRPS), and coordinates/collaborates on all OT, recreational, and vocational goals.

An ongoing discussion concerns the distinction between pain-contingent physical therapy and time-contingent physical therapy approaches. lt is generally accepted that PT should be executed within the bounds of the patients' tolerance and never when the affected limb is insensate (such as immediately after a block) or with CRPS Type II patients who present with pronounced hypoesthesia. Inappropriately aggressive PT can trigger extreme pain, edema, distress, and fatigue, and may in turn exacerbate the inflammatory and sympathetic symptoms of CRPS; it is therefore to be avoided. Use of assistive or range of motion devices, prolonged application of ice, and inactivity may also aggravate CRPS. Physical therapists must teach patients with CRPS that they will experience pain both when they exercise too much and when they exercise too little. Patients must therefore be taught to seek the "happy medium", and it is the physical therapist's responsibility to help them find that therapeutic ground and help them to steadily advance toward a more functional and active lifestyle. In a series of RCTs, Oerleman's group has shown that PT (and to a lesser extent OT) improves pain ratings and "active mobility" compared to patients receiving only counseling (from a social worker) in upper extremity CRPS cohorts (level 2). The principal objective of the physiotherapeutic treatment protocol as investigated by Oerlemans et al. is to enable the patient to gain the greatest possible degree of control over his or her symptoms while relentlessly pursuing goal of reanimating the affected part. A specific set of questions, standardized assessment scales, and objective tests carried out during observed tasks and physical examinations are used to gain an impression of the degree of segmental dysregulation and the extent to which pain can be managed. The treatment program is set up on the basis of the information obtained. It comprises a number of physiotherapy interventions such as support, exercise therapy, improving skills, and relaxation therapy. The key components of this protocol are increasing the degree of control over the pain, improving the way the patient copes with the syndrome, treating any dysregulation, and improving skills; for example, by training and practice in compensatory skills, and posture and movement instruction.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^113Nnjxb]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating painful state of an extremity that can develop after trauma. CRPS is diagnosed by the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS. The syndrome is characterized by continuing regional pain with abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, edema, and/or trophic signs. The clinical presentation of CRPS can be very heterogeneous because CRPS is a multi-mechanism syndrome. Therefore, mechanism-based subgroups have been suggested to personalize treatment for CRPS. Additionally, the presentation of symptom pain may also be able to identify different subgroups of CRPS. In this review, the types of pain recognized by the IASP―nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain―will be discussed as possible subgroups for CRPS. Each pain type should be identified in CRPS patients, with a thorough history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests or (novel) biomarkers to optimize treatment effectiveness. Over the course of the syndrome, patients with CRPS probably experience more than one distinct pain type. Therefore, pain specialists should be alert to not only adjust their treatment if underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms tend to change but also to personalize the treatment of the associated type of pain in the CRPS patient.

### Experiences of diagnosis and treatment for upper limb complex regional pain syndrome: a qualitative analysis [^116AYcgR]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Upper limb CRPS significantly changes people's lives and self-concept, leading people to engage with healthcare while embarking on their own navigation process. In this study, participants described the challenges of trying to fit themselves into the existing healthcare system, and desired a combination of information, validation, and simplification to support them in moving forward with CRPS. This indicates a need for a paradigm shift in CRPS management, where healthcare providers consciously enter individuals' lives and fit treatment into this. These findings lead to the following recommendations: for provision of timely, holistic, and credible information about CRPS to individuals, greater emphasis on the therapeutic alliance between the individual and healthcare providers, and a unified team approach to simplify and improve healthcare for CRPS.

### Physiotherapy for pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) types I and II [^115eHqmY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling condition that usually manifests in response to trauma or surgery. When it occurs, it is associated with significant pain and disability. It is thought to arise and persist as a consequence of a maladaptive pro-inflammatory response and disturbances in sympathetically-mediated vasomotor control, together with maladaptive peripheral and central neuronal plasticity. CRPS can be classified into two types: type I (CRPS I) in which a specific nerve lesion has not been identified, and type II (CRPS II) where there is an identifiable nerve lesion. Guidelines recommend the inclusion of a variety of physiotherapy interventions as part of the multimodal treatment of people with CRPS, although their effectiveness is not known.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for treating the pain and disability associated with CRPS types I and II.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from inception up to 12 February 2015: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, PEDro, Web of Science, DARE and Health Technology Assessments, without language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physiotherapy interventions for treating pain and disability in people CRPS. We also searched additional online sources for unpublished trials and trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of physiotherapy interventions (including manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, electrotherapy, physiotherapist-administered education and cortically directed sensory-motor rehabilitation strategies) employed in either a stand-alone fashion or in combination, compared with placebo, no treatment, another intervention or usual care, or of varying physiotherapy interventions compared with each other in adults with CRPS I and II. Our primary outcomes of interest were patient-centred outcomes of pain intensity and functional disability.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated those studies identified through the electronic searches for eligibility and subsequently extracted all relevant data from the included RCTs. Two review authors independently performed 'Risk of bias' assessments and rated the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs (739 participants) that tested the effectiveness of a broad range of physiotherapy-based interventions. Overall, there was a paucity of high quality evidence concerning physiotherapy treatment for pain and disability in people with CRPS I. Most included trials were at 'high' risk of bias (15 trials) and the remainder were at 'unclear' risk of bias (three trials). The quality of the evidence was very low or low for all comparisons, according to the GRADE approach. We found very low quality evidence that graded motor imagery (GMI; two trials, 49 participants) may be useful for improving pain (0 to 100 VAS) (mean difference (MD) -21.00, 95% CI -31.17 to -10.83) and functional disability (11-point numerical rating scale) (MD 2.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.48), at long-term (six months) follow-up, in people with CRPS I compared to usual care plus physiotherapy; very low quality evidence that multimodal physiotherapy (one trial, 135 participants) may be useful for improving 'impairment' at long-term (12 month) follow-up compared to a minimal 'social work' intervention; and very low quality evidence that mirror therapy (two trials, 72 participants) provides clinically meaningful improvements in pain (0 to 10 VAS) (MD 3.4, 95% CI -4.71 to -2.09) and function (0 to 5 functional ability subscale of the Wolf Motor Function Test) (MD -2.3, 95% CI -2.88 to -1.72) at long-term (six month) follow-up in people with CRPS I post stroke compared to placebo (covered mirror). There was low to very low quality evidence that tactile discrimination training, stellate ganglion block via ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy compared to placebo, and manual lymphatic drainage combined with and compared to either anti-inflammatories and physical therapy or exercise are not effective for treating pain in the short-term in people with CRPS I. Laser therapy may provide small clinically insignificant, short-term, improvements in pain compared to interferential current therapy in people with CRPS I. Adverse events were only rarely reported in the included trials. No trials including participants with CRPS II met the inclusion criteria of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

The best available data show that GMI and mirror therapy may provide clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function in people with CRPS I although the quality of the supporting evidence is very low. Evidence of the effectiveness of multimodal physiotherapy, electrotherapy and manual lymphatic drainage for treating people with CRPS types I and II is generally absent or unclear. Large scale, high quality RCTs are required to test the effectiveness of physiotherapy-based interventions for treating pain and disability of people with CRPS I and II. Implications for clinical practice and future research are considered.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^111LAXGs]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Various uncontrolled studies suggest that CRPS patients benefited from certain physiotherapeutic modalities, including stress loading and isometric techniques (level 4). Oerlemans et al. conducted a prospective controlled study of 135 CRPS patients with pain located in an upper extremity, and she reported that both physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) proved valuable in managing pain, restoring mobility, and reducing impairment (level 2). Daly and Bialocerkowski reported in a well-performed meta-analysis (level 1) good quality evidence that pain management physical therapy combined with medical management is more effective than control therapy, based largely on the Oerlemans et al. study. In their prospective assessment of 145 patients, Birklein et al. found that pain was notably less for patients undergoing PT (level 3). In another study of 28 children meeting the IASP criteria for CRPS, 92% reduced or eliminated their pain after receiving exercise therapy (level 3).

### Low dose naltrexone therapy for complex regional pain… [^117NKFEm]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

CRPS typically affects a specific area of the body, such as the hands or feet, and symptoms may include extreme sensitivity, pins-and-needles sensation, color and/or temperature changes, swelling, and stinging. One treatment route commonly prescribed for CRPS is an anti-neuropathic medication regime of Gabapentin or Pregabalin-medications prescribed to specifically ease nerve-related pain. Targeted nerve blocks and epidural injections are other common treatments physiatrists and pain providers will perform for CRPS patients, often in conjunction with medication and physical therapy for a comprehensive pain management plan. However, for those who cannot take anti-neuropathic medications and are hesitant to pursue more invasive routes like nerve blocks or spinal cord stimulations, there is a lack of available treatment options which makes pain management uncertain and inconsistent.

In an effort to diversify available treatments, there is a budding interest in the role that low-dose naltrexone may play in reducing chronic pain associated with CRPS. There is currently only one other low-dose naltrexone study being conducted with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome patients as the primary study population. Dr. Sean Mackey is leading this study through the Stanford Division of Pain Medicine, and the study is still in the process of enrolling eligible patients. Published case studies demonstrate the promising nature of the drug in a multi-modal treatment course and suggest that more extensive research on the effectiveness of low-dose naltrexone would be beneficial. Our feasibility study has two purposes: to evaluate the potential of LDN as CRPS pain management, and to evaluate whether such a long-term interventional drug study can be conducted at the Hospital for Special Surgery.

Not only will the investigators be collecting pain scores over time to better understand whether LDN may help improve pain and symptom severity, but the investigators will also be collecting information regarding how many patients enroll, how many patients remain enrolled during the duration of the study, why patients may un-enroll, and how compliant patients are with taking the daily study medication. Over the course of two years, a total of 40 patients recently diagnosed with CRPS at the 75th St HSS outpatient location will be enrolled and randomized to receive either capsules with the active low-dose naltrexone medication, or placebo capsules which do not contain any active ingredient. The study medication will be supplied to study patients in addition to any standard CRPS therapies, including physical therapy, medication management, and interventional therapies.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^112nJPef]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

While the contribution of psychophysiological interactions to CRPS is largely speculative, it is theoretically consistent and highlights the importance of addressing psychological factors in the clinical management of CRPS. A vicious cycle in which pain provokes disuse and emotional arousal, both of which in turn further exacerbate the pain, could contribute to maintenance of CRPS. Psychological/behavioral treatments may therefore play an important role in CRPS management by targeting learned disuse and both life stress and negative affect that may contribute to maintenance or exacerbation of the disorder. Consistent with potential benefits of this treatment focus, a prospective study (level 3) in acute CRPS patients found that greater baseline anxiety and pain-related fear predicted worse treatment outcomes in terms of pain and disability over the following 12 months, suggesting that early targeting of these issues may have long-term benefits. Psychological treatments can also enhance pain coping skills that ultimately lead to improved functioning and quality of life and increase ability to self-manage pain. In line with this, an electronic diary study showed that in CRPS patients, greater engagement in pain acceptance-based coping (a core tenet of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy [ACT]) was linked to same-day improvements in pain and mood. At minimum, psychological treatments focusing on the issues above are likely to enhance patients' sense of control over the condition, and thereby reduce fears that may be a barrier to achieving success in functional therapies.

Clinical Recommendations

There is little well-controlled CRPS-specific outcome research on which to base psychological treatment recommendations for the condition. However, clinical experience and available data do suggest several specific strategies that may be helpful.

While there are indications that many cases of acute CRPS may resolve relatively quickly without any need for specific psychological intervention, a low cost and potentially helpful intervention recommended for all acute or chronic CRPS patients is comprehensive education about the condition. Specifically, it is recommended that all patients and their families receive detailed information early in treatment that addresses the negative effects of disuse, the importance of reactivation, the need for an active self-management approach to treatment, and that provides an explanation of how possible psychophysiological interactions could affect severity of CRPS. Such education may help prevent development of dysfunctional behavior patterns (e.g. elevated distress and severe disuse) that could contribute to the severity, disability, and chronicity of the condition. For more chronic CRPS patients or those who do not respond to limited intervention, individualized psychological evaluation is recommended, followed by focused psychological pain management treatment. An overview of several key issues to address in this assessment and treatment is provided below.

Psychological Assessment

Several specific areas of relevance to CRPS management should be addressed in the psychological evaluation, including: 1) presence of comorbid Axis I (or Axis II) psychiatric disorders, 2) cognitive, behavioral, and emotional responses to CRPS, 3) ongoing life stressors, and 4) responses by significant others to the patient's CRPS. As noted previously, Axis I psychiatric disorders such as Major Depression, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder are at least as common in CRPS patients as in other chronic pain patients. The importance of assessing for disorders such as major depression is highlighted by the fact that diminished energy level and motivation related to clinical depression may be a significant barrier to success in active physically-focused treatment modalities (e.g. physical and occupational therapy); also, there are very effective and safe medications available. Identification of specific life stressors and general emotional arousal (depressed, anxious, fearful, or angry mood) even in the absence of clinically diagnosable psychiatric disorder may be equally important given possible psychophysiological interactions hypothesized above.

Comparative Efficacy of Psychological Interventions in Other Non-CRPS Chronic Pain Disorders

Numerous RCTs have documented the efficacy of various psychological approaches to the management of chronic pain in general, and these have been quantitatively summarized in several published meta-analyses. Treatment approaches examined include many of the same interventions used in the CRPS studies described previously, including relaxation techniques, autogenic training, biofeedback, behavioral therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as more recent mindfulness-based and ACT approaches. Results of several meta-analyses clearly document the efficacy of these techniques for non-CRPS chronic pain conditions. For example, a meta-analysis of clinical trials testing progressive muscle relaxation techniques found significant effects in various chronic pain conditions, reflecting a moderate effect size (level 1). Meta-analysis specifically of autogenic training, another relaxation procedure, also indicated a significant and at least moderate effect size in controlled trials for patients with headache and somatoform pain disorder (level 1). Significant efficacy for biofeedback training is also indicated by meta-analyses in populations including temporomandibular joint pain and migraine headache patients (both level 1). More generally, meta-analyses of RCTs across psychological treatment types (various treatments provided both alone and in combination) indicate significant efficacy of this class of techniques for a variety of chronic pain conditions, including low back pain, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer-related pain (all level 1). Results of one available meta-analysis also confirm that cognitive behavioral interventions are significantly effective for children and adolescents with chronic pain (level 1). Overall, the results of RCTs of psychological treatment approaches consistently indicate at least a moderate benefit, in terms of experienced pain, mood, and function, for patients with a variety of chronic pain conditions. Given the efficacy of these interventions shown for various non-CRPS chronic pain conditions, their utility specifically in the management of CRPS might also be expected. These meta-analytic findings provide additional support, albeit indirect, for the reported efficacy of psychological interventions in CRPS patients described in uncontrolled trials.

Motor Cortex Stimulation

Of all therapies, ranging from minimally invasive to interventional, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is the most invasive form of treatment for pain conditions, including CRPS. The mechanism of action for MCS is the modulation of pathologic hyperactivity in the thalamic relay nuclei. Deafferentation results in the loss of inhibitory control of the nociceptive neurons, and MCS has been shown to normalize this disinhibition to a greater degree than somatosensory cortex stimulation (level 4). Similar to SCS procedures, a trial is required prior to the implantation of MCS. Risks are surprisingly rare but complications may occur consistent with other chronically implanted hardware in functional neurosurgery (level 4).

According to the spirit of the Malibu treatment scheme (Figure 2) simpler, less invasive, less dangerous and less expensive interventional techniques should be tried before invasive, experimental and much more expensive techniques (Figure 4 and Appendix A2).

Figure 4.
Consensus based, empiric Interventional Pain Treatment Algorithm for CRPS (modified from).

Inadequate or partial response to any mentioned therapy may lead to a stepwise progression down through modalities always in conjunction with other non-interventional treatments.

In this 5th edition of these diagnostic and treatment guidelines, we find progress evident in diagnosis, clinical outcome measures, and evidence-based treatments compared to prior versions. Nonetheless, the conclusion in prior guidelines that "we need more high quality research regarding CRPS interventions" still stands. There are few interventions with efficacy that has been convincingly demonstrated, and until such data are available, reliance on the standard clinical principles of interdisciplinary pain and symptom management will be necessary. While evidence for efficacy of most CRPS interventions remains weak in CRPS patients as a group, we suggest that going forward there may be value in exploring intervention efficacy within empirically-identified CRPS subtypes (e.g. warm vs cold CRPS) to determine whether a precision medicine approach to CRPS management could enhance outcomes. In each clinical situation the specific risk, benefit and expense of any intervention must be carefully and continuously considered.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^117TJho4]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

With regards to family intervention, the most crucial issue to address is the possibility that some family members may be a barrier to reactivation due to solicitous responses and fear of pain exacerbations. Unless detailed education regarding CRPS and disuse issues is provided, family members may consider any activity that increases pain as dangerous to the patient and something to be discouraged. It is therefore important to ensure that family members understand the necessity of reactivation and that this might be associated with transient increases in pain. In contrast, family members may, due to a lack of understanding, incorrectly assume that unusual symptoms such as allodynia are exaggerated, and as a consequence, be less than fully supportive. Adequate positive family support can have a significant impact on ultimate efficacy of treatment. Family members should therefore be guided in how they can best respond to the patient's pain in a way that encourages and facilitates appropriate reactivation, and helps keep the patient focused on constructive management of the condition. The importance of addressing family issues is highlighted by findings demonstrating that more than half of caregivers of CRPS patients experience negative mood and significant strain, and these factors in turn are associated with greater patient disability. While one might assume that this family distress and strain is a result of having to handle greater patient disability, the possibility of bi-directional causal influences must at least be considered.

### Comprehensive mechanisms and non-invasive treatment for complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review [^113QkBjh]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by an exaggerated response to an initial stimulus, accompanied by autonomic, sensory, motor, and sudomotor dysfunctions. Recognized as a systemic disorder, CRPS involves complex interactions among inflammatory, immunologic, neurogenic, genetic, and psychological factors. The primary mechanisms include peripheral and central sensitization, sympathetic nervous system dysregulation, and altered somatosensory processing. However, the exact pathophysiology remains unclear, contributing to ongoing debate about optimal treatment approaches. Management typically involves a multimodal approach. Pharmacologic options such as corticosteroids, ketamine, and bisphosphonates have demonstrated relative safety and efficacy in clinical practice. Moreover, rehabilitation therapies -including cortically directed sensorimotor rehabilitation, range-of-motion or aerobic exercises, exposure therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and thermal therapy -serve as valuable nonpharmacologic interventions. No consensus currently exists on standardized treatment protocols for CRPS, particularly regarding the choice of non-invasive approaches. In this context, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for guiding appropriate management strategies. This review provides updated insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, alongside a synthesis of evidence-based non-invasive treatment, to support mechanism-driven clinical decision-making, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

### Multidisciplinary approach and the self-training educative pain sensation (STEPS) model for managing orofacial complex regional pain syndrome [^11662y5o]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The STEPS model comprises four key components, each with demonstrated effectiveness in managing CRPS. The first component, pain education, serves as a first-line intervention and has proven efficacy in various chronic pain conditions, including CRPS. The (IASP) guidelines strongly recommend this step because it empowers patients through self-management and active engagement.

GMI constitutes the second component of the STEPS model. This case report aligns with other studies by demonstrating the successful application of GMI in the patient's treatment. However, some studies present contrasting results. For instance, Johnson et al reported conflicting outcomes regarding pain intensity and function in patients across two treatment centres following GMI implementation. This discrepancy might be attributed to the lack of prior patient education before GMI, a crucial step for patient engagement. Furthermore, the study by Johnson et al employed non-specialised pain rehabilitation teams to administer GMI in person and over the phone. Managing a complex condition like O-CRPS necessitates a qualified pain rehabilitation team capable of delivering this complex intervention while addressing individual patient needs.

Learning points

Multidisciplinary collaboration: This case report highlights the crucial role of multidisciplinary teams in effectively managing orofacial complex regional pain syndrome (O-CRPS), a complex condition requiring a multifaceted approach.
Successful application of the Self-Training Educative Pain Sensation (STEPS) model: A trained pain rehabilitation team's successful application of the STEPS model demonstrates the importance of a structured and evidence-based approach to O-CRPS treatment.
Significant patient improvements: The case highlights significant improvements in various domains, including pain, emotional well-being, function, social engagement and overall health, showcasing the potential of the STEPS model to address the biopsychosocial aspects of O-CRPS.
Early diagnosis and referral: This type of patient often suffers from misdiagnosis and, as a result, ineffective treatment. The interdisciplinary management of this condition helps both to save time and financial resources. It is important for the general dentist to become familiar with the model for quick and effective referral.
Need for further research: The report emphasises the need for further studies to examine the outcomes of this intervention in a broader population of patients with both CRPS and specifically O-CRPS.

### Complex regional pain type 1 [^113a7XNk]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome is increasingly recognized in the pediatric population. Owing to the nature of presentation with pain, many of these children present to the emergency setting at different stages of the syndrome with or without numerous prior interactions with health professionals. Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) is a clinical syndrome characterized by amplified musculoskeletal limb pain that is out of proportion to the history and physical findings, or pain due to non-noxious stimuli (allodynia/hyperalgesia), and accompanied by one or more signs of autonomic dysfunction. Differential diagnosis may include significant trauma (eg, fractures), inflammatory conditions, malignancies, and systemic illness. The diagnosis is clinical. The treatment goals for CRPS1 are restoration of function and relief of pain. Education, physical, and occupational therapy with psychotherapy and defined goals of achievement with reward are the mainstay of treatment for this population.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^112vDcn8]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating painful state of an extremity that can develop after trauma. CRPS is diagnosed by the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS. The syndrome is characterized by continuing regional pain with abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, edema, and/or trophic signs. The clinical presentation of CRPS can be very heterogeneous because CRPS is a multi-mechanism syndrome. Therefore, mechanism-based subgroups have been suggested to personalize treatment for CRPS. Additionally, the presentation of symptom pain may also be able to identify different subgroups of CRPS. In this review, the types of pain recognized by the IASP-nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain-will be discussed as possible subgroups for CRPS. Each pain type should be identified in CRPS patients, with a thorough history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests or (novel) biomarkers to optimize treatment effectiveness. Over the course of the syndrome, patients with CRPS probably experience more than one distinct pain type. Therefore, pain specialists should be alert to not only adjust their treatment if underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms tend to change but also to personalize the treatment of the associated type of pain in the CRPS patient.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^115VjCr3]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome is a chronic pain condition characterized by autonomic and inflammatory features. It occurs acutely in about 7% of patients who have limb fractures, limb surgery, or other injuries. Many cases resolve within the first year, with a smaller subset progressing to the chronic form. This transition is often paralleled by a change from "warm complex regional pain syndrome", with inflammatory characteristics dominant, to "cold complex regional pain syndrome" in which autonomic features dominate. Multiple peripheral and central mechanisms seem to be involved, the relative contributions of which may differ between individuals and over time. Possible contributors include peripheral and central sensitization, autonomic changes and sympatho-afferent coupling, inflammatory and immune alterations, brain changes, and genetic and psychological factors. The syndrome is diagnosed purely on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. Effective management of the chronic form of the syndrome is often challenging. Few high quality randomized controlled trials are available to support the efficacy of the most commonly used interventions. Reviews of available randomized trials suggest that physical and occupational therapy (including graded motor imagery and mirror therapy), bisphosphonates, calcitonin, subanesthetic intravenous ketamine, free radical scavengers, oral corticosteroids, and spinal cord stimulation may be effective treatments. Multidisciplinary clinical care, which centers around functionally focused therapies is recommended. Other interventions are used to facilitate engagement in functional therapies and to improve quality of life.

A second aspect of the pain management treatment component is cognitive intervention. Given the emphasis in consensus guidelines for CRPS management using an active rehabilitation approach, it is important to reframe the CRPS patient's role as that of an active participant in the treatment process rather than a passive recipient of treatment interventions. As part of this active treatment focus, pain exacerbations should be identified as a cue to practice self-management interventions that may help the patient gain control over their situation. As patients learn relaxation skills and begin to understand the cognitive and behavioral aspects of the syndrome, they will have increasing resources for exerting at least some degree of control over their CRPS. Increased sense of perceived control, even if that control is limited in scope, may be an important factor in determining outcomes in chronic pain treatment [e.g. Andrasik and Holroyd). Dysfunctional cognitions may be common in CRPS patients, including catastrophic interpretations about symptoms or implications of CRPS for the future, fearful pain-related cognitions like those described above, and unrealistic beliefs about treatment. Such cognitions contribute to elevated distress, which may impact sympathetic outflow and catecholamine release, and potentially aggravate CRPS pain and vasomotor changes. Moreover, in the absence of in vivo reactivation experiments in which constructive (i.e. encouraging rather than catastrophic) self-talk is practiced, fear of pain may prevent improved daily function even in the face of objectively improved capabilities during therapy. It is therefore important that cognitive interventions be employed to help patients learn to identify and modify their specific dysfunctional cognitions regarding reactivation, CRPS, and its treatment.

Based upon aggregated interview outcomes, HCPs interviewed during the study could be generalized into four different intervention approaches. These styles drove their treatment decisions, the understanding of and experiences with CRPS management, the level of interaction with patients and the knowledge of treatment advancements. Understanding these perspectives provides context about how HCPs may perceive a novel treatment. The four types of HCP intervention approaches are:
HCPs driven by patient accountability, ie, those who are typically intolerant of the use of opioids, which they associate with "giving up" and believe make the pain worse. These HCPs take a "tough-it-out" approach and believe that success is possible if the patient is prepared to commit to rigorous physical therapy. They are open to, and stay abreast of, new therapies but anything that seems a "quick fix" is viewed with skepticism. A novel treatment for them would provide an alternative to opioids to assist patients in continuing physical therapy.
HCPs driven by personal relationships, ie, those who prioritize patients' sense of well-being. They are willing to spend as much time as is needed with the patient and are a source of positivity. These HCPs are often open-minded regarding treatment, are up to date on advances in therapy and encourage patients to be honest about how medications are working in order to help find the right treatment. A novel treatment for them would be an exciting addition to the treatment options for CRPS.
HCPs focused on expert care, ie, those who are perhaps more aware of CRPS than most but admit to their lack of expertise. To ensure the best possible care for their patients, these HCPs will refer more complex CRPS cases to specialists, such as pain specialists. They believe that treatment should be administered by experts and, therefore, spend minimal effort in familiarizing themselves with new treatment options. A novel treatment would be a consideration for them if it is simple and relatively low risk.
HCPs focused on relieving pain, ie, who view CRPS as a chronic condition with no cure and ineffective treatment options. They view providing pain relief as their primary role. They recommend opioids as a remedy to mask the pain and, as they are set in their understanding and treatment philosophy, they do not search for new treatment options. A novel therapy for them would be a better option for reducing pain, but only if it is really effective.

### Treatment of complex regional pain syndrome… [^11775eMV]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Limited treatment options for these individuals currently exist, and guidelines are based on expert consensus. Existing knowledge suggests that continued physiotherapy with supportive pain control and psychological treatment is the most important strategy to manage CRPS. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation offers a potential opportunity to noninvasively treat pain in patients with CRPS. Some studies have illustrated the analgesic effects of rTMS in patients with CRPS. Gaertner et al. delivered 10 Hz stimulation to the motor cortex in patients with CRPS. Patients were able to choose between one or five sessions of treatment. A significant reduction in pain was demonstrated in both groups one week following the last treatment session. There were no group differences in changes in pain. Two patients from each group maintained a > 50% reduction in pain relief beyond 6 weeks post treatment.

Further, Piceralli et al. observed a reduction in pain following 10 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS applied to the motor cortex in a group of 12 patients with CRPS. Additionally, Pleger et al. found that one session of rTMS applied to the motor cortex was sufficient to cause pain relief, however the duration of relief was experienced for only 45 minutes after stimulation. rTMS has been also used in other chronic pain conditions such as neuropathic pain. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the study procedures in a feasibility study involving 18 patients. In addition, the use of rTMS paired with a sensorimotor training task will be investigated in CRPS I patients, to induce positive neuroplastic changes so as to effect temporary and long-term pain relief. rTMS will be delivered to the primary motor cortex controlling the hand to create an environment within the sensory motor cortex that promotes neuroplasticity.

Study intervention procedure: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied to the left motor cortex representation of the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle regardless of affected hand. Surface electromyography electrodes will be placed on the skin overlying the APB muscle.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^112Wp6UJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hence, the aim of this narrative review is threefold: 1) to describe the types of pain in CRPS and link these pain types to pathophysiological underlying mechanisms in CRPS; 2) to explain how these pain types can be differentiated by history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic tests; 3) to illustrate how these pain types can be specifically targeted to optimize treatment effectiveness. Ultimately, a personalized treatment plan should be made for each CRPS patient. For this purpose, the differentiation of symptom pain in nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain may be an additional helpful tool to optimize the management of CRPS.

Interventional Therapies

Numerous interventional therapies have been described but usually poorly studied. As the mechanisms and pathophysiology of CRPS are multifactorial, this presents unique challenges to treatment due to the dynamic and varied/diverse nature of its clinical symptoms. This section will review the historical evidence for the use of various traditional therapies in the treatment of CRPS, including sympathetic nerve blocks (SNB), intravenous regional anesthetic techniques (IVRA), "other" blocks (including somatic blocks and spinal infusions), neurolytic sympathetic blockade, and implantable therapies (including neuromodulation and targeted drug delivery). Recent publications of randomized controlled trials and their supporting evidence for the interventional treatment of CRPS have come from the field of neuromodulation, and in particular, dorsal root ganglion stimulation. This is an advanced form of spinal cord stimulation used to treat focal neuropathic pain, and studies published in 2017 and 2019 allowed this therapy to emerge as important later stage considerations. Traditional spinal cord stimulation is an FDA-approved treatment for chronic pain, initially introduced to market in 1967.

Included in this review will be several topical reviews and meta-analyses identified in a 2020 PubMed search that provide an update from the previous edition. The Cochrane Database for Systematic Review will be used to highlight quality studies, to explore newer and existing treatments, and to facilitate some aspects of clinical decision-making.

When patients are not making notable improvements in function with conservative exercise therapy, more invasive treatment may be considered to mitigate the status and progression of chronic CRPS. The Malibu algorithm is discussed above. A traditional treatment strategy in certain clinics is to initiate regional nerve blocks in conjunction with structured exercise therapy early in the treatment. Progression to neuromodulation may be considered if the patient has significant limitations or functional deterioration during treatment, and spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root ganglion stimulation may prove to be effective and long-term strategies to in a sub-set of patients (level 2).

### Complex regional pain syndrome: advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^111NsCXg]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare pain disorder that usually occurs in a limb after trauma. The features of this disorder include severe pain and sensory, autonomic, motor, and trophic abnormalities. Research from the past decade has offered new insights into CRPS epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Early identification of individuals at high risk of CRPS is improving, with several risk factors established and some others identified in prospective studies during the past 5 years. Better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS has led to its classification as a chronic primary pain disorder, and subtypes of CRPS have been updated. Procedures for diagnosis have also been clarified. Although effective treatment of CRPS remains a challenge, evidence-based integrated management approaches provide new opportunities to improve patient care. Further advances in diagnosis and treatment of CRPS will require coordinated, international multicentre initiatives.

### Work-related complex regional pain syndrome: diagnosis and treatment [^114KywRo]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome can be a debilitating disorder, which, in its earliest stages, can be prevented by aggressive rehabilitation based on reactivation. It is critical to follow international criteria on making the diagnosis; overdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate interventions and further disability. When present, early recognition with reactivation is the cornerstone of treatment. This article presents a phased approach to treatment that suggests movements of nonresponders quickly to more integrated levels of care. Some commonly used invasive interventions, such as sympathectomy and spinal cord stimulation, have not been proved effective; these unproven and potentially harmful therapies should be avoided.

Diagnosis

Historically, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) has been referred to by many names, with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) and Causalgia the best known. Both terms are sometimes still used inappropriately, and there are no validated diagnostic criteria for either. The historical evolution of terms and diagnostic criteria for CRPS is interesting and colorful but is beyond the scope of this review. Interested readers are referred to the prior version of this review for a more detailed history.

The label CRPS originated at an international conference held in Orlando, Florida, in 1994 that led to the first consensus-based diagnostic criteria for CRPS adopted by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). These 1994 IASP criteria for CRPS were necessary and important, yet experience gained from developing and systematically improving diagnostic criteria for headache and psychiatric disorders highlighted the necessity of validating and modifying such preliminary consensus-based criteria through systematic validation research. To this end, a series of validation studies were conducted, leading ultimately to an empirically derived set of CRPS criteria (the so-called Budapest Criteria) that were adopted formally by the IASP committee on taxonomy as the new IASP criteria in 2012 (Table 2). The fact that the clinical presentation of CRPS (and its underlying mechanisms) can differ between patients and even within a patient over time made development of validated and clinically useful criteria somewhat more challenging. The results of these diagnostic validation studies are now briefly reviewed to detail the rationale for the format and content of the 2012 revised IASP criteria.

### The efficacy of an interdisciplinary pain management program for complex regional pain syndrome compared to low back pain and chronic widespread pain: an observational study [^113S84n2]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study comparing the recovery trajectories of people with CRPS to other persistent pain conditions following completion of an IPMP. The results showed that, in keeping with the initial hypothesis, people with CRPS were equally likely to improve in pain intensity and interference when compared to people with persistent LBP pain or CWP. In addition, a machine learning model was developed to predict recovery trajectories in people with persistent pain attending an IPMP, which showed reasonable prediction accuracy, particularly for pain intensity.

These findings support the use of IPMPs for people with CRPS. It is widely acknowledged that conducting RCTs with the CRPS population is challenging because it is a rare disease. However, because RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of IPMPs for LBP and CWP, the finding that outcomes are similar for CRPS supports the evidence base for interdisciplinary management of CRPS. This is important, because it provides support for clinical guidelines, and healthcare providerswho already recommend or provide IPMPs for CRPS. According to the ICD-11, CRPS is now considered a primary pain condition, like CWP and nonspecific LBP, so it is not surprising that similar management approaches produce equivalent effects for these conditions. However, it is noteworthy that despite limited evidence, there is still a strong emphasis in the literature on providing medical interventions for CRPS, and greater evidence for interdisciplinary pain management may support a more nuanced approach to supporting people with CRPS. The finding that IPMPs are equally beneficial for people with CRPS as they for other pain conditions should increase the likelihood of clinicians referring patients to these services. This has the potential of improving patients' quality of life.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^114rqzbn]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

There have been some modest recent advancements in the research of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, yet the amount and quality of the work in this complicated multifactorial disease remains low (with some notable exceptions; e.g., the recent work on the dorsal root ganglion stimulation). The semi-systematic (though in some cases narrative) approach to review is necessary so that we might treat our patients while waiting for "better research". This semi-systematic review was conducted by experts in the field, (deliberately) some of whom are promising young researchers supplemented by the experience of "elder statesman" researchers, who all mention the system they have used to examine the literature. What we found is generally low- to medium-quality research with small numbers of subjects; however, there are some recent exceptions to this. The primary reason for this paucity of research is the fact that this is a rare disease, and it is very difficult to acquire a sufficient sample size for statistical significance using traditional statistical approaches. Several larger trials have failed, probably due to using the broad general diagnostic criteria (the "Budapest" criteria) in a multifactorial/multi-mechanism disease. Responsive subsets can often be identified in these larger trials, but not sufficient to achieve statistically significant results in the general diagnostic grouping. This being the case the authors have necessarily included data from less compelling protocols, including trials such as case series and even in some instances case reports/empirical information. In the humanitarian spirit of treating our often desperate patients with this rare syndrome, without great evidence, we must take what data we can find (as in this work) and tailor a treatment regime for each patient.

Many patients with CRPS experience refractory pain that significantly restricts their daily activities. Although a range of therapeutic interventions, including pharmacological, procedural, and rehabilitative therapy, have been explored, pain management is often suboptimal. Effective management requires a comprehensive understanding of CRPS pathophysiology and the available treatment modalities.

This review explores the underlying mechanisms of CRPS and highlights non-invasive treatment approaches — pharmacological and rehabilitative — aiming to support clinical decision-making and improve symptom management. The following sections present the pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS, pharmacological treatments, and rehabilitative treatment approaches for managing the condition.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^1127T41i]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Some interventions can be beneficial for multiple pain types in CRPS such as patient education, psychological interventions, and physical therapy. These therapies should be considered as part of a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment program. Patient education should highlight a biopsychosocial model that addresses physical exercise, fatigue, stress reduction, and cognitive difficulties. Regarding psychological interventions for CRPS, there are only few small studies testing their efficacy for CRPS. Given the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for chronic pain in general, its utility for the management of CRPS might also be expected. Furthermore, clinical experience indicates that mobilization and active physiotherapy play an important role in functional restoration, but the evidence about the effect of physical therapy on CRPS is still very uncertain. Our research groups recommend that the management of CRPS should be based on biopsychosocial model and psychological support and physical therapy should be integrated as early as possible and continued during the course of the syndrome (Table 2). Additional pharmacological treatment should target the most prominent pain type at clinical presentation and target specific underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS. When patients do not respond to conservative and pharmacological treatment, neurostimulation can be considered. Neurostimulation may target multiple mechanisms including neuropathic pain, ischemic pain, and inflammation. We suggest that neurostimulation also affects nociplastic pain, as it is described that neurostimulation inhibits pain transmission and neuron hyperactivity in the dorsal horn and activates descending modulatory pathways that suggest supraspinal involvement. A consensus-based e-health tool can help physicians in selecting CRPS patients for neurostimulation.

The Rationale for Functional Restoration

CRPS can be a very difficult condition to treat successfully. Not only is the syndrome bio-medically multifaceted, comprising both central and peripheral pathophysiology, but it also frequently contains psychosocial components that are additional pivotal diagnostic features (and thus, critical treatment targets). The array of possible patient presentations and the fact that the presentation often changes over time also complicate successful identification and treatment. To further add to the clinical challenges of managing CRPS, the epidemiology and natural history of CRPS are only superficially known; evidence concerning CRPS treatment has developed slowly due in large part to the early vagaries of diagnosis (see above); and, moreover, research data — when they are available — are sometimes challenging to interpret. Given these obstacles to diagnosis, treatment, and research, how is a specialist to embark on a path toward the successful treatment of such a complicated and partially understood condition? The only treatment methodology that can possibly successfully span these gaps in medical science is a systematic and orderly interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary treatment is defined (here) as a dedicated, coherent, coordinated, specially trained group of relevant professionals that meet regularly to plan, coordinate care, and adapt to treatment eventualities. Less desirable (but more accessible) is multidisciplinary treatment (a single practitioner coordinates all the various specialties).

Pharmacotherapy

For the past 150 years, multiple drug treatments for CRPS have been tried. One of the first drugs mentioned was laudanum (tincture of opium) by Weir-Mitchell (who coined the term causalgia) and his use of the" new invention", the hypodermic syringe, to perform cocaine nerve blocks. Unfortunately, most medications used clinically to manage CRPS have not yet been tested adequately in high quality, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). This absence of multiple trials to document efficacy of many pharmacotherapy agents is attributable to many factors, including previous lack of uniformly accepted diagnostic criteria (preventing generalization across studies), the low prevalence of this rare disease causing difficulties in recruitment, as well as lack of funding for trials using promising older agents without patent protection to provide financial incentives. Fortunately, with the Food and Drug Administration's designation of CRPS as a Rare Disease in the past decade, industry interest in conducting definitive trials for CRPS therapeutics has increased.

The resourceful clinician will extrapolate from RCTs, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews concerning treatments for related neuropathic conditions and ultimately utilize empirical drug trials in each patient, based on consideration of what mechanisms seem most germane. However, repeated trials of ultimately ineffective drugs can also lead to patient frustration and disengagement. CRPS differs from other neuropathic pain syndromes by having additional tissues and systems involved, including the microcirculation, bone, and inflammatory pathways. In fact, although qualities of CRPS pain are often neuropathic, by currently accepted standards the condition does not fulfill criteria for neuropathic pain. Reliable data now show variable involvement of central sensitization, motor abnormalities, and sympathetic efferent features at different times and in different individuals suffering from CRPS. It is very likely that there will never be a single medication that will effectively treat all patients with this multi-factorial disease.

Medications trialed specifically for CRPS include calcitonin and bisphosphonates, and several immune modulating drugs. Treatments better studied in neuropathic pain include tricyclic anti-depressants, gabapentin and pregabalin, carbamazepine, opioids, clonidine, nifedipine, α-adrenergic antagonists, lidocaine patches, and topical capsaicin. This section summarizes the outcomes from the few CRPS trials, as well as the pertinent trials for related neuropathic pains. As with most treatments, drug therapy works best when prescribed in conjunction with functional restoration and treatment of other comorbid conditions (please see above).

### Intravenous ketamine infusion for complex regional pain syndrome: survey, consensus, and a reference protocol [^115pVjXc]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To find and reach a consensus on the usage of ketamine in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome and to determine a reference protocol for future studies.

Design

Three hundred fifty-one medical professionals participated in our survey on practice procedures, with 104 respondents providing information on their usage of ketamine for treating the pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome. Respondents answered questions about inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, children vs adults, safety, and basic demographic information. An expert group then met to reach a consensus for a reference protocol.

Results

There is a difference in how inpatients are treated compared with outpatients, making it necessary to have two different reference protocols. The duration of pain relief varied from one to 10days to one to six months, with a correlation between the duration of pain relief and total infusion hours per round.

Conclusions

The consensus reference protocols are made up of nine recommended topics. Reference protocols need to be validated by extensive research before guidelines can be created.

Evidence in non-CRPS pain conditions also suggests that targeting acceptance of CRPS may enhance pain coping and quality of life in CRPS patients. ACT is considered a next generation CBT intervention, and it focuses on helping patients engage in flexible patterns of behavior that increase engagement in valued life activities despite continuing pain and discomfort. Given the dearth of proven medical interventions for CRPS and its sometimes intractable nature, interventions such as ACT that target learning to live more effectively with the condition are likely to prove valuable.

Given the impact of learned disuse as a potential barrier to reactivation, behavioral interventions targeting this disuse can also be an integral component of the overall treatment program. Reactivation and behavioral goals must necessarily balance disuse concerns with avoiding severe pain exacerbations that could potentially contribute to maintenance of CRPS and reinforce learned disuse. Realistic pain-limited incremental reactivation is key, with the psychologist and functional therapists coordinating efforts to ensure that appropriate activity goals are set and that problems encountered in this reactivation process (e.g. pain-related fear of movement) are effectively addressed. As noted above, there is some experimental evidence supporting the efficacy of graded in vivo exposure therapy to address pain-related fear in CRPS, with apparent beneficial effects on pain and other CRPS symptoms as well.

### Canadian surveillance study of complex regional pain syndrome in children [^114PZr7s]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome treatment recommendations typically include physical therapy and intensive cognitive behavioral therapy with pharmacotherapy and referral to specialist care. Mirror therapy or graded motor imagery, as a component of physical therapy, has also been recommended. It is reassuring that therapy referrals in this study most commonly included physical therapy (83.3%) and multidisciplinary pain clinics (72.6%). A small number of patients withdrew from physical treatments because of pain exacerbation (5.3%). Pain education was recommended for only 65.6% of cases. To date, there are no specific pharmacological treatments recommended for pediatric CRPS and no large scale clinical trials have been conducted. Although efficacy data are limited for pediatric CRPS, standard treatments for both nociceptive and neuropathic pain (eg, tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentinoids) are commonly used to support engagement in physical therapy and target functional goals. In this study, topical treatments were more common than opioids, perhaps representing a change in prescribing patterns. Topical prescribing has not been reported in past studies. Analgesic use was similar in the Scottish surveillance study, but in that study, more than 60% of patients received pain-modulating agents. Previous adult research has reported limited effect from common analgesics such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. In this study, analgesics (eg, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) were more commonly prescribed than antiepileptic drugs or antidepressants, and graded motor imagery was not used commonly, which raises concerns as to whether clinicians are relying on ineffective treatments for children.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^115GUudA]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

4.1. Recommendations for clinicians in the adult setting

There is no gold standard laboratory, radiological, or genetic test to diagnose CRPS. This is true for many primary pain disorders, where the etiology is ill defined and can be highly variable with many contributing biological, psychological, and social factors. In addition, CRPS is highly complex with the large number of symptoms that coexist with pain. As is the case with many pain disorders, in the absence of a gold standard test, patients are often diagnosed based on a clinical diagnosis. To aid in making a clinical diagnosis for CRPS, clinicians can use one of the 4 diagnostic tools. There are no existing screening tools for CRPS, and as such, people with suspected CRPS should undergo rapid diagnostic assessment. Reducing wait-times for patients with suspected CRPS is recommended in community-based settings and specialist pain clinics.

Of the 4 diagnostic tools reviewed in this article, there are no significant differences in the feasibility of applying the criteria. All tools require a combination of physical examination and self-report, and none require costly equipment. The Budapest Criteria are explicitly endorsed by the IASP, the international society that makes recommendations on assessment, prevention, and treatment of pain diseases. Clinicians should follow the recommendations of the IASP and use the Budapest Criteria for diagnosing CRPS in adults. This review cannot make recommendations based on the sufficiency of measurement properties of the diagnostic tools because this review did not comprehensively examine them (eg, with a tool such as the COSMIN guideline for systematic reviews of outcome measures). However, based on the data that were gathered, no tool was comprehensively evaluated across all measurement property domains, which would be required to approach a strong recommendation according to COSMIN guidelines. Furthermore, there is a notably high degree of variability across studies in the sensitivity of the Budapest Criteria (45%-99%) and the Budapest Research Criteria (20%-78%). This highlights the importance of using clinical expertise, and not using any diagnostic tool as a standalone assessment.

### Complex regional pain syndrome or limb pain: a plea for a critical approach [^1126uchP]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Most frequently, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) develops after a trauma and affects distal parts of the limbs. Early recognition and initiation of adequate treatment is crucial for a favorable outcome. On the other hand, misdiagnosing other disorders as CRPS is detrimental because more appropriate treatment may be withheld from the patients. Despite intensive research, a specific biomarker or paraclinical measure for CRPS diagnosis is still lacking. Instead, clinical criteria approved by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and latest adapted in 2019 are central for diagnosing CPRS. Thus, the CRPS diagnosis remains challenging with the risk of a "deliberate diagnosis" for unexplained pain, while at the same time a delayed CRPS diagnosis prevents early treatment and full recovery. CRPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. To clinically diagnose CRPS, a vigorous exclusion of "other diseases that would better explain the signs and symptoms" are needed before the patients should be referred to tertiary centers for specific pain treatment. We highlight red flags that suggest "non-CRPS" limb pain despite clinical similarity to CRPS. Clinical and neurological examination and paraclinical evaluation of a probably CRPS patient are summarized. Finally, we pinpoint common differential diagnoses for CRPS. This perspective might help CRPS researchers and caregivers to reach a correct diagnosis and choose the right treatment, regardless whether for CRPS mimics or CRPS itself.

General Considerations

To help avoid unrealistic expectations, patients should be told that while there is no treatment proven to cure CRPS or reduce symptoms in all patients, the drugs that patients will receive during their treatment have been shown to help with CRPS for some patients.
Recognize that CRPS may be more than just a single unitary condition. Early CRPS (up to 6–18 months duration) can respond differently to interventions than persistent CRPS. Importantly, patients diagnosed with early CRPS likely will naturally improve and drugs or nerve-blocks that are effective even for only a few months may bridge the time to natural recovery. Approximately 15% of early CRPS patients fail to recover, and an early cold limb may be a poor prognostic sign.
Understand that most patients will over time develop analgesic tolerance to available drugs whereas side effects often continue.
Available drugs are not thought to "cure" the condition.
Monotherapy is best, to minimize adverse effects, cost, and patient non-compliance, but rational polypharmacy is often needed, particularly to address the various CRPS symptoms (and disease subtypes). This of course should comprise rational combinations of different classes of medications rather than multiple medications from the same class.
The choice of medications should include cost considerations and other patient needs.
Drugs that simultaneously treat multiple symptoms are desirable, for example, tricyclic antidepressants are relatively effective in RCTs for relieving neuralgic pain and also effective for anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
Traditionally, as needed (PRN) drug intake was considered inferior to scheduled drug intake. However, recognition that patients often develop tolerance to regular analgesic drug intake has changed this consideration somewhat. Some patients may benefit from taking certain drugs as and when required, for example after a bad day, or in anticipation of a difficult night. More research is needed to clarify this question.
Reasonable treatment outcomes should be agreed upon in partnership with the patient before treatment starts (e.g. a pain reduction of two points on a 0–10 scale, improvement in specific functional activities). If these targets are not achieved, or if initial beneficial effects later lessen, the drug treatment should then be reconsidered.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^112fePf3]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

It is critical to identify and aggressively treat all spheres of the pain experience. Obsessing with only the biomedical sphere often dooms the clinician and patient to failure, especially in chronic CRPS. Psychological factors and comorbidity are equally important, often modifiable, treatment targets in CRPS and can help ensure optimal outcomes (detailed below). The psychological spheres of the pain experience can now be identified through the many psychometric, quantified measures that have been created and that have demonstrated efficacy in psychological assessment.

Psychological features are sometimes critically important diagnostic components to identify and aggressively treat. Subjective but quantifiable psychometric scores are also often employed as secondary outcomes in research. CRPS is not a psychological disorder, however, and it is therefore usually illogical to designate psychometric outcomes as primary benchmarks of improvement in CRPS treatment. Thus, solely treating psychological aspects of a patient's CRPS is also doomed to fail. Both pain intensity and the psychological sequelae/co-morbidities of pain are recognized, fundamental elements in understanding the whole patient, yet the subjective character of these elements and their measurement deem them less suitable for research or for interpreting clinical outcomes. Applying interventions solely as a means of trying to reduce pain ratings is a strategy that is equally doomed to fail. More objective clinical benchmarks and outcomes should be identified if possible — standards upon which clinical decisions may be made and success may be measured. Thus, ideally, treatment of CRPS should rely upon an intuitive, measurable, and step-wise functional restoration algorithm as the pivotal feature of treatment of CRPS.

Functional restoration has historically and empirically been considered a critical and necessary component of interdisciplinary pain management programs for CRPS. This contention has been codified by two large international consensus-building conferences. Baron and Wasner concluded that physiotherapy is "of utmost importance", and Birklein et al. argued that rehabilitation techniques should always be employed for the "obvious reasons" outlined in these manuscripts. In a Dutch multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline for treatment of CRPS, physical therapy is reported to have beneficial effect with regard to functional restoration and ability to cope with the complaint, and therefore should form a part of the standard treatment for CRPS. Furthermore, the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) has concluded that physical functioning is a "core domain" in the assessment of pain treatment efficacy, second only to pain assessment.

### Mechanism-based treatment in complex regional pain syndromes [^112dKriF]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS) are multifactorial disorders with complex aetiology and pathogenesis. Management of CRPS is challenging, partly because of a lack of clinical data regarding the efficacy of the various therapies, and partly because successful treatment of CRPS requires a multidisciplinary, patient-tailored approach. The pain in CRPS is often described as typical 'burning' neuropathic pain, and is accompanied by a variety of sensory, motor and autonomic signs and symptoms. Because research into therapies specifically in CRPS has been scarce, treatment for these syndromes has been largely based on therapeutic strategies adapted from neuropathic pain states; however, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of CRPS has provided the opportunity to develop mechanism-based treatments. The interactions between the multiple pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the development, progression and maintenance of CRPS remain poorly understood. This Review describes the challenges in linking the current theories and knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms to the mode of actions of the different treatment approaches. We discuss the current treatment strategies for CRPS, including pharmacotherapy, sympathetic ganglion block interventions, psychological support, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and establish the concept of mechanism-based treatment for CRPS.

### Comprehensive mechanisms and non-invasive treatment for complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review [^114WS5oD]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by an exaggerated response to an initial stimulus, accompanied by autonomic, sensory, motor, and sudomotor dysfunctions. Recognized as a systemic disorder, CRPS involves complex interactions among inflammatory, immunologic, neurogenic, genetic, and psychological factors. The primary mechanisms include peripheral and central sensitization, sympathetic nervous system dysregulation, and altered somatosensory processing. However, the exact pathophysiology remains unclear, contributing to ongoing debate about optimal treatment approaches. Management typically involves a multimodal approach. Pharmacologic options such as corticosteroids, ketamine, and bisphosphonates have demonstrated relative safety and efficacy in clinical practice. Moreover, rehabilitation therapies — including cortically directed sensorimotor rehabilitation, range-of-motion or aerobic exercises, exposure therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and thermal therapy — serve as valuable nonpharmacologic interventions. No consensus currently exists on standardized treatment protocols for CRPS, particularly regarding the choice of non-invasive approaches. In this context, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for guiding appropriate management strategies. This review provides updated insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, alongside a synthesis of evidence-based non-invasive treatment, to support mechanism-driven clinical decision-making, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

### Prednisolone effective for complex regional pain syndrome… [^116HK2D9]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Which is more effective for complex regional pain syndrome following stroke: prednisolone or piroxicam. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial Allocation: Concealed. Synopsis: Complex regional pain syndrome, which includes conditions such as causalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy, may follow stroke. The researchers identified 106 patients with this syndrome following stroke. After excluding those with diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, heart disease, ulcer, or mild disease, there were 60 patients remaining for the study. These patients were randomized to receive piroxicam 20 mg per day or prednisolone 40 mg per day for 14 days, followed by a taper of 10 mg per week. The mean age of participants was 56 years, the age range was 40 to 70 years, and one third were women. Groups were balanced at the start of the study, and there were no dropouts.

The primary outcome was a 14-point symptom score, for which 14 was the worst and 0 was the best. After one month, the score decreased from a mean of 10. 7 to a mean of
4. 3 in the prednisolone group but did not change significantly in the piroxicam group. An improvement of two points or more was considered clinically significant and occurred in 83 percent of patients taking prednisolone compared with 17 percent taking piroxicam Bottom Line: Prednisolone provides short-term pain relief in patients with complex regional pain syndrome. Longer studies are needed to assess the persistence of this benefit and to better define its risks.

### Rational pain management in complex regional pain syndrome 1 (CRPS 1) – a network meta-analysis [^114e15K3]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) 1 advocate several substance classes to reduce pain and support physical rehabilitation, but guidance about which agent should be prioritized when designing a therapeutic regimen is not provided. Using a network meta-analytic approach, we examined the efficacy of all agent classes investigated in randomized clinical trials of CRPS 1 and provide a rank order of various substances stratified by length of illness duration.

Design

In this study a network meta-analysis was conducted.

Patients

The participants of this study were patients with CRPS 1.

Method

Searches in electronic, previous systematic reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, and the reference lists of relevant articles were performed. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing at least one analgesic agent with placebo or with another analgesic and reporting efficacy in reducing pain. Summary efficacy stratified by symptom duration and length of follow-up was computed across all substance classes. Two authors independently extracted data.

Results

In total, 16 studies were included in the analysis. Bisphosphonates appear to be the treatment of choice in early stages of CRPS 1. The effects of calcitonin surpass that of bisphosphonates and other substances as a short-term medication in more chronic stages of the illness. While most medications showed some efficacy on short-term follow-up, only bisphosphonates, NMDA analogs, and vasodilators showed better long-term pain reduction than placebo.

Limitation

For some drug classes, only a few studies were available and many studies included a small group of patients. Insufficient data were available to analyze efficacy on disability.

Conclusion

This network meta-analysis indicates that a rational pharmacological treatment strategy of pain management should consider bisphosphonates in early CRPS 1 and a short-term course of calcitonin in later stages. While most medications showed some efficacy on short-term follow-up, only bisphosphonates, NMDA analogs and vasodilators showed better long-term pain reduction than placebo.

### Pain exposure physical therapy versus conventional treatment in complex regional pain syndrome type 1-a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial [^114nhx7Y]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A randomized controlled study published in 2015 found no clinical difference between two different types of treatment for people with complex regional pain syndrome type 1, but we did observe a difference in the use of healthcare resources. Because currently there is no effective management available, less economic costs with comparable outcomes are relevant and interesting.

Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 is a debilitating condition that usually develops following injury, but can also arise spontaneously. The disorder is characterized by pain and sensory, autonomic, motor, and/or trophic changes. There is emerging evidence that pain-related fear and avoidance behavior can lead to disease deterioration and the development of chronic pain-related disability. Despite elaborate research, treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 can still be disappointing and there is a need for more high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of most therapies.

In the present randomized controlled trial, we compared a Pain Exposure Physical Therapy approach to the Dutch conventional guideline-based treatment in patients with complex regional pain syndrome type 1. The guideline includes pharmacological interventions with various drugs and intensive pain-contingent physical therapy sometimes taking a few months or even years. Key element of the Pain Exposure Physical Therapy intervention is to stimulate the use of the affected extremity while simultaneously ignoring the pain. Although we found no difference in clinical effect between both interventions we expected that early and forced use in daily life, without the use of medication, would lead to lower costs. Pain Exposure Physical Therapy follows a time-contingent treatment scheme with a maximum of five treatment sessions.

Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 is a very costly disorder. Annual costs for chronic regional pain syndrome type 1 in the Netherlands have been estimated between €32.5 million and €47.3 million, including medical costs as well as nonmedical costs and costs of lost productivity. With this particular study, we investigated the potential cost-effectiveness of Pain Exposure Physical Therapy versus conventional treatment.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: a narrative review for the practising clinician [^113G4YeL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a life-altering condition that usually affects the extremities after a trauma or nerve injury. The physiologic changes that occur as a result of the inciting injury are complex, as the name of the syndrome implies. The pain and disability associated with CRPS often lead to psychological co-morbidities that create a vicious cycle of pain, isolation, and depression. We review recent developments in the understanding of CRPS and advancements in management of this syndrome. Further research in targeting specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of CRPS should lead to prevention of this condition.

Given the nearly complete absence of RCTs of psychological interventions for CRPS, results of a recent review and meta-analysis of cognitive behavioral interventions in other neuropathic pain patients may be informative. Only a single randomized controlled trial of high methodological quality was identified, which demonstrated significant efficacy of cognitive behavioral interventions for reducing neuropathic pain intensity, although this effect was restricted to women (level 2). However, meta-analysis of all four available controlled trials (level 1) indicated no overall significant effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on neuropathic pain intensity. These results do not provide unambiguous support for the likely efficacy of psychological interventions in CRPS patients, but firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to the limited number of studies available.

In summary, there are only a few small RCTs specifically testing the efficacy of psychological interventions for CRPS, either alone or in the multidisciplinary context. However, the data available do suggest that psychological interventions are likely to be a useful part of a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment program. The efficacy of such techniques for CRPS would not be surprising, given the strong evidence of their utility in other types of chronic pain. These results will be briefly summarized below.

Table 2
IASP diagnostic criteria for CRPS

Table 3
Budapest clinical diagnostic criteria for CRPS

As previously mentioned, the diagnosis of CRPS is a clinical one, based on a meticulous history and physical examination which includes a thorough neurologic assessment. The diagnostic criteria developed for the diagnosis of adult CRPS can further assist in the diagnosis of CRPS in children and adolescents. We recommend that all patients suspected of CRPS should also undergo baseline laboratory tests, including complete blood count, blood chemistry, CRP, ESR, creatinine kinase and ANA. When the history or physical examination arouses suspicion of an active thyroid disease, thyroid function test should be performed as well. It is also recommended to perform a plain radiograph (if not previously performed) of the affected limb to rule out any localized pathology to the bones, joints and surrounding tissue. Usually, no further diagnostic evaluations are needed if there are no abnormal findings in the initial diagnostic workup. However, if the initial diagnostic workup suggests a different diagnosis, such as infection, a rheumatic disease, or a malignancy, further laboratory and imaging test are needed.

Treatment

The primary goals for the treatment of CRPS are pain relief and the improvement of all domains of functioning; thus, improving the patient's quality of life. The scope of therapy includes an intensive physical therapy program combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention. This often contradicts the patient's logic, where rest is considered as means of improving his or her symptoms. A Cochrane review published in 2013 on interventions for treating pain and disability in adults with CRPS concluded that there was a lack of high quality evidence for most CRPS therapies. In 2012, The American Pain Society published a position statement on assessing and managing children with chronic pain. It recommended the use of interdisciplinary treatment programs for children with chronic pain, which incorporate CBT with physical and occupational rehabilitation.

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^116mwfFa]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome has long been recognized as a severe and high impact chronic pain disorder. However, the condition has historically been difficult to define and classify and little attention has been given to where complex regional pain syndrome sits within other apparently similar chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia and regional pain syndrome. In this review challenges in regard to nomenclature, definitions, and classification of complex regional pain syndrome are reviewed and suggestions are provided about future directions.

Interdisciplinary Management

The following interdisciplinary rehabilitation section focuses on the history, description and evidence for CRPS rehabilitation-based treatment. A systematic review of the evidence was conducted utilizing PubMed and MEDLINE. Search terms included "CRPS", "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome", "causalgia", "reflex sympathetic dystrophy", "rehabilitation", "interdisciplinary management", "occupational therapy", "physical therapy", "recreational therapy", and "vocational therapy". No time limit was applied to this search. Studies were selected based on the highest quality evidence available and relevance to CRPS rehabilitation. Also, anecdotal and practical information are included to assist the CRPS treatment practitioner.

A Dahlem type (think-tank) conference was held in Malibu, California, in 1997 to generate consensus as to treatment guidelines for CRPS. All treatments were focused on functional restoration (primarily the "reanimation of the affected part"); the use of drugs, blocks, and psychotherapy was reserved for patients failing to progress in the functional algorithm. Figure 2 portrays the Malibu CRPS treatment algorithm, updated to reflect some newer intervention approaches now available. Interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary pain management techniques emphasizing functional restoration are thought to be the most effective therapy for chronic pain, perhaps by resetting altered central processing and/or normalizing the distal environment (level 1). The Malibu algorithm has been corroborated and empirically "validated" by frequent clinical use, although a proper controlled trial of such a clinical algorithm is not fiscally feasible.

### Pharmacologic treatment of complex regional pain syndrome I: a conceptual framework [^116mAMtd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Pain may be a leading symptom in complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS I) and may hinder functional recovery. In this case, a pharmacotherapeutic approach to pain should be part of the individually tailored interdisciplinary treatment regimen. However, operational criteria for determining which patient may profit from what therapeutic intervention are lacking. This article discusses a conceptual framework in which the rapid progress made in basic pain research may contribute to the clinical management of pain in CRPS I. First, recent insights in the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying CRPS I are reviewed. CRPS I is considered a neuropathic pain syndrome with a mixed and time-dependent profile of a regional inflammation, sensitization of primary somatosensory afferents (peripheral sensitization), and sensitization of spinal neurons (central sensitization). The dominant mechanisms may vary across individual patients with different time profiles. Second, a model was constructed in which signs and symptoms in an individual patient are related to these mechanisms. Finally, relating the clinical picture to the underlying pathophysiology may help determine the pharmacotherapeutic approach for an individual patient. Pharmacologic options are discussed in this context. The presented framework does not aim to provide an evidence-based treatment algorithm, ready to be used in daily clinical practice; rather it offers a crude, first step toward a mechanism-based pharmacotherapy in CRPS I, in an effort to shift from a mainly empirical treatment paradigm toward theory-driven treatment procedures.

### The efficacy of an interdisciplinary pain management program for complex regional pain syndrome compared to low back pain and chronic widespread pain: an observational study [^115vhUP2]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating condition which can occur in a person's limb following injury or surgery, or spontaneously. It is characterised by significant pain, sensory changes, temperature disturbance, discolouration, swelling, abnormal sweating, and trophic changes to nails, hair and skin. The pathophysiology of CRPS is complex and includes inflammatory mechanisms, autonomic dysregulation and nociplastic changes to the central nervous system. Full recovery from CRPS is relatively rare and it frequently leads to long-term disability.CRPS often causes significant psychological distress, and people with CRPS generally require support to manage pain, functional limitations and the broader effects of the condition.

Because CRPS is relatively uncommon, large clinical trials are challenging to conduct and there is a paucity of research documenting treatment efficacy. Although there have been some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of medical and physiotherapy interventions for CRPS, these are relatively few and treatment guidelines focus on functional restoration and physical rehabilitation, in addition to education, psychological intervention and pain relief.

Interdisciplinary pain management programs (IPMPs) are typically 3–4 week fulltime programs (30–40 hours per week) provided to people with chronic pain. They deliver cognitive and behavioural interventions including pain education, goal setting and activity planning, graded exercise, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training, and medication management, in an environment designed to reinforce "well" behavior (ie, operant therapy). The efficacy of IPMPs is well established for mixed chronic pain samples, low back pain (LBP), neck pain and chronic widespread pain (CWP). Treatment guidelines for CRPS include a recommendation for interdisciplinary pain management, and 80% of clinicians report using IPMPs for patients with persistent CRPS 9; however, there are no published RCTs evaluating the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapies or IPMPs in this population. Several observational studies have reported improvements in physical function, disability and emotional distress following an IPMP for a CRPS population, with mixed findings on outcomes for pain intensity. However, no studies of IPMP outcomes for CRPS have included a comparison group to test whether people with CRPS have a comparable treatment response as those with more widely studied conditions, where there is evidence for IPMP efficacy (LBP, CWP).

Interdisciplinary versus Multidisciplinary

Although interdisciplinary treatment programs are clearly the sine qua non of CRPS treatment (holistic, planned team treatment with special training of all modalities; meeting frequently to assess plan, progress/problems and re-plan as a team), this level of intensity is often unavailable except in large urban or academic centers. Payors often consider these interdisciplinary programs to be "too expensive" (although in actuality, our urban 4 week program costs 1/3 to 1/2 as much as a single spinal cord stimulator implant, and this doesn't consider maintenance, re-implant with lead failure etc.) and opt for less effective, but better understood single modalities. Whatever the rationale for interdisciplinary unavailability, the next best option is a multidisciplinary approach. This approach is traditionally characterized by a single lead practitioner (usually a physician or psychologist) organizing and arranging for specialty training and coordination of local resources, and then referring the patient to these separate modalities. Unfortunately, this is labor intensive (and poorly reimbursed) for the knowledgeable lead practitioner, as the only coordination is via the reports of the isolated modalities (e.g. no real "team"). However, in the context of a multifactorial disease such as CRPS, and the uncertainty as to which modalities are "going to work", either of these options is far superior to an unidisciplinary/unimodal approach.

An iterative program of research, conducted by members of the COMPACT consortium, has informed the development of the long-term, international CRPS clinical research registry and core data set (Figure 1). This work is ongoing, and more detail is given below on each stage of the program to date.

Figure 1.
COMPACT process.

A CRPS Core Data Set

A core outcome measurement set can be defined as a minimum set of standardized outcomes, which should be measured and reported in all research studies for a particular clinical condition. The COMPACT core data set was developed in two stages and includes:

Demographic data
Patient-reported questionnaire outcome measures
Clinician-reported outcomes/questionnaires.
Clinical outcome measures (currently in development)

In the first stage, a core set of patient-reported and clinician-reported questionnaire outcome measures was agreed upon (Table 4). This work was informed by a systematic literature review utilizing PubMed of outcome measures used in CRPS clinical trials (level 1 evidence), and an online survey (level 4 evidence) of usage of outcome measures in CRPS clinical trials by healthcare professionals and academics. Agreement on the final core set was achieved by means of consensus within international workshops. The patient-reported questionnaire outcome measures captured the minimum domains needed to answer the consortium-agreed research question "What is the clinical presentation and course of CRPS and what factors influence it?" and comprised the following domains: pain, disease severity, participation and function, emotional and psychological function, sleep quality, self-efficacy, catastrophizing, and patient's global impression of change. One clinician-reported questionnaire outcome measure, namely, the CSS, was also included.

Table 4.
COMPACT data set

The second stage was comprised of a two stage e-Delphi study of clinicians and academics working internationally in the area of CRPS in order to agree on which (if any) clinical outcome measures should be included in the core data set. Results of the e-Delphi survey were presented to core members of the study team in a workshop held in Valencia, Spain, in September 2019. The group considered the feasibility and acceptability of each outcome in the final selected list, and whether an outcome should be "core" or optional. This work is in preparation for publication.

### Canadian surveillance study of complex regional pain syndrome in children [^114DHJAs]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This study describes the minimum incidence of pediatric complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), clinical features, and treatments recommended by pediatricians and pain clinics in Canada. Participants in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program reported new cases of CRPS aged 2 to 18 years monthly and completed a detailed case reporting questionnaire from September 2017 to August 2019. Descriptive analysis was completed, and the annual incidence of CRPS by sex and age groupings was estimated. A total of 198 cases were reported to the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program, and 168 (84.8%) met the case definition. The minimum Canadian incidence of CRPS is estimated at 1.14/100,000 (95% confidence interval 0.93–1.35/100,000) children per year. Incidence was highest among girls 12 years and older (3.10, 95% confidence interval 2.76–3.44/100,000). The mean age of CRPS diagnosis was 12.2 years (SD = 2.4), with the mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis of 5.6 months (SD = 9.9) and no known inciting event for 19.6% of cases. Most cases had lower limb involvement (79.8%). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (82.7%) and acetaminophen (66.0%) were prescribed more commonly than antiepileptic drugs (52.3%) and antidepressants (32.0%). Referrals most commonly included physical therapy (83.3%) and multidisciplinary pain clinics (72.6%); a small number of patients withdrew from treatment because of pain exacerbation (5.3%). Pain education was recommended for only 65.6% of cases. Treatment variability highlights the need for empiric data to support treatment of pediatric CRPS and development of treatment consensus guidelines.

### Current practice in the rehabilitation of complex regional pain syndrome: a survey of practitioners [^111KCgJ6]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

International clinical guidelines for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome recommend a wide range and variation of rehabilitation therapies as the core treatment. It is likely that most therapists employ a range of approaches when managing people with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome but a recent Cochrane review identified little evidence relating to the effectiveness of multi-modal rehabilitation. There is need for up to date trials of rehabilitation for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, but in order to develop a clear model of best practice that can be rigorously evaluated we need to understand current practice.

Method

An electronic survey was disseminated internationally to clinicians involved in the rehabilitation of individuals with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. The survey aimed to establish which criteria are used for diagnosis and which modalities clinicians use to treat Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and which they consider ineffective or harmful.

Results

132 valid responses were received. A third of participants did not use any established criteria to diagnose Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Current practice commonly included patient education, encouragement of self-management, and physical exercises. Cortically directed treatments such as graded motor imagery and psychological approaches were often incorporated into treatment whereas pain provocative therapies, splinting, contrast bathing, and cold and heat therapy were rarely used in the acute or chronic phase of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.

Conclusion

A broad range of modalities are currently used in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome rehabilitation. Practice appears to be characterized by educational and exercise based interventions delivered in a pain-contingent manner which largely echoes recommendations in international clinical guidelines. Implications for Rehabilitation: Patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome suffer from a painful and disabling condition for which we still do not know the best treatment options. From our survey sample most clinicians use treatments recommended in the international guidelines. A large proportion of clinicians from our survey sample are not using internationally recognized diagnostic criteria and we therefore recommend that clinicians become familiar with these criteria and use them for all suspected Complex Regional Pain Syndrome cases.

Psychological Interventions

Clinicians who work with CRPS patients recognize that successful management of the syndrome presents a significant challenge. In the absence of any definitive medical treatment the need for interdisciplinary management of CRPS has been emphasized as above. It is now generally agreed that successful treatment must simultaneously address the medical, psychological, and social aspects of the syndrome. As will be described below, there are several reasons why addressing psychological and behavioral factors may be crucial to successful treatment in patients with CRPS. A rationale for use of psychological interventions in the management of CRPS will first be described. The treatment outcome literature regarding efficacy of psychological interventions for CRPS will then be presented, followed by a brief overview of relevant meta-analytic literature regarding efficacy of such interventions for non-CRPS chronic pain conditions. Finally, an overview of clinical recommendations for psychological care of CRPS patients based on both research literature and clinical experience will be presented.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^1113hYR8]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS; also known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy [RSD], causalgia). These guidelines have been sponsored by the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association and are written by expert practitioners in each discipline that is traditionally utilized in the treatment of CRPS. There is a fairly recent, excellent, rigorous systematic review of the treatment literature in CRPS which confirmed there is only modest high-quality research in the area. Nonetheless, in this "evidence vacuum" we still have a responsibility to treat. Certainly, we must develop better evidence, but our patients cannot wait for that. Thus, although the authors of these practical guidelines all utilized a systematic approach to reviewing the available and relevant literature, they have also included less rigorous, preliminary research reports, often supplemented by extensive empirical experience. The authors perforce must also extrapolate from "related conditions" (e.g. neuropathy). The research quality, clinical relevance and "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed, sometimes in considerable detail. Where there have been no discernable updates in areas since the 4th edition, text from that has been kept, sometimes verbatim.

These guidelines are intended to serve as an aid to the informed practitioner. They are not intended to replace or supplant the clinician's best judgment, experience, training and/or a careful consideration of the clinical context. Although every reasonable attempt has been made to minimize the bias of the authors, it must be recalled that, in context, all the experts are to a degree biased to "their" therapeutic approach.

Detailed sections are provided as a guide and informational source not only to the "expert" in CRPS therapy but also the primary practitioner who is interested. Levels of evidence are mentioned when appropriate (Table 1), so that the practitioner can better assess the modality under discussion and, if desired, to personally review the citations in detail. In the humanitarian spirit of making the most of all current thinking in the area, balanced by a careful case by case analysis of the risk/cost versus benefit analysis, we offer these "practical" guidelines.

Sympathetic Nerve Blocks

Sympathetic blockade with local anesthetics has long been a traditional part of the armamentarium of regional nerve blocks utilized to treat CRPS. Several decades ago, the prevailing opinion as proposed by Livingston was that the disorder causing the symptoms and physical exam findings of CRPS were due to an abnormal upregulation of the sympathetic nervous system (although this is questionable). Therefore, sympathetic nerve blocks were historically thought to be a necessary step in managing pain caused by CRPS and to facilitate progress in the interdisciplinary algorithm.

Multiple mechanisms have been postulated in the development of CRPS, including the involvement of nociceptor/peripheral and regional sensitization, central sensitization, the somatosensory, sympathetic, and motor systems. Autonomic signs of CRPS include skin temperature and color asymmetry, local inflammation andedema, that contribute to pain out of proportion to the initial injury. Sympathetic nerve blocks have historically been considered an important procedure both in the diagnosis (i.e. Sympathetically Maintained Pain; SMP) and treatment of CRPS. In the subgroup of CRPS patients with SMP (responsive to sympathetic blocks), there is some evidence suggesting the coupling of sympathetic nerves with several types of afferent nerve fiber types in the peripheral and central nervous system completing feed-back and feed-forward loops in CRPS (level 4).

It is a less common form of CRPS, which typically affects the upper and lower limbs. The O-CRPS is characterised by severe, burning or throbbing pain in the face and mouth, often accompanied by other symptoms like swelling or changes in skin texture, increased sensitivity to touch, temperature or light, difficulty opening or closing the mouth, dryness or excessive drooling, tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and vision changes.

Diagnosing orofacial CRPS (O-CRPS) is particularly challenging for healthcare providers and dentists specifically, due to the overlap with various orofacial pain (OFP) conditions.OFP encompasses a wide range of issues like temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, neuropathic pain and systemic disorders. This complexity necessitates a meticulous assessment, often involving imaging and nerve conduction studies to rule out other possibilities. While there is no single definitive test for O-CRPS, the Budapest criteria from the (IASP) guide diagnosis, as described above.

Background

O-CRPS is a rare and debilitating chronic pain condition affecting the face and mouth. This report acknowledges the scarcity of O-CRPS cases within the Saudi healthcare system and highlights the successful application of an interdisciplinary approach in patient management.

Given the complexities of O-CRPS diagnosis and management, an interdisciplinary approach has been used, fostering collaboration between dentists and a specialised pain rehabilitation team. The treatment plan adheres to the recommendations set forth by the (IASP) for CRPS interdisciplinary managementand incorporates the findings of the 2015 study by Parkitny et al. This ensures the intervention is not only evidence-based but also tailored to the patient's specific needs. By showcasing the success of this interdisciplinary approach and outlining a structured intervention method grounded in established research, this case report aims to illustrate the application of a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosing and managing (O-CRPS) within the Saudi healthcare system and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Self-Training Educative Pain Sensation (STEPS) model in managing O-CRPS.

### Interventions for treating pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome-an overview of systematic reviews [^111YC6Mw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition that usually occurs in a limb following trauma or surgery. It is characterised by persisting pain that is disproportionate in magnitude or duration to the typical course of pain after similar injury. There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal management of CRPS, although a broad range of interventions have been described and are commonly used. This is the first update of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2013.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence from Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of any intervention used to reduce pain, disability, or both, in adults with CRPS.

Methods

We identified Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane reviews through a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, PEDro, LILACS and Epistemonikos from inception to October 2022, with no language restrictions. We included systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that included adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with CRPS, using any diagnostic criteria. Two overview authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the reviews and certainty of the evidence using the AMSTAR 2 and GRADE tools respectively. We extracted data for the primary outcomes pain, disability and adverse events, and the secondary outcomes quality of life, emotional well-being, and participants' ratings of satisfaction or improvement with treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We included six Cochrane and 13 non-Cochrane systematic reviews in the previous version of this overview and five Cochrane and 12 non-Cochrane reviews in the current version. Using the AMSTAR 2 tool, we judged Cochrane reviews to have higher methodological quality than non-Cochrane reviews. The studies in the included reviews were typically small and mostly at high risk of bias or of low methodological quality. We found no high-certainty evidence for any comparison. There was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may reduce pain intensity post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.8 to -3.4, P = 0.001; I² = 81%; 4 trials, n = 181) and moderate-certainty evidence that they are probably associated with increased adverse events of any nature (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.47; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 168.0; 4 trials, n = 181). There was moderate-certainty evidence that lidocaine local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade probably does not reduce pain intensity compared with placebo, and low-certainty evidence that it may not reduce pain intensity compared with ultrasound of the stellate ganglion. No effect size was reported for either comparison. There was low-certainty evidence that topical dimethyl sulfoxide may not reduce pain intensity compared with oral N-acetylcysteine, but no effect size was reported. There was low-certainty evidence that continuous bupivacaine brachial plexus block may reduce pain intensity compared with continuous bupivacaine stellate ganglion block, but no effect size was reported. For a wide range of other commonly used interventions, the certainty in the evidence was very low and provides insufficient evidence to either support or refute their use. Comparisons with low- and very low-certainty evidence should be treated with substantial caution. We did not identify any RCT evidence for routinely used pharmacological interventions for CRPS such as tricyclic antidepressants or opioids.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite a considerable increase in included evidence compared with the previous version of this overview, we identified no high-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of any therapy for CRPS. Until larger, high-quality trials are undertaken, formulating an evidence-based approach to managing CRPS will remain difficult. Current non-Cochrane systematic reviews of interventions for CRPS are of low methodological quality and should not be relied upon to provide an accurate and comprehensive summary of the evidence.

Concerns with the Malibu Guidelines

In order to expedite reanimation and normalization of use of the affected extremity, functional restoration should efficiently supply a range of interventional and non-interventional treatment methods. In an effort to explore the creation of a stepwise functional restoration through a physiotherapeutic algorithm, a consensus-building symposium was held in Malibu in 1987. As noted above, the core principles of the algorithm generated by this group include patient motivation, desensitization, and reactivation facilitated by pain relief; the use of pharmacologic and/or interventional procedures to treat specific signs and symptoms; and cognitive behavioral psychotherapeutic techniques. As a result of the conference, the symposium members produced a white paper about the purpose and usefulness of an assortment of functional restoration treatment designs; they also recommended formal treatment guidelines (level 3).

The "Malibu" guidelines created some new problems. First, although these guidelines recognize several specific interventions to be applied (physical, pharmacologic, anesthesiologic, and psychologic), they offer no recommendations regarding optimal sequence or duration of these various interventions. Second, the original Malibu guidelines stressed the concept of time contingency, that is, the implication that all "patients should progress through each treatment level in 2 weeks or less", which has proven to be far too rigid and unrealistic in this complex syndrome. Third, the guidelines assert that drugs, sympathetic blocks and psychotherapy should be reserved and used only in cases where progress in the functional restoration-based algorithm has not been achieved. They fail to recognize the frequent necessity of providing medications, blocks, and psychological support from the beginning (and not "reserve" these interventions until after a patient has "failed to progress"). In our experience, it is more often than not the case that multiple interventions are required to get a patient started adequately in a functional restoration process.

### Invasive management for pediatric complex regional pain syndrome: literature review of evidence [^115knSy3]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a multifactorial condition with complex pathogenesis characterized by spontaneous or stimulus-induced pain that is disproportionate to the inciting event. It is also commonly accompanied by a myriad of autonomic and motor disturbances in highly variable combinations. This condition has been underreported in children until recently. Consequently, the management of CRPS in the pediatric population presents an even greater challenge than in adults, partly because there is a lack of clinical data concerning the efficacy of the diverse treatment methods available, and partly because successful treatment of CRPS involves a multidisciplinary approach. There is a variety of invasive methods to the treatment of CRPS, but scarce pediatric-focused trials have been published to date.

Objective

To examine and analyze the data currently existing for the invasive management of CRPS in children. It further suggests a management algorithm based in the evidence reviewed and our team experience.

Study Design

A comprehensive review of invasive management for pediatric CRPS.

Setting

Academic hospital in Spain.

Methods

A comprehensive review of all the evidence published to date was conducted. Four databases (PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases) were searched for articles published from 1980 to 2014. The eligibility criteria were any paper published in English or Spanish where a non-conventional approach was used to manage pediatric CRPS. Two independent reviewers extracted the data.

Results

Many case series have reported the use of interventional management with positive results; however, there is not a single randomized control trial to date comparing the conservative and the invasive management in children. The largest series of pediatric cases showed that between 29% to 35% of children with CRPS needed interventional measures to manage this condition successfully. Sympathetic blocks and spinal drug infusion emerge as the most reported techniques; the spinal infusion of drugs together with the spinal cord stimulation being the most successfully employed. Based upon the available evidence with regard to effect and complications, we recommend an algorithm for the management of pediatric CRPS.

Limitations

The limitations of this study include the paucity of literature, lack of randomized trials, and lack of quality evidence.

Conclusions

Invasive techniques have been used to treat CRPS over the last few decades; however, the evidence for their use is still very weak. Invasive management should be contemplated only when high-standard conservative management has failed to work.

### Global burden of complex regional pain syndrome in at-risk populations: estimates of prevalence from 35 countries between 1993 and 2023 [^112SNXuP]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, the most commonly used diagnostic criteria are the Budapest criteria, followed by The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria, and Veldman criteria. However, due to the complex and variable presentation of CRPS, there is no gold standard test for diagnosis, and clinicians often rely on clinical assessment supported by imaging, such as x-ray evidence of trophic changes, 3-phase (Tc99m) bone scintigraphy, or magnetic resonance imaging.

Owing to its variable manifestation and unknown pathophysiology, CRPS treatment remains challenging. Patients typically require an interdisciplinary and multimodal approach, including conservative treatment (eg, physical therapy, mirror therapy, and acupuncture), multimodal pharmacological therapy, and interventional procedures (eg, sympathetic plexus block, spinal cord stimulation, dorsal root ganglion stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and intrathecal drug delivery). Despite these efforts, severe cases may progress to the extent of requiring amputation. The multifaceted treatment contributes to the substantial economic burden associated with CRPS. Analysis of the Swiss national database revealed that management of CRPS approximates $86,900 in insurance costs and $23,300 in treatment costs per affected individual over a 5-year period. Moreover, after diagnosis, health care costs double, and prescription costs increase by approximately 2.6-fold from baseline costs annually.

Other research also supports the value of integrating psychological methods into multidisciplinary CRPS management. Two RCTs examining efficacy of physical therapy for CRPS described previously have included components of psychological treatment in the therapy package. Oerlemans et al. (level 2) tested a physical therapy protocol that included relaxation exercises and cognitive interventions (designed to increase perceived control over pain). This combined intervention was found to produce significantly greater improvements in pain, active range of motion, and impairment levels than were observed in the social work control group. In another RCT of physical therapy, Lee et al. (level 2) examined two different frequencies of physical therapy treatment (once per week versus three times per week) for child and adolescent CRPS patients, with both groups additionally receiving six sessions of cognitive behavioral treatment. Although no attentional control group was available for comparison, both groups were found to improve significantly in terms of pain and function when compared to their pre-treatment baselines. While the multicomponent interventions in both of these studies do not permit conclusions to be drawn specifically regarding the efficacy of psychological interventions, they do suggest that psychological treatment in combination with physical therapy may prove effective in a rehabilitation-focused approach to management of CRPS. This conclusion is also supported by results of a prospective controlled case series examining efficacy of combined therapy for CRPS. A 4-week interdisciplinary pain management program including medical treatment, physical and occupational therapy, and group psychotherapy produced significant improvements in several functional outcomes without any corresponding increases in pain-related anxiety, suggesting how such treatments could potentially work synergistically (level 3). Although not addressing CRPS specifically, one recent meta-analysis (level 1) suggests that psychological interventions for chronic pain may be more effective when provided in the context of multidisciplinary care than when provided alone. This meta-analysis found that effect sizes for an ACT intervention approach regarding disability and mood were significantly larger when ACT was provided in the multidisciplinary rather than unidisciplinary context.

### Multidisciplinary approach and the self-training educative pain sensation (STEPS) model for managing orofacial complex regional pain syndrome [^114EzsfG]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition that plagues individuals with intense pain, sensory abnormalities and dysfunction in an affected limb. The CRPS comes in two subtypes: CRPS-1, which occurs in the absence of a definitive nerve injury, and CRPS-2, which arises alongside a demonstrable nerve lesion. While the risk factors for CRPS lean towards middle-aged women with a history of physical or emotional trauma, the exact cause remains a puzzle. Research suggests a complex interplay of genetics, psychological factors like depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome, and abnormal responses within the nervous system, including heightened sensitivity in both the peripheral nerves and the pain-processing centres of the brain (central sensitisation).

CRPS unfolds in two distinct phases. The initial acute phase is characterised by inflammation, evident as redness, swelling, pain and warmth in the affected limb. This phase eventually transitions into the chronic phase, weeks or months later. The chronic phase is dominated by allodynia, a phenomenon where normally innocuous stimuli like a gentle touch are perceived as excruciating pain and hyperalgesia, an increased sensitivity to pain in general.

Diagnosing CRPS is a challenge due to the lack of a single definitive test. Instead, healthcare professionals rely on a set of established clinical criteria set forth by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), known as the Budapest criterion. These criteria rely on a comprehensive medical history, physical examination and the presence of specific symptoms in sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/oedema and motor/trophic categories, alongside the crucial exclusion of alternative explanations for the patient's pain.

Management of CRPS necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing various treatment modalities. Physical therapy plays a crucial role in improving mobility and function in the affected limb. Medication is often employed to manage the relentless pain, inflammation and any accompanying psychological distress. Psychological interventions can be immensely helpful in coping with the emotional toll of chronic pain.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome: a pilot study [^112Ts67M]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition that is debilitating and dramatically decreases quality of life. CRPS is characterized by a constellation of sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction.CRPS differs from other chronic pain conditions; neuropathic or generalized non-specific pain conditions; in that pain is associated with obvious and distinct alterations in sensory processing, sympathetic nervous involvement, and motor dysfunction. CRPS patients commonly present with allodynia whereby non-painful stimuli evoke a painful sensation. The worldwide incidence of CRPS is 26.2 per 100,000 people per yearand is 3 to 4 times more prevalent in females. Options for medical management of CRPS include medications such as opioids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and procedures such as sympathetic blockade and invasive spinal cord stimulation. However, evidence for these treatments come from medium to low quality randomized controlled trials (RCT). At present, CRPS is managed through continued physiotherapy with supportive treatment for pain and mental health.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 4th edition [^114K7xdp]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This is the fourth edition of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS; aka reflex sympathetic dystrophy).

Methods

Expert practitioners in each discipline traditionally utilized in the treatment of CRPS systematically reviewed the available and relevant literature; due to the paucity of levels 1 and 2 studies, less rigorous, preliminary research reports were included. The literature review was supplemented with knowledge gained from extensive empirical clinical experience, particularly in areas where high-quality evidence to guide therapy is lacking.

Results

The research quality, clinical relevance, and "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed, sometimes in considerable detail with an eye to the expert practitioner in each therapeutic area. Levels of evidence are mentioned when available, so that the practitioner can better assess and analyze the modality under discussion, and if desired, to personally consider the citations. Tables provide details on characteristics of studies in different subject domains described in the literature.

Conclusions

In the humanitarian spirit of making the most of all current thinking in the area, balanced by a careful case-by-case analysis of the risk/cost vs benefit analysis, the authors offer these "practical" guidelines.

In 2020, Mekhail et al. published a subgroup analysis from the previously published ACCURATE study. A retrospective analysis was conducted with 61 patients, who received a DRG neurostimulator implant. The outcomes of patients with paresthesia-free stimulation was compared to those who experienced paresthesia, measured at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 month follow ups. The percentage of patients with paresthesia free pain relief increased from 16.4% at 1 month to 38.3% at 12 months (level 3). Authors concluded that paresthesia based neurostimulation is not required for pain relief and is not congruent with trial success.

Randomized controlled studies of SCS for CRPS demonstrate "weak recommendations" as stated by Dworkin et al. The benefit of "shared decision making" should be emphasized with the patient by explicitly sharing the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this therapy. Dworkin et al, suggests reserving SCS therapy for patients who did not respond adequately to non-invasive treatments and sympathetic nerve blocks or for patients where nerve blocks are not appropriate. In 2020, Huygen et al. published a meta-analysis (level 1), which identified 217 patients with a permanent DRG implant at 12 months follow-up. Using a 10 point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) the analysis of pooled data overall showed a weighted mean pain score of 3.4, with 63% of patients demonstrating ≥ 50% pain relief. This study included efficacy sub-type analyses for CRPS type 1, causalgia (type II) and low back pain resulting in a mean NRS reduction in pain intensity of 4.9, 4.6, and 3.9, respectively. Thus, there is evidence supporting SCS and DRG for the treatment of CRPS, but high-quality and corroboratory evidence is needed.

### Intravenous therapies for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^112fRjsA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains a challenging clinical pain condition. Multidisciplinary approaches have been advocated for managing CRPS. Compared with spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal targeted therapy, IV treatments are less invasive and less costly. We aimed to systemically review the literature on IV therapies and determine the level of evidence to guide the management of CRPS. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane databases for articles published on IV therapies of CRPS up through February 2015. The search yielded 299 articles, of which 101 were deemed relevant by reading the titles and 63 by reading abstracts. All these 63 articles were retrieved for analysis and discussion. We evaluated the relevant studies and provided recommendations according to the level of evidence. We conclude that there is evidence to support the use of IV bisphosphonates, immunoglobulin, ketamine, or lidocaine as valuable interventions in selected patients with CRPS. However, high-quality studies are required to further evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of IV therapies for CRPS.

### Physiotherapy for pain and disability in adults with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) types I and II [^1142ugw3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful and disabling condition that usually manifests in response to trauma or surgery and is associated with significant pain and disability. CRPS can be classified into two types: type I (CRPS I) in which a specific nerve lesion has not been identified and type II (CRPS II) where there is an identifiable nerve lesion. Guidelines recommend the inclusion of a variety of physiotherapy interventions as part of the multimodal treatment of people with CRPS. This is the first update of the review originally published in Issue 2, 2016.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions for treating pain and disability associated with CRPS types I and II in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, PEDro, Web of Science, DARE and Health Technology Assessments from February 2015 to July 2021 without language restrictions, we searched the reference lists of included studies and we contacted an expert in the field. We also searched additional online sources for unpublished trials and trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physiotherapy interventions compared with placebo, no treatment, another intervention or usual care, or other physiotherapy interventions in adults with CRPS I and II. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were composite scores for CRPS symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), patient global impression of change (PGIC) scales and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened database searches for eligibility, extracted data, evaluated risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE system.

Main Results

We included 16 new trials (600 participants) along with the 18 trials from the original review totalling 34 RCTs (1339 participants). Thirty-three trials included participants with CRPS I and one trial included participants with CRPS II. Included trials compared a diverse range of interventions including physical rehabilitation, electrotherapy modalities, cortically directed rehabilitation, electroacupuncture and exposure-based approaches. Most interventions were tested in small, single trials. Most were at high risk of bias overall (27 trials) and the remainder were at 'unclear' risk of bias (seven trials). For all comparisons and outcomes where we found evidence, we graded the certainty of the evidence as very low, downgraded due to serious study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. Included trials rarely reported adverse effects. Physiotherapy compared with minimal care for adults with CRPS I One trial (135 participants) of multimodal physiotherapy, for which pain data were unavailable, found no between-group differences in pain intensity at 12-month follow-up. Multimodal physiotherapy demonstrated a small between-group improvement in disability at 12 months follow-up compared to an attention control (Impairment Level Sum score, 5 to 50 scale; mean difference (MD) -3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.13 to -0.27) (very low-certainty evidence). Equivalent data for pain were not available. Details regarding adverse events were not reported. Physiotherapy compared with minimal care for adults with CRPS II We did not find any trials of physiotherapy compared with minimal care for adults with CRPS II.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physiotherapy interventions on pain and disability in CRPS. This conclusion is similar to our 2016 review. Large-scale, high-quality RCTs with longer-term follow-up are required to test the effectiveness of physiotherapy-based interventions for treating pain and disability in adults with CRPS I and II.

### The therapeutic approach to complex regional pain syndrome: light and shade [^114ouDez]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a highly painful, limb-confined condition that usually arises after a trauma although its causes remain unknown. It is associated with a particularly poor quality of life, and considerable healthcare and societal costs. Its distinct combination of abnormalities includes limb-confined inflammation and tissue hypoxia, sympathetic dysregulation, small fibre damage, serum autoantibodies, central sensitisation and cortical reorganisation, which place it at the crossroads of disciplines including rheumatology, pain medicine and neurology. The significant scientific and clinical advances made over the past 10 years promise an improved understanding of the causes of CRPS, and for more effective treatments. This review summarises the currently available treatments. The therapeutic approach is multidisciplinary, and involves educating patients about the condition, sustaining or restoring limb function, reducing pain, and providing psychological support. This paper describes the systemic drug treatments, grouped on the basis of their real or presumed antinociceptive mechanisms and reported actions without making any formal distinction between CRPS types I and II.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: manifestations and the role of neurostimulation in its management [^114mftjV]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

The hallmark of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is excruciating pain (aching, burning, pricking, or shooting). Diagnosis should be established as soon as possible, as response to treatment is adversely affected by any delay. Treatment of CRPS is aimed at improving function, using an interdisciplinary, time-dependent, patient-dependent approach that encompasses rehabilitation, psychological therapy, and pain management. If no response to conventional treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy) is noted within 12–16 weeks, a more interventional technique such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS) should be used. SCS has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of CRPS type I, resulting in a significant, long-term reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life. SCS is particularly effective at helping to restore function in affected extremities, especially if applied early in the course of the disease. SCS is also cost effective and improves health-related quality of life.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^113WF6BT]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pain experienced by CRPS patients should be differentiated between nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain to optimize the management of CRPS. Pain should be seen as a continuum in which nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain can shift over the course of the syndrome due to a change in underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS. Precision medicine―by subgrouping CRPS patients based on history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing on the most prominent pain type―may tailor a more specific and effective treatment for individual CRPS patients.

### Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome [^111CMc6s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005, Issue 4 (and last updated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2013 issue 8), on local anaesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain to treat people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of LASB for the treatment of pain in CRPS and to evaluate the incidence of adverse effects of the procedure.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS (Birme), conference abstracts of the World Congresses of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and various clinical trial registers up to September 2015. We also searched bibliographies from retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of sympathetic blockade with local anaesthetics in children or adults with CRPS compared to placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The outcomes of interest were reduction in pain intensity, the proportion who achieved moderate or substantial pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the presence of adverse effects in each treatment arm. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included an additional four studies (N = 154) in this update. For this update, we excluded studies that did not follow up patients for more than 48 hours. As a result, we excluded four studies from the previous review in this update. Overall we included 12 studies (N = 461), all of which we judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to very low, downgraded due to limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or a combination of these. Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (N = 32). They did not demonstrate significant short-term benefit for LASB for pain intensity (moderate quality evidence). One small study (N = 36) at high risk of bias compared thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents into the subcutaneous space, reporting statistically significant and clinically important differences in pain intensity at one-year follow-up but not at short term follow-up (very low quality evidence). Of two studies that investigated LASB as an addition to rehabilitation treatment, the only study that reported pain outcomes demonstrated no additional benefit from LASB (very low quality evidence). Eight small randomised studies compared sympathetic blockade to various other active interventions. Most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block versus other active treatments (low to very low quality evidence). One small study compared ultrasound-guided LASB with non-guided LASB and found no clinically important difference in pain outcomes (very low quality evidence). Six studies reported adverse events, all with minor effects reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This update's results are similar to the previous versions of this systematic review, and the main conclusions are unchanged. There remains a scarcity of published evidence and a lack of high quality evidence to support or refute the use of local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for CRPS. From the existing evidence, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of this intervention, but the limited data available do not suggest that LASB is effective for reducing pain in CRPS.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^114h1xX6]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Minneapolis Conference

Because of these and other issues, a second expert panel (the Minneapolis Group) revisited the Malibu guidelines in August 2001, along with the pertinent literature up to that time. In response to clinical evidence suggesting that sequencing and timing of the treatment guidelines could be improved (e.g. under certain circumstances, concurrent rather than linear utilization of interdisciplinary interventions provided optimum treatment), the Minneapolis group recommended the use of concurrent "pathways", which were still built upon the original domains of rehabilitation, pain management, and psychological treatment. Additionally, the Minneapolis group liberalized the use of analgesic modalities, deemphasized time-contingency, while preserving the focus on function.

Both the Malibu and the Minneapolis groups emphasized the pivotal importance of functional restoration. Both acknowledged that pain management was important, but because pain reports can be heavily influenced by psychosocial state and reinforcement contingencies, pain was considered secondary to function as an outcome due to the latter's more objective nature. Both groups recognized, however, that pain would logically drive the type, quality, intensity, and pace of other interventions used to achieve the primary, functional outcomes. The next sections provide a detailed examination of each therapy directly involved in functional restoration.

CRPS Stages? CRPS Subtypes?

Is CRPS a uniform phenomenon across individuals, or are there distinct subtypes and/or stages of the syndrome? This issue of diagnostic heterogeneity, addressing whether or not patient presentations (i.e. the overall pattern of CRPS signs and symptoms) tend to be similar across individuals, may have significant implications for both prognosis and treatment. Historically, three progressive stages of CRPS have been cited as important in identifying and treating the syndrome (e.g.), but empirical studies indicate that the existence of such sequential stages is clinical lore and is an unsubstantiated theory based on certain authors' clinical experience rather than an outcome of specific scientific study (level 4). Statistical analysis (cluster analysis) to identify CRPS patient subgroups based on presence of similar patterns of clinical features has failed to support the traditional sequential staging of CRPS (level 2). When patients are assigned into three subgroups based on similarity of CRPS features, pain duration is similar across the groups, unlike what would be expected if the traditional sequential stages of CRPS were valid. Results of the first such study, for example, identified distinct patient subgroups characterized by: (1) a relatively limited syndrome with vasomotor signs predominating, (2) a relatively limited syndrome with neuropathic pain/sensory abnormalities predominating, and (3) a florid CRPS syndrome with a wide array of CRPS features similar to "classic RSD" descriptions. Both studies addressing this issue found statistical evidence for this latter, more severe CRPS patient subgroup.

### Complex regional pain syndrome in adults [^112HatbE]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a highly painful, limb-confined condition, which arises usually after trauma. It is associated with a particularly poor quality of life, and large health-care and societal costs. The causes of CRPS remain unknown. The condition's distinct combination of abnormalities includes limb-confined inflammation and tissue hypoxia, sympathetic dysregulation, small fibre damage, serum autoantibodies, central sensitization and cortical reorganization. These features place CRPS at a crossroads of interests of several disciplines including rheumatology, pain medicine and neurology. Significant scientific and clinical advances over the past 10 years hold promise both for an improved understanding of the causes of CRPS, and for more effective treatments. This review summarizes current concepts of our understanding of CRPS in adults. Based on the results from systematic reviews, treatment approaches are discussed within the context of these concepts. The treatment of CRPS is multidisciplinary and aims to educate about the condition, sustain or restore limb function, reduce pain and provide psychological intervention. Results from recent randomized controlled trials suggest that it is possible that some patients whose condition was considered refractory in the past can now be effectively treated, but confirmatory trials are required. The review concludes with a discussion of the need for additional research.

Although VR is frequently the final step of rehabilitation therapy, addressing return-to-work issues early is critical so as to set employment as a long-term goal. Allowing the patient an opportunity to participate in a trial graduated time/effort work period before providing final release for work is often an excellent way to observe his/her ability to return to work and perform job duties, and it also provides an opportunity to further assess work behaviors and capacity. In addition, the initial graded increase of time and effort spent at work greatly alleviates significant patient anxiety and thus improves chances of successful return-to-work. Return-to-work can be a form of therapy, provided the work activities do not exacerbate the problem or increase long-term pain.

The VR counselor should coordinate the provision of release for work by assembling information from all disciplines. Releases for sedentary or light duty should always list specific physical limitations, and the releases for limited duty should include comprehensive instructions. When preparing a release for work form, the VR specialist must take into account the abilities of the patient, including: lifting, pushing, pulling, walking, crouching, using stairs, using tools, bending at the waist, maintaining awkward and/or sustained postures, maintaining a sustained grip, tolerating extended sitting or standing, tolerating extensive data-entry functions and other repetitive motion tasks, tolerating hot and cold environments, and tolerating any severe vibrational factors. Any number of these factors may require modification of the work environment, particularly in chronic or severe CRPS. As is the case for RT, the value of VR in CRPS management is based solely on clinical experience rather than systematic research.
