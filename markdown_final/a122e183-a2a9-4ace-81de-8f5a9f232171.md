## Question

Can colchicine be used to treat acute cholangitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colchicine has any role in treating acute cholangitis and, if not, what the evidence and guidelines indicate instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how acute cholangitis is defined pathophysiologically and what guideline-backed standard care entails. Then, I should review colchicine's pharmacology, approved indications, and safety profile to see if there is a plausible or supported role. Next, I will check for any direct evidence of colchicine use in acute cholangitis, followed by data from related cholangiopathies like PBC and PSC to avoid inappropriate extrapolation. After that, I should assess mechanistic fit and potential harms in cholangitis patients, especially given hepatic or renal dysfunction and drug–drug interactions common in this setting. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical recommendation and highlight safer, evidence-based management pathways, verifying each step against high-quality sources as I go [^111RLMUX] [^115MKeNt] [^114jwxgn].

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and standard of care so I don't get ahead of myself: acute cholangitis is an acute bacterial infection supervening on biliary obstruction, and outcomes hinge on timely antibiotics plus source control via biliary decompression, typically with ERCP for moderate to severe disease; in fact, ERCP is recommended as the treatment of choice for decompression in such cases, with percutaneous or surgical drainage considered based on feasibility and severity, and guideline-based care emphasizes early risk stratification and urgent intervention to prevent sepsis and death [^111RLMUX] [^113S9jSh] [^114nkbWD] [^113KsLob].

> Wait, let me verify colchicine's mechanism and labeled uses before considering any off-label rationale: colchicine is an anti-inflammatory alkaloid that disrupts microtubule polymerization, inhibits neutrophil activation and migration, and modulates inflammasome-mediated IL-1β signaling; it is indicated for gout, FMF, recurrent pericarditis, and, at low dose, secondary prevention in ASCVD, but it is not an antimicrobial and has no effect on obstructive etiologies; importantly, it has a narrow therapeutic index with substantial toxicity risk and prominent CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein–mediated interactions, and it is not removed by hemodialysis [^115MKeNt] [^115bfKew] [^114jwxgn].

> I should double-check whether any guideline or trial actually evaluates colchicine in acute cholangitis; hold on, I need to be sure I'm not missing niche data: across the cited cholangitis and endoscopy guidelines and comprehensive reviews, colchicine is not mentioned as therapy for acute bacterial cholangitis, and the recommended management consistently centers on prompt broad-spectrum antibiotics and biliary drainage; my scan of the provided materials shows no trials or case series supporting colchicine in this indication, which aligns with the pathophysiologic need for antimicrobial therapy plus decompression rather than anti-inflammatory monotherapy [^111RLMUX] [^113KsLob] [^113S9jSh].

> Next, I should review related cholangiopathies to be sure I don't conflate chronic autoimmune cholestatic disease with acute infection; let me consider PBC and PSC data: in PBC, Cochrane systematic reviews found no benefit of colchicine on mortality, transplant, histology, or biochemistry, with insufficient evidence to support its use and potential for harm; in PSC, multiple guidelines explicitly state that small trials of colchicine and other immunomodulators have shown no efficacy and cannot be recommended for classic PSC; these diseases are pathobiologically distinct from acute bacterial cholangitis, so even if there had been a signal (there was not), it wouldn't justify extrapolation to an acute septic process [^116xZVg7] [^115Gcfv2] [^114o5NQ8] [^113GxxXj] [^1135WMGN].

> But wait, what if colchicine's anti-neutrophil effects could theoretically dampen biliary inflammation in acute cholangitis? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the problem in acute cholangitis is not sterile inflammation but bacterial overgrowth behind an obstruction, so clinical improvement requires bacterial eradication and relief of biliary pressure; colchicine has no antibacterial activity and does nothing to relieve obstruction, making it mechanistically mismatched to the therapeutic targets in this condition, whereas antibiotics and decompression directly address both drivers of morbidity and mortality [^111RLMUX] [^113KsLob] [^115MKeNt].

> I need to ensure safety considerations are front and center, because cholangitis patients often have cholestasis, organ dysfunction, and polypharmacy; let me verify key risks: colchicine exposure and toxicity increase with hepatic or renal impairment and with concomitant CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors common in biliary sepsis care (for example, clarithromycin), and the FDA specifically warns of life-threatening and fatal toxicities with standard doses when combined with such inhibitors in patients with hepatic or renal impairment; clarithromycin–colchicine coadministration has been associated with fatal outcomes, and colchicine poisoning is often refractory to extracorporeal removal and can be fatal, underscoring the narrow margin for error in acutely ill patients likely to have fluctuating organ function [^113AjjUZ] [^112khWRa] [^114jwxgn] [^115XPR6W].

> Let me reconsider the totality of evidence and align it with guideline-based care; I should confirm the core management steps to prevent therapeutic delay: the standard, life-saving approach is early, appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics and urgent biliary drainage (endoscopic stent or sphincterotomy with stone extraction as indicated), followed by definitive management of stones such as early cholecystectomy in suitable cases; there is no role for colchicine in this algorithm, and using it could delay essential therapy and increase risk through drug interactions and toxicity in a hemodynamically or organ-compromised patient [^111RLMUX] [^113S9jSh] [^114nkbWD] [^115kboQi].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm the bottom line clearly and clinically; colchicine should not be used to treat acute cholangitis because there is no evidence of benefit, its mechanism does not address infection or obstruction, and its safety profile is unfavorable in the typical cholangitis patient, whereas guideline-concordant antibiotics and prompt biliary decompression are the proven, urgent standards of care; I need to emphasize avoiding concomitant macrolides or other strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors with colchicine in any patient with hepatic or renal impairment due to the high risk of fatal toxicity, reinforcing that colchicine has no therapeutic role here and may be dangerous if introduced inadvertently during cholangitis management [^111RLMUX] [^113KsLob] [^113AjjUZ] [^112khWRa].

---

Colchicine is **not recommended** for acute cholangitis because it does not address the underlying infection or biliary obstruction [^111RLMUX] and is not included in any clinical guidelines [^114nkbWD]. The standard of care is **prompt antibiotics and urgent biliary drainage** [^113S9jSh]; colchicine's anti-inflammatory effects are irrelevant to the pathophysiology of acute cholangitis [^113KsLob], and its use risks serious toxicity, especially in hepatic or renal impairment [^113AjjUZ] [^112NixMc] [^112EMJrQ]. There is no evidence supporting colchicine for acute cholangitis, and its use should be avoided.

---

## Pathophysiology of acute cholangitis

Acute cholangitis is a **bacterial infection of the biliary tree** [^113KsLob], typically due to obstruction from gallstones, strictures, or tumors. Obstruction allows bacterial overgrowth and retrograde migration of enteric bacteria, leading to inflammation and sepsis. The classic presentation is Charcot's triad — fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain — with potential progression to sepsis, shock, and multiorgan failure [^1127GnzZ].

---

## Current standard of care for acute cholangitis

The **standard of care** includes:

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Prompt broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria [^1127GnzZ] [^114nkbWD].

- **Biliary drainage**: Urgent biliary decompression, typically via ERCP, to relieve obstruction and prevent sepsis [^111RLMUX] [^113S9jSh].

- **Supportive care**: Fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic support, and monitoring for complications [^1127GnzZ].

---

## Colchicine: pharmacological properties and clinical uses

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory alkaloid that inhibits microtubule polymerization [^115MKeNt], reducing neutrophil migration and cytokine release. It is used primarily for gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and pericarditis [^115bfKew]; however, it has a **narrow therapeutic index** and significant toxicity risk, particularly in hepatic or renal impairment [^113AjjUZ] [^112NixMc] [^112EMJrQ].

---

## Evidence regarding colchicine in acute cholangitis

There is **no evidence supporting colchicine** for acute cholangitis — no clinical trials, case reports, or guidelines support its use. Because it does not address the infection or obstruction central to the disease [^113KsLob], it is not appropriate.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of colchicine in acute cholangitis

Colchicine carries **significant risks**, particularly in hepatic or renal impairment [^113AjjUZ]:

- **Gastrointestinal toxicity**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common [^113b16TH].

- **Myopathy and neuropathy**: Risk increases with renal or hepatic impairment [^112NixMc].

- **Bone marrow suppression**: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia [^113AjjUZ].

- **Multiorgan failure**: Potentially fatal in overdose or impaired clearance [^115XPR6W].

- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors [^113AjjUZ] (e.g. clarithromycin) [^112khWRa] can cause life-threatening toxicity.

Given these risks, colchicine is **contraindicated in hepatic or renal impairment**, which is common in acute cholangitis.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

No **guidelines** or expert recommendations support colchicine for acute cholangitis [^111RLMUX] [^114nkbWD]. The **standard of care** remains antibiotics and biliary drainage [^113S9jSh]; colchicine has no role.

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

| **Aspect** | **Antibiotics** | **Biliary drainage** | **Colchicine** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Treat infection | Relieve obstruction | Anti-inflammatory |
| Evidence | Strong | Strong | None |
| Guideline support | Yes | Yes | No |
| Risks | Minimal | Minimal | Significant |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Colchicine is **not recommended** for acute cholangitis because it does not treat the infection or obstruction [^111RLMUX] and carries a significant risk of toxicity [^113AjjUZ], especially in hepatic or renal impairment. The **standard of care** is **antibiotics and urgent biliary drainage** [^113S9jSh]; therefore, colchicine should be avoided.

Acute cholangitis is an infectious disease characterized by acute inflammation and infection in the bile ducts resulting from a combination of biliary obstruction and bacterial growth in bile. Bacteria reach the biliary system either by ascent from the intestine or by the portal venous system. The most common cause of cholangitis is choledocholithiasis.

The key elements of therapy in acute cholangitis are adequate antimicrobial treatment to avoid or manage septic complications and biliary decompression to restore biliary drainage in case of obstruction. The clinical presentation varies, and initial risk stratification is important to guide further management. In severe cholangitis, an early interventional approach is absolutely essential for survival. The type and timing of biliary drainage should be based on the severity of the clinical presentation and the availability and feasibility of drainage techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and open surgical drainage.

ERCP plays a central role in the management of biliary obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the treatment of choice for biliary decompression in patients with moderate/severe acute cholangitis (Recommendation 1A).

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to compare endoscopic and open drainage in 82 patients with severe acute cholangitis with hypotension and disturbed consciousness. This RCT demonstrated that the morbidity… (Note: The text appears cut off and should be checked in the original document for completion.)

### Colchicine and SARS-CoV-2: Management of the hyperinflammatory state [^116AMSo7]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The global COVID-19 pandemic is currently underway. In December 2020, the European Agency of Medicine (EMA) licensed the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Therapeutic management of the COVID-19 positive patient should primarily aim to avoid the severe complications and organ injury caused by generalized inflammation from a cytokine storm, occurring in the most severe stages of viral infection. Knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 suggests a central role for exaggerated activation of the innate immune system as an important contributor to the adverse outcomes of COVID-19.

Several studies have shown that blocking the cytokine storm or acting early with prevention can be effective; studies are underway to evaluate agents that may reduce this hyperinflammatory state. The search for effective management strategies for COVID-19 continues to evolve. The actions of colchicine, one of the oldest anti-inflammatory therapies, target multiple pathways associated with excessive COVID-19 inflammation. Colchicine is easily administered, generally well tolerated, and inexpensive.

This article reports the scientific and molecular rationale for the use of colchicine as monotherapy or in combination in the various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection to modulate and control the inflammatory state. Low-dose colchicine may be considered safe and effective for the treatment and prevention of cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as an adjunctive remedy to other therapeutic agents. Well-organized clinical studies are needed to further validate these findings.

Rates of response were similar for the recommended low-dose treatment group (38%) and the nonrecommended high-dose group (33%) but were higher compared to the placebo group (16%) as shown in Table 8.

Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients achieving varying degrees of improvement in pain from baseline at 24 hours.

The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with FMF is derived from the published literature. Three randomized, placebo-controlled studies were identified. The three placebo-controlled studies randomized a total of 48 adult patients diagnosed with FMF and reported similar efficacy endpoints as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria.

One of the studies randomized 15 patients with FMF to a six-month crossover study during which five patients discontinued due to study noncompliance. The ten patients completing the study experienced five attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with colchicine compared to 59 attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with placebo. Similarly, the second study randomized 22 patients with FMF to a four-month crossover study during which nine patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy while receiving placebo or study noncompliance. The 13 patients completing the study experienced 18 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with colchicine compared to 68 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with placebo. The third study was discontinued after an interim analysis of six of the 11 patients enrolled had completed the study; results could not be confirmed.

The recommendations are based on the GRADE classification system, which classifies recommendations as strong or weak. The strength of recommendation is determined by the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, quality of evidence, variability in values and preferences, and resource use.

- **Evidence levels**: The GRADE system assesses evidence quality as high, moderate, low, or very low. A larger difference between desirable and undesirable effects increases the likelihood of a strong recommendation. Conversely, a narrower gradient suggests a weak recommendation.

- **Impact of evidence quality**: Higher quality evidence generally supports strong recommendations. When values and preferences vary significantly, or there is uncertainty in these areas, weak recommendations are more likely.

- **Resource use**: High intervention costs reduce the likelihood of a strong recommendation. Strong recommendations imply that most informed patients would choose the recommended management, allowing clinicians to structure patient interactions accordingly. In contrast, weak recommendations require clinicians to ensure care aligns with each patient's unique values and preferences.

The study demonstrates that colchicine administration leads to a notable reduction in mortality rates and a decrease in the necessity for oxygen therapy among individuals with COVID-19. Although its impact on broader outcomes like hospitalization rates, ICU admissions, and discharge rates remains minimal, there's a significant finding regarding its efficacy in lowering hospitalizations specifically among PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. This detailed understanding highlights the potential of colchicine as a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19, particularly in mitigating mortality risks and oxygen therapy requirements. These results offer valuable insights for clinicians, highlighting the need to consider colchicine as a viable treatment option for COVID-19 patients, while also emphasizing the necessity for further exploration to optimize its clinical utility.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^117VfbCj]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Colchicine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with an oral bioavailability of around 50% on average. It is primarily eliminated through biliary excretion and feces. Colchicine is mainly transported into the gastrointestinal tract by the multidrug resistance transporter molecule P-glycoprotein. Enteric and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which catalyzes demethylation of colchicine to inactive metabolites, also contributes to colchicine metabolism, along with a minor (10%–20%) contribution to elimination via the kidneys. Importantly, CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein are very frequently colocalized, leading to robust mutual inhibition by many drugs of these molecules. Colchicine is also subject to a range of drug interactions, particularly with CYP3A4 inhibitors, which can result in a doubling of colchicine plasma concentrations, and with P-glycoprotein inhibitors, which may quadruple colchicine concentrations.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the use of drug concentrations to guide therapy to improve drug efficacy and/or reduce toxicity. It has particular benefits for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, in which the difference between clinically effective concentrations and concentrations associated with adverse events is small. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic range, with many patients experiencing dose-dependent gastrointestinal toxicity. Plasma colchicine concentrations have been measured in some cases of fatal colchicine overdose, with levels ranging from 10 to 250 ng/mL (10–250 μg/L).

### Probenecid and colchicine [^1151Eo1h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to this product or to probenecid or colchicine. Probenecid and colchicine tablets are contraindicated in children under 2 years of age. They are not recommended for individuals with known blood dyscrasias or uric acid kidney stones. Therapy with probenecid and colchicine should not be started until an acute gouty attack has subsided.

- **Pregnancy**: Probenecid crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood. Colchicine can arrest cell division in animals and plants. In certain species of animals under specific conditions, colchicine has produced teratogenic effects. The possibility of such effects in humans has also been reported. Due to the colchicine component, probenecid and colchicine is contraindicated in pregnant patients. The use of any drug in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against the possible hazards.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Diagnosis, prognosis, and management [^1168ET55]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic immune-mediated liver disease of unclear etiology, characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of bile ducts. It primarily affects middle-aged men and is associated with a four-fold increase in mortality compared to an age- and sex-matched population. Progressive biliary and hepatic damage leads to portal hypertension and hepatic failure in most patients over a 10- to 15-year period from initial diagnosis. Additionally, PSC markedly increases the risk of hepatobiliary cancers, such as cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, with cancer being the leading cause of mortality in patients with PSC. It is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in 70% of patients and increases the risk of colorectal cancer almost ten-fold. Despite extensive research, the pathogenic mechanisms of PSC remain incompletely understood, although there is growing evidence supporting the role of genetic and immunologic factors. There are no proven medical therapies that alter the natural progression of the disease; hence, liver transplantation is the only available treatment for patients with advanced PSC, yielding excellent outcomes in this population.

### Lodoco [^114jwxgn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In healthy volunteers (n = 12), 40 to 65% of 1 mg orally administered colchicine was recovered unchanged in urine. Enterohepatic recirculation and biliary excretion are also postulated to play a role in colchicine elimination. Following a single oral dose of 0.5 mg daily, the mean effective half-life in healthy volunteers is 19 hours. Colchicine is a substrate of P-gp, and it is not removed by hemodialysis.

- **Specific populations**:

	- **Geriatric patients**: The pharmacokinetic studies of Lodoco were not conducted in elderly patients. In a study comparing the relative bioavailability between 18 elderly subjects and 20 young subjects, the following pharmacokinetic parameter values (mean ± SD) were observed for colchicine in the young and elderly subjects, respectively: AUC (ng·hr/mL) 22.4 ± 7.0 and 25.0 ± 6.9; Cmax (ng/mL) 2.6 ± 0.7 and 2.6 ± 1.0; Tmax (h) 1.4 ± 0.4 and 1.3 ± 0.4; apparent elimination half-life (h) 24.9 ± 5.3 and 30.1 ± 10.8. No statistical differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters were found between the groups, and it was concluded that no dosing adjustments were required in elderly patients.

### Confirmed fatal colchicine poisoning in an adolescent with blood and bile concentrations-implications for GI decontamination [^115XPR6W]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). High credibility.

Colchicine is commonly used to treat diseases like acute gouty arthritis. However, colchicine has a very narrow therapeutic index, and ingestions of more than 0.5 mg/kg can be deadly. We report a fatal acute colchicine overdose in an adolescent. Blood and postmortem bile colchicine concentrations were obtained to better understand the degree of enterohepatic circulation of colchicine.

- **Case report**: A 13-year-old boy presented to the emergency department after acute colchicine poisoning. A single dose of activated charcoal was administered early, but no other doses were attempted. Despite aggressive interventions such as exchange transfusion and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), the patient died 8 days later. Postmortem histology was notable for centrilobular necrosis of the liver and a cardiac septal microinfarct. The patient's blood colchicine concentration on hospital days 1 (approximately 30 hours post-ingestion), 5, and 7 was 12 ng/mL, 11 ng/mL, and 9.5 ng/mL, respectively. A postmortem bile concentration obtained during autopsy was 27 ng/mL.

- **Discussion**: Humans produce approximately 600 mL of bile daily. Assuming that activated charcoal would be able to adsorb 100% of biliary colchicine, using the bile concentration obtained above, only 0.0162 mg of colchicine per day would be able to be adsorbed and eliminated by activated charcoal in this patient.

- **Conclusion**: Despite supportive care, activated charcoal, VA-ECMO, and exchange transfusion, modern medicine may not be enough to prevent death in severely poisoned colchicine patients.

### Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the pro-inflammatory roles of liver-resident Th1-like cells in primary biliary cholangitis [^111fgTqM]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For PBC therapy, about 40% of patients do not show a satisfactory response to UDCA. These patients need additional treatments to reach therapeutic goals and to prevent their PBC from progressing into hepatic fibrosis or even cirrhosis. Because PBC is an autoimmune liver disease, traditional immunomodulatory drugs such as methotrexate, colchicine, and budesonide have been tested to treat "UDCA non-responders". However, several clinical trials failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the usage of those immunosuppressive agents for treating PBC.

By identifying cell-type specific regulators, we found that the JAK/STAT pathway of the liver-resident Th1-like cells was activated in both PBC patients and the 2OA-BSA murine PBC model. JAK inhibitors have been used in the treatment of multiple autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Here, we demonstrated that a two-week administration of the JAK inhibitor baricitinib into the 2OA-BSA cholangitis mouse model resulted in obvious histological remission with lower hepatic cytokine levels and a reduced number of liver-resident Th1-like cells. These data suggest that baricitinib could be applied to repress liver-resident Th1-like cells in future therapies of PBC. Further clinical trials are urgently needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib and other JAK inhibitors to treat UDCA non-responders in PBC patients.

Due to limitations in our sample size, we have made certain assumptions about intriguing findings without experimental validation. These include the correlation between monocyte proportions and TBIL levels.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on sclerosing cholangitis [^116NMsba]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, particularly concerning immunosuppressants, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend considering corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressants for up to three years. This includes agents such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and mycophenolate mofetil, with the possibility of extending this treatment beyond three years. These immunosuppressants should be initiated during prednisone/prednisolone tapering as maintenance treatment of IgG4-related cholangitis to reduce the risk of relapse.

Immunosuppression and other treatments

Despite the presumed immune-mediated disease process in PSC, clinical experience with treating those with active colitis using steroids and other immunosuppressant agents has not demonstrated improvement in PSC disease activity or outcome. Small randomized trials have investigated the role of prednisolone, budesonide, colchicine, penicillamine, azathioprine, ciclosporin, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibodies. There is no evidence that any of these drugs are effective, and therefore, none can be recommended for the treatment of classic PSC. Nevertheless, some of these drugs may have a role in an overlap syndrome since pediatric patients and those with additional features of AIH are more likely to respond to immunosuppressive treatments. A retrospective study in adults suggested a beneficial role of steroids in a subgroup with additional features of AIH. Those with good evidence of PSC and additional features of AIH should be treated similarly to those with classic AIH. The choice of the most appropriate systemic steroid therapy is not clear.

Steroids have been given to the subset of patients with PSC and a raised serum IgG4 (after exclusion of IgG4-SC). In a small study of 18 patients, steroids led to a fall in bilirubin in 9 out of 10 patients with raised bilirubin, and a significant fall in ALP; however, steroid-related side effects and post-steroid relapse were common.

A review of small case series with limited evidence suggests modest improvement in liver biochemistry in patients treated with vancomycin.

More sophisticated risk scores designed to predict prognosis in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) have been developed. Recent approaches to survival analysis have addressed whether simple assessments of biochemical response to treatment, particularly with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), may be clinically useful. There is also a focus on whether variability in such responses may underpin the heterogeneity of earlier treatment and outcome studies.

Stratification by biochemistry has now been widely reproduced across cohorts and is recommended for all patients after one year of UDCA therapy. This stratification aims to identify high-risk patients who are predicted to have reduced survival and may benefit from new disease-modifying therapy trials. In addition to stratification by biochemistry, large-scale studies have confirmed that age at presentation and gender are also important risk stratifiers.

However, it remains unclear which risk/response criteria are optimal for use in clinical practice. The significance of meeting response criteria prior to therapy and its impact on UDCA therapy use is also unclear. Conversely, classifying low risk more effectively may help reduce secondary care follow-up for many patients. To that effect, more dynamic linear risk models have been developed, but further information is needed on how to implement these models clinically.

### Colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis [^116xZVg7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Colchicine has been used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis due to its immunomodulatory and antifibrotic potential. However, therapeutical responses to colchicine in randomized clinical trials have been inconsistent.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of colchicine in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified through electronic searches of The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE (as of September 2003), along with manual searches of bibliographies. Trial authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials comparing colchicine with any control therapy were included, irrespective of language, year of publication, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The primary outcomes were the number of deaths and the number of deaths and/or patients who underwent liver transplantation. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Intervention effects were examined using both fixed effect and random effects models. Heterogeneity was investigated with subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.

- **Main results**: Eleven randomized clinical trials involving 716 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were detected between colchicine and placebo/no intervention on the number of deaths (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.06), or the number of deaths and/or liver transplantations.

### An overview of recent treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^115fdq9U]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic hepatic dysfunction characterized by inflammatory and tissue-degenerative strictures of the biliary tree, leading to cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. The pathophysiological mechanisms involve immune-mediated responses. Numerous treatment modalities targeting the inflammatory aspects have been suggested, but a consensus on the best treatment option is lacking. This study aims to review the most up-to-date treatment options for PSC.

### Update on primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1117hVci]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) remains one of the most challenging conditions in clinical hepatology. There has been a steady growth in research to address this challenge, and the present review aims to summarize the most recently published literature. The main emphasis is on linking recent pathogenetic insights to clinical characteristics and patient management.

With regard to pathogenesis, there is no consensus yet on whether immune-mediated injury or factors related to bile acid physiology are the most important. It also remains unclear whether PSC is a collection of various secondary etiologies yet to be defined, or a disease entity predominantly represented by sclerosing cholangitis in the context of inflammatory bowel disease.

Most importantly, there is no available medical therapy with proven influence on clinical endpoints. The timing of liver transplantation and patient follow-up is challenging due to the unpredictable and high risk of cholangiocarcinoma.

### Pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis and advances in diagnosis and management [^1149imsa]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), first described in the mid-1850s, is a complex liver disease that presents heterogeneously. PSC is characterized by chronic cholestasis, which is associated with chronic inflammation of the biliary epithelium. This inflammation results in multifocal bile duct strictures that can affect the entire biliary tree. Chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis involving the hepatic parenchyma and biliary tree, which can eventually cause cirrhosis and malignancy. Although the etiology of PSC is not fully understood, which contributes to the lack of effective medical therapy for this condition, there has been progress in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of PSC. Recognizing specific clinical subtypes and their patterns of progression may enhance phenotypic and genotypic classification of the disease. This work reviews our understanding of this enigmatic disorder and discusses important topics for future studies.

### Colchicine-associated ring mitosis in liver biopsy and their clinical implications [^114LP6i9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Colchicine is an alkaloid with antimitotic activity used to treat a variety of medical conditions. Colchicine toxicity can result in multiorgan failure and death. In recent years, the histopathologic features of colchicine toxicity in various organs — such as the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, salivary glands, muscle, and skin — have been described. However, the histopathologic manifestations of colchicine in the liver have not been reported previously.

We present the case of a 54-year-old man with transfusion-acquired chronic hepatitis C and longstanding gout managed with colchicine. A liver biopsy performed showed changes consistent with chronic hepatitis C, along with many scattered mitoses arrested in metaphase in the hepatocytes that have been referred to as "ring" mitoses. The liver biopsy was compared with a biopsy from 7 years ago, which appeared similar; however, ring mitoses were absent. Ring mitoses have been associated with colchicine-mediated tissue injury in various other sites, and their presence is believed to represent colchicine-induced liver injury in this case.

### Colchicine: The good, the BAD, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^116BLmAr]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Colchicine has an important role in managing various conditions, including gout, familial Mediterranean fever, amyloidosis, Behçet's syndrome, recurrent pericarditis, and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. The adverse effect profile of colchicine is well understood. However, due to its narrow therapeutic index, colchicine has been associated with overdose and fatalities. When ingested in toxic amounts, the mainstay of management is supportive care.

Strategies to minimize the risk of colchicine poisoning can focus on three broad causes: unauthorized access, intentional overdose, and inappropriate dosing. Culturally safe and appropriate education about storage and the appropriate use of colchicine is essential to minimize the risk of overdose.

### Primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112EsdcY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases encompass a broad spectrum of pathologies, with the core injury occurring at the level of cholangiocytes and progressing to hepatic fibrosis and liver dysfunction. Primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are the most significant progressive cholangiopathies in adults. Although rare, they commonly evolve to liver failure and the need for liver transplantation. Despite recent advances in the basic knowledge of these cholangiopathies, the pathogenesis is still elusive. Targeted treatments to prevent disease progression and preclude malignancy are not yet available. This review addresses the general clinical features of both diseases, analyzes their commonalities and differences, and provides a state-of-the-art overview of the currently available therapeutics.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis - a comprehensive review [^1117aJ9p]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disorder characterized by multi-focal bile duct strictures and progressive liver disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is usually present, and there is a high risk of cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. Most patients ultimately require liver transplantation, after which disease recurrence may occur. With limited therapeutic options and a lack of proven surveillance strategies, patients currently have significant unmet needs.

In the present seminar, we provide a comprehensive review of the status of the field. We emphasize developments related to patient stratification and disease behavior, and provide an overview of management options from a practical, patient-centered perspective. We survey advances made in the understanding of PSC pathogenesis and summarize the ongoing efforts to develop an effective therapy based on these insights.

### Pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis: An attempted network meta-analysis [^113GxxXj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that is associated with both hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancies, which can result in liver cirrhosis and its complications. The optimal pharmacological treatment for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis by performing a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. Given that it was not possible to assess whether potential effect modifiers were similar across comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analysis but instead used standard Cochrane methods. When trials begin to provide an adequate description of potential effect modifiers, we will attempt to conduct a network meta-analysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index - Expanded, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomized controlled trials registers until February 2017 to identify randomized clinical trials (RCT) on pharmacological interventions for primary sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status, in which participants were given a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We excluded trials that included previously liver-transplanted participants. We considered any of various pharmacological interventions compared.

### Recent advances in the management of primary sclerosing cholangitis [^114Rn5eV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by fibroinflammatory damage to the biliary tree, typically in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, with an increased risk of liver failure and cholangiocarcinoma. A complex pathophysiology, heterogeneity in clinical features, and the rare nature of the disease have contributed to the lack of effective therapy at the time of writing. However, recent innovations in the characterization and prognostication of patients with PSC, in addition to new tools for medical management and emerging pharmacologic agents, give rise to the potential for meaningful progress in the next several years. This review summarizes concepts in PSC and highlights particular areas in need of further study.

### Colchicine: The good, the BAD, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^113b16TH]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Management of colchicine poisoning: There are currently no specific or effective treatments for colchicine poisoning, meaning the mainstay is supportive care only. Anyone with a known or suspected colchicine overdose should be admitted for observation for the first 24 hours post-ingestion. If no symptoms or signs have developed within this period, they are unlikely to occur. Activated charcoal or gastric lavage may be useful for individuals who present early after ingestion to prevent further gastrointestinal absorption, but this can be complicated by the presence of vomiting.

Several mechanisms have been tried to remove excess colchicine. Treatment with hemodialysis and plasma exchange is complicated by colchicine's short half-life and ability to bind to tissues. The rationale for plasma exchange is that colchicine is approximately 40–50% protein bound at therapeutic doses. The data are conflicting regarding the benefit, with a case report of plasma exchange revealing removal of only 0.01% of the ingested dose, an amount unlikely to influence clinical outcome, while other reports have suggested potential benefit. Hemodialysis is indicated to support significant renal impairment rather than as a mechanism for the removal of colchicine.

Several animal models have shown that colchicine-specific antigen-binding fragments can reverse the effects of colchicine. Treatment of colchicine poisoning with colchicine-specific fragment antigen-binding (Fab) has been reported. In this case, the colchicine Fab infusion led to a dramatic increase in plasma colchicine concentrations.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^116jptPd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Methodology**: The criteria for considering studies for this meta-analysis were well-defined. The review focused on clinical trials and cohort studies that investigated colchicine administration in COVID-19 patients, comparing it with standard treatment or placebo.

- **Types of studies**: The analysis was restricted to clinical trials and cohort studies examining colchicine administration in COVID-19 patients versus standard treatment or placebo.

- **Types of participants**: Participants were adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. A definite diagnosis was established if the patients were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or high-resolution CT chest with CO-RADS 4 or 5. The study included all healthcare settings, such as community/primary care, hospital outpatient, and long-stay institutional settings.

- **Types of interventions**: Both clinical trials and cohort studies were included. Colchicine was administered to COVID-19 patients in comparison to standard treatment or placebo.

- **Types of outcome measures**: The outcomes considered included mortality, duration of COVID-19 illness until recovery, need for hospitalization, need for O2 therapy, need for ICU admission, and need for artificial ventilation.

- **Inclusion criteria**: The study included cohort studies, and randomized and non-randomized clinical trials conducted on adult human subjects. Participants needed a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis with a positive RT-PCR and/or high-resolution CT chest with CO-RADS 4 or 5. The studies were conducted in all healthcare settings and published in Arabic, English, French, or Spanish.

### Colcrys [^115MKeNt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The mechanism by which Colcrys exerts its beneficial effect in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) has not been fully elucidated. However, evidence suggests that colchicine may interfere with the intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes, which mediates the activation of interleukin-1β. Additionally, colchicine disrupts cytoskeletal functions through inhibition of β-tubulin polymerization into microtubules, consequently preventing the activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils thought to mediate some gout symptoms.

- **Absorption**: In healthy adults, Colcrys is absorbed when given orally, reaching a mean maximum concentration (Cmax) of 2.5 ng/mL (range 1.1 to 4.4 ng/mL) within one to two hours (range 0.5 to 3 hours) following a single dose administered under fasting conditions. Following oral administration of Colcrys as 1.8 mg colchicine over one hour to healthy, young adults under fasting conditions, colchicine appears to be readily absorbed, reaching mean maximum plasma concentrations of 6.2 ng/mL at a median of 1.81 hours (range: 1.0 to 2.5 hours). Following administration of the non-recommended high-dose regimen (4.8 mg over six hours), mean maximal plasma concentrations were 6.8 ng/mL, at a median of 4.47 hours (range: 3.1 to 7.5 hours). After ten days on a regimen of 0.6 mg twice daily, peak concentrations are 3.1 to 3.6 ng/mL (range 1.6 to 6.0 ng/mL), occurring 1.3 to 1.4 hours post-dose (range 0.5 to 3.0 hours). Mean pharmacokinetic parameter values in healthy adults are not shown here.

In some subjects, secondary colchicine peaks are seen.

### Colchicine for primary biliary cirrhosis: A Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^115Gcfv2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Colchicine is used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis due to its immunomodulatory and antifibrotic potential. However, results from randomized clinical trials have been inconsistent. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of colchicine on primary biliary cirrhosis.

- **Methods**: We identified randomized clinical trials comparing colchicine with placebo or no intervention. Effects were analyzed using fixed and random effects models. We investigated heterogeneity through subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: We included 10 trials involving 631 patients, with four considered high-quality trials. No significant differences were detected between colchicine and placebo or no intervention concerning mortality (relative risk (RR) = 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71–2.06), mortality or liver transplantation (RR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.67–1.49), liver complications, liver biochemical variables, liver histology, or adverse events. Regarding mortality, an extreme case analysis favoring colchicine did not demonstrate beneficial effects, whereas an extreme case analysis favoring placebo or no intervention demonstrated a detrimental effect of colchicine (RR = 2.28; 95% CI, 1.17–4.44). The number of patients without improvement of pruritus significantly decreased in the colchicine group (RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65–0.87), although this estimate was based on only 156 patients from three trials.

- **Conclusions**: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. We cannot exclude a risk of adverse effects associated with its use.

### Colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease management [^114rED5G]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Low credibility.

Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory alkaloid, has assumed an important role in managing cardiovascular inflammation approximately 3,500 years after its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt. Primarily used in high doses for treating acute gout flares during the 20th century, research in the early 21st century demonstrated that low-dose colchicine effectively treats acute gout attacks, lowers the risk of recurrent pericarditis, and can contribute to the secondary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events. As the first Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted anti-inflammatory cardiovascular therapy, colchicine currently holds a unique role in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

The safe use of colchicine requires careful monitoring for drug-drug interactions, changes in kidney and liver function, and counseling regarding potential gastrointestinal upset. Future research should further elucidate the mechanisms behind colchicine's anti-inflammatory effects relevant to atherosclerosis, its potential role in primary prevention, its application in other cardiometabolic conditions, its safety in cardiovascular patients, and opportunities for individualizing colchicine therapy using clinical and molecular diagnostics.

### The British Society of Gastroenterology/UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^116sdUEj]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The histopathology of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) classical staging systems divides the histological injury of PBC into four stages: florid duct lesions and portal inflammation without interface activity (stage 1), interface hepatitis, ductular proliferation, and periportal fibrosis (stage 2), bridging necrosis or bridging fibrosis (stage 3), and cirrhosis (stage 4). These systems are easy to apply and are quite reproducible; however, their practical utility is limited due to the uneven distribution of diagnostic histological lesions of PBC and the coexistence of different disease stages at any time.

Furthermore, they incorporate features such as inflammation, which should be regarded as manifestations of disease activity (histological 'grade') rather than disease progression (histological 'stage'). A more recent scoring system described by Nakanuma and colleagues assigns individual scores for fibrosis, bile duct loss, and severity of chronic cholestasis based on copper-associated protein deposition to assess disease stage, and provides a separate system for grading necroinflammatory activity based on cholangitic and hepatitic features. Similar to the classical staging systems, the Nakanuma staging system correlates well with clinical and laboratory features. Subsequent studies have suggested that the Nakanuma system is more useful than previously described staging systems in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with PBC and may also be helpful in predicting treatment responses. Another recently described histological scoring system for PBC is based on prognostically significant features.

### Cholangiography can discriminate sclerosing cholangitis with autoimmune pancreatitis from primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1145DkG3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Sclerosing cholangitis with autoimmune pancreatitis has a cholangiographic appearance similar to that of primary sclerosing cholangitis, but only the former responds well to corticosteroid therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between these two diseases. Cholangiography is the reference standard for diagnosing primary sclerosing cholangitis. The present study compared the characteristic findings for these two types of sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Methods**: Cholangiograms from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 29) and sclerosing cholangitis with autoimmune pancreatitis (n = 26) were studied regarding the length and region of stricture formation, and other characteristic findings.

- **Results**: Band-like stricture, beaded or pruned-tree appearance, and diverticulum-like formation were significantly more frequent in primary sclerosing cholangitis. In contrast, segmental stricture, long stricture with prestenotic dilatation, and stricture of the distal common bile duct were significantly more common in sclerosing cholangitis with autoimmune pancreatitis. Discriminant analysis based on these findings correctly identified 27 of 28 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and 25 of 26 patients with sclerosing cholangitis with autoimmune pancreatitis. It also identified a patient with an incorrect diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis, who proved, upon review of a surgical specimen, to have findings consistent with lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing cholangitis.

- **Conclusions**: Characteristic cholangiographic features allow discrimination.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: A meta-analysis [^116KxRbW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly affected global healthcare and economic systems. It was caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from a flu-like illness to severe pneumonia and death. Until September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide, with deaths surpassing 6 million. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug used in many autoinflammatory conditions, such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behçet's syndrome. It inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins that stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Colchicine decreases the differentiation of myofibroblasts and the release of fibrotic mediators, including transforming growth factor (TGF-β1), which are related to fibrosis. Additionally, colchicine has been used to treat viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Colchicine is considered safe, affordable, and widely available.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to assess the evidence of colchicine's effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted up to May 2022, yielding 814 articles after ranking them according to author and year of publication. Only eight clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further steps of data collection, analysis, and reporting.

- **Results**: This meta-analysis involved 16,488 patients; 8,146 patients were included for further analysis.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: What have we learned and where are we going [^1135WMGN]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

It has proven difficult to establish robust evidence for significant clinical benefits of medical treatment in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). For ursodeoxycholic acid, clinical practice guidelines only offer vague recommendations, leading to a situation of variable prescription rates depending on local reimbursement policies and physician preference.

The difficulty in drug development in PSC is partly related to a poor understanding of critical disease processes with failure to identify relevant mechanisms of action of putative drugs. The variable disease course, both intra-individually and between individuals, and the lack of robust definitions of what success looks like for clinical trials in PSC have also contributed to the negative outcomes of trials performed.

In this review article, we will discuss these uncertainties and challenges, building on key previous and ongoing clinical trials. Despite the lack of consensus for ideal phase II and phase III study designs, several trials for diverse compounds are currently ongoing, indicating a shift from therapeutic nihilism toward hope for people with PSC. While waiting for robust efficacy data for drugs currently being tested, the lack of effective interventions should not motivate the prescription of compounds to people with PSC based on low-quality evidence.

### Immune-related cholangitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors: A systematic review of clinical features and management [^114jmTm1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The terms used for cholangitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are often confused. Large-duct cholangitis has frequently been termed 'sclerosing cholangitis' and 'secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC)'. Small-duct cholangitis has been referred to as 'cholangitis liver disease', 'cholangiopathy', 'biliary injury', among other names. To align with immune-mediated hepatitis (IMH), ICI-related cholangitis is termed 'immune-mediated cholangitis' (IMC) in this review.

Currently, there is limited knowledge regarding the clinical features of IMC induced by ICIs. This study reviewed the published cases of IMC, focusing on biochemical results, pathological characteristics, imaging features, treatment strategies, and outcomes, to provide new insights into the diagnosis and therapy of IMC.

### Liver biopsy in primary biliary cholangitis: Is sinusoidal fibrosis the missing key [^111Fs3SB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

The role of liver biopsy in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is controversial, as is the optimal method of histological assessment. We compared the Ludwig and Ishak systems and three components of the Japanese (Nakanuma) staging system to evaluate their clinical and biochemical correlations and prognostic value.

We reviewed biopsies from 106 patients with PBC, derived from a previous trial of colchicine therapy with 24–34 years' follow-up, following which five clinical outcomes were evaluated: hepatic decompensation, cholestatic PBC death/liver transplant, portal hypertensive PBC death, all PBC deaths, and overall survival.

Ludwig and Ishak stages correlated well with prognostically significant parameters, including serum bilirubin, and both Mayo and Child Scores. Serum aspartate aminotransferase correlated with interface hepatitis (IFH), and alkaline phosphatase with orcein deposition, bile duct (BD) loss, and cholestasis. Ludwig correlated with all five clinical outcomes, while the Ishak stage was only significantly correlated with two. While sinusoidal fibrosis, orcein deposition, BD loss, and cholestasis all predicted hepatic death/transplant, after correction for Mayo Score, the only histological parameters predictive of clinical outcomes were IFH (associated with two) and sinusoidal fibrosis (associated with all five).

Liver biopsy is required in the diagnosis of around 20% of patients with PBC. The Ludwig system is of more prognostic value than both Ishak and any of the three individual components of the Nakanuma staging system.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^116iEyZ6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Of interest, we have shown that both trough and peak colchicine concentrations are higher in individuals receiving a statin. The interaction between colchicine and statins is well-recognized, as both are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Approximately 5% of colchicine is metabolized by CYP3A4 into inactive metabolites, with the majority excreted via the liver and kidneys mediated by P-glycoprotein. Simvastatin and atorvastatin are substrates of the CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein and are thus subject to interactions with colchicine, resulting in increased colchicine concentrations.

In comparison, pravastatin and rosuvastatin are not substrates of CYP enzymes, and hence the concomitant use of CYP inhibitors or inducers, such as colchicine, does not affect them. Our finding that colchicine concentrations are higher in those receiving a statin is therefore not unexpected.

- **Clinical implications**: Of more importance to patients and healthcare providers is whether there are clinically meaningful adverse events associated with the combination of colchicine and a statin. Both colchicine and statins can cause myopathy. There are four statin-associated myopathy clinical phenotypes: rhabdomyolysis, myalgia or mild hyperCKemia (defined as less than five times the upper limit of normal), self-limited toxic statin myopathy, and myositis, which is typically an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with anti–3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase antibodies. The number of participants in our study was too small to undertake reliable analysis of those taking a statin.

### Colchicine: The good, the BAD, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^117PsGAs]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

The clinical uses of colchicine and its dosing require careful consideration to minimize risks. The indications and dosing, both established and emerging, are varied, with particular recommendations for those with renal impairment and individuals receiving medications that interact with colchicine. There is ample data indicating that colchicine is effective in managing gout. It prevents gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy and treats gout flares effectively. It is essential to acknowledge that older dosing regimens for treating gout flares, specifically 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhea occurs, are no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity. Lower doses of colchicine are effective without these adverse gastrointestinal effects.

In rheumatology practice, colchicine is widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, Behçet's syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While it has been traditionally used for acute pericarditis, more recently, its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, such as postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

### Colchicine or methotrexate, with ursodiol, are effective after 20 years in a subset of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^1148L6Ev]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The combination of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), colchicine, and methotrexate (MTX) is an effective therapy for a subset of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who do not respond to UDCA. However, the durability of this response is unclear. We investigated whether the response to the combination therapy was durable.

- **Methods**: We followed, for an additional 10 years (range 9–13 years), 29 patients with PBC who had been treated with the combination of UDCA and MTX or UDCA and colchicine in a randomized controlled trial that began in 1988 and lasted 10 years.

- **Results**: Of the 11 patients given MTX plus UDCA, 9 were still alive and well, whereas 2 died from causes unrelated to liver disease at the ages of 79 and 70. Of the 18 patients given the combination of colchicine and UDCA, 12 were alive and well 20 years after the trial ended. Three had progressive liver disease; 2 of these underwent liver transplantation and 1 died of pneumonia. Three died of unrelated causes at the ages of 73, 76, and 76 years, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with the combination of UDCA and MTX or UDCA and colchicine led to sustained clinical remission in a subset of patients with PBC. The response to the combination of UDCA and MTX appeared to be more durable than to UDCA and colchicine.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^112Qn3jj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The efficacy of colchicine on the duration of COVID-19 illness was assessed in three clinical trials. Lopes et al. found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received colchicine had a shorter duration of illness till recovery compared to patients who received placebo. This finding mirrors the result reported by a recent study, suggesting the anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory roles of colchicine in managing COVID-19. Conversely, two clinical trials reported that colchicine did not affect the illness duration. These findings are in agreement with the results of a recently published study investigating the efficacy of colchicine on the clinical course duration of COVID-19.

- **Efficacy of colchicine on need for hospitalization**: Tardif et al. investigated the efficacy of colchicine among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus placebo. They found that colchicine did not influence the need for hospitalization among these patients. A recent clinical trial assessing the effect of colchicine on the prognosis of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients similarly showed no significant impact on the hospitalization rate.

- **Efficacy of colchicine on need for O2 therapy**: Lopes et al. assessed the efficacy of colchicine on the need for O2 therapy, demonstrating that colchicine use resulted in a significant decrease in the need for O2 therapy among COVID-19 patients.

### Colchicine and the heart [^115bfKew]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Colchicine is a unique, sophisticated anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for decades to prevent acute inflammatory flares in gout and familial Mediterranean fever. In recent years, clinical trials have demonstrated its potential in a range of cardiovascular (CV) conditions. Colchicine is avidly taken up by leucocytes, and its ability to bind to tubulin and interfere with microtubular function affects the expression of cytokines and interleukins. It impacts the capacity of neutrophils to marginate, ingress, aggregate, express superoxide, release neutrophil extracellular traps, and interact with platelets.

In patients with acute and recurrent pericarditis, clinical trials involving more than 1600 patients have consistently shown that colchicine halves the risk of recurrence [relative risk (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42–0.60]. In patients with acute and chronic coronary syndromes, multicenter randomized controlled trials with over 11,000 patients followed for up to 5 years demonstrated that colchicine may reduce the risk of CV death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and ischemia-driven revascularization by more than 30% (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49–0.81).

Use of colchicine at doses of 0.5–1.0 mg daily in CV trials has proved safe. Early gastrointestinal intolerance limits its use in approximately 10% of patients; however, about 90% of patients tolerate it well over the long term. Despite isolated case reports, clinically relevant drug interactions with moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/competitors or P-glycoprotein inhibitors/competitors are rare if this dosage of colchicine is used.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^116xUkZR]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Comorbidities can imply contraindications for drugs usually prescribed for the management of acute flares in gout. Colchicine and NSAIDs should not be used for patients with renal failure, who are usually given intra-articular or systemic steroids instead. Furthermore, with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, steroids can be poorly tolerated, especially when repeated courses are needed in patients with frequent flares. Following the observation that interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a major role in MSU crystal-triggered inflammation, IL-1 blockers have been proposed for the management of flares in patients with difficult-to-treat disease.

Open studies of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra support its off-label use for patients resistant to or with contraindications to NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids. Canakinumab, a long-lasting antibody to IL-1β, has been approved by the European Medical Agency (but not the US Food and Drug Administration) following two RCTs comparing it to intra-muscular triamcinolone acetonide. The EULAR recommends considering IL-1 blockers for the management of gout flares in patients with frequent flares and with contraindications to NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids (oral or injectable). Infection is a contraindication.

According to the EULAR and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations, small doses of colchicine should be used during the first six months of ULD therapy to decrease the risk of ULD flares. Colchicine exposure has been found to be up to two-fold higher in people with mild renal impairment.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^114tiPmV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted global healthcare and economic systems, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia and death. As of September 2022, the cumulative number of cases exceeded 600 million worldwide, with deaths surpassing 6 million. Colchicine is an alkaloid drug used in various autoinflammatory conditions, such as gout, familial Mediterranean fever, and Behçet's syndrome. It inhibits the production of superoxide and the release of interleukins, which stimulate the inflammatory cascade. Additionally, colchicine decreases the differentiation of myofibroblasts and the release of fibrotic mediators, including transforming growth factor (TGF-β1), which are associated with fibrosis. Furthermore, colchicine has been used to treat viral myocarditis caused by CMV or EBV, interstitial pneumonia, and pericarditis resulting from influenza B infection. Colchicine is considered safe, affordable, and widely available.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to assess the evidence of colchicine's effectiveness in COVID-19 treatment.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted up to May 2022, yielding 814 articles ranked according to authors and year of publication. Only 8 clinical trials and cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included for further steps of data collection, analysis, and reporting.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^113HYAiq]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Our objective was to examine the relationship between colchicine plasma concentrations, clinical and demographic factors, and determine the relationship between colchicine concentrations, efficacy, and colchicine‐specific adverse events.

Post hoc analyses were undertaken using data from a 12‐month randomized controlled trial involving 200 people with gout, comparing low‐dose colchicine to placebo for the first six months while starting allopurinol, with a further six‐month follow‐up. Steady‐state colchicine plasma concentrations were measured 30 to 80 minutes post-dose (assumed peak) and just before the dose (trough) at month three. Creatine kinase (CK) levels were measured at months zero, three, and six. Self‐reported gout flares, adverse events, and serious adverse events were collected monthly.

Peak and trough colchicine concentrations were available for 79 participants in the colchicine arm. Multivariable analysis showed those taking a statin and non‐Māori and non‐Pacific ethnicity were independently associated with higher trough concentrations. Age older than 60 years was independently associated with higher peak concentrations. Trough and peak colchicine concentrations were significantly higher in those who had any adverse event between months four and six. However, there was no association between colchicine concentrations and colchicine‐specific adverse events (gastrointestinal and muscle) or with CK changes in the colchicine‐treated patients.

### Usefulness of interleukin-1 receptor antagonists in patients with recurrent pericarditis [^117Uka5S]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine remain the standard of care as the initial treatment of acute pericarditis. Corticosteroids and traditional immunosuppressive medications are often added if patients develop symptoms and remain medically refractory. There has been growing interest in the use of interleukin-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1RAs) in managing pericarditis, especially in medically refractory cases. Anakinra treatment for idiopathic pericarditis is a recent pilot trial showing a benefit of using the IL-1RA, anakinra, in recurrent pericarditis. Publications remain limited, and more outcomes trials are needed. This review focuses on the mechanism of action, clinical utility, current studies, and future investigations involving the role of IL-1RAs in the management of recurrent pericarditis.

### Prevpac [^112khWRa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

There have been post-marketing reports of colchicine toxicity with concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine, especially in the elderly, some of which occurred in patients with renal insufficiency. Deaths have been reported in some such patients (see PRECAUTIONS).

For information about warnings of other drugs that may be used in combination with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to the WARNINGS section of their package inserts.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin and/or amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis [^113KsLob]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholangitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholangitis is a bacterial infection that occurs in the setting of biliary obstruction, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acute cholangitis involves a blockage in the bile ducts, often due to choledocholithiasis or strictures. This blockage allows for the retrograde migration of bacteria from the intestine into the biliary system, leading to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent immune response, which results in inflammation and infection of the bile ducts.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute cholangitis in the US is estimated at 3,000 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute cholangitis often present with the Charcot triad of fever, jaundice, and RUQ pain. In severe cases, patients may also exhibit signs of sepsis, such as hypotension and altered mental status.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary and is influenced by factors such as disease severity, the patient's overall health, and the timeliness and effectiveness of treatment. Certain laboratory values, such as a WBC count > 20,000 cells/mcL and a TBIL level > 10 mg/dL, have been identified as independent prognostic factors for adverse outcomes.
