## Question

Supplement for liver health

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which supplements have evidence for liver health, how to prioritize them, and what to avoid, with explicit reasoning and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the hierarchy of evidence. Then, I should verify which supplements have the strongest and most actionable evidence. Next, I will examine condition-specific nuances such as NAFLD/NASH, cirrhosis, and alcohol-associated liver disease. After that, I need to check safety, monitoring, and drug–supplement interactions. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight what to avoid, making sure I continuously validate claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and evidence hierarchy so I don't jump to conclusions. Liver disease spans NAFLD/NASH, viral hepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease, and cirrhosis, and the cornerstone of management remains lifestyle modification and disease-specific therapy; supplements are adjuncts at best, and many have very low certainty evidence, so I need to anchor recommendations to guidelines and high-quality systematic reviews rather than marketing claims.

> I will now examine vitamin D because deficiency is common in chronic liver disease and bone health is frequently compromised. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: Cochrane reviews show very low certainty for hard outcomes, but guidelines advise checking and repleting if low because of bone-related and potential liver-related benefits; transplant and PBC guidance also support maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D at or above 30 ng/mL with typical doses of 400–1000 IU/day, with monitoring and dose adjustment as needed [^113dajdL] [^113cA4eN] [^111Nf9Ux] [^112c3jft].

> Next, I should review vitamin E for NAFLD/NASH. Hold on, I should verify the scope of benefit: high-quality trials and meta-analyses show vitamin E likely reduces ALT and AST and may improve histology in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH, but long-term clinical outcomes remain uncertain; AACE/AASLD suggests considering vitamin E in non-diabetic MASH, while cautioning against use in diabetes or advanced fibrosis, and pediatric guidance supports vitamin E for biopsy-proven NASH in children with discussion of unknown long-term safety [^115NMDL6] [^115nXuuo] [^114LfrR4] [^1117HT6V].

> Let me consider omega-3 fatty acids next. I should double-check whether benefits extend beyond liver fat reduction. Meta-analyses suggest omega-3s reduce hepatic steatosis and may modestly improve liver enzymes, but clinical outcomes are unproven and some pediatric data are mixed; given favorable cardiovascular effects, they can be considered for NAFLD with metabolic risk, ideally alongside lifestyle therapy, while recognizing the evidence gap for hard endpoints [^114LfrR4] [^116sXJhe] [^114LfrR4].

> I need to check zinc because hypozincemia is common in cirrhosis and can worsen encephalopathy and infection risk. Guidelines recommend zinc supplementation when deficiency is documented or symptomatic, particularly in alcohol-associated liver disease and cirrhosis, with monitoring to avoid oversupplementation; this is a targeted, deficiency-driven strategy rather than routine use [^116J2HmZ] [^117WL8SW] [^1114R5iZ].

> Now, let me review milk thistle (silymarin). Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on popularity. Large randomized trials in chronic hepatitis C and cirrhosis have not shown clinically meaningful benefits on virologic, histologic, or hard outcomes, and systematic reviews conclude no proven benefit on mortality or histology; although generally well tolerated, it should not be recommended as disease-modifying therapy for liver disease outside of research settings [^117LkuoV] [^1173ZuWL].

> I should confirm the stance on broad-spectrum antioxidants. Cochrane reviews indicate no clear benefit of antioxidant cocktails (vitamins A, C, E, selenium, beta-carotene) on mortality or liver-related outcomes, and some signals suggest increased liver enzyme activity; thus, outside of specific indications like vitamin E in non-diabetic NASH, routine antioxidant supplementation is not supported [^111ofyfS] [^115B2MHU].

> Let me think about probiotics and the gut–liver axis. Systematic reviews suggest modest improvements in weight, liver enzymes, and steatosis, but heterogeneity is high and long-term clinical outcomes are unproven; given low risk, probiotics can be considered adjunctively, but I should emphasize that they are not substitutes for weight loss and lifestyle change [^1139QNoE] [^115rtURE].

> I should double-check which supplements to avoid or use with extreme caution. Herbal and dietary supplements account for a substantial proportion of DILI in some registries, with green tea extract, anabolic steroids, and multi-ingredient products frequently implicated; patients should disclose all supplements, and any suspected HDS hepatotoxicity warrants cessation and standard DILI evaluation, with transplant referral for severe injury; "liver cleanse" products are largely unproven and may be harmful, so I need to counsel patients to avoid them [^1173UGce] [^113eGrW7] [^11342vBG] [^1127aA44].

> Next, I should review condition-specific nuances. For NAFLD/NASH, prioritize 7–10% weight loss, then consider vitamin E in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH and omega-3s for steatosis and metabolic risk; for alcohol-associated liver disease, ensure adequate nutrition and replete thiamine, B12, and zinc when deficient; for cirrhosis, screen for and treat malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamin D and zinc; in pediatrics, vitamin E may be used for biopsy-proven NASH, but routine pharmacotherapy or supplements are not recommended otherwise [^115nXuuo] [^117WL8SW] [^1114R5iZ] [^1117HT6V].

> I need to ensure safety and monitoring are explicit. Before starting any supplement, obtain a full inventory of prescription and OTC products, assess for hepatotoxicity risk, and check baseline liver biochemistries when appropriate; monitor for clinical and laboratory signals of injury after changes, and apply causality assessment if liver tests worsen; avoid rechallenge after HDS-DILI unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and alternatives are unavailable [^11342vBG] [^113s1NHW] [^115XC8yR].

> But wait, what about coffee? Observational data consistently associate coffee with improved liver outcomes, but these are not randomized supplement data; I can discuss coffee as a lifestyle choice with potential liver benefits, while avoiding overstatement and recognizing residual confounding [^111dcjZD].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations. First-line is lifestyle therapy for weight, diet, and activity; second-line, correct documented deficiencies: replete vitamin D to at least 30 ng/mL, give zinc if low or symptomatic, and consider vitamin E 800 IU/day for non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH after discussing uncertain long-term safety; omega-3s can be used for NAFLD with metabolic risk, primarily to reduce steatosis and cardiovascular risk; avoid unproven "liver cleanse" products and be vigilant for HDS hepatotoxicity; throughout, monitor liver tests and reassess risk–benefit at regular intervals [^111Nf9Ux] [^115nXuuo] [^115NMDL6] [^11342vBG].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line: no supplement replaces lifestyle and disease-specific therapy; vitamin D repletion is broadly reasonable when low, vitamin E has a narrow, evidence-based role in non-diabetic NASH, omega-3s and zinc can be considered selectively, and many popular supplements lack benefit or carry hepatotoxic risk; shared decision-making and close monitoring are essential to navigate this low-certainty landscape safely [^113cA4eN] [^115NMDL6] [^1173UGce].

Supplements for liver health should be approached with caution, as **most lack robust evidence** and some can cause harm [^111jpcav]. The most consistent, evidence-based options are **vitamin E for non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH** [^115nXuuo] (800 IU/day) [^115NMDL6] and **omega-3 fatty acids** (1–4 g/day) for NAFLD with hypertriglyceridemia, which may reduce liver fat and enzymes but have limited histologic benefit [^113VQj6j]. Vitamin D should be used only to correct deficiency [^117TSnbQ], and **milk thistle is not recommended** due to inconsistent results [^117LkuoV] [^1173ZuWL]. Avoid high-dose vitamin A, niacin, and herbal hepatotoxins (e.g. kava, green tea extract) [^113eGrW7] [^116zzSMN]; always discuss supplements with a clinician and prioritize lifestyle and weight loss [^1114R5iZ].

## Evidence-based supplements for liver health

Key characteristics of vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids:

| **Aspect** | **Vitamin E** | **Omega-3 fatty acids** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical evidence | Vitamin E (800 IU/day) is recommended for non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH [^notfound], improving liver enzymes and histology [^115NMDL6] [^114N8hAK] | Omega-3s (1–4 g/day) may reduce liver fat and improve enzymes in NAFLD with hypertriglyceridemia, but histologic benefit is limited [^113VQj6j] |
| Limitations | Not recommended for patients with diabetes or advanced fibrosis due to potential risks [^115nXuuo] | Mixed results; not a substitute for lifestyle changes [^116sXJhe] |
| Safety | Long-term safety is uncertain; monitor for adverse effects [^115NMDL6] | Generally safe; monitor for gastrointestinal effects and bleeding risk |

---

### Vitamin D

Vitamin D should be supplemented **only to correct deficiency** [^117TSnbQ], which is common in liver disease and associated with worse outcomes [^116We25k]. Evidence for direct liver benefits is limited; therefore, **monitor levels and adjust dosing** to maintain sufficiency [^1114R5iZ].

---

### Milk thistle (silymarin)

Evidence is inconsistent; **no clear benefit** on mortality, histology, or biochemical markers has been demonstrated [^117LkuoV] [^1173ZuWL]. Given the lack of definitive benefit, **routine use is not recommended** [^1173ZuWL].

---

## Supplements with limited or conflicting evidence

| **Supplement** | **Potential benefits** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Probiotics | May improve enzymes, lipids, insulin resistance | - Heterogeneous <br/> - Limited histologic data [^notfound] |
| N-acetylcysteine | Antioxidant; may benefit alcoholic hepatitis | - Limited evidence <br/> - Not routine [^notfound] |
| S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) | Antioxidant; may improve enzymes | - Limited evidence <br/> - Not routine [^notfound] |

---

## Supplements with potential hepatotoxicity

- **High-dose vitamin A**: Linked to hepatotoxicity; avoid in liver disease.
- **Niacin (nicotinic acid)**: High doses can cause liver injury; use cautiously.
- **Herbal hepatotoxins**: Kava, green tea extract, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and others can cause severe liver injury [^113eGrW7] [^116zzSMN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, diet, and exercise are foundational for NAFLD/NASH [^1114R5iZ].
- **Vitamin E**: Consider for non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH [^115nXuuo].
- **Omega-3s**: Consider for NAFLD with hypertriglyceridemia [^notfound].
- **Avoidance**: High-dose vitamins, herbal hepatotoxins, and unproven supplements [^111jpcav].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **Assessment**: Evaluate for deficiencies (vitamin D, zinc, thiamine) and correct them [^1114R5iZ] [^117WL8SW].
- **Monitoring**: Track liver enzymes and clinical status during supplementation.
- **Patient education**: Emphasize lifestyle, weight loss, and risks of unproven supplements [^1114R5iZ] [^1173UGce].
- **Caution**: Avoid high-dose vitamins, herbal hepatotoxins, and unproven products [^114N8hAK] [^1173UGce] [^11342vBG].

---

Supplements can have a limited role in liver health: **vitamin E and omega-3s** may help select patients, but most lack strong evidence and some are harmful. Prioritize lifestyle and weight loss, correct deficiencies, and avoid hepatotoxins; always individualize decisions and monitor for adverse effects.

### Vitamin D supplementation for chronic liver diseases in adults [^115JswHe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is often reported in people with chronic liver diseases. Therefore, improving vitamin D status could have a beneficial effect on people with chronic liver diseases.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation in people with chronic liver diseases.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We also searched databases of ongoing trials and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials. All searches were up to January 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults with chronic liver diseases. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We contacted authors of the trials to ask for missing information. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs), and for continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Trial Sequential Analyses-adjusted CIs. We calculated Peto odds ratio (OR) for rare events. We considered risk of bias in domains to assess the risk of systematic errors. We conducted Trial Sequential Analyses to control the risk of random errors. We assessed the quality of the evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 15 randomised clinical trials with 1034 participants randomised. All trials had a parallel group design. Nine trials were conducted in high-income countries and six trials in middle-income countries. All trials were at high risk of bias. Six trials included participants with chronic hepatitis C, four trials included participants with liver cirrhosis, four trials included participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and one trial included liver transplant recipients. All included trials reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants. Participants in six trials had baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at or above vitamin D adequacy (20 ng/mL), while participants in the remaining nine trials were vitamin D insufficient (less than 20 ng/mL). All trials administered vitamin D orally. Mean duration of vitamin D supplementation was 0.5 years and follow-up was 0.6 years. Eleven trials (831 participants; 40% women; mean age 52 years) tested vitamin D 3, one trial (18 men; mean age 61 years) with three intervention groups tested vitamin D 2 and 25-dihydroxyvitamin D in separate groups, and three trials (185 participants; 55% women; mean age 55 years) tested 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Seven trials used placebo, and eight trials used no intervention in the control group. The effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality at the end of follow-up is uncertain because the results were imprecise (Peto OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.38; I² = 32%; 15 trials; 1034 participants; very low quality evidence). Trial Sequential Analysis on all-cause mortality was performed based on a mortality rate in the control group of 10%, a relative risk reduction of 28% in the experimental intervention group, a type I error of 2.5%, and type II error of 10% (90% power). There was no diversity. The required information size was 6396 participants. The cumulative Z-curve did not cross the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit or harm after the 15th trial, and the Trial Sequential Analyses-adjusted CI was 0.00 to 2534. The effect of vitamin D on liver-related mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.08 to 34.66; 1 trial; 18 participants) and on serious adverse events such as hypercalcaemia (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 100.8; 1 trial; 76 participants), myocardial infarction (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.08 to 6.81; 2 trials; 86 participants), and thyroiditis (RR 0.33 95% CI 0.01 to 7.91; 1 trial; 68 participants) is uncertain because the results were imprecise. The evidence on all these outcomes is of very low quality. The effect of vitamin D 3 on non-serious adverse events such as glossitis (RR 3.70, 95% CI 0.16 to 87.6; 1 trial; 65 participants; very low quality of evidence) is uncertain because the result was imprecise. Due to few data, we did not conduct Trial Sequential Analysis on liver-related mortality, and serious and non-serious adverse events. We found no data on liver-related morbidity and health-related quality of life in the randomised trials included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain as to whether vitamin D supplements in the form of vitamin D 3, vitamin D 2, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or 25-dihydroxyvitamin D have important effect on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, or on serious or non-serious adverse events because the results were imprecise. There is no evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on liver-related morbidity and health-related quality of life. Our conclusions are based on few trials with an insufficient number of participants and on lack of data on clinically important outcomes. In addition, the analysed trials are at high risk of bias with significant intertrial heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence is very low.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is often reported in people with chronic liver diseases. Improving vitamin D status could therefore be beneficial for people with chronic liver diseases.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin D supplementation in adults with chronic liver diseases.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and enquired experts and pharmaceutical companies as to additional trials. All searches were up to November 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration versus placebo or no intervention in adults with chronic liver diseases. Vitamin D could have been administered as supplemental vitamin D (vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol)), or an active form of vitamin D (1α-hydroxyvitamin D (alfacalcidol), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 27 randomised clinical trials with 1979 adult participants. This review update added 12 trials with 945 participants. We assessed all trials as at high risk of bias. All trials had a parallel-group design. Eleven trials were conducted in high-income countries and 16 trials in middle-income countries. Ten trials included participants with chronic hepatitis C, five trials participants with liver cirrhosis, 11 trials participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and one trial liver transplant recipients. All of the included trials reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants. Participants in nine trials had baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at or above vitamin D adequacy (20 ng/mL), whilst participants in the remaining 18 trials were vitamin D insufficient (less than 20 ng/mL). Twenty-four trials administered vitamin D orally, two trials intramuscularly, and one trial intramuscularly and orally. In all 27 trials, the mean duration of vitamin D supplementation was 6 months, and the mean follow-up of participants from randomisation was 7 months. Twenty trials (1592 participants; 44% women; mean age 48 years) tested vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol); three trials (156 participants; 28% women; mean age 54 years) tested vitamin D 2; four trials (291 participants; 60% women; mean age 52 years) tested 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; and one trial (18 participants; 0% women; mean age 52 years) tested 25-hydroxyvitamin D. One trial did not report the form of vitamin D. Twelve trials used a placebo, whilst the other 15 trials used no intervention in the control group. Fourteen trials appeared to be free of vested interest. Eleven trials did not provide any information on clinical trial support or sponsorship. Two trials were funded by industry. We are very uncertain regarding the effect of vitamin D versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.45; 27 trials; 1979 participants). The mean follow-up was 7 months (range 1 to 18 months). We are very uncertain regarding the effect of vitamin D versus placebo or no intervention on liver-related mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.08 to 34.66; 1 trial; 18 participants) (follow-up: 12 months); serious adverse events such as hypercalcaemia (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 100.8; 1 trial; 76 participants); myocardial infarction (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.08 to 6.81; 2 trials; 86 participants); thyroiditis (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.91; 1 trial; 68 participants); circular haemorrhoidal prolapse (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 65.9; 1 trial; 20 participants); bronchopneumonia (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32; 1 trial 20 participants); and non-serious adverse events. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes is very low. We found no data on liver-related morbidity such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, ascites, or liver cancer. There were also no data on health-related quality of life. The evidence is also very uncertain regarding the effect of vitamin D versus placebo or no intervention on rapid, early, and sustained virological response in people with chronic hepatitis C.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the high risk of bias and insufficient power of the included trials and the very low certainty of the available evidence, vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or no intervention may increase or reduce all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, or non-serious adverse events in adults with chronic liver diseases. There is a lack of data on liver-related morbidity and health-related quality of life. Further evidence on clinically important outcomes analysed in this review is needed.

### Antioxidant supplements for liver diseases [^111ofyfS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Several liver diseases have been associated with oxidative stress. Accordingly, antioxidants have been suggested as potential therapeutics for various liver diseases. The evidence supporting these suggestions is equivocal.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antioxidant supplements for patients with liver diseases.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science to January 2011. We scanned bibliographies of relevant publications and asked experts and pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion randomised trials that compared antioxidant supplements (beta-carotene, vitamin A, C, E, and selenium) versus placebo or no intervention for autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis (any aetiology).

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcome measures were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, biochemical indices at maximum follow-up in the individual trials as well as adverse events, quality-of-life measures, and cost-effectiveness. For patients with hepatitis B or C we also considered end of treatment and sustained virological response. We conducted random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twenty randomised trials with 1225 participants were included. The trials assessed beta-carotene (3 trials), vitamin A (2 trials), vitamin C (9 trials), vitamin E (15 trials), and selenium (8 trials). The majority of the trials had high risk of bias and showed heterogeneity. Overall, the assessed antioxidant supplements had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.19, I(2) = 0%), or liver-related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.05, I(2) = 37%). Stratification according to the type of liver disease did not affect noticeably the results. Antioxidant supplements significantly increased activity of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (MD 24.21 IU/l, 95% CI 6.67 to 41.75, I(2) = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to support or refute antioxidant supplements in patients with liver disease. Antioxidant supplements may increase liver enzyme activity.

### Nutritional supplementation for nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease: a network meta-analysis [^116sXJhe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD. Currently no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

- To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis
- To generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included in the review a total of 202 randomised clinical trials (14,200 participants). Nineteen trials were at low risk of bias. A total of 32 different interventions were compared in these trials. A total of 115 trials (7732 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 28 months. The follow-up period in trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 28 months. During this follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. We did not calculate effect estimates for mortality because of sparse data (zero events for at least one of the groups in the trial). None of the trials reported that they measured overall health-related quality of life using a validated scale. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions on serious adverse events (number of people or number of events). We are very uncertain about effects on adverse events of most of the supplements that we investigated, as the evidence is of very low certainty. However, people taking PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) may be more likely to experience an adverse event than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta-analysis results: OR 4.44, 95% CrI 2.40 to 8.48; low-certainty evidence; 4 trials, 203 participants; direct evidence: OR 4.43, 95% CrI 2.43 to 8.42). People who take other supplements (a category that includes nutritional supplements other than vitamins, fatty acids, phospholipids, and antioxidants) had higher numbers of adverse events than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta-analysis: rate ratio 1.73, 95% CrI 1.26 to 2.41; 6 trials, 291 participants; direct evidence: rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.25 to 2.40; low-certainty evidence). Data were sparse (zero events in all groups in the trial) for liver transplantation, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we did not perform formal analysis for these outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of other antioxidants (antioxidants other than vitamins) compared to no active intervention on liver cirrhosis (HR 1.68, 95% CrI 0.23 to 15.10; 1 trial, 99 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions in any of the remaining comparisons, or data were sparse (with zero events in at least one of the groups), precluding formal calculations of effect estimates. Data were probably because of the very short follow-up period (2 months to 28 months). It takes follow-up of 8 to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes are noted in trials providing less than 5 to 10 years of follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of nutritional supplementation compared to no additional intervention on all clinical outcomes for people with non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of patients to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice) comparing interventions such as vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, PUFAs, and no nutritional supplementation. The reason for the choice of interventions is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes, which may translate to clinical benefit. Outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource utilisation measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare utilisation after minimum follow-up of 8 years (to find meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes).

### Herbs and liver injury: a clinical perspective [^112J4JqM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Despite a perception that herbal and dietary supplements are safe, devastating liver injury has been reported to result from their use. The difficulty in characterizing liver injury attributable to herbal and dietary supplements stems from the permissive regulatory environment, the complexity of marketed products, and underreporting by the patients who use them. Despite these limitations, researchers, clinicians, and regulators have increasing awareness of the need for study in this area.

### Antioxidant supplements for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and / or steatohepatitis [^115B2MHU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterised by fatty deposition in the hepatocytes of patients with minimal or no alcohol intake and without other known cause. NAFLD includes a wide spectrum of histologic abnormalities ranging from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or even cirrhosis. Antioxidant supplements, therefore, could potentially protect cellular structures against oxidative stress and the resulting lipid peroxidation.

Objectives

To systematically evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidant supplements versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions for patients with NAFLD or NASH.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (June 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1980 to June 2006), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1978 to June 2006). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials evaluating any antioxidant supplements versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with NAFLD or NASH. Our inclusion criteria for NAFLD or NASH were based on history of minimal or no alcohol intake, imaging techniques showing hepatic steatosis, and/or histological evidence of hepatic damage (including simple steatosis, fatty infiltration plus nonspecific inflammation, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis), and by exclusion of other causes of hepatic steatosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data from the identified trials and contacted authors. We used a random-effects model and fixed-effect model with the significant level set at P = 0.05. We evaluated the methodological quality of the randomised trials by looking at how the generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up were performed. We made our analyses following the intention-to-treat method by imputing missing data.

Main Results

We identified six trials: two were regarded of high methodological quality and four of low methodological quality. None of the trials reported any deaths. Treatment with antioxidant supplements showed a significant, though not clinically relevant, amelioration of aspartate aminotransferase levels, but not of alanine aminotransferase levels, as compared to placebo or other interventions. Gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase was decreased, albeit not significantly, in the treatment arm. Radiological and histological data were too limited to draw any definite conclusions on the effectiveness of these agents. Adverse events were non-specific and of no major clinical relevance.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient data to either support or refute the use of antioxidant supplements for patients with NAFLD. It may be advisable to carry out large prospective randomised clinical trials on this topic.

Statin use and monitoring in liver disease are delineated with specific recommendations. "Predosing liver biochemistries are recommended for all patients initiating statin therapy. However, routine on-treatment monitoring of liver biochemistries is not recommended because of the low risk of hepatotoxicity, including patients with liver disease". Furthermore, "Patients with known compensated chronic liver disease and cirrhosis can and should receive statins as clinically indicated", while in decompensated cirrhosis, "use of statins… should be individualized based on assessment of risk versus benefit".

Chronic liver diseases result in overall deterioration of health status and changes in metabolism. The search for strategies to control and combat these hepatic diseases has witnessed a great boom in the last decades. Nutritional therapy for controlling and managing liver diseases may be a positive influence as it improves the function of the liver. In this review, we focus mainly on describing liver conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and intrahepatic cholestasis as well as using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a dietary supplement and its potential alternative therapeutic effect to correct the hepatic dysfunction associated with these conditions.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113EDQxA]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) epidemiology, regulation, and reporting — American consumers spent more than $9.6 billion on herbal products in 2019, and based on DILIN Registry data, HDS comprise approximately 20% of all cases of liver injury encountered in adults. Regulation in the United States is minimal, with manufacturers not compelled to prove safety and only needing to attest to safety based on historical use; the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act provides the current regulatory framework. Outside the United States, approaches vary; in the European Union, market allowance requires a demonstrated history of safe use with periodic chemical verification of labeled ingredients. Allegations of injury attributable to a dietary supplement can be reported to the US Food and Drug Administration through the MedWatch adverse reporting system, and, when a report's veracity is verified, regulatory actions can include withdrawal of a product from the market.

### Complementary and alternative medicine use in United States adults with liver disease [^117Mrxgs]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Goals

To describe the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in US adults with liver disease.

Background

The prevalence and patterns of CAM use among US adults with liver disease have not been well characterized. The 2012 National Health Interview Survey is considered the most current and comprehensive source of information on CAM use in US adults.

Study

Using the results of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, the prevalence of CAM use, most common modalities used, reasons for CAM use, perceived benefits, perceived helpfulness and importance, and disclosure of CAM to health care providers were compared between adults with and without liver disease.

Results

Of the 647 adults with liver disease, 41% reported using CAM in the prior year, compared with 33% of adults without liver disease. The most common modality was herbs and supplements (23%), and 3% of respondents reported consumption of a potentially hepatotoxic substance in the previous 30 days. Only a small proportion of CAM therapies were used specifically for liver disease, with milk thistle being the most common. Among respondents with liver disease, CAM was used more commonly for anxiety or depression, fatigue, and substance use. The majority believed that these therapies improved health. Nearly one-third of therapies were not reported to health care providers, mostly due to failure of the provider to ask.

Conclusions

CAM use, particularly herbs and supplements, is prevalent among US adults with liver disease. Many do not disclose their CAM use to their providers, despite some using potentially hepatotoxic substances.

### Vitamin D for your patients with chronic hepatitis C? [^1128gYqw]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is increasingly becoming recognized as an important physiological regulator with pleiotropic functions outside of its classical role in skeletal homeostasis. A growing body of clinical evidence highlights the prevalence and risks of vitamin D deficiency in patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C infection, and vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as an adjunct to current standards of care. This review considers the experimental evidence for the anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antiviral effects of vitamin D, and discusses the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation to protect against liver disease progression and improve responses to treatment.

### Liver cleansing imposters: an analysis of popular online liver supplements [^1127aA44]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The liver supplement market is rapidly expanding, yet the efficacy and safety of these products remain largely unsubstantiated. The aim of this study was to analyze the best-selling liver "cleansing" supplements on Amazon, the leading online retailer in the United States.

Methods

We identified the top 20 liver cleanse supplements on Amazon using specific search criteria. Product composition, marketing claims, customer reviews, sales data, and revenue were analyzed. AMZScout was used for sales analytics and FakeSpot for review authenticity assessment. The most common ingredients were identified, and their scientific evidence evaluated through structured PubMed searches with predefined criteria for evidence quality assessment.

Results

The 20 top-selling supplements generated total annual sales of 1,420,584 units with a revenue of $38,783,937. All products claimed to "eliminate toxins" or provide "liver detox/cleanse", whereas 85% claimed to "enhance liver function". The average product rating was 4.4 of 5 stars, with review reliability averaging 73% ± 20%. Milk thistle was the most common ingredient (19/20 products), followed by dandelion and turmeric root (13/20 each). Scientific evidence supporting these ingredients' efficacy in liver health was limited and inconclusive.

Discussion

This study reveals a thriving market for liver supplements, despite limited scientific evidence supporting their efficacy. The prevalence of bold health claims, high consumer satisfaction, and significant sales highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation and regulation of these products. Healthcare providers should be aware of these trends to better counsel patients on evidence-based approaches to liver health.

### Omega-3 supplementation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VQj6j]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a frequent accompaniment of obesity and insulin resistance. With the prevalence approaching 85% in obese populations, new therapeutic approaches to manage NAFLD are warranted. A systematic search of the literature was conducted for studies pertaining to the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on NAFLD in humans. Primary outcome measures were liver fat and liver function tests: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase [1]. Data were pooled and meta-analyses conducted using a random effects model. Nine eligible studies, involving 355 individuals given either omega-3 PUFA or control treatment were included. Beneficial changes in liver fat favoured PUFA treatment (effect size = -0.97, 95% CI: -0.58 to -1.35, p < 0.001). A benefit of PUFA vs. control was also observed for AST (effect size = -0.97, 95% CI: -0.13 to -1.82, p = 0.02). There was a trend towards favouring PUFA treatment on ALT but this was not significant (effect size = -0.56, 95% CI: -1.16 to 0.03, p = 0.06). Sub-analyses of only randomised control trials (RCTs) showed a significant benefit for PUFA vs. control on liver fat (effect size = -0.96, 95% CI: -0.43 to -1.48, p < 0.001), but not for ALT (p = 0.74) or AST (p = 0.28). There was significant heterogeneity between studies. The pooled data suggest that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may decrease liver fat, however, the optimal dose is currently not known. Well designed RCTs which quantify the magnitude of effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on liver fat are needed.

### Liver injury from herbal and dietary supplements [^113eGrW7]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) are used increasingly both in the United States and worldwide, and HDS-induced liver injury in the United States has increased proportionally. Current challenges in the diagnosis and management of HDS-induced liver injury were the focus of a 2-day research symposium sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the National Institutes of Health. HDS-induced liver injury now accounts for 20% of cases of hepatotoxicity in the United States based on research data. The major implicated agents include anabolic steroids, green tea extract, and multi-ingredient nutritional supplements. Anabolic steroids marketed as bodybuilding supplements typically induce a prolonged cholestatic but ultimately self-limiting liver injury that has a distinctive serum biochemical as well as histological phenotype. Green tea extract and many other products, in contrast, tend to cause an acute hepatitis-like injury. Currently, however, the majority of cases of HDS-associated liver injury are due to multi-ingredient nutritional supplements, and the component responsible for the toxicity is usually unknown or can only be suspected. HDS-induced liver injury presents many clinical and research challenges in diagnosis, identification of the responsible constituents, treatment, and prevention. Also important are improvements in regulatory oversight of nonprescription products to guarantee their constituents and ensure purity and safety. The confident identification of injurious ingredients within HDS will require strategic alignments among clinicians, chemists, and toxicologists. The ultimate goal should be to prohibit or more closely regulate potentially injurious ingredients and thus promote public safety. (Hepatology 2017;65:363–373).

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112jtZWp]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

There are currently more than 1000 prescription medications available for use in the United States and more than 100,000 over‐the‐counter herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) available for purchase in retail stores and online. In addition, the average adult American receives more than six prescription medications per year. Many of these drugs and HDS products have been implicated as causes of DILI. Furthermore, DILI is a leading reason for regulatory actions regarding drugs in development as well as those in the marketplace. Confidently establishing a diagnosis of DILI is difficult because of the need to exclude more common competing causes of liver injury, the protean clinical manifestations from an individual agent, and the lack of a validated diagnostic biomarker.–

This guidance was developed with the support and oversight of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines Committee, who chose to commission a guidance, rather than a guideline, because of the paucity of randomized controlled trials on this topic. This document was developed by consensus of an expert panel and provides guidance statements based on formal review and analysis of the literature on the topics and questions related to the needs of patients with drug and supplement–induced liver injury.

The aim of this practice guidance is to provide recommendations regarding the common clinical, laboratory, and histological features seen in patients with DILI based on observational and epidemiological data reported in case series or DILI registries. In addition, expert opinion–based recommendations for patient management, including risk stratification, are provided to assist patients and practitioners.

Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) top takeaway messages on supplements in pre-obesity/obesity state that supplements are substances taken in addition to dietary intake and that no available supplement has prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial evidence to support clinically meaningful and sustained weight loss with health outcomes benefits. The OMA notes that the FDA does not approve supplements, which are considered a food and not a drug, and that supplements are not permitted to be marketed for the purpose of treating, diagnosing, preventing, or curing disease. Safety concerns are highlighted, including severe side effects, hepatotoxicity with weight-loss nutritional supplements, and the potential for adverse supplement-to-drug interactions. It also states that some weight-loss supplements continue to be marketed even when banned by the FDA due to adverse effects, and that patients should be advised of the limited evidence and the lack of oversight by government agencies regarding the claims made about such supplements.

### Effect of atorvastatin, vitamin E and C on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: is the combination required? [^113Nxy1p]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with the metabolic syndrome. The current standard of care, healthy diet and weight loss, has limited effect. The benefits of pharmacological treatments are unclear due to the difficulty of using liver histology as the main outcome in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this issue, an RCT with atorvastatin and antioxidants (vitamins E+C) vs. placebo shows improvement in liver steatosis based on computed tomography scans. The questions are is this beneficial effect due to the combined treatment or the effect of an individual compound; does this intervention improve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Nutritional supplements and alternative medicine [^1114y6VB]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A major health care trend in the last decade has been the increased use of complementary and alternative medicine and nutritional supplements. Indeed, we now have Physician's Desk References for both herbal therapies and dietary supplements. A large amount of out-of-pocket dollars are spent on complementary and alternative medicine each year in the United States, and complementary and alternative medicine users believe strongly in the efficacy of their treatments.

Recent Findings

In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, probiotics appear to be a highly promising form of therapy. In acute pancreatitis, enteral nutrition has been shown to be safe and effective. Peppermint oil is one of the most widely used complementary and alternative medicine therapies for irritable bowel syndrome. Antioxidants are increasingly used in liver disease, especially agents involved in methionine metabolism. Both S-adenosylmethionine and betaine have shown efficacy in animal models of alcoholic liver disease, and "knockout" mice that develop S-adenosylmethionine deficiency also develop steatohepatitis. Thus, there is great interest in these complementary and alternative medicine agents in both alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. There are also important safety issues related to complementary and alternative medicine. Deaths of well-known athletes have highlighted the risks of ephedra, and some research suggests that complementary and alternative medicine agents are a major cause of fulminant liver failure necessitating liver transplantation.

Summary

Thus, physicians must be aware not only of the potential therapeutic benefits of complementary and alternative medicine agents and nutritional supplements, but also their potential risks, including toxicity and drug interactions.

### The hepatoprotective and hypolipidemic effects of spirulina () supplementation in a cretan population with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a prospective pilot study [^113HAxB8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Spirulina is a microscopic and filamentous cyanobacterium with high nutritional value taken as a safe dietary supplement for both humans and animals
Species of Spirulina have exhibited metabolic (hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic), anti-viral, liver-protecting and blood-vessel relaxing effects, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties
Proven effective therapies for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) do not exist. The cornerstone therapy of NAFLD is directed toward weight loss, lifestyle modifications, and comorbidity management

What the new findings are:

Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) supplementation at a high dosage of 6 g daily in NAFLD patients has strong and multiple beneficial metabolic effects and improves their health-related quality of life
Spirulina supplementation could be used as a safe and effective dietary supplement on NAFLD patients

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^1114R5iZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Table 3 key concepts — outcomes and interventions in liver disease emphasize that presence of malnutrition in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is associated with higher risk of mortality (in-hospital, waitlist, and posttransplant), length of stay, complications, and infections compared with patients without malnutrition. Given that sarcopenia is associated with worse patient outcomes before, during, and after liver transplantation, structured programs are needed to assess and treat sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease, especially patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis, should have dietary assessment to ensure adequate nutritional intake. Evidence for supplemental vitamin D in chronic liver disease is limited; however, if vitamin D level is low, supplementation may offer bone-related and liver-related health benefits. Zinc supplementation should be considered for patients with liver disease and hypozincemia and/or signs/symptoms of zinc deficiency. Lifestyle modification with diet and exercise decreases adverse clinical outcomes in patients with MASH and should be encouraged independent of MASH pharmacotherapy. In patients with cirrhosis and evidence of fluid retention (ascites and/or edema), free water restriction may be needed when serum sodium is below 126 mEq/L.

### Milk thistle for the treatment of liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173ZuWL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Milk thistle, an herbal compound, is the dietary supplement taken most frequently by patients with chronic liver disease. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy and safety of this herb for the treatment of liver disease.

Methods

We searched English and non-English reports through July 1999 using thirteen databases and reference lists, and contacting manufacturers and technical experts. Reviewers independently screened all reports to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials that evaluated milk thistle for the treatment of liver disease. Outcomes of primary interest included mortality, histological findings on liver biopsy specimens, serum aminotransferase and albumin levels, and prothrombin times.

Results

Fourteen trials met inclusion criteria. Four trials reported outcomes for mortality among 433 participants. The overall summary odds ratio for mortality in the milk thistle group compared with placebo was 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 1.5; P = 0.6). Three trials assessed histology on liver biopsy; study quality was inversely associated with the likelihood of histological benefit for milk thistle compared with placebo. There were no differences in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or albumin levels, or prothrombin times, among participants assigned to milk thistle compared with those assigned to placebo. The only statistically significant difference was a greater reduction in alanine aminotransferase levels among patients with chronic liver disease assigned to milk thistle (-9 IU/L, 95% CI: -18 to -1 IU/L; P = 0.05), but this reduction was of negligible clinical importance and no longer statistically significant after limiting analyses to studies of longer duration or of higher quality. The frequency of adverse effects was low and, in clinical trials, indistinguishable from placebo.

Conclusion

Treatment with milk thistle appears to be safe and well tolerated. We found no reduction in mortality, in improvements in histology at liver biopsy, or in biochemical markers of liver function among patients with chronic liver disease. Data are too limited to exclude a substantial benefit or harm of milk thistle on mortality, and also to support recommending this herbal compound for the treatment of liver disease.

### Nicotinamide improves aspects of healthspan, but not lifespan, in mice [^112GhPVE]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The role in longevity and healthspan of nicotinamide (NAM), the physiological precursor of NAD +, is elusive. Here, we report that chronic NAM supplementation improves healthspan measures in mice without extending lifespan. Untargeted metabolite profiling of the liver and metabolic flux analysis of liver-derived cells revealed NAM-mediated improvement in glucose homeostasis in mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) that was associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation concomitant with increased glycogen deposition and flux through the pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways. Targeted NAD metabolome analysis in liver revealed depressed expression of NAM salvage in NAM-treated mice, an effect counteracted by higher expression of de novo NAD biosynthetic enzymes. Although neither hepatic NAD + nor NADP + was boosted by NAM, acetylation of some SIRT1 targets was enhanced by NAM supplementation in a diet- and NAM dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our results show health improvement in NAM-supplemented HFD-fed mice in the absence of survival effects.

### Effect of saffron supplementation on liver enzymes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112U4qAM]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Possible protective effects of saffron (Crocus sativus L) have been reported in several randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Current systematic review was performed to summarize the efficacy of saffron intake on liver enzymes.

Methods

An electronic database search was conducted on PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane for RCTs comparing effect of saffron and placebo on liver enzymes from inception to July 2021. There was no restriction in language of included studies and we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for each variable. Random-effect model was used to calculate effect size.

Results

Eight studies (n = 463 participants) were included in the systematic review. The saffron intake was associated with a statistically significant decrease in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SMD: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.34, -0.02; I² = 0%) in comparison to placebo intake. Our results also indicated that saffron consumption did not have a significant effect on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SMD: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.36, 0.09; I² = 47.0%) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (SMD: 0.14; 95% CI: -0.18, 0.46; I² = 42.9%) compared to placebo.

Conclusions

Saffron intake showed beneficial impacts on circulating AST levels. However, larger well-designed RCTs are still needed to clarify the effect of saffron intake on these and other liver enzymes.

Causality assessment provides an organized approach to determining the likelihood that a given drug or HDS is the cause of liver injury by reviewing the timing, laboratory, and clinical features following exposure and exclusion of other more common causes of liver injury. A scoring system is then applied to the component data fields, and a summary causality score is generated that typically ranges from definite (highly probable) to excluded (unlikely).

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^117N1c77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin E improves the biochemistry and histology features of NAFLD; however, the mechanistic aspects that lie behind this remain elusive. One study reported that vitamin E decreased intrahepatic triglycerides by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis through its antioxidant activity, and other studies demonstrated that vitamin E attenuated NAFLD via multiple other mechanisms, including protecting cellular structures against damage from oxygen‐free radicals; upregulation of superoxide dismutase activity; and downregulation of isoprostanes (an index of lipid peroxidation), malondialdehyde and genes related to inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and leptin and adiponectin expression. The results of these studies reflect the potential beneficial effects of vitamin E on inhibition of NAFLD progression.

Why it is important to do this review

The increased prevalence of NAFLD has become one of the most important global public health issues. Oxidative stress is one of the key factors in the onset and development of NAFLD. Therefore, antioxidant therapy could possibly be beneficial in the management of NAFLD. Vitamin E may improve liver function and histological changes in people with NAFLD.

A review addressing the effects of antioxidant supplements on people with NAFLD or NASH was published in 2007, and it has not been updated since. That review concluded that antioxidant supplements other than vitamin E exerted a beneficial effect on the activity of alanine aminotransferase and on steatosis, but meta‐analyses published in 2015 and 2019 reported that vitamin E had a beneficial effect on NAFLD. In addition, given the enormous amount of research being published on the topic of antioxidants, we decided to prepare a new review focusing on vitamin E in people with NAFLD. We use the updated Cochrane methodology during our review production, starting with its protocol.

### Acute liver failure induced by green tea extracts: case report and review of the literature [^116zzSMN]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

In industrialized countries, over-the-counter dietary supplements have become popular in preventing and treating an expanding list of medical conditions. Although most commercially available supplements have not been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy, they have found an enlarging market because they are considered natural. Oral supplements containing green tea extract have been marketed as effective for weight loss and to prevent and cure some solid tumors. Although there is little scientific evidence of the effectiveness of green tea extracts to improve the quality of health of regular consumers, there is an increasing body of medical literature supporting the hypothesis that they can cause serious side effects. Our experience adds to previous reports of acute liver toxicity observed in individuals consuming supplements containing green tea extract. We highlight the importance of obtaining a detailed history of dietary supplement consumption when evaluating a patient presenting with acute liver dysfunction.

### Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta-analyses of multiple health outcomes [^111dcjZD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and recommendations

Coffee consumption has been investigated for associations with a diverse range of health outcomes. This umbrella review has systematically assimilated this vast amount of existing evidence where it has been published in a meta-analysis. Most of this evidence comes from observational research that provides only low or very low quality evidence. Beneficial associations between coffee consumption and liver outcomes (fibrosis, cirrhosis, chronic liver disease, and liver cancer) have relatively large and consistent effect sizes compared with other outcomes. Consumption is also beneficially associated with a range of other health outcomes and importantly does not seem to have definitive harmful associations with any outcomes outside of pregnancy. The association between consumption and risk of fracture in women remains uncertain but warrants further investigation. Residual confounding could explain some of the observed associations, and Mendelian randomisation studies could be applied to a range of outcomes, including risk of fracture, to help examine this issue. Randomised controlled trials that change long term behaviour, and with valid proxies of outcomes important to patients, could offer more definitive conclusions and could be especially useful in relation to coffee consumption and chronic liver disease. Reassuringly, our analysis indicates that future randomised controlled trials in which the intervention is increasing coffee consumption, within usual levels of intake, possibly optimised at three to four cups a day, would be unlikely to result in significant harm to participants. Pregnancy, or risk of pregnancy, and women with higher a risk of fracture, however, would be justified exclusion criteria for participation in a coffee treatment study.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115NMDL6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance are the basic management of NAFLD, but these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of vitamin E for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals, versus placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD.

Search Methods

We used recommended Cochrane search methods. The latest search was performed on 2 February 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention, in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. We included participants with imaging techniques or histology-proven NAFLD and minimal alcohol intake, and participants with steatohepatitis who had liver biopsies.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, non-serious adverse events, biochemical response, and imaging assessment of the degree of fatty liver.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane's RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each of the predefined outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 16 randomised clinical trials involving 1066 paediatric and adult participants with NAFLD. Experimental groups received vitamin E alone (14 trials) or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C (2 trials). Control groups received placebo in 13 trials and no intervention in three trials. Daily dosages of oral vitamin E ranged from 298 international units (IU) to 1000 IU. Co-interventions were lifestyle and low-calorie diet interventions in 13 trials, ursodeoxycholic acid in one trial, unchanged diet and physical activity in one trial, and baseline treatments for type 2 diabetes in one trial. Nine trials had more than two intervention groups, but we used only the groups in which vitamin E alone or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C were compared with placebo or no intervention. In total, 7.9% (84/1066) of participants dropped out. Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 24 months.

Synthesis Of Results

Vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 20.86; 3 trials, 351 participants; very low certainty evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 12.01; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. There were no data on liver-related mortality or liver-related morbidity. The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on physical health-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.74, 95% CI -0.52 to 2.01; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); psychosocial health-related quality of life (MD -0.57, 95% CI -4.11 to 2.97; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); and non-serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are also very uncertain. There were no data on proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD -9.29, 95% CI -13.69 to -4.89; 11 trials, 708 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD -4.90, 95% CI -7.24 to -2.57; 11 trials, 695 participants; moderate certainty evidence) levels compared with placebo or no intervention. Vitamin E may slightly reduce serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (MD -5.21, 95% CI -9.88 to -0.54; 5 trials, 416 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo There were no data on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on reducing serum ALT (MD -0.50, 95% CI -4.58 to 3.58; 2 trials, 133 participants; very low certainty evidence), AST (MD 0.09, 95% CI -3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI -3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. We identified three ongoing trials, and six trials are awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know if long-term treatment (18 months to 24 months) with vitamin E administered alone affects all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, or non-serious adverse events in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo or no intervention. We found no data on liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely reduces ALT and AST slightly when compared with placebo, but whether this has any impact on the clinical course in people with NAFLD is unknown. The trials on vitamin E plus vitamin C did not report on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, or non-serious adverse events. Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on liver enzymes in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo.

Funding

Three trials disclosed no external funding. Five trials were industry funded. Five trials were funded by organisations with no vested interests. Three trials did not provide any information on clinical trial support or sponsorship.

### Dietary betaine supplementation increases fgf21 levels to improve glucose homeostasis and reduce hepatic lipid accumulation in mice [^113Mfxhj]. Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Identifying markers of human insulin resistance may permit development of new approaches for treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes. To this end, we analyzed the fasting plasma metabolome in metabolically characterized human volunteers across a spectrum of insulin resistance. We demonstrate that plasma betaine levels are reduced in insulin-resistant humans and correlate closely with insulin sensitivity. Moreover, betaine administration to mice with diet-induced obesity prevents the development of impaired glucose homeostasis, reduces hepatic lipid accumulation, increases white adipose oxidative capacity, and enhances whole-body energy expenditure. In parallel with these beneficial metabolic effects, betaine supplementation robustly increased hepatic and circulating fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)21 levels. Betaine administration failed to improve glucose homeostasis and liver fat content in Fgf21(-/-) mice, demonstrating that Fgf21 is necessary for betaine's beneficial effects. Together, these data indicate that dietary betaine increases Fgf21 levels to improve metabolic health in mice and suggest that betaine supplementation merits further investigation as a supplement for treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes in humans.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^11266B2K]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Chronic liver disease — enteral nutrition (EN) formulas and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA): Patients with chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis or end-stage disease, have high malnutrition risk estimated to affect more than half of patients with cirrhosis. ESPEN has favored BCAA-enriched formulas for hepatic encephalopathy based on two randomized trials reporting improved health-related outcomes, but updated ASPEN guidelines noted no advantage of BCAA-enriched formulas when first-line therapy with antibiotics or lactulose was given. A Cochrane review reported beneficial effects of BCAA on hepatic encephalopathy in 16 trials with 827 participants yet found no effect on mortality, quality of life, or nutrition status, and the optimal EN formula for chronic liver disease remains controversial.

### Nutritional interventions for liver-transplanted patients [^114QzdjZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Malnutrition is a common problem for patients waiting for orthotopic liver transplantation and a risk factor for post-transplant morbidity. The decision to initiate enteral or parenteral nutrition, to which patients and at which time, is still debated. The effects of nutritional supplements given before or after liver transplantation, or both, still remains unclear.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of enteral and parenteral nutrition as well as oral nutritional supplements administered to patients before and after liver transplantation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (March 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2 of 12, 2012) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2012), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2012), Science Citation Index Expanded (January 1900 to March 2012), Social Science Citation Index (January 1961 to October 2010), and reference lists of articles. Manufacturers and experts in the field have also been contacted and relevant journals and conference proceedings were handsearched (from 1997 to October 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials of parallel or cross-over design evaluating the beneficial or harmful effects of enteral or parenteral nutrition or oral nutritional supplements for patients before and after liver transplantation were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the trials and extracted data. Dichotomous data were reported as odds ratios (OR) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity of included interventions.

Main Results

Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Four publications did not report outcomes pre-defined in the review protocol, or other clinically relevant outcomes and additional data could not be obtained. Nine trials could provide data for the review. Most of the 13 included trials were small and at high risk of bias. Meta-analyses were not possible due to clinical heterogeneity of the interventions. No interventions that were likely to be beneficial were identified. For interventions of unknown effectiveness, postoperative enteral nutrition compared with postoperative parenteral nutrition seemed to have no beneficial or harmful effects on clinical outcomes. Parenteral nutrition containing protein, fat, carbohydrates, and branched-chain amino acids with or without alanyl-glutamine seemed to have no beneficial effect on the outcomes of one and three years survival when compared with a solution of 5% dextrose and normal saline. Enteral immunonutrition with Supportan® seemed to have no effect on occurrence of immunological rejection when compared with enteral nutrition with Fresubin®. There is weak evidence that, compared with standard dietary advice, adding a nutritional supplement to usual diet for patients during the waiting time for liver transplantation had an effect on clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. The combination of enteral nutrition plus parenteral nutrition plus glutamine-dipeptide seemed to be beneficial in reducing length of hospital stay after liver transplantation compared with standard parenteral nutrition (mean difference (MD) -12.20 days; 95% CI -20.20 to -4.00). There is weak evidence that the use of parenteral nutrition plus branched-chain amino acids had an effect on clinical outcomes compared with standard parenteral nutrition, but each was beneficial in reducing length of stay in intensive care unit compared to a standard glucose solution (MD -2.40; 95% CI -4.29 to -0.51 and MD -2.20 days; 95% CI -3.79 to -0.61). There is weak evidence that adding omega-3 fish oil to parenteral nutrition reduced the length of hospital stay after liver transplantation (mean difference -7.1 days; 95% CI -13.02 to -1.18) and the length of stay in intensive care unit after liver transplantation (MD -1.9 days; 95% CI -1.9 to -0.22). For interventions unlikely to be beneficial, there is a significant increased risk in acute rejections in malnourished patients with a history of encephalopathy and treated with the nutritional supplement Ensure® compared with usual diet only (MD 0.70 events per patient; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.32).

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to identify nutritional interventions for liver transplanted patients that seemed to offer convincing benefits. Further randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and powerful sample sizes are needed.

### Do dietary supplements have beneficial health effects in industrialized nations: what is the evidence? [^112hW5EH]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary supplements are regularly used by at least half of the American population, yet the health benefits of these agents are unclear.

Objective

A systematic review to determine the benefits and risks of dietary supplements in Westernized societies.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and citation review of relevant articles.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-pregnant Westernized adults that evaluated clinical outcomes of nutritional supplements.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, dietary intervention and clinical outcomes. The outcome of each study was classified as non-beneficial, beneficial or harmful according to whether the end-point(s) of interest reached statistical significance.

Data Synthesis

Sixty-three studies met the criteria for our systematic review. No benefit was recorded in 45 studies, with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and with two showing a trend towards benefit. Four studies reported harm with increased cancer deaths (n = 2) and increased fractures (n = 2). Two studies reported both a harmful as well as a beneficial outcome. A beneficial outcome was reported in 12 studies; 6 which studied vitamin D and three which investigated omega-3 fatty acids. While a benefit was reported in one study each which investigated Vitamin E, folic acid and Ginkgo biloba this benefit was not confirmed by larger and more adequately powered studies.

Conclusions

With the possible exceptions of Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids there is no data to support the widespread use of dietary supplements in Westernized populations; indeed, many of these supplements may be harmful.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^11592sSr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Synthesis of results

Vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention

The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on all‐cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 20.86; 3 trials, 351 participants; very low certainty evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 12.01; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. There were no data on liver‐related mortality or liver‐related morbidity. The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on physical health‐related quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.74, 95% CI −0.52 to 2.01; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); psychosocial health‐related quality of life (MD −0.57, 95% CI −4.11 to 2.97; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); and non‐serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are also very uncertain. There were no data on proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD −9.29, 95% CI −13.69 to −4.89; 11 trials, 708 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD −4.90, 95% CI −7.24 to −2.57; 11 trials, 695 participants; moderate certainty evidence) levels compared with placebo or no intervention. Vitamin E may slightly reduce serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (MD −5.21, 95% CI −9.88 to −0.54; 5 trials, 416 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain.

Vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo

There were no data on all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, and non‐serious adverse events. The effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on reducing serum ALT (MD −0.50, 95% CI −4.58 to 3.58; 2 trials, 133 participants; very low certainty evidence), AST (MD 0.09, 95% CI −3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence), and gamma‐glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI −3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain.

We identified three ongoing trials, and six trials are awaiting classification.

Authors' conclusions

Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know if long‐term treatment (18 months to 24 months) with vitamin E administered alone affects all‐cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, or non‐serious adverse events in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo or no intervention. We found no data on liver‐related mortality, liver‐related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely reduces ALT and AST slightly when compared with placebo, but whether this has any impact on the clinical course in people with NAFLD is unknown.

The trials on vitamin E plus vitamin C did not report on all‐cause mortality, liver‐related mortality, serious adverse events, liver‐related morbidity, health‐related quality of life, or non‐serious adverse events. Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on liver enzymes in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^115rgPFq]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Methotrexate — risk factors and monitoring guidance — states that long-term therapy can lead to hepatic steatosis and fibrosis and lists risk factors; the 2008 American College of Rheumatology advises baseline testing and then every 2–4 weeks within the first 3 months, every 8–12 weeks for 3–6 months, and every 12 weeks beyond 6 months. Updated 2021 guidance restricts use in suspected NAFLD to those with normal liver tests only because serious hepatic fibrosis (stage ≥ 3) is usually detected noninvasively. For psoriasis, the 2020 Academy of Dermatology guidelines recommend fibrosis-4 serologic testing and transient elastography at baseline and annually in patients with hepatotoxicity risk factors; laboratory monitoring is recommended at baseline and every 3–6 months, with liver biopsy reserved for abnormal transient elastography or persistent liver test elevations. After 3.5–4.0 g cumulative dose exposure, transient elastography and or liver biopsy are recommended for all recipients.

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^111Nf9Ux]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Post-transplant bone health management recommends minimizing corticosteroid exposure and ensuring calcium and vitamin D repletion, with monitoring and selective bisphosphonate use. In order to diminish factors that promote bone loss, glucocorticoids should be reduced or discontinued as soon as possible after LT. Calcium supplements are recommended for all LT recipients with (or at risk of) osteopenia, and all patients should receive 1000 to 1200 mg of elemental calcium daily. Vitamin D levels should be maintained at a serum level of at least 30 ng/mL, with supplementation generally 400–1000 IU/day, and the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D must be checked and should be rechecked annually or more frequently if a deficiency is diagnosed. Despite these caveats, we suggest that bisphosphonate therapy should be considered in the following circumstances: T-score less than -2.5 or atraumatic fractures; and T-score between -1.5 and -2.5 and other risk factors.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112c3jft]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis — bone health, screening, and supplementation: Baseline and regular screening every 2 years using bone mineral density testing is appropriate, and daily calcium (1,500 mg/day) and vitamin D supplements (1,000 International Units/day) may be advisable if there is no history of renal stones; vitamin D levels should be measured annually in patients with advanced disease. In osteoporosis, alendronate was shown in a randomized controlled trial to significantly improve bone density compared with placebo, whereas etidronate was ineffective and monthly ibandronate was found comparable to weekly alendronate in safety and efficiency; hormone replacement therapy has led to some improvement but is seldom used because of safety concerns. Patients with PBC should be provided 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium and 1,000 International Units of vitamin D daily in the diet and as supplements if needed.

### Gut microbiota manipulation with prebiotics in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomized controlled trial protocol [^115Hixnm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The planned double blind, randomized clinical trial will determine whether adding prebiotic to a 6-month weight loss intervention will augment improvements in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis attributed to weight loss alone in the placebo group receiving an identical weight loss intervention but without supplementation. The exploration into the mechanisms of action is critically important in advancing treatment options for NAFLD and this study will specifically address de novo lipogenesis and metagenomic analysis of gut microbiota and their associated metabolic by-products (i.e. VOCs). Ultimately this clinical trial will advance our understanding of the magnitude to which NAFLD can be treated with a dietary intervention aimed at modulating the gut microbiota.

The proposed study design using daily packets to be consumed with water prior to a meal is feasible as indicated by our previous research and is similar to soluble fiber supplements already on the market. More promising, however, is the versatility of prebiotics. Foods supplemented with prebiotics are already in production because the physical properties and sweet taste allows manufactures to decrease the caloric value while maintaining the palatability and texture of the food. This ease of incorporation is important given the surge in interest in manipulation of the gut microbiota to prevent or treat conditions such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease. While other options including fecal transplantation and antimicrobial-based interventions are being tested as viable means to manipulate the gut microbiota, targeted dietary interventions such as prebiotics or probiotics are easy to administer and for the most part have good safety and tolerance records. While both prebiotics and probiotics are promising means to manipulate the gut microbiota, unlike prebiotics, probiotics must remain viable during storage and also be capable of surviving the harsh intestinal environment of the host in order to exert their beneficial effects. Additionally, given the well-established health promoting properties of prebiotics and their tolerability, they could be used not only as a treatment but also as a prophylactic.

This trial will assess the ability of a prebiotic to improve overall health in a group at high-risk for a host of metabolic diseases. Improvement in liver health is expected, as are improvements in other predictors of the metabolic syndrome. Ultimately, the research will provide clinical evidence for a potential low-risk treatment option for NAFLD patients. Should the prebiotic intervention prove beneficial, it could have a significant impact on the ability of health professionals to recommend evidence-based targeted dietary interventions for managing NAFLD.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^112TDFN1]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome since obesity and insulin resistance are the main pathogenic contributors for both conditions. NAFLD carries increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. There is an urgent need to find effective and safe therapy for children and adults with NAFLD. Data from research and clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in metabolic syndrome-related conditions and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Methods/Design

We are conducting a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in children with NAFLD. Patients are randomized to receive either omega-3 fatty acids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or placebo for 24 weeks. The dose of omega-3 (DHA+ EPA) ranges from 450 to 1300 mg daily. Low calorie diet and increased physical activity are advised and monitored using validated questionnaires. The primary outcome of the trial is the number of patients who decreased ALT activity by ≥ 0,3 of upper limit of normal. The main secondary outcomes are improvement in the laboratory liver tests, liver steatosis on ultrasound, markers of insulin resistance and difference in fat/lean body mass composition after 6 months of intervention.

Discussion

Herbals and dietary supplements — "Liver injury associated with the consumption of herbal medicines and dietary supplements is often referred to as "herb-induced liver injury" (HILI)". Use is common and often without proven benefit ("Herbals and dietary supplements are used world-wide, often without any proven health benefits".), and in the United States these products are "regulated as food products and not subjected to the same premarket requirements for safety or efficacy when compared to traditional pharmaceutical agents". Diagnosis is challenging because "many of the products contain multiple ingredients". Agents "implicated with PALF include Kava, willow bark tea, Atractylis gummifera, green tea, Teucrium polium, pennyroyal oil, Chaparral, Impila, and other Pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and weight loss supplements predominantly in adult patients".

### Nutrition and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current perspectives [^116fBZxu]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are diseases in their own right as well as modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. With expanding knowledge on NAFLD pathogenesis, insights have been gleaned into molecular targets for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Lifestyle modifications constitute a cornerstone of NAFLD management. This article reviews roles of key dietary macronutrients and micronutrients in NAFLD pathogenesis and their effects on molecular targets shared with established or emerging pharmacotherapies. Based on current evidence, a recommendation for a dietary framework as part of the comprehensive management strategy for NAFLD is provided.

### Evidence for clinical interventions targeting the gut microbiome in cardiometabolic disease [^1175b4HL]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Box 2
Survey of gut microbiome targeted interventions for tackling cardiometabolic risk*

The proportion of studies reporting a significant improvement in clinical outcomes did not differ among the various types of cardiometabolic areas investigated (obesity, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, liver disease and so on) (fig 2). However, studies of probiotic interventions (both single and multiple strain formulations) were significantly less likely to report significant changes to the gut microbiome than studies using either dietary or prebiotic interventions (fig 2). A key limitation of probiotic based interventions already highlightedis the tendency for bacteria in the probiotic formulation to fail to form bacterial colonies in the gut of the host. This is confirmed by the interventional studies we analyse here.

It is therefore likely that the beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation on various cardiometabolic disease traits may be, at least in part, mediated by their "postbiotic" effects. Postbiotics are substances or components of the microbial cells (such as parts of their membranes) that provide a direct benefit to the host. In support of this possibility, it has been shown that pasteurised probiotic preparations (with microbial cell components but not with live microbes) improve cardiometabolic disease outcomes.

Paradoxically, the dietary interventions category shows the largest proportion of studies that resulted in both changes in gut microbiome composition and in cardiometabolic disease improvements. Microbial strains, such as probiotics, or specific fibres which fulfil the definition of "prebiotics" seem to be less effective. This points to gaps in our understanding as to what truly drives beneficial changes in gut microbiome composition that result in cardiometabolic health benefits.

### Vitamin D status in gastrointestinal and liver disease [^114HyB1U]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to report on the vitamin D status and its relationship with bone health in individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disorders. In addition, recommendations regarding replacement and maintenance of optimal vitamin D stores, as well as the state of knowledge regarding its effect on the disease through its actions on the immune system, will be reviewed.

Recent Findings

The scientific community has revised upward the serum levels of vitamin D considered optimal, and doses of vitamin D much larger than those currently recommended may be needed to maintain these levels, especially in individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disorders. The relationship between vitamin D and bone health in this population is controversial. The role of vitamin D in the regulation of the immune system continues to be elucidated.

Summary

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among individuals with gastrointestinal and liver disease. Although replacement and supplementation guidelines have not been well defined, practitioners should aim for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 32 ng/ml. The contribution of vitamin D to the bone health of these individuals and its role in altering disease course through its actions on the immune system remain to be elucidated.

### Liver ACOX1 regulates levels of circulating lipids that promote metabolic health through adipose remodeling [^111rYGDE]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Although prenatal global knockout of Acox1 in the 129/Sv mouse strain leads to severe abnormalities, including growth retardation, hepatic steatosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, our work shows that mice with liver-specific knockout of Acox1 on the C57BL/6 J genetic background are healthy with normal liver function. The phenotypic difference between our model and the global knockout mice might reflect differences in genetic backgrounds, since 129/Sv mice are known for having increased susceptibility for developing cancer. It also possible that extrahepatic deletion of Acox1 in the global knockout mouse model contributes to liver disease. However, our results indicate that systemic inhibition of ACOX1 activity in mice using a pharmacological inhibitor does not lead to abnormalities and instead improves metabolic health. Thus, ACOX1 is a potentially druggable target.

In summary, this work identifies hepatic peroxisomal β-oxidation as an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis that limits circulating levels of endogenously produced ω-3 VLCFAs that influence the energy expenditure and metabolic functions of adipose tissue through activation of GPR120 signaling. Dietary supplementation of these beneficial lipids or inhibition of ACOX1 enzyme activity has the potential to be an effective strategy for treating obesity-associated metabolic disorders.

### International expert consensus on micronutrient supplement use during the early life course [^116yuTd9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Choline

Choline supplement use in pregnancy and lactation did not achieve consensus among the panellists. Choline contributes to normal liver function and lipid metabolism in adults. The requirements for choline are greater during pregnancy and lactation than outside these critical time periods, due to the need to meet the needs of both the mother and foetus or breastfed infant at the same time. Choline is actively transported through the placenta and accumulates in the foetus. Choline supplement use by the mother leads to higher choline levels in breast milk and consequently increased choline intake for breastfed infants. The EFSA has recently evaluated the evidence on the role of maternal choline intake in health outcomes in the foetus and infants, and concluded that a sufficient intake of choline during pregnancy and lactation (480 mg/day and 520 mg/day, respectively) can contribute to normal liver function of the foetus and exclusively breastfed infants.

A recent meta-analysis of observational studies reported that low maternal choline intake or blood levels are associated with a higher risk of NTDs in newborns. Higher choline intake is likely to have positive impacts on foetal brain development and neurodevelopment of the child after birth. The growing evidence on the role of choline during pregnancy and lactation is still awaiting translation into population-wide recommendations and policy. This could explain why the panellists did not prioritise choline supplement use for pregnant and lactating people in this Delphi study.

Other examined micronutrients: Vitamin K

Consensus among panellists was that the evidence for vitamin K supplement use was weak. This reflects the current lack of evidence, with most pregnancy and neonatal outcomes unassessed, not significant or providing very low-quality evidence, and few trials reporting neonatal adverse effects. A study of women admitted for elective caesarean section found that vitamin K supplement use was favourable for maternal bleeding but was of limited value for neonatal bleeding and other outcomes. The existing literature gaps warrant future investigations on un-assessed or inadequately reported outcomes.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in children with obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) and expert joint perspective 2025 [^1174zf5x]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Nutritional deficiencies — key nutrient relationships to MASLD include that vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased MASLD risk and promotes hepatic steatosis; vitamin E, an antioxidant, has been shown in some studies to reduce oxidative stress, improve liver function and decrease inflammation in MASLD patients, though evidence remains mixed; selenium protects against cellular damage, with supplementation potentially slowing MASLD progression; essential fatty acids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, support lipid metabolism and reduce hepatic fat storage; and choline deficiency disrupts VLDL production and triglyceride export, contributing to hepatic fat accumulation. Addressing these deficiencies through appropriate dietary intake or supplementation may offer therapeutic benefits in MASLD management, though further research is needed to establish clear guidelines.

Nutrition support in pediatric chronic liver disease — conclusions emphasize that malnutrition is common in cholestasis and cirrhosis, and optimizing calorie, protein, fat, and micronutrient provision has the potential to positively impact survival, development, quality of life, and overall health. Optimal nutritional assessment is stated to be multifaceted and must include dietary intake, careful physical examination, anthropometric measurements, functional assessments, and attention to both micro and macronutrient deficiencies. Interventions are described as ranging from avoidance of prolonged periods of fasting and use of modular supplements (e.g. MCT oil supplementation) to nasogastric feeds or total parenteral nutrition, and for children who progress to end-stage liver disease, optimizing nutrition may affect their post–liver transplant course. The authors also note that carefully designed research may improve care by validating comprehensive assessment tools, determining ideal monitoring and supplementation practices, and evaluating the efficacy of aggressive nutritional interventions such as the need to start total parenteral nutrition.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

As oxidative stress is reported to be causative in NAFLD initiation and progression, antioxidant supplements may potentially protect cellular structures against damage from oxygen‐free radicals and reactive products of lipid peroxidation. A number of antioxidants such as vitamin E, silymarin, betaine, and N‐acetylcysteine are also being studied. A 2011 Cochrane review also reported that antioxidant supplements might increase liver enzyme activity.

Vitamin E (α‐tocopherol), a fat‐soluble antioxidant, is the major type of lipid‐soluble, chain‐breaking antioxidant found in the human body. It occurs naturally in foods such as nuts, seeds, and leafy green vegetables. Vitamin E was first described in 1922 as a dietary factor essential to prevent foetal reabsorption in rats, and soon after it was identified as an antioxidant of polyunsaturated lipids. It was considered a cytoprotective factor with suggested roles in preventing inflammatory and degenerative processes of the liver during exposure to a range of xenobiotics, environmental pollutants, and dietary factors.

Recently, convincing evidence from animal studies found a preventive role of vitamin E in metabolic and inflammatory abnormalities associated with NAFLD, which was confirmed in clinical trials. Since the 2000s, vitamin E has been studied in monotherapy or with other agents in many clinical trials to treat NAFLD, and Sanyal and colleagues showed that vitamin E, but not pioglitazone, improved the histological features of NASH. Results from these studies showed that vitamin E relieved NASH‐associated injury and inflammation, decreased intrahepatic triglycerides, and improved lipid metabolism. However, a 2021 Cochrane network meta‐analysis conducted by Komolafe and colleagues reported no effects of vitamin E on all clinical outcomes for people with NAFLD when compared to no additional intervention; the authors also reported that data were sparse.

The dosages of vitamin E used in studies range from 39 IU per day to 1000 IU per day; duration of administration ranged from one month to 96 weeks. However, high‐dose vitamin E (400 IU per day or greater) might increase the risk of all‐cause mortality, bleeding, and prostate cancer.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114LfrR4]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — guidance on pharmacologic therapy and supplements states that metformin at 500 mg twice-daily offers no benefit to children with NAFLD and thus should not be prescribed to specifically treat NAFLD or NASH, and the effect of higher doses is not known. Vitamin E 800 IU/day offers benefit to children with biopsy-proven NASH; long-term safety of high-dose vitamin E in children is unknown, and Vitamin E may be used to treat NASH in children, but risks and benefits should be discussed with each patient. Evidence for omega-3 fatty acids is mixed in children, with a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid failing to show significant therapeutic benefit in one study, whereas docosahexaenoic acid administered at 250 mg/day for 6 months showed significant improvement in hepatic fat as well as cardiometabolic risk factors in another study.

### S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) therapy in liver disease: a review of current evidence and clinical utility [^11328Cs2]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe; AdoMet) is an important, metabolically pleiotropic molecule that participates in multiple cellular reactions as the precursor for the synthesis of glutathione and principle methyl donor required for methylation of nucleic acids, phospholipids, histones, biogenic amines, and proteins. SAMe synthesis is depressed in chronic liver disease and so there has been considerable interest in the utility of SAMe to ameliorate disease severity. Despite encouraging pre-clinical data confirming that SAMe depletion can exacerbate liver injury and supporting a hepatoprotective role for SAMe therapy, to date no large, high-quality randomised clinical trials have been performed that establish clinical utility in specific disease states. Here, we offer an in-depth review of the published scientific literature relating to the physiological and pathophysiological roles of SAMe and its therapeutic use in liver disease, critically assessing implications for clinical practice and offering recommendations for further research.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^112UsuQb]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Marine omega-3 fatty acids are very promising dietary supplements used in prevention and therapy of cardiovascular, inflammatory, immunological, psychological and neurological disorders. They are safe pharmacological agents within the wide range of dose, what was shown in several studies including pregnancy, newborns and elderly and confirmed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2012.

The beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids are possibly secondary to their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic and vasodilatory properties. There is an evidence they could improve lipid prolife by lowering triglycerides, decrease insulin resistance and cytokine synthesis. These effects may be linked with the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Already a number of studies showed efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the metabolic syndrome-related conditions. Therefore omega-3 fatty acids may be potentially promising medication in the treatment of NAFLD.

To our best knowledge, our study is one of the very few double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials testing efficacy of omega-3 in children with NAFLD. Previously Nobili et al. supplemented a group of 60 children with either DHA or placebo for 6 months. The therapy decreased liver steatosis on ultrasound, improved triglycerides and insulin resistance markers, however no change in ALT activity was observed. Further pediatric trials supporting or refuting use of omega-3 fatty in NAFLD are needed.

The review of the literature of randomized trials suggests that wide-range doses (0,8–13,7g per day) of omega-3 fatty acids are safe and may be efficient in NAFLD, however the optimal dose and proportion in the treatment of NAFLD has not been agreed yet. Moreover the evidence is limited in children. We used omega-3 formula containing EPA and DHA, that should combine positive metabolic (mostly EPA) and anti-inflammatory effects (DHA). The composition of the studied supplement consisted of pre-defined DHA/EPA ratio (3:2). The chosen dose and content of omega-3 in our study was decided on the basis of review of the promising results from available open-label studies and it is a compromise that should provide safety and efficacy of therapy. However, the study is testing only one dose of omega-3 instead of multiple doses to determine the dose–response relationship. Use of sunflower oil as a placebo/comparator may be justified because omega-6 are commonly present in a regular diet and the given dose does not influence their nutritional balance.

### Nonlinear associations of serum vitamin D levels with advanced liver disease and mortality: a US cohort study [^116We25k]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency affects an estimated 30%–50% of the general population, representing a significant public health concern. – This fat-soluble vitamin plays a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and regulating calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to an increased risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.

Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represent significant global health burdens. Cirrhosis, characterized by progressive liver fibrosis, is the 11th leading cause of death worldwide.HCC, the most common primary liver cancer, ranks as the sixth most common cancer and fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally.

Several observational studies have investigated the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and liver diseases. For example, a cross-sectional study found that patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis had significantly lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls. Another study reported that low vitamin D levels are associated with higher mortality rates in patients with liver cirrhosis.

The potential mechanisms underlying the association between vitamin D deficiency and the incidence of liver diseases have been examined in various experimental studies. Vitamin D is believed to exert anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antiproliferative effects through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is expressed in liver cells, potentially modulating immune responses and cellular homeostasis. – Despite the growing evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to liver diseases, comprehensive studies assessing the impact of demographic factors such as age, sex, and race on this association are lacking. Furthermore, many existing studies have been limited by small sample sizes, single-center design, limiting generalizability, and insufficient adjustment for potential confounders, potentially biasing results. In addition, most studies focused on the association between vitamin D deficiency and liver disease severity. By contrast, the effect on disease incidence remains less explored, leaving uncertainty about its role in disease initiation. However, the clinical benefits of vitamin D supplementation remain controversial, as some studies report benefits, while others show no significant impact on long-term health outcomes.

Given these knowledge gaps and methodological limitations in prior research, the primary objectives of this study were to investigate the association between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of liver cirrhosis and HCC, to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce these risks, and to explore how these risks vary according to demographic factors.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: modulating gut microbiota to improve severity? [^115rtURE]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Gut microbiota plays a role in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, which include nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, through the gut-liver axis. To date, clinical guidelines recommend a weight loss goal of 7%-10% to improve features of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Because this target is not easily achieved by all patients, alternative therapeutic options are currently being evaluated. This review focuses on therapeutics that aim to modulate the gut microbiota and the gut-liver axis. We discuss how probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotic, fecal microbiota transfer, polyphenols, specific diets, and exercise interventions have been found to modify gut microbiota signatures; improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease outcomes; and detail, when available, the different mechanisms by which these beneficial outcomes might occur. Apart from probiotics that have already been tested in human randomized controlled trials, most of these potential therapeutics have been studied in animals. Their efficacy still warrants confirmation in humans using appropriate design.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112kBkan]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk determinants — drug properties: Although idiosyncratic DILI typically is independent of administered dose, risk factors are given at a daily dose of > 50–100 mg per day. More than 80% of DILI cases that resulted in liver transplantation in the United States were caused by medications with daily doses exceeding 50 mg. Drugs with high lipophilicity and extensive metabolism in the liver (> 50%) are associated with an increased hepatotoxic potential, especially in combination with a high daily dose (> 100 mg daily). Concomitant administration of multiple hepatotoxic drugs and dose escalation as seen with azathioprine have been associated with increased risk, whereas dose reduction or increasing the dosing interval may improve tolerability.

### Combined beneficial effect of voluntary physical exercise and vitamin D supplementation in diet-induced obese C57BL / 6J mice [^1121w5ma]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Physical exercise (PE) combined with nutritional approaches has beneficial effects that are widely advocated to improve metabolic health. Here we used voluntary PE together with vitamin D (VD) supplementation, which has already shown beneficial effects in primary and tertiary prevention in obese mice models, to study their combined additive effects on body weight management, glucose homeostasis, metabolic inflammation, and liver steatosis as key markers of metabolic health.

Methods

Ten-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat/sucrose (HFS) diet for 10 wk, then assigned to a 15-wk intervention period with PE, VD supplementation, or both PE and VD supplementation. Morphological, histological, and molecular phenotype data were characterized.

Results

The HFS-induced increases in body mass, adiposity, and adipocyte hypertrophy were improved by PE but not by VD supplementation. The HFS-induced inflammation (highlighted by chemokines mRNA levels) in inguinal adipose tissue was decreased by PE and/or VD supplementation. Furthermore, the intervention combining PE and VD showed additive effects on restoring insulin sensitivity and improving hepatic steatosis, as demonstrated through a normalization of size and number of hepatic lipid droplets and triglyceride content and a significant molecular-level decrease in the expression of genes coding for key enzymes in hepatic de novo lipogenesis.

Conclusions

Taken together, our data show beneficial effects of combining PE and VD supplementation on obesity-associated comorbidities such as insulin resistance and hepatic disease in mice. This combined exercise-nutritional support strategy could prove valuable in obesity management programs.

### Dietary vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing digestive diseases and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114SZqmu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin E supplementation is recommended for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for nondiabetic patients, but its preventative effects are unclear.

Methods

We assessed dietary vitamin E intake with disease phenotypes and evaluated vitamin E levels with the development of NAFLD.

Results

Data from > 210,000 participants demonstrate that increased dietary vitamin E associates with reduced rates of several gastrointestinal diseases and reduced overall mortality. Diabetic and overweight subjects with increased vitamin E intake have fewer NAFLD diagnoses.

Discussion

Our findings reveal the relevance of vitamin E consumption for several gastrointestinal diseases and warrant further mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.

### Effect of an Asian-adapted mediterranean diet and pentadecanoic acid on fatty liver disease: the TANGO randomized controlled trial [^112xGsb8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Weight loss is the most effective treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is evidence that the Mediterranean diets rich in unsaturated fatty acids and fiber have beneficial effects on weight homeostasis and metabolic risk factors in individuals with NAFLD. Studies have also shown that higher circulating concentrations of pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) are associated with a lower risk for NAFLD.

Objectives

To examine the effects of a Mediterranean-like, culturally contextualized Asian diet rich in fiber and unsaturated fatty acids, with or without C15:0 supplementation, in Chinese females with NAFLD.

Methods

In a double-blinded, parallel-design, randomized controlled trial, 88 Chinese females with NAFLD were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups for 12 wk: diet with C15:0 supplementation (n = 31), diet without C15:0 supplementation (n = 28), or control (habitual diet and no C15:0 supplementation, n = 29). At baseline and after the intervention, body fat percentage, intrahepatic lipid content, muscle and abdominal fat, liver enzymes, cardiometabolic risk factors, and gut microbiome were assessed.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, weight reductions of 4.0 ± 0.5 kg (5.3%), 3.4 ± 0.5 kg (4.5%), and 1.5 ± 0.5 kg (2.1%) were achieved in the diet-with-C15:0, diet without-C15:0, and the control groups, respectively. The proton density fat fraction (PDFF) of the liver decreased by 33%, 30%, and 10%, respectively. Both diet groups achieved significantly greater reductions in body weight, liver PDFF, total cholesterol, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and triglyceride concentrations compared with the control group. C15:0 supplementation reduced LDL-cholesterol further, and increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (deep and superficial), insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and blood pressure decreased significantly in all groups, in parallel with weight loss.

Conclusion

Mild weight loss induced by a Mediterranean-like diet adapted for Asians has multiple beneficial health effects in females with NAFLD. C15:0 supplementation lowers LDL-cholesterol and may cause beneficial shifts in the gut microbiome.

Trial Registration Number

This trial was registered at the clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05259475.

### Maternal and postnatal supplementation of fish oil improves metabolic health of mouse male offspring [^116jHGQa]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Over half of American women of childbearing age have either obesity or overweight. Hence, maternal programming through diet is critical for prevention of diseases in the offspring. Clinical trials with fish oil (FO) report various health benefits; however, it remains unclear whether maternal and postnatal consumption of FO protects offspring from adverse effects of consuming a high-fat (HF) diet.

Methods

Female mice were fed HF diets supplemented without (HF) or with FO from 8 weeks before pregnancy through lactation. A low-fat (LF) diet was included as a control diet. After weaning, male offspring from HF or FO dams were either continued on their respective diet (HF-HF and FO-FO) or switched to the other diet (HF-FO and FO-HF) and compared with LF. Phenotypic and mechanistic studies were performed.

Results

FO-FO offspring demonstrated significantly higher glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity compared with other pups fed the HF diet (P < 0.05). Furthermore, FO-FO pups had lower adiposity, inflammation, and fat deposition in the liver, consistent with reduced markers of hepatic lipogenesis and increased hepatic lipid oxidation.

Conclusions

Supplementation of FO during pregnancy and early life is more beneficial than treating with FO either during pregnancy or in pups.

AASLD idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) clinical course and prognosis — Most adults and children present with an acute liver injury phenotype that typically resolves within 6 months without long-term sequelae in 80%, but a subset is at risk for severe outcomes. In registry studies, 10% of patients with idiosyncratic DILI are at risk for adverse hepatic outcomes including acute liver failure (ALF), liver transplantation, and death within 6 months of onset. Because spontaneous survival in idiosyncratic DILI-related ALF is only 25%, early transfer to a liver transplant center is recommended. Chronic liver injury persisting beyond 6–12 months is observed in 10%–20% and may be more commonly encountered in those with cholestatic DILI.

### The effect of probiotic supplementation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score in patients attending a tertiary hospital clinic in cairo, Egypt [^114HhV2v]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients diagnosed with NAFLD should undergo an initial assessment of liver fibrosis using NAFLD scores. Primary care clinics can effectively manage follow-up for patients whose NFS is below − 1.455.

The current standard of care for treating NAFLD emphasizes lifestyle interventions, particularly through diet and exercise. European guidelines recommend the Mediterranean dietary pattern specifically for NAFLD treatment. Statins are also recommended to lower cardiovascular risks and are generally safe for most NAFLD patients. Additionally, insulin-sensitizing agents like metformin or thiazolidinediones are used to reduce insulin resistance. These strategies not only target NAFLD management but also address associated cardiovascular risks, given their shared metabolic implications.

Vitamin E is recognized for its ability to reduce oxidative damage to liver cells. Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) may alleviate steatosis through several mechanisms, including moderate weight loss, improved glycemic control, reversal of hepatic insulin resistance, and enhanced glucose sensitivity of pancreatic beta-cells. These treatments offer promising avenues for addressing NAFLD by targeting specific pathways involved in liver health and metabolic regulation.

Microbial therapies encompass treatments such as prebiotics and probiotics, which aim to manipulate the intestinal microbiota. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that foster the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the intestine. Meanwhile, probiotics work by modulating the gut microbiota, thereby reducing pathogenic bacteria, enhancing gut barrier integrity, and mitigating liver inflammation. These therapies represent innovative approaches to managing conditions like NAFLD by targeting the gut-liver axis and influencing overall gut health.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of probiotics supplementation (lactobacillus) on NAFLD fibrosis score.

### NASPGHAN clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in children: recommendations from the Expert Committee on Nafld (ECON) and the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (NASPGHAN) [^1117HT6V]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric NAFLD medications and supplements — routine pharmacologic therapy is not supported. In summary, no medication or supplement has been shown to be of significant value for the management of NAFLD in children, and Recommendation 13 states: No currently available medications or supplements are recommended to treat NAFLD because none have been proven to benefit the majority of patients with NAFLD. Strength: 2, Evidence: C. In the TONIC randomized clinical trial, which included 173 children ages 8 to 17 years, vitamin E treatment was associated with statistically significant improvements in histology, as shown by a lower NAS and greater resolution of NASH. Metformin administered at 500 mg twice daily was not different than placebo in terms of NAS score or ALT improvement and there was no improvement in insulin sensitivity in the metformin group. With respect to supplements, a small RCT using either 250 or 500 mg DHA compared with placebo for pediatric NAFLD found no improvement in ALT, an adult study suggests that fish oil worsens NASH, and probiotics were tested in 2 small studies of short duration (2–4 months) with ALT improved significantly in 1 study compared to placebo.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113s1NHW]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### The effects of onion consumption on treatment of metabolic, histologic, and inflammatory features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114jQJko]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as the most common liver disease, is becoming anoutstanding public health concern in the world. NAFLD is strongly associated with the features of metabolic syndrome such as hyperglycemia, central obesity and dyslipidaemia. It is also associated withincreased risk of all-cause mortality, contributed by liver relateddeaths as well as non-liver related causes such as malignancy, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Although the beneficial role of diet and some dietary supplements on NAFLD treatment have been shown recently, no consensus has yet been achieved. Thus, finding effective therapies are a research priority to reduce the anticipatedburden of liver diseases.

Onion has the potential properties in amelioration of inflammation, hyperglycemia andhyperlipidemia. Its high content of flavonoids, makes it as a great source of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agent. It seems that all of these properties can help in treatment of NAFLD. Therefore, the purpose of thepresent study was to examine the effects of oraladministration of onion powder on hepatic and serum features of NAFLD in an experimental model of disease.

### The role of the gut microbiome in graft fibrosis after pediatric liver transplantation [^1158kxHV]. Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Diet recommendation and nutrition advice post LT

Nutritional support is very crucial in children undergoing LT. Infants with end-stage liver diseases often exhibit growth failure due to impaired absorption of nutrition (Yang et al.). LT outcomes improve if malnutrition can be resolved before surgery and a good nutritional status should be maintained post-LT (Yang et al.). In addition, supplementing fiber and probiotics to LT recipients decreased postoperative infections (Rayes et al.). The impact of nutrition on fibrosis could (partly) be mediated through affecting the microbiome composition or function. Dependent on the age of children, fibers (especially oligosaccharides) are important sources of SCFAs and promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. The American Health Foundation recommends that children over 2 years old should take as daily amount of fiber their weight in years +5 to +10 g/d (Catzola and Vajro). In general, supplementing fiber-containing diet post-LT might improve the gut health in infants. It is tempting to speculate that this could also prevent or mitigate graft fibrosis.

### Milk thistle (PDQ ®)-NCI-national cancer institute… [^1124Sorx]. NCI (2003). Low credibility.

- Laboratory studies demonstrate that silymarin stabilizes cellular membranes, stimulates detoxification pathways, stimulates regeneration of liver tissue, inhibits the growth of certain cancer cell lines, exerts direct cytotoxic activity toward certain cancer cell lines, and possibly increases the efficacy of certain chemotherapy agents.
- Human clinical trials have investigated milk thistle or silymarin primarily in individuals with hepatitis or cirrhosis, although small studies have been reported about individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Silymarin is most well known for its purported effects on the liver. In laboratory studies, silymarin has been found to stabilize cell membranes, thus preventing toxic chemicals from entering the cell. Laboratory studies have also demonstrated that silymarin stimulates synthesis and activity of enzymes responsible for detoxification pathways. Alternatively, this may be related to the effect of silymarin on detoxification systems.

In vitro data have shown silybin to stimulate and/or inhibit phase I detoxification pathways in silybin-treated human liver cells. However, this effect was found to be dose-dependent, and these levels are not physiologically attainable with the current manufacturer dose recommendations. Silymarin and silybin have also been found to accelerate cell regeneration in the liver through stimulation of precursors to DNA synthesis and enhancement of production of the cellular enzymes required for DNA synthesis. Silymarin has been shown to mitigate oxidative stress in cells treated with pro-oxidant compounds.

### Milk thistle-NCI… [^113aZYR5]. NCI (2007). Low credibility.

- Milk thistle is a plant whose fruit and seeds are used for liver and bile duct disorders.
- Milk thistle is usually taken in capsules or tablets.
- Studies of milk thistle have been done in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Milk thistle is usually taken by mouth in capsules or tablets. In Europe silybin is given by intravenous infusion as the only treatment for Amanita phalloides, a mushroom toxin that causes death. Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using milk thistle. In laboratory studies, tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies, tests are done to see if a drug, procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Have any studies of milk thistle been done in people.

Several small studies have looked at whether milk thistle can be used to decrease side effects of cancer treatment.
- A randomized clinical trial in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia found that silymarin decreased the side effects of chemotherapy on the liver without harming the cancer treatment.
- A randomized clinical trial in men with prostate cancer who had surgery to remove their prostate found that taking silymarin and selenium improved quality of life, lowered cholesterol, and increased the amount of selenium in the blood. A number of clinical trials have studied milk thistle in the treatment of patients with hepatitis, cirrhosis, mushroom poisoning, or bile duct disorders. These trials have used a wide range of doses with mixed results. In a trial of biologic therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis, patients taking silymarin had less symptoms and a better quality of life compared to patients not taking silymarin.

Silymarin has been found to help with iron chelation therapy, which removes extra iron in the blood of patients who have had many blood transfusions. Have any side effects or risks been reported from milk thistle. Very few side effects from the use of milk thistle or silymarin have been reported. Several large studies in patients with liver disorders have found that taking silymarin may rarely have a laxative effect or cause nausea, heartburn, or stomach upset. At high doses, mild allergic reactions have been seen.

### Liver disease… [^116pHugq]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Milk thistle was used in classical Greece to treat liver and gallbladder diseases and to protect the liver against toxins. It recently has been investigated for use as a cytoprotectant, an anticarcinogen, and a supportive treatment for liver damage from Amanita phalloides poisoning. Its active ingredient is silymarin, found primarily in the seeds. Silymarin undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, which results in higher concentrations in liver cells than in serum. Several mechanisms of cytoprotection have been identified. In some studies, 8 milk thistle promoted neuronal differentiation and survival. In others, silymarin inhibited leukotriene formation by Kupffer cells 9 and increased expression of growth factor beta-1 and c-myc.

10 In animal studies, it has shown protective effects against damage to the pancreas from cyclosporine 11; damage to the kidney from acetaminophen, cisplatin, and vincristine 12; and damage to the liver from carbon tetrachloride, 13, 14 partly by reducing lipid peroxidation. Uses and Effectiveness LIVER DISEASE In the United States, milk thistle is most commonly used to treat viral infections and cirrhosis of the liver. Clinical trials have produced conflicting results. In a study. In a six-month double-blind study 26 of 36 patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, the group given Legalon showed normalization of their bilirubin, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase serum levels, and also showed improvement in histology. These effects did not occur in the placebo group.

In another study, 27 106 patients with mild acute and subacute liver disease characterized by elevated serum transaminase levels were randomized to receive silymarin or placebo. Of the 97 patients who completed the four-week study, there was a statistically significant greater decrease in transaminase levels in the silymarin group. In addition, results of a smaller study 28 of 20 patients with chronic active hepatitis randomized to placebo or silybin showed that the milk thistle group had significantly lower transaminase, bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels than the placebo group. This study used a complex of silybin with phosphatidylcholine, which appears to increase bioavailability.

### Effect of silymarin (milk thistle) on liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C unsuccessfully treated with interferon therapy… [^117LkuoV]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive 420-mg silymarin, 700-mg silymarin, or matching placebo administered 3 times per day for 24 weeks. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was serum ALT level of 45 U/L or less or less than 65 U/L, provided this was at least a 50% decline from baseline values. Secondary outcomes included changes in ALT levels, HCV RNA levels, and quality-of-life measures. Silymarin, an extract of milk thistle, is the botanical treatment most commonly used for liver disorders in the United States, owing to its purported hepatoprotective properties. 6, 7 Indeed, 33% of patients with chronic HCV infection and cirrhosis.

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 420-mg silymarin, 700-mg silymarin, or matching placebo gelatin capsules administered 3 times daily for 24 weeks, a standard duration of treatment for which effective therapies for HCV have regularly demonstrated improvement in disease activity. 5, 18, 19 The botanical product used in the trial is a dry extract of milk thistle fruits, marketed as Legalon 140. This standardized silymarin product is approved as a prescription drug in several countries of Europe and Asia as a treatment for hepatic disorders. The placebo gelatin capsules consisted of lactose and other Legalon 140 components that included mannitol, magnesium stearate, and sodium carboxymethyl starch.

The study was double blinded so that patients took 5 capsules 3 times daily, which consisted of either 5 capsules of silymarin, 3 capsules of silymarin and 2 of placebo, or 5 capsules of placebo, provided in a sealed, labeled cup. Limited data from human and animal studies suggest that silymarin flavonolignans undergo rapid and extensive conjugative metabolism with primarily biliary excretion, resulting in short half-lives and low systemic exposures following oral administration of silymarin. 28–32 The doses administered in the present trial, substantially higher than customary doses of silymarin preparations, were first evaluated in a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study and were chosen to increase the chance of detecting a therapeutic benefit.
