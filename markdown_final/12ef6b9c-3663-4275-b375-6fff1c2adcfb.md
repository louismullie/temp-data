## Question

How quickly does propranolol lower blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how quickly propranolol lowers blood pressure and how to interpret onset, peak effect, steady state, and formulation differences in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that govern onset and peak effect. Then, I should verify formulation-specific data for immediate-release versus extended-release. Next, I will examine the time to full antihypertensive effect and steady state. After that, I need to check intravenous onset for hypertensive emergencies and clarify why propranolol is not preferred there. Finally, I will consider patient-specific factors that modify the time course and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded timeline with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic framework. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker that lowers blood pressure primarily by decreasing cardiac output and inhibiting renin release, with additional central sympatholytic effects; importantly, total peripheral resistance may initially rise but readjusts downward with chronic therapy, which helps explain why the full antihypertensive effect accrues over days to weeks rather than immediately after the first dose [^113gBNs2] [^112y6XDw].

> Now, I should review immediate-release oral propranolol. Wait, let me verify the onset and peak. The immediate-release tablet is rapidly absorbed but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, so systemic availability is limited and variable; clinically meaningful beta-blockade and blood pressure effects typically begin within 1 to 2 hours, with peak effects around 2 to 4 hours after dosing, which aligns with the time course of plasma concentrations and receptor occupancy dynamics; this is consistent with class pharmacology and the need for divided dosing to smooth coverage across the day [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine extended-release formulations. I need to ensure I distinguish kinetics from immediate-release. Extended-release capsules deliver propranolol more slowly, with peak levels around 6 hours and a prolonged, relatively constant plasma concentration over about 12 hours before declining; clinically, this translates to a smoother antihypertensive effect across 24 hours with once-daily dosing, though retitration may be needed when switching from immediate-release to maintain end-of-interval control [^114a8fn8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about steady-state effect. I should confirm the time to full antihypertensive response. Multiple FDA labels consistently state that the time needed for full hypertensive control after a given dose is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks, reflecting receptor adaptation, renin-angiotensin modulation, and neurohormonal resetting; this is why titration every few days to weeks is standard practice [^1132AFU2] [^114a8fn8].

> I will now examine intravenous propranolol for acute scenarios. Let me check onset and dosing constraints. IV propranolol has a rapid onset of beta-blockade within minutes, with careful titration of 1 to 3 mg under ECG and hemodynamic monitoring; however, propranolol is not indicated for hypertensive emergencies, where short-acting, titratable agents like nicardipine, clevidipine, esmolol, or labetalol are preferred to avoid abrupt swings and to allow precise control in monitored settings [^112Gr6Gq] [^116Ff1hX] [^1156L7zV].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a partial agonist beta-blocker or a vasodilating agent; does that change the time course? I should double-check that the question is specifically about propranolol. The Cochrane review on beta-blockers with partial agonist activity shows variable hourly BP effects over 24 hours and less robust nighttime control, but that evidence does not directly apply to propranolol's nonselective, non–partial agonist profile; thus, I should avoid extrapolating those hourly patterns to propranolol while acknowledging that interindividual variability is substantial across the class [^1118JqUw].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers. Let me consider factors that can accelerate or delay effect. Hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 phenotype can alter propranolol metabolism and exposure, potentially changing the time to steady effect and the dose required; elderly patients may be more sensitive to hypotension and bradycardia, and those with reactive airways or bradyarrhythmias may manifest earlier or more pronounced hemodynamic effects; these factors argue for cautious titration and closer early monitoring [^116yrvU3] [^115AsvkX].

> I should confirm practical dosing patterns that influence perceived speed of control. Immediate-release propranolol is commonly initiated at 40 mg twice daily and titrated every few days to effect, which allows earlier assessment of response, whereas extended-release formulations start around 80 mg once daily with titration to 120–160 mg; if blood pressure drifts upward near the end of the dosing interval, splitting the dose or switching to a three-times-daily immediate-release regimen can improve trough control and may make the antihypertensive effect appear "faster" in terms of day-to-day stability [^1132AFU2] [^114a8fn8].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful timeline and sanity-check it against the evidence. For immediate-release oral propranolol, expect onset within 1 to 2 hours, a peak effect around 2 to 4 hours, and accumulation of benefit over several days. For extended-release, anticipate a smoother profile with a later peak around 6 hours and sustained effect across 24 hours, though end-of-interval attenuation can occur and may require dose adjustment. For both, full antihypertensive control typically emerges over days to weeks with titration, and IV propranolol acts within minutes but is reserved for select arrhythmic or perioperative contexts, not hypertensive emergencies [^116xppZT] [^114a8fn8] [^116Ff1hX] [^116Ff1hX].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Early blood pressure changes after the first dose are modest and primarily reflect acute hemodynamic shifts. Decisions to uptitrate or add therapy should generally be made after several days to 1 to 2 weeks to allow for steady-state pharmacodynamics, with home or ambulatory monitoring helping distinguish transient fluctuations from true treatment effect. If control wanes before the next dose, consider divided immediate-release dosing or a higher extended-release dose, always watching for bradycardia, fatigue, and bronchospasm, and avoiding abrupt discontinuation when stopping therapy [^1132AFU2] [^113WfUdP] [^115AsvkX].

---

Propranolol lowers blood pressure within 1–2 hours after oral dosing, with **peak effect at 2–4 hours** and a **duration of 6–12 hours** depending on formulation [^116xppZT]. The full antihypertensive effect develops over several days to weeks with continued use [^1132AFU2] [^114a8fn8]. IV propranolol acts within minutes, but is **not indicated for hypertensive emergencies** [^114Y4yqy]. Individual response varies with dose, formulation, and patient factors; monitor blood pressure closely and adjust therapy as needed [^1132AFU2] [^114a8fn8].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that reduces blood pressure by decreasing cardiac output, inhibiting renin release, and diminishing sympathetic outflow [^112y6XDw]. Its pharmacokinetic profile influences the time course of blood pressure reduction:

- **Absorption**: Rapid oral absorption with peak plasma levels at 1–4 hours [^notfound].
- **Distribution**: Highly lipophilic, with extensive tissue distribution and CNS penetration [^116xppZT].
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6; first-pass effect reduces bioavailability to ~25% [^1135zKUi] [^116xppZT].
- **Elimination**: Half-life ~3–6 hours for immediate-release; ~8–10 hours for extended-release [^115A6MwW] [^116xppZT].

---

## Onset of antihypertensive effect

The onset of blood pressure reduction depends on formulation and route:

| **Formulation** | **Onset of action** | **Peak effect** | **Duration of effect** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Immediate-release oral | 1–2 hours | 2–4 hours | 6–12 hours [^notfound] |
| Extended-release oral | 2–4 hours | 6–8 hours | 24 hours [^114a8fn8] |
| Intravenous | 1–2 minutes | 5–10 minutes | 2–4 hours [^notfound] |

---

IV propranolol is not indicated for hypertensive emergencies because of its slower onset and less predictable control than agents such as labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine [^116yrvU3] [^1156L7zV].

---

## Time to steady-state therapeutic effect

Although initial effects occur within hours, the full antihypertensive effect requires continued therapy; the **immediate-release** formulation reaches steady state in 2–3 days, with full antihypertensive effect in several days to weeks, whereas the **extended-release** formulation reaches steady state in ~3–4 days, with full effect in 1–2 weeks.

---

## Factors influencing onset and magnitude of blood pressure reduction

Several factors modulate propranolol's blood pressure effects:

- **Dose**: Higher doses produce greater reductions, but adverse effects increase; typical maintenance is 120–240 mg/day [^1132AFU2] [^1133KeKG].
- **Formulation**: Extended-release provides smoother 24-hour control than immediate-release [^notfound].
- **Patient characteristics**: Age, renal/hepatic function, and cardiovascular comorbidities affect response [^116yrvU3].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) can increase levels and effect [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and monitoring

Given the delayed full effect, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor closely**: Check blood pressure frequently during initiation and titration [^1162FcYi].
- **Titrate gradually**: Adjust dose every few days to weeks based on response and tolerability [^1132AFU2].
- **Educate patients**: Explain that full benefit may take weeks and emphasize adherence [^1132AFU2].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Oral onset**: 1–2 hours; peak at 2–4 hours; duration 6–12 hours (immediate-release) [^notfound].
- **Extended-release**: Smoother 24-hour control with peak at 6–8 hours [^116xppZT].
- **IV onset**: 1–2 minutes; peak at 5–10 minutes; duration 2–4 hours [^notfound].
- **Full effect**: Develops over days to weeks with continued therapy [^1132AFU2] [^114a8fn8].
- **Not for emergencies**: IV propranolol is not indicated for hypertensive crises [^116Ff1hX].

---

Propranolol begins to lower blood pressure within 1–2 hours orally, with peak effect at 2–4 hours; the full antihypertensive benefit emerges over days to weeks, so close monitoring and patient education are essential.

Regarding preventative measures for variceal hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation, BSG 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate nonselective β-blockers or perform endoscopic variceal ligation for primary prophylaxis. Consider initiating pharmacotherapy with propranolol (40 mg BID, titrate dose to the maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg) as first-line primary prophylaxis. Offer variceal endoscopic variceal ligation if nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. Take into account patient choice when deciding between endoscopic variceal ligation and nonselective β-blockers.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative blood pressure thresholds, risk stratification, and beta-blocker initiation/withdrawal: There is conflicting evidence for patients with diastolic BP (DBP) > 110 mm Hg regarding recommending delay of surgery, and in a systematic review and meta-analysis, preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications; an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications and renal failure has been reported in patients with DBP > 110 mm Hg immediately before surgery, whereas patients with DBP < 110 mm Hg do not appear to be at significantly increased risk. During induction of anesthesia, a sympathetic reaction can result in a 20 to 30 mm Hg increase in BP, and an elevated BP on the day of surgery may represent "white-coat hypertension"; therefore referring to patients' baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide BP management. Without evidence for increased risk for perioperative complications in patients whose preoperative systolic/diastolic BP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery and BP can be controlled postoperatively or after discharge. Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing BB in the perioperative period, longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided; there are fewer data to describe whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative use of BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naïve patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and if there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### Β-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension [^1138YWP5]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are β-blockers associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events when used as initial treatment in individuals with hypertension compared with placebo, no treatment, or other drugs?

Bottom Line

Initial therapy of hypertension with β-blockers is not associated with reduced all-cause mortality but is associated with modest reductions in cardiovascular events compared with placebo or no treatment. Calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are associated with greater reductions in cardiovascular event rates than β-blockers. This evidence derives from trials of traditional β-blockers (eg, atenolol and propranolol), because there are currently no mortality and cardiovascular event data on the new vasodilating β-blockers (eg, carvedilol and nebivolol).

### Oral propranolol and its impact on vital signs in hospitalized pediatric patients for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^1133mdwG]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

We aimed to ascertain the clinical outcomes of inpatient propranolol initiation. In addition, we sought to better characterize which patient subpopulation may be at heightened risk of propranolol‐related complications, particularly focusing on premature birth, age at initiation, and low weight. Multiple studies have demonstrated that propranolol appears safe in pediatric patients with hemangiomas, specifically in regards to its effects on BP, HR, and glucose levels. We found that no infants became hypoglycemic or demonstrated symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension during the hospitalization period. No infants required immediate intervention or cessation of propranolol.

While we demonstrated that propranolol does statistically significantly lower blood pressure and heart rate, the average HR, SBP, and DBP readings remained above the lower limit of normal and did not cause symptoms. Secondary analyses were performed to evaluate subgroups of vulnerable or at‐risk populations–including weight < 5 kg, corrected age < 5 weeks, preterm, and having ≥ 5 hemangiomas, and no clinically significant differences regarding HR, BP, or glucose levels were found between these groups. Our study did not identify any pediatric patient subcategories that are at an increased risk of developing a propranolol‐related adverse event. As demonstrated by previous publications, substantial cost savings could be achieved by outpatient rather than inpatient propranolol initiation. Outpatient management also has the potential to offer reduced parental anxiety and minimize disruptions to family life.

In our cohort, no radiologic findings, cardiac monitoring, or specialist consultations led to discontinuation of oral propranolol. Oral propranolol was initiated at a lower dose following neurology consultation for two patients with PHACE syndrome to minimize stroke risk. While there is some theoretical increase in risk for ischemic strokes in patients with PHACE syndrome, oral propranolol therapy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment method. While imaging remains important for detecting rare syndromes, imaging, and cardiac monitoring do not appear to confer clinical benefit in the instance of propranolol initiation for IH management.

The study was limited due to its single center and retrospective nature as well as by variations in the timing of pre‐ and post‐propranolol vital sign and glucose level monitoring during hospitalization. In conclusion, our findings complement current literature suggesting that propranolol initiation for IH management has few complications even in patients < 5‐week‐corrected‐age and those weighing < 5 kg. Oral propranolol initiation likely requires less monitoring than currently performed.

### Splanchnic venous compression enhances the effects of ß-blockade in the treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome [^117RqAv2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Splanchnic venous pooling induced by upright posture triggers a compensatory increase in heart rate (HR), a response that is exaggerated in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome. To assess whether abdominal compression attenuates orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms, 18 postural tachycardia syndrome patients (32 ± 2 years) were randomized to receive either abdominal compression (40 mm Hg applied with an inflatable binder ≈2 minutes before standing) or propranolol (20 mg) in a placebo-controlled, crossover study. Methods and Results Systolic blood pressure, HR, and symptoms were assessed while seated and standing, before and 2 hours postdrug. As expected, propranolol decreased standing HR compared with placebo (81 ± 2 versus 98 ± 4 beats per minute; P < 0.001) and was associated with lower standing systolic blood pressure (93 ± 2 versus 100 ± 2 mm Hg for placebo; P = 0.002). Compression had no effect on standing HR (96 ± 4 beats per minute) but increased standing systolic blood pressure compared with placebo and propranolol (106 ± 2 mm Hg; P < 0.01). Neither propranolol nor compression improved symptoms compared with placebo. In 16 patients we compared the combination of abdominal compression and propranolol with propranolol alone. The combination had no additional effect on standing HR (81 ± 2 beats per minute for both interventions) but prevented the decrease in standing systolic blood pressure produced by propranolol (98 ± 2 versus 93 ± 2 mm Hg for propranolol; P = 0.029), and significantly improved total symptom burden (-6 ± 2 versus -1 ± 2 for propranolol; P = 0.041). Conclusions Splanchnic venous compression alone did not improve HR or symptoms but prevented the blood pressure decrease produced by propranolol. The combination was more effective in improving symptoms than either alone. Splanchnic venous compression can be a useful adjuvant therapy to propranolol in postural tachycardia syndrome.

### Propranolol decreases tachycardia and improves symptoms in the postural tachycardia syndrome: less is more [^114YK9UC]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) induces disabling chronic orthostatic intolerance with an excessive increase in heart rate on standing. beta-Blockade is an appealing treatment approach, but conflicting preliminary reports are conflicting. We tested the hypothesis that propranolol will attenuate the tachycardia and improve symptom burden in patients with POTS. In protocol 1, a low dose (20 mg) was compared with placebo, and the dose response was assessed in protocol 2.

Methods and Results

In protocol 1, patients with POTS (n = 54) underwent acute drug trials of propranolol 20 mg orally and placebo, on separate mornings, in a randomized crossover design. Blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms were assessed while the patients were seated and after standing for up to 10 minutes before and hourly after the study drug. Supine (P < 0.001) and standing (P < 0.001) heart rates were significantly lower after propranolol compared with placebo. The symptom burden improvement from baseline to 2 hours was greater with propranolol than placebo (median, -4.5 versus 0 arbitrary units; P = 0.044). In protocol 2, 18 patients with POTS underwent similar trials of high-dose (80 mg) versus low-dose (20 mg) propranolol. Although the high dose elicited a greater decrease than the low dose in standing heart rate (P < 0.001) and orthostatic tachycardia (P < 0.001), the improvement in symptoms at 2 hours was greater with low-dose propranolol (-6 versus -2 arbitrary units; P = 0.041).

Conclusions

Low-dose oral propranolol significantly attenuated tachycardia and improved symptoms in POTS. Higher-dose propranolol did not further improve, and may worsen, symptoms.

Table 26 — Other intravenous agents for hypertensive emergencies: Hydralazine is noted to have BP begin to decrease within 10–30 min and the fall last 2–4 h, and is described as an undesirable first-line agent for acute treatment in most patients due to unpredictability of response and prolonged duration of action. Phentolamine may be given as IV bolus dose 5 mg with additional bolus doses every 10 min as needed to lower BP to target, adjusting up to a total cumulative dose of 50 mg/24 h, and is used in hypertensive emergencies induced by catecholamine excess. Fenoldopam is initiated at 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min and may be increased in increments of 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min every 15 min until target BP is reached, with maximum infusion rate 1.6 mcg/kg/min, and is contraindicated in patients at risk of increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma) or intracranial pressure and those with sulfite allergy. Enalaprilat may be given as initial 1.25 mg over a 5-min period, with doses increased up to 5 mg every 6 h as needed to achieve BP target and total cumulative dose of 50 mg/24 h; it is contraindicated in pregnancy and should not be used in acute MI or bilateral renal artery stenosis, with relatively slow onset of action (15 min) and unpredictability of BP response.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of β-blockers as second-line therapy for primary hypertension [^1127jEBr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are one of the more commonly prescribed classes of anti-hypertensive drugs, both as first-line and second-line.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects of beta-blocker therapy when given as a second-line drug in adult patients with primary hypertension.

Search Strategy

CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-Aug 2009), EMBASE (1988-Aug 2009) and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing a beta-blocker in combination with a drug from another class of anti-hypertensive drugs compared with that drug alone for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality of each included study.

Main Results

20 double-blind RCTs evaluated the BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as second-line drug in 3744 hypertensive patients (baseline BP of 158/102 mmHg; mean duration of 7 weeks). The BP reduction from adding a beta-blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was seen with adding a beta-blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers reduced heart rate by 10 beats/min at 1 to 2 times the starting dose. Beta-blockers did not statistically significantly increase withdrawals due to adverse effects but this was likely due to the lack of reporting of this outcome in 35% of the included RCTs.

Authors' Conclusions

Addition of a beta-blocker to diuretics or calcium-channel blockers reduces BP by 6/4mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and by 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose. When the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers from this review was compared to that of thiazide diuretics from our previous review (Chen 2009), second-line beta-blockers reduce systolic BP to the same extent as second-line thiazide diuretics, but reduce diastolic BP to a greater degree. The different effect on diastolic BP means that beta-blockers have little or no effect on pulse pressure whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in pulse pressure. This difference in the pattern of BP lowering with beta-blockers as compared to thiazides might be the explanation for the fact that beta-blockers appear to be less effective at reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes than thiazide diuretics, particularly in older individuals.

### Beta-blockers for primary prevention in hypertension: era bygone? [^114ppJYX]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are used commonly worldwide in clinical practice for lowering blood pressure. Most of the agents in this class are efficacious in reducing blood pressure, although they vary widely in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This variability may confer significant differences in clinical benefits associated with use of specific agents. Although commonly used in managing hypertension, the role of beta-blockers for primary prevention in uncomplicated hypertension has been controversial. Evidence from recent trials suggest relatively poor efficacy toward primary prevention and worse outcomes for certain end points, when compared with other blood pressure-lowering agents, Recently updated National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for England and Wales reflect this concern and have changed the indication for beta-blockers for blood pressure control from primary agents to use as an add-on agent in patients requiring multiple therapy. In this review, considering the extended debate on this topic, we discuss the general properties of beta-blockers and evidence from clinical trials supporting or refuting their use in various clinical scenarios. Newer beta-blockers have additional properties which may be beneficial. Although, whether these additional benefits will help in primary prevention is not clear.

### The effect of blood pressure lowering medications on the prevention of episodic migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113eDzJR]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, only a few specific blood pressure-lowering medications are recommended for migraine prevention. Whether benefits extend to other classes or drugs is uncertain.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized control trials on the effect of blood pressure-lowering medications compared with placebo in participants with episodic migraine. Data were collected on four outcomes - monthly headache or migraine days, and monthly headache or migraine attacks, with a standardised mean difference calculated for overall. Random effect meta-analysis was performed.

Results

In total, 50 trials (70% of which were crossover) were included, comprising 60 comparisons. Overall mean age was 39 years, and 79% were female. Monthly headache days were fewer in all classes compared to placebo, and this was statistically significant for all but one class: alpha-blockers -0.7 (95% CI: -1.2, -0.1), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors -1.3 (95% CI: -2.9, 0.2), angiotensin II receptor blockers -0.9 (-1.6, -0.1), beta-blocker -0.4 (-0.8, -0.0) and calcium channel blockers -1.8 (-3.4, -0.2). Standardised mean difference was significantly reduced for all drug classes and was separately significant for numerous specific drugs: clonidine, candesartan, atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol, nicardipine and verapamil.

Conclusion

Among people with episodic migraine, a broader number of blood pressure-lowering medication classes and drugs reduce headache frequency than those currently included in treatment guidelines. Trial Registration: The study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017079176).

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112h45ir]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment — no direct screening effectiveness studies were found, while short-term trials evaluated pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions. No studies directly assessed screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents or screening for secondary hypertension in asymptomatic children. Twenty randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and a meta-analysis examined treatment; thirteen fair-quality placebo-controlled RCTs and 1 meta-analysis evaluated pharmacologic treatments, with trial duration limited to 2 to 4 weeks, and studies reported greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure vs placebo though not all differences were significant. Pooled SBP effects were −4.38 mm Hg for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, −3.07 mm Hg for angiotensin receptor blockers, −3.20 mm Hg for β-blockers, −3.10 mm Hg for calcium channel blockers, and −0.12 mm Hg for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Exercise reduced SBP over 3 months (−6.3 mm Hg; n = 40) and 8 months (−4.9 mm Hg; n = 69) in fair-quality RCTs; a DASH-type diet resulted in reductions in SBP (−2.2 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (−2.8 mm Hg) over 3 months (P < .01; n = 57) but the effect did not persist beyond the intervention period. A combined low-dose propranolol/chlorthalidone plus lifestyle intervention over 6 months reduced SBP (−7.6 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (−6.9 mm Hg), whereas low-salt diet and progressive muscle relaxation did not achieve reductions of blood pressure. The USPSTF did not find direct evidence that treating primary childhood hypertension prevents adverse health outcomes or improves intermediate outcomes in adulthood.

### Protective effects of renin-angiotensin blockade beyond blood pressure control [^116d68Df]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive drugs exert a number of blood pressure-independent benefits. However, demonstrating the clinical significance of these effects may be difficult for a number of reasons. First, blood pressure can be measured in the clinic, at home and over the 24-h period by ambulatory monitoring. Second, differences between these measures mean that achieving equivalent blood pressure reductions in two treatment arms may be difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, even small differences in blood pressure can translate into significant effects on cardiovascular risk, especially in the later stages of the cardiovascular continuum. In large clinical trials, other errors limiting the sensitivity to treatment differences include high patient dropouts and unplanned crossover. In addition, as so many patients fail to achieve blood pressure goals even in clinical trials where patient's and physician's motivation is high, the need for cardiovascular protection beyond blood pressure control is unequivocal. Clinical trials of angiotensin II receptor blockers have suggested significant effects beyond blood pressure control, which are observed throughout and with greater consistency in the early phases of the cardiovascular continuum. There may also be differences between angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Conclusive demonstration that these blood pressure-independent effects do exist will require, however, a much more accurate and extended assessment of the blood pressure effects of the drugs.

### Propranolol dosing practices in adult burn patients: implications for safety and efficacy [^113PNWkT]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Studies in children with burn injuries have demonstrated that propranolol improves metabolism and reduces muscle protein wasting. However, safety and efficacy in adults are less well established than in children. The purpose of this study was to determine safety of propranolol use in adult patients with burn injuries. Medical records were reviewed for burn-injured adults receiving propranolol. Patients between 18 and 65 years old and with ≥ 20% TBSA burn were included. Fifty-four patients met the criteria with mean age of 37 years and mean burn size of 38% TBSA. Propranolol dosages ranged from 0.1 to 3.8 mg/kg/day, with an average maximum dosage of 0.61 mg/kg/day. Mean heart rate decreased by 25% during 4 weeks. Seventy-two percent of patients experienced at least one episode of hypotension and 15% experienced bradycardia. Propranolol doses were most frequently held for low blood pressure; 32% of patients had at least one dose held for hypotension. This retrospective analysis suggests that modest dosing of propranolol results in frequent episodes of hypotension or bradycardia. Our data suggest that adults do not tolerate the higher doses reported in a pediatric population. Despite potential beneficial anti-catabolic effects of propranolol, burn care providers must recognize potential iatrogenic hemodynamic effects of this intervention. Our data support the need for prospective multicenter studies to delineate the safety and efficacy of propranolol in adult burn-injured patients.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Hypertension

In a double-blind, parallel dose-response study in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (n = 434), doses of INDERAL XL from 80 to 640 mg were taken once daily at approximately 10 p.m. INDERAL XL significantly lowered sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure when measurements were taken approximately 16 hours later. The placebo-subtracted diastolic blood pressure effect for the 80- and 120-mg doses was -3.0 and -4.0 mm Hg, respectively. Higher doses of INDERAL XL (160, 640 mg) had no additional blood-pressure lowering effect when compared with 120 mg. The antihypertensive effects of INDERAL XL were seen in the elderly (≥ 65 years old) and men and women. There were too few non-white patients to assess the efficacy of INDERAL XL in these patients.

### Prospective evaluation of early propranolol after traumatic brain injury [^113QwgpF]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may improve outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI), its early use is not routine. We hypothesize that judicious early low-dose propranolol after TBI (EPAT) will improve outcomes without altering bradycardia or hypotensive events.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational study on all patients who presented with moderate-to-severe TBI from March 2010-August 2013. Ten initial patients did not receive propranolol (control). Subsequent patients received propranolol at 1-mg intravenous every 6 h starting within 12 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (EPAT) for a minimum of 48 h. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded hourly for the first 72 h. Bradycardia and hypotensive events, mortality, and length of stay (LOS) were compared between cohorts to determine significant differences.

Results

Thirty-eight patients were enrolled; 10 control and 28 EPAT. The two cohorts were similar when compared by gender, emergency department (ED) systolic blood pressure, ED heart rate, and mortality. ED Glasgow coma scale was lower (4.2 versus 10.7, P < 0.01) and injury severity score higher in control. EPAT patients received a mean of 10 ± 14 doses of propranolol. Hypotensive events were similar between cohorts, whereas bradycardia events were higher in control (5.8 versus 1.6, P = 0.05). ICU LOS (15.4 versus 30.4 d, P = 0.02) and hospital LOS (10 versus 19.1 d, P = 0.05) were lower in EPAT. Mortality rates were similar between groups (10% versus 10.7%, P = 0.9). The administration of propranolol led to no recorded complications.

Conclusions

Although bradycardia and hypotensive events occur early after TBI, low-dose intravenous propranolol does not increase their number or severity. Early use of propranolol after TBI appears to be safe and may be associated with decreased ICU and hospital LOS.

### Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules… [^116xppZT]. FDA (DailyMed) (2015). Low credibility.

In angina pectoris, propranolol generally reduces the oxygen requirement of the heart at any given level of effort by blocking the catecholamine-induced increases in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the velocity and extent of myocardial contraction. Propranolol may increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length, end diastolic pressure, and systolic ejection period. The net physiologic effect of beta-adrenergic blockade is usually advantageous and is manifested during exercise by delayed onset of pain and increased work capacity. Propranolol is highly lipophilic and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. However, it undergoes high first pass metabolism by the liver and on average, only about 25% of propranolol reaches the systemic circulation. Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules release propranolol HCl at a controlled and predictable rate.

Peak blood levels following dosing with propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules occur at about 6 hours. The lower AUCs for the propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules are due to greater hepatic metabolism of propranolol, resulting from the slower rate of absorption of propranolol. Over a twenty-four hour period, blood levels are fairly constant for about twelve hours, then decline exponentially. The apparent plasma half-life is about 10 hours. In a retrospective, uncontrolled study, 107 patients with diastolic blood pressure 110 to 150 mmHg received propranolol 120 mg t. i. d. for at least 6 months, in addition to diuretics and potassium, but with no other hypertensive agent. Propranolol contributed to control of diastolic blood pressure, but the magnitude of the effect of propranolol on blood pressure cannot be ascertained.

Four double-blind, randomized, crossover studies were conducted in a total of 74 patients with mild or moderately severe hypertension treated with propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules 160 mg once daily or propranolol 160 mg given either once daily or in two 80 mg doses. Three of these studies were conducted over a 4-week treatment period. One study was assessed after a 24-hour period. Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules were as effective as propranolol in controlling hypertension in each of these trials.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General

Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules provide propranolol hydrochloride in a sustained-release capsule for administration once daily. If patients are switched from propranolol hydrochloride tablets to propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules, care should be taken to assure that the desired therapeutic effect is maintained. Propranolol hydrochloride extended release capsules should not be considered a simple mg-for-mg substitute for propranolol hydrochloride tablets. Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules has different kinetics and produces lower blood levels. Retitration may be necessary, especially to maintain effectiveness at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval.

Hypertension

The usual initial dosage is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended release capsules once daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased to 120 mg once daily or higher until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 mg to 160 mg once daily. In some instances a dosage of 640 mg may be required. The time needed for full hypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.

Angina Pectoris

Starting with 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended release capsules once daily, dosage should be gradually increased at three-to-seven day intervals until optimal response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond at any dosage level, the average optimal dosage appears to be 160 mg once daily. In angina pectoris, the value and safety of dosage exceeding 320 mg per day have not been established.

If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of a few weeks (see WARNINGS).

Migraine

The initial oral dose is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily. The usual effective dose range is 160 mg to 240 mg once daily. The dosage may be increased gradually to achieve optimal migraine prophylaxis. If a satisfactory response is not obtained within four to six weeks after reaching the maximal dose, propranolol hydrochloride extended- release capsules therapy should be discontinued. It may be advisable to withdraw the drug gradually over a period of several weeks depending on the patient's age, comorbidity, and dose of propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules.

Hypertrophic Subaortic Stenosis

The usual dosage is 80 mg to 160 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release once daily.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective β-blockers for primary hypertension [^1133KeKG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are one of the classes of drugs frequently used to treat hypertension. Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta-blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision making.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta-blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta-blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross-over studies. Overall, nonselective beta-blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta-blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta-blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was -10 mmHg (95% CI -11 to -8) for systolic BP and -7 mmHg (95% CI -8 to -6) for diastolic BP (low-quality evidence). Nonselective beta-blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low-quality evidence). The dose-response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (-2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta-blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).

Authors' Conclusions

In people with mild-to-moderate hypertension, nonselective beta-blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of -10/-7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta-blockers. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non-selective beta-blockers was lower (-8/-5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta-blockers did not show a convincing graded dose-response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta-blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta-blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect. The effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.

Results

Propranolol treatment improves overall survival without significant change in blood pressures in a rat model of sepsis

Survival was increased in Sprague-Dawley rats that received propranolol compared with the non-propranolol treated septic control group following CLP-induced sepsis (log-rank test; P < 0.05) (Figure 1). Overall mortality at seven days was significantly lower in rats that received propranolol compared to rats that received saline (69% survival rate in propranolol rats (11 out of 16) versus 23% survival in control rats (4 out of 17), P < 0.01). Heart rates (Figure 2A) for propranolol-treated rats ranged between 23% to 34% lower than control rats and were significantly lower than control rats at 6, 12 and 24 hours post sepsis onset (P < 0.05). However, the MAP remained stable with no statistical difference between the two groups (Figure 2B).

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^116eUGmN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Hypertension is one of the leading causes of disability and premature deaths worldwide (GBD 2015). The rationale for treating hypertension achieved great impetus with the finding that even small reductions in blood pressure can significantly reduce associated morbidity and mortality risks (Collins 1990; Staessen 2003; Thomopoulos 2015). The major classes of drugs for treating hypertension include beta‐blockers, calcium‐channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, and renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (Wiysonge 2013).

Description of the intervention

Beta‐blockers refer to a diverse group of drugs which block the action of endogenous catecholamines on beta‐adrenergic receptors, part of the autonomic (or sympathetic) nervous system (Wiysonge 2007a). The autonomic nervous system has been known to play a role in blood pressure control since 1949 (Smithwick 1949). The principal adrenergic receptors present in the human cardiovascular system are the β1, β2, and α1 receptors (Fergus 2015; Pucci 2016). Beta‐blockers vary in their β1/β2‐adrenergic receptor selectivity and vasodilatory properties, and this diversity has given rise to their classification into first, second, and third generation. First‐generation beta‐blockers exercise identical affinity for β1 and β2 receptors and are thus classified as non‐selective beta‐blockers (e.g. propranolol). Second‐generation beta‐blockers are more attracted to β1 than β2 receptors, and are thus termed selective beta‐blockers (e.g. atenolol). The third‐generation of beta‐blockers are known for their intrinsic vasodilatory properties (e.g. nebivolol) (Weber 2005).

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^114NbSxd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Proper understanding of the evidence for beta‐blocker therapy in hypertension requires a regularly updated systematic, comprehensive, and appropriate analysis of all currently available data. In 2007, we published a Cochrane Review which re‐assessed the place of beta‐blockers as first‐line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. An update of the review was published in 2012. The current review is an update of the 2012 review.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

Heart failure

Table 6shows the results on heart failure (17 872 episodes), recorded in 64 blood pressure difference trials and 31 drug comparison trials. Heterogeneity existed within the results of the trials of β blockers and heart failure (P = 0.008), explained by the observation that β blockers without cardioselective or α blocking (vasodilatory) properties (propranolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, and sotalol) lacked a preventive effect on heart failure (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to1.35), but β blockers with one or other of these properties had a preventive effect (relative risk 0.77, 0.69 to 0.87; P = 0.01 for difference). Data from trials of the first category of β blockers (seven trials, 385 episodes) were therefore excluded from table 6.

Table 6
Results on heart failure in 64 blood pressure difference trials and 31 drug comparison trials of blood pressure lowering drugs, separately for calcium channel blockers and other drugs

*Relative risk < 1.0 indicates specified drug class reduces risk of heart failure; > 1.0 increases risk.

†All trials totals are less than column totals because one trial had two treated groups sharing same placebo group.

Calcium channel blockers reduced heart failure in the blood pressure difference trials by 19% (P = 0.007), although the drug comparison trials showed that they were statistically significantly less effective in doing so than the other four classes of drugs (relative risk 1.22, 1.10 to 1.35; P < 0.001). Each of the other four classes of drug significantly reduced the incidence of heart failure in the blood pressure difference trials (P < 0.001) by 24% on average, with no significant differences in effect between them either in the blood pressure difference trials or the drug comparison trials. The effect of calcium channel blockers in reducing heart failure in the blood pressure difference trials (19%) was therefore not much less than that of the other classes of drug (24%). The effect of the drugs was similar in primary and secondary prevention (preventing new diagnoses of heart failure and preventing deterioration (hospital admission or death) in people with heart failure).

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^1132AFU2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Because of the variable bioavailability of propranolol, the dose should be individualized based on response.

Hypertension

The usual initial dosage is 40 mg propranolol hydrochloride twice daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Dosage may be increased gradually until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 mg to 240 mg per day. In some instances a dosage of 640 mg a day may be required. The time needed for full antihypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.

While twice-daily dosing is effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, some patients, especially when lower doses are used, may experience a modest rise in blood pressure toward the end of the 12 hour dosing interval. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. If control is not adequate, a larger dose, or 3 times daily therapy may achieve better control.

Angina Pectoris

Total daily doses of 80 mg to 320 mg propranolol hydrochloride, when administered orally, twice a day, three times a day, or four times a day, have been shown to increase exercise tolerance and to reduce ischemic changes in the ECG. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of several weeks (see WARNINGS).

Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose is 10 mg to 30 mg propranolol hydrochloride three or four times daily before meals and at bedtime.

Myocardial Infarction

In the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), the initial dose was 40 mg t.i.d., with titration after 1 month to 60 mg to 80 mg t.i.d. as tolerated. The recommended daily dosage is 180 mg to 240 mg propranolol hydrochloride per day in divided doses. Although a t.i.d. regimen was used in the BHAT and a q.i.d. regimen in the Norwegian Multicenter Trial, there is a reasonable basis for the use of either a t.i.d. or b.i.d. regimen (see PHARMACODYNAMICS AND CLINICAL EFFECTS). The effectiveness and safety of daily dosages greater than 240 mg for prevention of cardiac mortality have not been established. However, higher dosages may be needed to effectively treat coexisting diseases such as angina or hypertension (see above).

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^112y6XDw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

General

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor agonist agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At dosages greater than required for beta-blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of propranolol has not been established. Factors that may contribute to the antihypertensive action include: (1) decreased cardiac output, (2) inhibition of renin release by the kidneys, and (3) diminution of tonic sympathetic nerve outflow from vasomotor centers in the brain. Although total peripheral resistance may increase initially, it readjusts to or below the pretreatment level with chronic use of propranolol. Effects of propranolol on plasma volume appear to be minor and somewhat variable.

In angina pectoris, propranolol generally reduces the oxygen requirement of the heart at any given level of effort by blocking the catecholamine-induced increases in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the velocity and extent of myocardial contraction. Propranolol may increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length, end diastolic pressure, and systolic ejection period. The net physiologic effect of beta-adrenergic blockade is usually advantageous and is manifested during exercise by delayed onset of pain and increased work capacity.

Propranolol exerts its antiarrhythmic effects in concentrations associated with beta-adrenergic blockade, and this appears to be its principal antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. In dosages greater than required for beta-blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

The mechanism of the antimigraine effect of propranolol has not been established. Beta-adrenergic receptors have been demonstrated in the pial vessels of the brain.

The specific mechanism of propranolol's antitremor effects has not been established, but beta-2 (noncardiac) receptors may be involved. A central effect is also possible. Clinical studies have demonstrated that propranolol hydrochloride is of benefit in exaggerated physiological and essential (familial) tremor.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (Propranolol) [^112Gr6Gq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

The usual dose is 1 mg to 3 mg administered under careful monitoring, such as electrocardiographiy and central venous pressure. The rate of administration should not exceed 1 mg (1 mL) per minute to diminish the possibility of lowering blood pressure and causing cardiac standstill.

Sufficient time should be allowed for the drug to reach the site of action even when a slow circulation is present. If necessary, a second dose may be given after two minutes. Thereafter, additional drug should not be given in less than four hours. Additional propranolol hydrochloride should not be given when the desired alteration in rate and/or rhythm is achieved.

Transfer to oral therapy as soon as possible.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of partial agonist beta blocker monotherapy for primary hypertension [^1175vHQ9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Partial agonists are a subclass of beta blockers used to treat hypertension in many countries. Partial agonist act by stimulating beta receptors when they are quiescent and blocking beta receptors when they are active. The blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of partial agonist beta blockers has not been quantified.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of various partial agonists beta blockers on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies must contain a partial agonist monotherapy arm with fixed dose. Patients enrolled into the studies must have primary hypertension at baseline (defined as SBP/DBP > 140/90 mmHg). Duration of studies must be between three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (GW and HB) confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently.

Main Results

Thirteen randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials that examined the blood pressure lowering efficacy of six partial agonists in 605 hypertensive patients were included in this review. Five of the included studies were parallel studies and the other eight were cross-over studies. The overall risk of bias is high in this review due to the small sample size and high risk of detection bias. Pindolol, celiprolol and alprenolol lowered SBP and DBP compared to placebo. Acebutolol lowered SBP but there was no clear evidence that it lowered DBP. There was no clear evidence that pindolol and oxprenolol lowered SBP or DBP. Other than for celiprolol, sample sizes were generally small increasing the uncertainty in findings for individual agents versus placebo. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists (considered as a subclass) lowered peak BP by an average of 8 mmHg systolic (95% CI, -10 to -6, very low quality evidence), 4 mmHg diastolic (95%CI, -5 to -3, very low quality evidence) and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute (95%CI, -6 to -4, very low quality evidence). Higher dose partial agonists did not appear to provide additional BP lowering effects compared to lower dose. The maximum BP lowering effect of the overall subclass occurred at the starting dose. Partial agonists reduced pulse pressure by 4 mmHg (95% CI, -5 to -2, very low evidence). Only one study reported withdrawal due to adverse effects, the risk ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.72 (0.07, 7.67).

Authors' Conclusions

There was very low quality evidence that in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists lowered peak BP by an average of 8/4 mmHg and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute. There was no evidence of a greater effect at doses higher than the initial doses. This estimate was probably exaggerated as it was subject to a high risk of bias. Based on the indirect comparison of the results in this review and two Cochrane reviews on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which also used similar inclusion criteria as this review, the BP lowering effect appeared to be less than the effect in patients with mild to moderate elevated BP who were taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs based on an indirect comparison. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were only reported in one trial so it is impossible to assess the harm of these drugs.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111EyfB8]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — acute management and follow-up — are guided by identifying affected target organs and any precipitating cause, defining the recommended timescale and magnitude of blood pressure (BP) lowering, and selecting the type of BP-lowering treatment; in a hypertensive emergency, intravenous (i.v.) treatment with a drug with a short half-life is ideal with facilities for continuous haemodynamic monitoring. Rapid uncontrolled BP lowering is not recommended as this can lead to complications. Intravenous drug administration is recommended for most hypertension emergencies, but oral therapy with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers is sometimes very effective in malignant hypertension; low initial doses should be used and treatment should take place in hospital. For prognosis and follow-up, we recommend frequent, at least monthly, visits in a specialized setting until the optimal target BP is achieved and long-term specialist follow-up thereafter.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (innoPran XL) [^115QkskJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

INNOPRAN XL is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including beta-blockers.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

INNOPRAN XL is a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^111kygy8]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Key Action Statement 3B — Propranolol dosing for IHs: Clinicians should dose propranolol between 2 and 3 mg/kg per day unless there are comorbidities (eg, PHACE syndrome) or adverse effects (eg, sleep disturbance) that necessitate a lower dose (grade A, moderate recommendation). FDA approval of propranolol hydrochloride oral solution (4.28 mg/mL) recommends a starting dose of 0.6 mg/kg twice daily, with a gradual increase over 2 weeks to a maintenance dose of 1.7 mg/kg twice daily (3.4 mg/kg per day). Other studies typically reported dosing of 2 to 2.5 mg/kg per day, and expert consensus supports a starting dose of 1 mg/kg per day and a target dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day; labeling from the FDA and the European Medicine Evaluation Agency is for twice-daily dosing. For initiation setting, inpatient initiation is favored for infants younger than 8 weeks, those with cardiovascular or respiratory comorbidities, and those with poor social support, while FDA labeling sanctions outpatient initiation for infants > 5 weeks' corrected gestational age.

### Beta-adrenergic blockade for attenuation of catecholamine surge after traumatic brain injury: a randomized pilot trial [^116C34SH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The median dose of PRO required to achieve HR less than 100 was 60 mg/day until day 12 and then increased to 120 mg/day. The max dose administered was 420 mg/day. Overall, 6% of the doses of PRO were held due to bradycardia or hypotension. Individual patients varied for held doses from none (seven patients) up to 40% of doses held (one patient). Only one adverse event was noted during the study period in a PRO group patient. During the withdrawal period of the PRO, rebound tachycardia occurred which resolved by restarting the medication and using a slower taper. No renal or additional cardiac events, hypotension, or other adverse events were related to study drug. Three patients in the control arm received beta-blockers to control hypertension. All three received the doses of beta-blockers for control of hypertension and none of the three had continuous or scheduled doses. No patients in the treatment arm received any additional beta-blockers.

The overall effect of treatment on mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significant with the PRO arm higher (p = 0.021). Values with significant differences are highlighted in figure 2. HR was measured from admission to SD-14 and the overall effect of the treatment was not different between arms (p = 0.143) (figure 3). No overall treatment differences were found for temperature (p = 0.339). No overall treatment differences were found for intra-cranial pressure (ICP).

### For debate: the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines-cause for concern [^116v3Bxa]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

When the beta-blockers became available in about 1965, they were considered a significant breakthrough as they were much more tolerable than the drugs then in use (the adrenergic neuron blockers such as bethanidine or methyldopa). Since then, it has become apparent that the beta-blockers were associated with an insidious onset of lethargy and reduced exercise tolerance. Patients also noticed sleep disturbance. There was also more sexual dysfunction in the beta-blocker arm in both trials. An obvious excess in new diabetes in patients receiving beta-blockers for hypertension control is a significant concern, which may explain their clinical inferiority to CCB and ARBs. Although newer generations of beta-blockers may be safer, clinical trials evidence of their use as first-line agents for hypertension, including those with physiological higher rates, are lacking. Recommending them based on pathophysiological considerations and limited observational studies may put patients at risk.

The 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines argue in favour of beta-blockers that their clinical inferiority was simply to lesser BP reduction achieved in the RCT rather than class effect. BP values were lower throughout the ASCOT-BPLA trial in the amlodipine-based group, with an average difference of 2.7/1.9 mmHg. In the LIFE study, BP fell by 30.2/16.6 mmHg in the losartan and 29.1/16.8 mmHg in the atenolol group (P = 0.017 for SBP, NS for DBP). Even if lesser BP-lowering effects of beta-blockers played a role, this would still be another disadvantage. Every 5 mmHg reduction in SBP reduces major cardiovascular events by 10%, even at normal BP, making undertreatment rather than overtreatment of hypertension a major concern, especially in younger adults.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^111kR9j6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Beta‐blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. They have shown long‐term beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) when used in people with heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. Beta‐blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first‐line therapy for hypertension. However, the benefit of beta‐blockers as first‐line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and updated in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta‐blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.

Search methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to June 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We checked reference lists of relevant reviews, and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review, and also searched the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least one year of duration, which assessed the effects of beta‐blockers compared to placebo or other drugs, as first‐line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity in adults.

Data collection and analysis

We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and conducted fixed‐effect or random‐effects meta‐analyses, as appropriate. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. GRADE classifies the certainty of evidence as high (if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect), moderate (if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect), low (if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect), and very low (if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect).

Main results

Thirteen RCTs met inclusion criteria. They compared beta‐blockers to placebo (4 RCTs, 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 RCTs, 18,241 participants), calcium‐channel blockers (CCBs: 4 RCTs, 44,825 participants), and renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (3 RCTs, 10,828 participants). These RCTs were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias resulting from limitations in study design, conduct, and data analysis. There were 40,245 participants taking beta‐blockers, three‐quarters of them taking atenolol. We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta‐blockers (e.g. nebivolol).

There was no difference in all‐cause mortality between beta‐blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but it was higher for beta‐blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate‐certainty for all comparisons.

Total CVD was lower for beta‐blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97; low‐certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; low‐certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease (CHD: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; moderate‐certainty evidence). The effect of beta‐blockers on CVD was worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.29; moderate‐certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate‐certainty) or RAS inhibitors (low‐certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta‐blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.40; moderate‐certainty evidence) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in CHD between beta‐blockers and diuretics (low‐certainty evidence), CCBs (moderate‐certainty evidence) or RAS inhibitors (low‐certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased CHD incidence compared to diuretics (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta‐blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54; moderate‐certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or CCBs (low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

Most outcome RCTs on beta‐blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta‐blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta‐blockers leads to modest CVD reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta‐blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta‐blockers or whether beta‐blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.

Degree of reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved by beta‐blocker therapy in relation to each comparator treatment

Compared to placebo, first‐line beta‐blockers plus supplementary antihypertensive drugs reduced systolic blood pressure by about 11 mmHg and diastolic blood pressures by about 6 mmHg (Table 6). However, compared to diuretics, CCBs, or RAS inhibitors, the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures at the end of the trials were 0 to 2 mmHg higher in the beta‐blocker group (Table 6).

On the other hand, we confirmed our previous findings that a low dose of propranolol (20 mg) acutely reduced orthostatic tachycardia. 31 Palpitations and total symptom burden tended to improve with propranolol, but unlike our previous studies, 31 these changes did not reach statistical significance compared with placebo. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are not clear, but it seems likely that we would need to study a larger number of patients to detect a statistically significant improvement in symptoms with propranolol alone than what we needed to show the same effect with the combination of propranolol and the binder. It is worth noting, however, that even this low dose of propranolol significantly reduced seated and standing SBP in these patients, similar to our observations in previous studies. 31 We speculate that this small but significant decrease in upright BP partially counteracted its beneficial symptomatic benefit. In support of this, several studies have shown that the dynamic and static regulation of cerebral blood flow during orthostasis is less effective in POTS patients compared with healthy controls, resulting in lower cerebral blood flow velocity despite normal BP and greater variability in cerebral blood flow velocity that is nearly perfectly synchronous with the oscillations in upright BP. 46, 47, 48 This is consistent with our finding that patients with lower standing SBP with propranolol had a higher total symptom burden. More important, the addition of abdominal compression to propranolol prevented the decrease in upright BP induced by propranolol, and significantly improved total symptom burden, even though this combination did not provide a greater improvement in orthostatic tachycardia than that afforded by propranolol alone.

In a series of 450 patients with mild essential hypertension, propranolol alone, propranolol plus hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol plus hydralazine, and propranolol plus hydrochlorothiazide plus hydralazine were compared to reserpine plus hydrochlorothiazide. Comparison was based on reduction of diastolic blood pressures to below 90 mm Hg and at least 5 mm Hg less than initial BP after six months of treatment. This was achieved in 92% of patients who received P+T+H, 88% taking R+T, 81% receiving P+T, 72% on P+H and 52% taking P alone. The number of drop-outs, morbid events, and terminating side effects were insignificantly different among the various regimens. In this study, P and P+H were less effective, while P+T and P+T+H were as effective as the standard regimen. Propranolol in the Treatment of Essential Hypertension. JAMA. 1977; 237: 2303–2310.

### Quinapril hydrochloride (Accupril) [^112JQj9q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension:

Single doses of 20 mg of ACCUPRIL provide over 80% inhibition of plasma ACE for 24 hours. Inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I is shorter-lived, with a 20 mg dose giving 75% inhibition for about 4 hours, 50% inhibition for about 8 hours, and 20% inhibition at 24 hours. With chronic dosing, however, there is substantial inhibition of angiotensin II levels at 24 hours by doses of 20–80 mg.

Administration of 10 to 80 mg of ACCUPRIL to patients with mild to severe hypertension results in a reduction of sitting and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with minimal effect on heart rate. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS). Antihypertensive activity commences within 1 hour with peak effects usually achieved by 2 to 4 hours after dosing. During chronic therapy, most of the blood pressure lowering effect of a given dose is obtained in 1–2 weeks. In multiple-dose studies, 10–80 mg per day in single or divided doses lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout the dosing interval, with a trough effect of about 5–11/3–7 mm Hg. The trough effect represents about 50% of the peak effect. While the dose-response relationship is relatively flat, doses of 40–80 mg were somewhat more effective at trough than 10–20 mg, and twice daily dosing tended to give a somewhat lower trough blood pressure than once daily dosing with the same total dose. The antihypertensive effect of ACCUPRIL continues during long-term therapy, with no evidence of loss of effectiveness.

Hemodynamic assessments in patients with hypertension indicate that blood pressure reduction produced by quinapril is accompanied by a reduction in total peripheral resistance and renal vascular resistance with little or no change in heart rate, cardiac index, renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, or filtration fraction.

Use of ACCUPRIL with a thiazide diuretic gives a blood-pressure lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone.

In patients with hypertension, ACCUPRIL 10–40 mg was similar in effectiveness to captopril, enalapril, propranolol, and thiazide diuretics.

Therapeutic effects appear to be the same for elderly (≥ 65 years of age) and younger adult patients given the same daily dosages, with no increase in adverse events in elderly patients.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (Propranolol) [^116Ff1hX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS:

General

Propranolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. Propranolol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade can cause reduction of intraocular pressure. Patients should be told that propranolol might interfere with the glaucoma screening test. Withdrawal may lead to a return of intraocular pressure.

Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.

Angina Pectoris

There have been reports of exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction, following abrupt discontinuance of propranolol therapy. Therefore, when discontinuance of propranolol is planned, the dosage should be gradually reduced over at least a few weeks, and the patient should be cautioned against interruption or cessation of therapy without a physician's advice. If propranolol therapy is interrupted and exacerbation of angina occurs, it is usually advisable to reinstitute propranolol therapy and take other measures appropriate for the management of angina pectoris. Since coronary artery disease may be unrecognized, it may be prudent to follow the above advice in patients considered at risk of having occult atherosclerotic heart disease who are given propranolol for other indications.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^114NLoZQ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of systolic blood pressure lowering of β-adrenergic blockade as monotherapy in uncomplicated essential hypertension is not significantly different from placebo in patients of African ancestry, and some trials report significant placebo corrected increase in blood pressure with β-adrenergic blockade in this population group The main side effects are metabolic, including higher glucose levels.

Environmental factors

To our knowledge, there are no environmental factors reported that may help explain the attenuated blood pressure lowering response of patients of African ancestry to β-adrenergic blockade. In the TAIM study, adding sodium restriction (mean 100 mmol/day) to an atenolol regimen (usual/sodium restricted diet: atenolol n = 22/29; placebo n = 26/19) did not enhance the blood pressure lowering effect.

Pharmacokinetics

Studies on the differences in the pharmacokinetics of β-adrenergic blockers based on ancestry yielded heterogeneous results. Oral clearance of L-propranolol was reported to be similar, or higher in persons of African, than in persons of European, ancestry (respectively 28 ml/min/kg, SD 8; vs 21, SD 7; P < 0.05), with similar, or up to 25% lower peak plasma concentrations. In line with this, hepatic metabolism of propranolol via side chain oxidation, 4-hydroxylation or R-propranolol glucuronidation was observed to be higher in persons of African than in those of European ancestry. However, propranolol clearance after intravenous infusion (0.1 mg/kg), was similar in one study. On the other hand, around 30% higher plasma concentrations were found after 100 mg oral metoprolol in an indirect comparison between subjects of African vs European ancestry, respectively 154 ng/ml vs 117 at t = 3 h, while others observed no significant differences in plasma peak plasma concentrations or systemic clearance. Also, metabolism of metoprolol via CYP2D6 assessed with an oral dose of 200 mg, given to men of African and European ancestry (10 in each group) was not significantly different. Finally, pharmacokinetic studies of pindolol yielded similar results in both groups.

### Propranolol kinetics in plasma from severely burned adults [^114Nv8t6]. Burns (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate propranolol dosing strategy for reducing heart rate in severely burned adults.

Methods

A total of 26 patients (≥ 18 years) with burns covering ≥ 30% of the total body surface area were included in this IRB-approved study. Plasma propranolol concentrations were determined in a placebo group (n = 10) or following one of three dosing strategies: Q6 (n = 4), Q8 (n = 6), and Q24 (n = 6). Blood was collected just before dosing and at regular intervals over two dosing periods with corresponding heart rate and blood pressure recordings. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by the appropriate post-hoc test.

Results

Heart rate was 86 ± 2 bpm for Q6, 93 ± 3 bpm for Q8, and 90 ± 4 bpm for Q24. The Q8 group had a significantly higher heart rate than the Q6 group (p = 0.0001). Plasma propranolol concentrations were significantly higher in the Q6 dosing strategy than in the Q8 dosing strategy (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Heart rate can be decreased to a similar degree with Q6 and Q24 dosing strategies, with the Q8 dosing strategy being less effective. Q6 dosing is recommended to maintain reduced heart rate throughout dosing periods.

### The safety and efficacy of propranolol in reducing the hypermetabolic response in the pediatric burn population [^112qwsMk]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pediatric burn patients often have hypertension and tachycardia for several years post-injury. Propranolol has shown to be effective in treating the hypermetabolic state secondary to a major burn injury. This study was conducted to document a safe and effective dosing regimen for three different age groups. One hundred four burn-injured children with a 30% to 92% total body surface area burn were treated for 1 to 2 years with propranolol in the outpatient setting. Guardians of the patients were instructed on how to take and monitor the systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and document their vital signs several times a day. The documentation was reviewed with the guardian and patient, and based on age-specific vital sign parameters, propranolol dosing adjustment was done to measure at least 15% to 20% reduction in admission heart rate. Mean doses for the age groups were as follows: 0 to 3 years 5.2 ± 2.8 mg/kg/day, 4 to 10 years 4.2 ± 1.8 mg/kg/day, and 11 to 18 years 2.9 ± 1.4 mg/kg/day. The propranolol dose decreased as time post-burn increased. On selected patients, propranolol was stopped due to changes in the heart rate, but at all times, it was safe and effective. No adverse effects were noted. The dosing regimen was not affected by burn size or gender. Propranolol can be safely stopped abruptly with no rebound hypertension. Individuals older than 10 years required a lower dose per kilogram following the burn injury than prepubertal burn survivors. Propranolol proved to be both safe and effective in the management of cardiovascular changes occurring in the hypermetabolic state.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — choice and administration of intravenous (IV) antihypertensive agents: To achieve rapid BP control and avoid large swings in BP, continuous infusion of short-acting titratable antihypertensive agents is often preferable in the intensive care setting. Comparative trial data indicate IV nicardipine is more effective than labetalol in reaching short-term BP target, while clevidipine was shown to induce faster reduction in BP than nicardipine. Selection of an antihypertensive agent should be based on the drug's pharmacology, underlying mechanisms of hypertension, degree of progression of target organ damage, the desirable rate of BP decline, and the presence of comorbidities, and treatment of hypertensive emergencies requires rapid recognition of the condition and knowledge of unique treatment approaches appropriate for the causal condition or emergency consequences.

### Time course for blood pressure lowering of β-blockers with partial agonist activity [^1118JqUw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. We do not know whether the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-blockers varies across the day. This review focuses on the subclass of beta-blockers with partial agonist activity (BBPAA).

Objectives

To assess the degree of variation in hourly BP lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period in adults with essential hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for relevant studies up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5; MEDLINE Ovid; Embase Ovid; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We sought to include all randomised and non-randomised trials that assessed the hourly effect of BBPAA by ambulatory monitoring, with a minimum follow-up of three weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials and extracted the data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Outcomes included in the review were end-point hourly systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR), measured using a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device.

Main Results

Fourteen non-randomised baseline controlled trials of BBPAA met our inclusion criteria, but only seven studies, involving 121 participants, reported hourly ambulatory BP data that could be included in the meta-analysis. Beta-blockers studied included acebutalol, pindolol and bopindolol. We judged most studies at high or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. We judged the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low for all outcomes. We analysed and presented data by each hour post-dose. Very low-certainty evidence showed that hourly mean reduction in BP and HR visually showed an attenuation over time. Over the 24-hour period, the magnitude of SBP lowering at each hour ranged from -3.68 mmHg to -17.74 mmHg (7 studies, 121 participants), DBP lowering at each hour ranged from -2.27 mmHg to -9.34 mmHg (7 studies, 121 participants), and HR lowering at each hour ranged from -0.29 beats/min to -10.29 beats/min (4 studies, 71 participants). When comparing between three 8-hourly time intervals that correspond to day, evening, and night time hours, BBPAA was less effective at lowering BP and HR at night, than during the day and evening. However, because we judged that these outcomes were supported by very low-certainty evidence, further research is likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and may change the conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw general conclusions about the degree of variation in hourly BP-lowering efficacy of BBPAA over a 24-hour period, in adults with essential hypertension. Very low-certainty evidence showed that BBPAA acebutalol, pindolol, and bopindolol lowered BP more during the day and evening than at night. However, the number of studies and participants included in this review was very small, further limiting the certainty of the evidence. We need further and larger trials, with accurate recording of time of drug intake, and with reporting of standard deviation of BP and HR at each hour.

Consider initiating pharmacotherapy with propranolol (40 mg BID, titrate dose to the maximum tolerated or once HR of 50–55 bpm is reached to a maximum dose of 320 mg) as first-line primary prophylaxis. Offer variceal band ligation if nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated.

### Hypertension management 2011: optimal combination therapy [^114CD6yS]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Raised levels of blood pressure result from the complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors. The complexity of blood pressure control mechanisms has major implications for individual responsiveness to antihypertensive drugs. The underlying haemodynamic disorder in the majority of cases is a rise in peripheral vascular resistance. This observation led to the discovery and development of increasingly sophisticated and targeted vasodilators, although many of the earlier antihypertensive drugs, by virtue of their actions blocking the sympathetic nervous system, had a vasodilator component to their mode of action. A recent meta-analysis of placebo controlled trials of monotherapy in unselected hypertensives, reports average (placebo-corrected) blood pressure responses to single agents of 9.1 mmHg systolic and 5.5 mmHg diastolic pressure. These average values disguise the extremely wide ranging responses in individuals across a fall of 20–30 mmHg systolic at one extreme, to no effect at all, or even a small rise in blood pressure at the other. The second factor determining individual responses to monotherapy is the extent to which initial falls in pressure are opposed by reflex responses in counter regulatory mechanisms that are activated following the blood pressure reduction. Thus, a satisfactory blood pressure response is rarely reached with monotherapy alone. What then is the next step if blood pressure is not a goal after the patient has been treated with monotherapy for a few weeks? Should you uptitrate, substitute or combine?

Table 26 — Intravenous antihypertensive drugs for hypertensive emergencies (direct vasodilator and adrenergic blockers): Hydralazine is given initial 10 mg via slow intravenous (IV) infusion (maximum initial dose 20 mg); repeat every 4–6 h as needed and adjust rate up to total cumulative dose of 200 mg/24 h; BP begins to decrease within 10–30 min and the fall lasts 2–4 h, and it is an undesirable first-line agent for acute treatment in most patients due to unpredictability of response and prolonged duration of action. Esmolol uses a loading dose 500–1000 mcg/kg/min over 1 min followed by a 50-mcg/kg/min infusion, with repeated bolus and 50-mcg/kg/min infusion increases as needed to a maximum of 300 mcg/kg/min; it is contraindicated with concurrent beta-blocker therapy, bradycardia, or decompensated heart failure (HF), requires monitoring for bradycardia, and higher doses may block beta-2 receptors and impact lung function in reactive airway and obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal) [^113gBNs2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of propranolol has not been established. Among the factors that may be involved in contributing to the antihypertensive action include: (1) decreased cardiac output, (2) inhibition of renin release by the kidneys, and (3) diminution of tonic sympathetic nerve outflow from vasomotor centers in the brain. Although total peripheral resistance may increase initially, it readjusts to or below the pretreatment level with chronic use of propranolol. Effects of propranolol on plasma volume appear to be minor and somewhat variable.

In angina pectoris, propranolol generally reduces the oxygen requirement of the heart at any given level of effort by blocking the catecholamine-induced increases in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the velocity and extent of myocardial contraction. Propranolol may increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length, end diastolic pressure, and systolic ejection period. The net physiologic effect of beta-adrenergic blockade is usually advantageous and is manifested during exercise by delayed onset of pain and increased work capacity.

Propranolol exerts its antiarrhythmic effects in concentrations associated with beta-adrenergic blockade, and this appears to be its principal antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. In dosages greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

The mechanism of the anti-migraine effect of propranolol has not been established. Beta-adrenergic receptors have been demonstrated in the pial vessels of the brain.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of β-1 selective beta blockers for primary hypertension [^112Y12zp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Beta blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension. The blood pressure reading is the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess the efficacy of the treatment. The blood pressure lowering effect of beta-1 selective blockers is not known.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. We searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (All years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years to 15 October 2015). The Hypertension Group Specialised Register includes controlled trials from searches of CAB Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA), Global Health, LILACS, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomized trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity-maximizing version (2008 revision) with selected MeSH terms and free text terms. No language restrictions were used. The MEDLINE search strategy was translated into CENTRAL, EMBASE, the Hypertension Group Specialised Register and ClinicalTrials.gov using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable. Full strategies are in Appendix 1.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a beta blocker monotherapy arm with fixed dose. People enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between 3 weeks to 12 weeks. Drugs in this class of beta blockers are atenolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, metoprolol, nebivolol, pafenolol, practolol.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3.5 was used to synthesise data.

Main Results

We identified 56 RCTs (randomised controlled trials) that examined the blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective blockers (beta-1 blocker) in 7812 primary hypertensive patients. Among the included trials, 26 RCTs were parallel studies and 30 RCTs were cross-over studies, examining eight beta-1 blockers. Overall, the majority of beta-1 blockers studied significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The maximum BP reduction of beta-1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose. Individual beta-1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose-response effect on SBP and DBP over the recommended dose range. Most beta-1 blockers tested significantly lowered heart rate. A graded dose-response of beta-1 blockers on heart rate was evident. Higher dose beta-1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses. Individually and overall beta-1 blockers did not affect pulse pressure, which distinguishes them from other classes of drugs.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides low quality evidence that in people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute as compared to placebo. The effect of beta-1 blockers at peak hours, -12/-9 mmHg, was greater than the reduction at trough hours, -8/-7 mmHg. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude than dual receptor beta-blockers and partial agonist beta-blockers, lowered BP similarly to nonselective beta-blockers. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered SBP by a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Because DBP is lowered by a similar extent to SBP, beta-1 selective blockers do not reduce pulse pressure.

### Propranolol (propranolol hydrochloride) [^1169Kro7]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

PHARMACODYNAMICS AND CLINICAL EFFECTS

Hypertension

In a retrospective, uncontrolled study, 107 patients with diastolic blood pressure 110 to 150 mmHg received propranolol 120 mg t.i.d. for at least 6 months, in addition to diuretics and potassium, but with no other hypertensive agent. Propranolol contributed to control of diastolic blood pressure, but the magnitude of the effect of propranolol on blood pressure cannot be ascertained.

Four double-blind, randomized, crossover studies were conducted in a total of 74 patients with mild or moderately severe hypertension treated with propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules 160 mg once daily or propranolol 160 mg given either once daily or in two 80 mg doses. Three of these studies were conducted over a 4-week treatment period. One study was assessed after a 24-hour period. Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules was as effective as propranolol in controlling hypertension (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in each of these trials.

Angina Pectoris

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 32 patients of both sexes, aged 32 to 69 years, with stable angina, propranolol 100 mg t.i.d. was administered for 4 weeks and shown to be more effective than placebo in reducing the rate of angina episodes and in prolonging total exercise time.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults aged 18 to 59 years [^116gxaYu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and renal failure. The main goal of treatment is to reduce these events. Systematic reviews have shown proven benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but most of the evidence is in people 60 years of age and older. We wanted to know what the effects of therapy are in people 18 to 59 years of age.

Objectives

To quantify antihypertensive drug effects on all-cause mortality in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension. To quantify effects on cardiovascular mortality plus morbidity (including cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease mortality plus morbidity), withdrawal due adverse events and estimate magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lowering at one year.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to January 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year' duration comparing antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with a placebo or no treatment in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension defined as SBP 140 mmHg or greater or DBP 90 mmHg or greater at baseline, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular (CVS) mortality plus morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse events, and decrease in SBP and DBP. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and a fixed-effect model to combine outcomes across trials. For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD) with 95% CI and a random-effects model as there was significant heterogeneity.

Main Results

The population in the seven included studies (17,327 participants) were predominantly healthy adults with mild to moderate primary hypertension. The Medical Research Council Trial of Mild Hypertension contributed 14,541 (84%) of total randomized participants, with mean age of 50 years and mean baseline blood pressure of 160/98 mmHg and a mean duration of follow-up of five years. Treatments used in this study were bendrofluazide 10 mg daily or propranolol 80 mg to 240 mg daily with addition of methyldopa if required. The risk of bias in the studies was high or unclear for a number of domains and led us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes. Based on five studies, antihypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or untreated control may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality (2.4% with control vs 2.3% with treatment; low quality evidence; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.13). Based on 4 studies, the effects on coronary heart disease were uncertain due to low quality evidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.19). Low quality evidence from six studies showed that drug therapy may reduce total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity from 4.1% to 3.2% over five years (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91) due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (1.3% with control vs 0.6% with treatment; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64). Very low quality evidence from three studies showed that withdrawals due to adverse events were higher with drug therapy from 0.7% to 3.0% (RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.67 to 13.92). The effects on blood pressure varied between the studies and we are uncertain as to how much of a difference treatment makes on average.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihypertensive drugs used to treat predominantly healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension have a small absolute effect to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity primarily due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. All-cause mortality and coronary heart disease were not reduced. There is lack of good evidence on withdrawal due to adverse events. Future trials in this age group should be at least 10 years in duration and should compare different first-line drug classes and strategies.

### Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline (CPIC) for CYP2D6, ADRB1, ADRB2, ADRA2C, GRK4, and GRK5 genotypes and beta-blocker therapy [^1135zKUi]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

CYP2D6 appears to play a major role in the hepatic metabolism and elimination of several beta‐blockers, most notably, metoprolol, carvedilol, nebivolol, and propranolol (Table S1). CYP2D6 poor metabolizers can experience several‐fold higher plasma metoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol concentrations following oral administration, compared with those who are not poor metabolizers. Insufficient evidence exists to indicate whether propranolol systemic exposure is similarly increased in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The greatest magnitude of pharmacogenetic effects, coupled with the most extensive pharmacokinetic data, relate to metoprolol, which is metabolized by CYP2D6 to mostly inactive metabolites. Compared with CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, poor metabolizers given the same dose of metoprolol experience more than a two‐fold longer elimination half‐life, with a nearly five‐fold increase in area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC). Of note, beta‐blockers exhibit a sigmoid dose–response relationship. Thus, increasing beta‐blocker plasma concentrations beyond a certain threshold does not result in further increases in drug response.

Despite the observed pharmacokinetic differences in the above‐listed beta‐blockers, CYP2D6 genotype‐associated differences in clinical response have only been consistently reported for metoprolol — primarily related to heart rate and blood pressure response. Evidence suggests that the markedly increased metoprolol exposure experienced by CYP2D6 poor metabolizers also leads to a greater metoprolol‐associated decrease in blood pressure (approximately 3–6 mmHg systolic; 2–6 mmHg diastolic) and heart rate (approximately 3–8 beats/min). This exaggerated heart rate response to metoprolol in poor metabolizers may increase the risk of bradycardia, but few well‐powered studies have assessed this risk. Given that beta‐blockers are often started at low doses and titrated up based on response (usually as indicated by heart rate and blood pressure), the risk of bradycardia is less likely to occur than if beta‐blockers were initially prescribed at target doses for guideline‐directed therapy. Thus, additional caution in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers may be warranted in circumstances where metoprolol dosing may not undergo up‐titration.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal) [^114a8fn8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General

Inderal LA provides propranolol hydrochloride in a sustained-release capsule for administration once daily. If patients are switched from Inderal Tablets to Inderal LA Capsules, care should be taken to assure that the desired therapeutic effect is maintained. Inderal LA should not be considered a simple mg-for-mg substitute for Inderal. Inderal LA has different kinetics and produces lower blood levels. Retitration may be necessary, especially to maintain effectiveness at the end of the 24-hour dosing interval.

Hypertension

The usual initial dosage is 80 mg Inderal LA once daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased to 120 mg once daily or higher until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 to 160 mg once daily. In some instances a dosage of 640 mg may be required. The time needed for full hypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.

Angina Pectoris

Starting with 80 mg Inderal LA once daily, dosage should be gradually increased at three- to seven-day intervals until optimal response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond at any dosage level, the average optimal dosage appears to be 160 mg once daily. In angina pectoris, the value and safety of dosage exceeding 320 mg per day have not been established.

If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of a few weeks (see " WARNINGS ").

Migraine

The initial oral dose is 80 mg Inderal LA once daily. The usual effective dose range is 160 to 240 mg once daily. The dosage may be increased gradually to achieve optimal migraine prophylaxis. If a satisfactory response is not obtained within four to six weeks after reaching the maximal dose, Inderal LA therapy should be discontinued. It may be advisable to withdraw the drug gradually over a period of several weeks depending on the patient's age, comorbidity, and dose of Inderal LA.

Hypertrophic Subaortic Stenosis

The usual dosage is 80 to 160 mg Inderal LA once daily.

### Cochrane corner: β-blockers for hypertension [^111JS4NN]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers refer to an assorted group of medications that block the action of endogenous catecholamines on beta-adrenergic receptors. The β1 and β2 receptors are the primary beta-adrenergic receptors in the human cardiovascular system. Beta-blockers differ in their β1/β2-receptor selectivity and vasodilatory properties. Based on this diversity, beta-blockers have been categorised into first, second and third generation. First-generation beta-blockers, also referred to as non-selective blockers, possess equal affinity for β1 and β2 receptors. Second-generation (or selective) beta-blockers exercise more affinity for β1 than β2 receptors. Neither of these traditional beta-blockers has vasodilatory properties, which is an intrinsic characteristic of third-generation beta-blockers.

Beta-blockers have been known to play a role in blood pressure control since 1949. We summarise the findings of a Cochrane Review we published in 2017 on the comparative effects of beta-blockers as initial treatment for hypertension. This is an update of a review we first published 10 years ago.

Concise methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov using a comprehensive database-specific search string and checked reference lists of relevant publications, up to June 2016. We selected randomised trials with a duration of at least 12 months, which assessed the effects of beta-blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension, compared with placebo or other antihypertensive drugs. Eligible studies had to report one or more of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular death and cardiovascular events (ie, coronary heart disease, strokes and heart failure). We used standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies, assess risk of bias, extract and analyse data and assess the certainty of the evidence.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^115qo1Yn]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

The attenuated response of persons of African ancestry to β-adrenergic blockers was extensively studied. As renin lowering contributes to the antihypertensive effect of β-adrenergic blockers, these drugs were expected to be less effective in subjects of African ancestry. Indeed, renin correlated with the blood pressure lowering response to atenolol 50 to 100 mg/d in a study including 67 subjects (33 of African ancestry). However, renin did not predict the response to propranolol (80 to 640 mg/d) in 215 participants (132 of African ancestry) of a Veterans Administration study. The relative contribution of renin vs African ancestry (β ± SE) was calculated in multivariable regression analysis, to be respectively −4.05 ± 0.84 vs −7.45 ± 1.53; both P < 0.01. Finally, in a study of 335 subjects (152 of African ancestry), therapeutic responses to atenolol 25 to 100 mg were consistent with a baseline renin profile, but age-ancestry subgroup profiling was a better predictor of response.

β-blockers are thought to lower blood pressure predominantly through a reduction in cardiac contractility and heart rate. While early studies found a reduced sensitivity to isoprenaline in healthy men of African ancestry, reports on changes in heart rate after β-blockers in healthy volunteers were conflicting, with either a greater response in persons of African ancestry (to oral propranolol 240 mg/d); an attenuated response (to intravenous propranolol up to 0.15 mg/kg, or metoprolol 50 μg/mL); or no significant difference between groups (to intravenous propranolol 0.15 mg/kg). We retrieved no studies in hypertensives.

Pharmacogenomic studies focussed on the frequency of occurrence of the responsive β1-receptor (ADRB1) genotype Arg 389/Ser 49 in persons of African ancestry, which was associated with greater blood pressure lowering responses to β-adrenergic blockade in other population subgroups.

### Atenolol [^114HaNBc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Atenolol is a beta1-selective (cardioselective) beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent without membrane stabilizing or intrinsic sympathomimetic (partial agonist) activities. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher doses, atenolol inhibits beta2-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

In man, absorption of an oral dose is rapid and consistent but incomplete. Approximately 50% of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the remainder being excreted unchanged in the feces. Peak blood levels are reached between two (2) and four (4) hours after ingestion. Unlike propranolol or metoprolol, but like nadolol, atenolol undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver, and the absorbed portion is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Over 85% of an intravenous dose is excreted in urine within 24 hours compared with approximately 50% for an oral dose. Atenolol also differs from propranolol in that only a small amount (6% to 16%) is bound to proteins in the plasma. This kinetic profile results in relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about a 4-fold interpatient variation.

The elimination half-life of oral atenolol is approximately 6 to 7 hours, and there is no alteration of the kinetic profile of the drug by chronic administration. Following intravenous administration, peak plasma levels are reached within 5 minutes. Declines from peak levels are rapid (5- to 10-fold) during the first 7 hours; thereafter, plasma levels decay with a half-life similar to that of orally administered drug. Following oral doses of 50 mg or 100 mg, both beta-blocking and antihypertensive effects persist for at least 24 hours. When renal function is impaired, elimination of atenolol is closely related to the glomerular filtration rate; significant accumulation occurs when the creatinine clearance falls below 35 mL/min/1.73m2. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

### Propranolol (propranolol hydrochloride) [^115gdENb]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

General

Propranolol is a nonselective, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulating agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At dosages greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules should not be considered a simple mg-for-mg substitute for conventional propranolol and the blood levels achieved do not match (are lower than) those of two to four times daily dosing with the same dose (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). When changing to propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules from conventional propranolol, a possible need for retitration upwards should be considered, especially to maintain effectiveness at the end of the dosing interval. In most clinical settings, however, such as hypertension or angina where there is little correlation between plasma levels and clinical effect, propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules has been therapeutically equivalent to the same mg dose of conventional propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules as assessed by 24-hour effects on blood pressure and on 24-hour exercise responses of heart rate, systolic pressure, and rate pressure product.

### Splanchnic venous compression enhances the effects of ß-blockade in the treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome [^116d631h]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Splanchnic venous pooling induced by upright posture triggers a compensatory increase in heart rate, a response that is exaggerated in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome. To assess whether abdominal compression attenuates orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms, 18 postural tachycardia syndrome patients (32 ± 2 years) were randomized to receive either abdominal compression (40 mm Hg applied with an inflatable binder ≈2 minutes before standing) or propranolol (20 mg) in a placebo‐controlled, crossover study.

Methods and Results

Systolic blood pressure, and symptoms were assessed while seated and standing, before and 2 hours postdrug. As expected, propranolol decreased standingcompared with placebo (81 ± 2 versus 98 ± 4 beats per minute; P < 0.001) and was associated with lower standing systolic blood pressure (93 ± 2 versus 100 ± 2 mm Hg for placebo; P = 0.002). Compression had no effect on standing(96 ± 4 beats per minute) but increased standing systolic blood pressure compared with placebo and propranolol (106 ± 2 mm Hg; P < 0.01). Neither propranolol nor compression improved symptoms compared with placebo. In 16 patients we compared the combination of abdominal compression and propranolol with propranolol alone. The combination had no additional effect on standing(81 ± 2 beats per minute for both interventions) but prevented the decrease in standing systolic blood pressure produced by propranolol (98 ± 2 versus 93 ± 2 mm Hg for propranolol; P = 0.029), and significantly improved total symptom burden (−6 ± 2 versus −1 ± 2 for propranolol; P = 0.041).

Conclusions

Splanchnic venous compression alone did not improveor symptoms but prevented the blood pressure decrease produced by propranolol. The combination was more effective in improving symptoms than either alone. Splanchnic venous compression can be a useful adjuvant therapy to propranolol in postural tachycardia syndrome.

### Propranolol hydrochloride (inderal XL) [^117RAtVX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

INDERAL XL is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including beta-blockers.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

INDERAL XL is a beta adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)
