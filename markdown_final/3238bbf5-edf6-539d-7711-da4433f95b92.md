## Question

Lumbar Interdiscal Disease ICD code

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ICD-10-CM code for "lumbar interdiscal disease". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "interdiscal disease" actually means clinically and how it maps to ICD-10-CM terminology. Then, I should verify the most specific ICD-10-CM codes for lumbar disc disorders, including degeneration, herniation, and discogenic pain. Next, I will check for any recently added codes that specifically denote discogenic pain. After that, I should consider coding nuances like laterality and whether pain is mentioned. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with examples and caveats about documentation and coding accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Interdiscal disease" is not a standard ICD-10-CM phrase; it generally refers to disorders of the intervertebral disc, which in ICD-10-CM are categorized under M51, "Thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral intervertebral disc disorders", with subcategories for degeneration, displacement (herniation), and other specified disc disorders, so I need to ensure I'm mapping the clinical intent to the correct M51 subcategory rather than assuming a single catch-all code [^d0d01eb9].

> I will now examine the most specific lumbar degeneration code. Wait, let me verify the exact alphanumeric string: for lumbar or lumbosacral disc degeneration without mention of back or leg pain, the code is M51.37, and within that, M51.379 denotes "other intervertebral disc degeneration, lumbosacral region, without mention of lumbar back pain or lower extremity pain", which fits when the diagnosis is degenerative disc disease without symptom localization in the record [^d0d01eb9].

> Next, I should review codes for lumbar disc herniation. Hold on, I should verify the radiculopathy variant: M51.1 is the parent code for "intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy", and for the lumbar region this is typically M51.16, though the exact subdigit depends on the specific lumbar level and laterality; if radiculopathy is not specified, M51.2 covers other specified intervertebral disc displacement, so I need to match the clinical detail to M51.1 versus M51.2 and document the level when possible [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is specifically about discogenic pain rather than generic degeneration or herniation. I should double-check whether there are newer codes for discogenic pain: yes, recent updates introduced M51.360–M51.379 for lumbosacral discogenic pain associated with degenerative disc disease, so if the provider documents discogenic pain, I should use one of those M51.36–M51.37 codes rather than M51.379, which excludes pain mentions, to capture the pain generator accurately [^7f97aecc] [^8634e8c7].

> Let me consider related lumbar diagnoses that often accompany or are conflated with "interdiscal disease". Lumbar radiculopathy is coded as M54.16, lumbar spinal stenosis as M48.06, and degenerative spondylolisthesis as M43.16; I need to ensure I don't substitute these for a disc disorder code unless the clinical documentation supports them as primary or contributory diagnoses, because misclassification can affect both care pathways and claims validity [^notfound].

> I should confirm coding mechanics and documentation requirements. ICD-10-CM coding for lumbar disc disorders requires attention to region, laterality, and whether pain is mentioned; for example, M51.379 explicitly excludes mention of lumbar back pain or lower extremity pain, so if pain is documented, I should avoid M51.379 and instead use a code that includes pain or the specific discogenic pain series, and I should document the precise level when known to support the most specific code [^d0d01eb9] [^7f97aecc].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer matches the clinical scenario. If the intent is "lumbar degenerative disc disease without pain specification", the most accurate ICD-10-CM code is M51.379; if the intent is "lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy", the appropriate code is M51.16 (with level/laterality detail as documented); if the intent is "lumbar discogenic pain due to degenerative disc disease", I should select from M51.360–M51.379 based on documented pain and level, recognizing that M51.379 would be incorrect if pain is mentioned in the record [^d0d01eb9] [^7f97aecc].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for lumbar interdiscal disease is **M51.37** (Other intervertebral disc degeneration, lumbosacral region) [^d0d01eb9]. Use **M51.37** for degenerative disc disease without radiculopathy, and add a secondary code (e.g. M54.5) if pain is present. For lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, use **M51.16** (Intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy, lumbar region). Accurate coding requires documentation of the specific pathology and symptoms to support medical necessity [^b67e8c24].

## ICD-10-CM codes for lumbar interdiscal disease

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** | **Clinical indication** |
|-|-|-|
| M51.37 | Other intervertebral disc degeneration, lumbosacral region | Degenerative disc disease without radiculopathy |
| M51.16 | Intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy, lumbar region | Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy |
| M51.26 | Other intervertebral disc displacement, lumbar region | Lumbar disc displacement without radiculopathy |
| M51.36 | Intervertebral disc degeneration with discogenic pain, lumbosacral region | Discogenic pain due to degenerative disc disease |

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on **detailed clinical documentation** that specifies:

- **Anatomical location**: Lumbar region (L1-L5) or lumbosacral region (L5-S1).
- **Pathology**: Degeneration, herniation, displacement, or discogenic pain.
- **Symptoms**: Presence or absence of radiculopathy or axial pain.
- **Laterality**: Left, right, or bilateral involvement.

---

## Common coding errors and how to avoid them

- **Incorrect code selection**: Using M51.37 for herniation with radiculopathy; use M51.16 instead.
- **Lack of specificity**: Document the exact lumbar level and laterality when possible.
- **Omission of symptoms**: Always document pain or neurological symptoms to justify the diagnosis.

---

## Clinical implications of accurate coding

Accurate coding ensures **appropriate reimbursement**, supports **evidence-based care**, and enables **effective tracking** of outcomes and epidemiology. It also reduces claim denials and supports quality reporting.

---

## Recent updates and changes

Recent ICD-10-CM updates have added **specific codes for discogenic pain** (M51.36–M51.379) [^7f97aecc], emphasizing the distinction between discogenic and vertebrogenic pain [^8634e8c7]. These changes improve diagnostic precision and guide targeted therapies.

---

The ICD-10-CM code for lumbar interdiscal disease is **M51.37** for degeneration without radiculopathy, with M51.16 for herniation with radiculopathy. Accurate coding depends on detailed documentation of anatomy, pathology, and symptoms, and supports optimal care, reimbursement, and research.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^8634e8c7]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recent issuance of specific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for lumbosacral discogenic pain associated with degenerative disc disease by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) underscores the importance of developing a clinical algorithm to enhance our ability to precisely diagnose and effectively treat patients suffering from discogenic low back pain. Recognition of discogenic pain as a unique source of back pain represents the culmination of decades of extensive basic science and clinical research on the degeneration of the intervertebral disc and its role in precipitating widespread degenerative changes across the entire spinal motion segment.

As our understanding of the sources and anatomical structures that contribute to chronic low back pain has evolved, estimates of the prevalence of patients suffering from pain emanating principally from the anterior column of the spine has expanded to include as many as 70% of the cases of low back pain. Indeed, anterior column pain has been differentiated further to involve not only the intervertebral disc but additionally the vertebral endplates. Due to their anatomical intimacy, it is recognized that there exists substantial pathoetiological interdependence of these structures in pain generation.

Using an approach that integrates expertise in musculoskeletal imaging, interventional pain management, and spine surgery, we developed a pragmatic discogenic pain clinical algorithm to improve diagnostic efficiency and maximize clinical benefit. Successful implementation of this algorithm is optimized by utilizing a team approach to back pain management that can effectively address and personalize the myriad diagnostic and treatment options available to the patient throughout their continuum of care.

### Surgeon input can increase the value of registry data: early experience from the American spine registry [^e91f7a84]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clear diagnostic delineation is necessary for the development of a strong evidence base in lumbar spinal surgery. Experience with existing national databases suggests that International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) coding is insufficient to support that need. The purpose of this study was to assess agreement between surgeon-specified diagnostic indication and hospital-reported ICD-10 codes for lumbar spine surgery.

Methods

Data collection for the American Spine Registry (ASR) includes an option to denote the surgeon's specific diagnostic indication for each procedure. For cases treated between January 2020 and March 2022, surgeon-delineated diagnosis was compared with the ICD-10 diagnosis generated by standard ASR electronic medical record data extraction. For decompression-only cases, the primary analysis focused on the etiology of neural compression as determined by the surgeon versus that determined on the basis of the related ICD-10 codes extracted from the ASR database. For lumbar fusion cases, the primary analysis compared structural pathology, which may have required fusion, as determined by the surgeon versus that determined on the basis of the extracted ICD-10 codes. This allowed for identification of agreement between surgeon delineation and extracted ICD-10 codes.

Results

In 5926 decompression-only cases, agreement between the surgeon and ASR ICD-10 codes was 89% for spinal stenosis and 78% for lumbar disc herniation and/or radiculopathy. Both the surgeon and database indicated no structural pathology (i.e., none) suggesting the need for fusion in 88% of cases. In 5663 lumbar fusion cases, agreement was 76% for spondylolisthesis but poor for other diagnostic indications.

Conclusions

Agreement between surgeon-specified diagnostic indication and hospital-reported ICD-10 codes was best for patients who underwent decompression only. In the fusion cases, agreement with ICD-10 codes was best in the spondylolisthesis group (76%). In cases other than spondylolisthesis, agreement was poor due to multiple diagnoses or lack of an ICD-10 code that reflected the pathology. This study suggested that standard ICD-10 codes may be inadequate to clearly define the indications for decompression or fusion in patients with lumbar degenerative disease.

### The nationwide inpatient sample database does not accurately reflect surgical indications for fusion [^a4f36d5b]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Object

The rates of lumbar spinal fusion operations have increased dramatically over the past 2 decades, and several studies based on administrative databases such as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) have suggested that the greatest rise is in the general categories of degenerative disc disease and disc herniation, neither of which is a well-accepted indication for lumbar fusion. The administrative databases classify cases with the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The ICD-9-CM discharge codes are not generated by surgeons but rather are assigned by trained hospital medical coders. It is unclear how accurately they capture the surgeon's indication for fusion. The authors sought to compare the ICD-9-CM code(s) assigned by the medical coder to the surgeon's indication based on a review of the medical chart.

Methods

A retrospective review was undertaken of all lumbar fusions performed at our institution by the department of neurosurgery between 8/1/2011 and 8/31/2013. Based on the authors' review, the indication for fusion for each case was categorized as spondylolisthesis, deformity, tumor, infection, nonpathological fracture, pseudarthrosis, adjacent-level degeneration, stenosis, degenerative disc pathology, or disc herniation. These surgeon diagnoses were compared with the primary ICD-9-CM codes that were submitted to administrative databases.

Results

There were 178 lumbar fusion operations performed for 170 hospital admissions. There were 44 hospitalizations in which fusion was performed for tumor, infection, or nonpathological fracture; the remaining 126 were for degenerative diagnoses. For these degenerative cases, the primary ICD-9-CM diagnosis matched the surgeon's diagnosis in only 61 of 126 degenerative cases (48.4%). When both the primary and all secondary ICD-9-CM diagnoses were considered, the indication for fusion was identified in 100 of 126 cases (79.4%).

Conclusions

Characterizing indications for fusion based solely on primary ICD-9-CM codes extracted from large administrative databases does not accurately reflect the surgeon's indication. While these databases may accurately describe national rates of lumbar fusion surgery, the lack of fidelity in the source codes limits their role in accurately identifying indications for surgery. Studying relationships among indications, complications, and outcomes stratified solely by ICD-9-CM codes is not well founded.

### Improving discharge data fidelity for use in large administrative databases [^c2b388a7]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Large administrative databases have assumed a major role in population-based studies examining health care delivery. Lumbar fusion surgeries specifically have been scrutinized for rising rates coupled with ill-defined indications for fusion such as stenosis and spondylosis. Administrative databases classify cases with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The ICD-9-CM discharge codes are not designated by surgeons, but rather are assigned by trained hospital medical coders. It is unclear how accurately they capture the surgeon's indication for fusion. The authors first sought to compare the ICD-9-CM code(s) assigned by the medical coder according to the surgeon's indication based on a review of the medical chart, and then to elucidate barriers to data fidelity.

Methods

A retrospective review was undertaken of all lumbar fusions performed in the Department of Neurosurgery at the authors' institution between August 1, 2011, and August 31, 2013. Based on this review, the indication for fusion in each case was categorized as follows: spondylolisthesis, deformity, tumor, infection, nonpathological fracture, pseudarthrosis, adjacent-level degeneration, stenosis, degenerative disc disease, or disc herniation. These surgeon diagnoses were compared with the primary ICD-9-CM codes that were generated by the medical coders and submitted to administrative databases. A follow-up interview with the hospital's coders and coding manager was undertaken to review causes of error and suggestions for future improvement in data fidelity.

Results

There were 178 lumbar fusion operations performed in the course of 170 hospital admissions. There were 44 hospitalizations in which fusion was performed for tumor, infection, or nonpathological fracture. Of these, the primary diagnosis matched the surgical indication for fusion in 98% of cases. The remaining 126 hospitalizations were for degenerative diseases, and of these, the primary ICD-9-CM diagnosis matched the surgeon's diagnosis in only 61 (48%) of 126 cases of degenerative disease. When both the primary and all secondary ICD-9-CM diagnoses were considered, the indication for fusion was identified in 100 (79%) of 126 cases. Still, in 21% of hospitalizations, the coder did not identify the surgical diagnosis, which was in fact present in the chart. There are many different causes of coding inaccuracy and data corruption. They include factors related to the quality of documentation by the physicians, coder training and experience, and ICD code ambiguity.

Conclusions

Researchers, policymakers, payers, and physicians should note these limitations when reviewing studies in which hospital claims data are used. Advanced domain-specific coder training, increased attention to detail and utilization of ICD-9-CM diagnoses by the surgeon, and improved direction from the surgeon to the coder may augment data fidelity and minimize coding errors. By understanding sources of error, users of these large databases can evaluate their limitations and make more useful decisions based on them.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^ffb63226]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants

In this study, men and women between the ages of 19 and 70 years who had an average numeric rating scale (NRS) score ≥ 5 for radiating leg pain (sciatica) for three consecutive days and who were confirmed with LDH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that could account for the radiating pain in the leg were included. If the grade of disc herniation on MRI was "protrusion" or higher, it was judged to be LDH. The MRI reading was performed by a radiologist. Whether the patient's symptoms were due to LDH findings on MRI was judged by a Korean medicine doctor with more than 2 years of clinical experience. As for disease codes of LDH, M51 for the seventh revision of the Korean standard classification of disease (KCD-7) was used. The KCD-7 is the Korean version mapping of the International Classification of Disease and Causes of Death-10 (ICD-10). Those who were diagnosed with specific critical conditions that may cause low back pain or radiating leg pain (spine metastasis of malignancy, acute fracture of the spine, or spine dislocation); those who were taking steroids, immunosuppressants, psychotropic medications, or any other medication that may affect the results of this study; and those who had undergone lumbar spinal surgery within the last 3 months were excluded from this study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the eligibility of the participants are presented in.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^7f97aecc]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to draw the distinction between discogenic and vertebrogenic pain syndromes as they have different treatment algorithms. While there may be diagnostic overlap, we eschew the use of the term "discovertebral" that has entered the medical lexicon. Specific ICD-10-CM codes have been issued for discogenic (M51.360 – M51.379) and vertebrogenic (M54.51) pain underscoring the distinction between these pain generators. A necessary feature of vertebrogenic pain is the presence of Type 1 or Type 2 Modic changes on MRI. These are commonly seen with other findings such as inflammation, edema, vertebral endplate changes, disruption and fissuring of the endplate, and vascularized fibrous tissues within the adjacent marrow. Edematous signal (Type 1 Modic change), and changes to the vertebral body marrow including replacement of normal bone marrow by fat (Type 2 Modic change) can also be associated with discogenic pain but are not necessary features in the differential diagnosis. Direct disc stimulation with provocative or anesthetic discography or the use of MRS may aid in pinpointing whether the disc or the endplate is the definitive source of low back pain, but an unspecified proportion of patients may exhibit characteristics of both pain syndromes.

Additionally, it is important to emphasize that interventionalists performing intradiscal procedures should ensure rigorous aseptic technique and consider preprocedural screening for Cutibacterium acnes colonization, especially in patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain and recurrent infections, to minimize infection risk and optimize outcomes.

The approach taken in developing the current discogenic pain algorithm was distinctly different than would be used in the formation of clinical practice guidelines, which are comprehensive dossiers and offer multiple options with graded levels of evidence. In contrast, we provide unambiguous alternatives and clear stopping points. As such, the proposed algorithm should be considered general guidance, appreciating that the treatment trajectory for some patients may fall outside this definitive rule set. In reality, each clinical decision should result in a personalized treatment plan based on discussions between physician and patient about the risk/benefit profile.

Study populations

FinnGen

The main goal of FinnGen is a better understanding of disease mechanisms by combining genomic and health data from up to over 500,000 Finns, with the aim of making healthcare and medical care more efficient. The aim of the studies is to find connections between individual genetic differences and diseases. Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes were used to characterize phenotype M51 (M51.0-M51.9: Thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral intervertebral disc disorders, Supplementary Table 1). Patients without a record of these ICD codes were categorized as controls, and from the controls participants that had been diagnosed with other dorsopathies were excluded (M40-M50, M52-M54, M76). The Hospital Discharge Registry and the Cause of Death Registry served as patient data sources; the analysis did not include patients whose registration data was only available in the primary care registry. The FinnGen (R9-version) data used in the study contains 37 636 LDH cases and 270 964 controls.

### Degenerative disc disease: what is in a name? [^25d2927d]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A systematic search and review OBJECTIVE.: The aim of this study was to investigate the term, degenerative disc disease, to elucidate its current usage and inform clinical, research, and policy recommendations.

Summary Of Background Data

Degenerative disc disease has long been a dominant concept in common, painful spinal disorders. Yet, despite its pervasiveness and important clinical consequences and controversies, there has not been a systematic examination of its use and meaning in the scientific literature.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of publications using the term degenerative disc disease from 2007 through 2016 in Ovid MEDLINE (R), Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus. Two investigators independently reviewed all publications in the primary sample. Publication and author identifiers, and qualitative study descriptors were extracted. Finally, the definition of degenerative disc disease was placed in one of eight categories. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

Results

Degenerative disc disease appeared in the titles of 402 publications in the primary sample and increased in frequency by 189% from the first to the last 3 years of the decade. No single definition was used in the majority of publications, and most frequently, the term was used without any definition provided (30.1%). In other cases, degenerative disc disease specifically included radiculopathy or myelopathy (14.4%), or only back or neck pain (5.5%), or was equated with disc degeneration regardless of the presence of symptoms (15.4%), or with discogenic pain or disc degeneration as a presumed cause of axial pain (12.7%). Another 7.2% comprised a mix of broad ranging findings and diagnoses. The most notable differences in definitions occurred between surgeons and other disciplines, and when applied to cervical versus lumbar regions.

Conclusion

Despite longstanding use and important consequences, degenerative disc disease represents an underdeveloped concept, with greatly varying, disparate definitions documented. Such inconsistencies challenge clear, accurate communication in medicine and science, create confusion and misconceptions among clinicians, patients and others, and hinder the advancement of related knowledge.

### Evidence for an inherited predisposition to lumbar disc disease [^c37ccb81]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A genetic predisposition for the development of symptomatic lumbar disc disease has been suggested by several twin sibling studies and subsequent genetic marker studies. The purpose of the present study was to define population-based familial clustering among individuals with a diagnosis of, or treated for, lumbar disc herniation or disc degeneration.

Methods

The Utah Population Database allows analysis of combined health and genealogic data for over one million Utah residents. We used the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes entered in patient records to identify patients with a diagnosis of either lumbar disc herniation or lumbar disc degeneration and genealogic data. The hypothesis of excess relatedness (familial clustering) was tested with use of the Genealogical Index of Familiality, which compares the average relatedness of affected individuals with expected population relatedness. Relative risks in relatives were estimated by comparing rates of disease in relatives with expected population rates (estimated from the relatives of matched controls). This methodology has been previously reported for other disease conditions but not for spinal diseases.

Results

The Genealogical Index of Familiality test for 1264 patients with lumbar disc disease showed a significant excess relatedness (p < 0.001). Relative risk in relatives was significantly elevated in both first-degree (relative risk, 4.15; p < 0.001) and third-degree relatives (relative risk, 1.46; p = 0.027).

Conclusions

Excess relatedness of affected individuals and elevated risks to both near and distant relatives was observed, strongly supporting a heritable contribution to the development of symptomatic lumbar disc disease.

Results and discussion

64 loci associate with LDH risk

In this genome-wide meta-analysis of LDH, as defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)−10 code M51 (M51.1-M51.9), we utilised data from FinnGen, the Estonian Biobank, and the UK Biobank, comprising a total of 829 699 participants (80 724 cases, and 748 975 controls; Supplementary Table 1). In the meta-analysis, we identified 41 previously unreported (Supplementary Figs 1–41, Table 1) and replicated 23 known loci located more than 1MB apart (Supplementary Fig 42, Supplementary Table 2), each containing at least one variant associated with LDH at the genome level (M51.1–51.9, Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Data 2). Out of the previously unreported loci, 4 loci had previously been associated with other back-related diseases; however, our research demonstrates that these loci are also associated with LDH. In the conditional analysis, we observed secondary signals at 5 of the loci (Supplementary Table 2). We estimated LD score regression-derived SNP-based heritability of LDH to be 0.081 (standard error [SE] = 0.003), suggesting that genetic factors account for 8.1% of the common variation in LDH risk. This estimate aligns with the one available at the UKB-Heritability Browser (0.077, SE = 0.026;). The genomic inflation factor lambda (1.47) suggested inflation in the test statistics. Given the intercept value of 1.12, the inflation observed may be attributed to a polygenic signal and population stratification. In FinnGen, the SNP-based heritability estimate was 14.3% (SE = 0.0083), and lambda 1.39 with an intercept of 1.13.

### Durability of supplemental nucleus pulposus allograft in patients with lumbar discogenic pain [^635890eb]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this study confirm the previous 6-month follow up results in the same group of patients with maintenance of treatment effect extended to two years. At this final follow up interval, almost two-thirds of the participants reported a substantial clinical benefit (≥ 50%) in pain relief with more than one half exhibiting minimal residual low back pain with a score ≤ 3. These encouraging results were achieved after a single minimally invasive allogeneic NP supplementation procedure and bodes well for this approach to preserving the natural function of the intervertebral disc.

The recent issuance of specific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes for lumbosacral discogenic pain associated with degenerative disc disease by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) underscores the importance of developing and evaluating intradiscal therapies that effectively treat patients suffering from discogenic low back pain. Direct supplementation of tissue lost to degenerative disc disease with allogeneic NP represents a straightforward homologous replacement approach to retard or prevent further degeneration of the anterior column of the spine. Minimally invasive intradiscal NP treatment represents an enormous opportunity to improve spine care by delaying or avoiding surgical intervention and enhancing quality of life in patients with discogenic back pain.

The limitations of this study include a small sample size, lack of a concurrent active or placebo control group and absence of follow up imaging evidence of potential disc structural changes. These issues limit the generalizability of the encouraging clinical findings but provide ample support for subsequent investigations that address these shortcomings. We do speculate, however, that the two-year duration of treatment effect observed in the current study mitigates the possibility of a marked placebo effect as the primary driver of efficacy.

The NP allograft used in this study is a minimally manipulated, off-the-shelf product that provides a nonsurgical option that can be delivered through a cannula under fluoroscopic guidance without altering the normal anatomy of the spine. The two-year findings of this study suggest that clinical adoption of this procedure may help to bridge the current treatment gap for patients experiencing chronic moderate-to-severe lumbar discogenic pain and delay the need for more invasive surgical interventions.

Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain is defined by ICD-11 as pain located in muscles, bones, joints, or tendons that lasts or recurs for longer than three months, that is associated with significant emotional distress and/or functional disability, and that cannot be better accounted for by another diagnosis. This will accommodate a subset of the cases previously included in FBSS, where surgery did not cause the pain (see above), but it is distinct from PSPS, which comprises a predisposition to developing symptomatic structural or pathological changes. Where psychosocial factors, as is commonly the case, contribute to the maintenance or exacerbation of symptoms and/or disability which are caused by another (secondary) diagnosis, they are accommodated in ICD-11 by extension codes.

Surgery is not indicated for primary pain but may in some cases be performed. Failure to relieve the pain would not be classified as PSPS, and the diagnosis of primary pain would remain; an inappropriate treatment that does not work cannot change the underlying diagnosis. However, if the spinal surgery caused a new, additional persistent pain, that would be classified as PSPS (type 2). This would add to, not replace, the original diagnosis (Primary musculoskeletal pain).

Subtypes

PSPS type 1: no relevant surgery PSPS type 2: surgery

(This notation is comparable with CRPS types 1 and 2)

Primary Subdivisions (Location of the Pain)

predominantly axial — predominantly radicular — mixed — lumbar and sacral — thoracic — cervical

Pathophysiology (Nature of the Pain)

neuropathic — nociceptive — neuropathic and nociceptive — nociplastic

Examples

PSPS type 1 — upper limb — radicular — facet joint hypertrophy.
PSPS type 1 — lumbar — axial — spondylosis.
PSPS type 2 — upper limb — radicular — cervical disc protrusion (operated).
PSPS type 2 — lower limb non radicular (referred) and lumbar axial — post lumbar fusion — adjacent-segment disease.

### Rare SLC13A1 variants associate with intervertebral disc disorder highlighting role of sulfate in disc pathology [^ce946c34]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded three loci harboring variants associating with self-reported back pain, and severe lumbar IDD requiring surgery. These are represented by variants in or near CHST3 / SPOCK2 and SOX5, genes that are involved in regulation of chondrogenesis and the nervous system, and an intergenic signal between GSDMC and CCDC26 that associates with both self-reported back pain, and lumbar IDD requiring surgery.

Here, we report results of the largest genetic study of back pain phenotypes to date; meta-analyses of GWASs from Iceland (deCODE Genetics), Denmark (Danish Blood Donor Study; DBDS and Copenhagen Hospital Biobank; CHB), and the United Kingdom (UK Biobank; UKB), combined with summary statistics from Finland (FinnGen). We focus on two of the most common physician-assigned back pain diagnoses as defined under the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)that are IDD (code M51) and dorsalgia (code M54); representing largely known (IDD) and unknown (dorsalgia) etiologies of back pain. In total, we report 41 variants at 33 loci of which new associations with back pain are at 30 loci.

Colours represent trajectory clusters. Abbreviations: gastro-oesophageal (GE), vitamin D (Vit D), hypertension (HT), unspecified mood [affective] disorders (UM[A]D), upper limb (UL), thoracic, thoracolumbar and lumbosacral intervertebral disc (TLS disc), persistent mood [affective] disorders (PM[A]D), vasomotor and allergic (V/A)

Most long COVID–associated trajectories involved transitions between different ICD chapters, while 29.8% involved pairs within the same chapter (Fig. 3). To help improve the interpretation of multimorbid mechanisms, three clusters were defined based on the most frequent chapter transitions among disease trajectories associated with long COVID. Three main clusters emerged: mental health and neuromuscular (MHNM, 45.6%), cardiometabolic and digestive (CMD, 19.3%) and respiratory (RESP, 7%). Disease trajectories with both conditions from the same cluster will be referred to as cis trajectories. Among the trans trajectories (transitioning from one cluster to another), the most common transitions were CMD → MHNM (19.3%), MHNM → CMD (5.3%), MHNM → RESP (1.8%) and RESP → MHNM (1.8%).

### Patterns in decompression and fusion procedures for patients with lumbar stenosis after major clinical trial results, 2016 to 2019 [^93b06800]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source

The data used in this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), an administrative data set that captures a representative 20% of inpatient hospital encounters in the US. Although granular data regarding comorbidities or clinical outcomes may be lacking, the breadth of this particular data set makes it well suited to the study of longitudinal patterns across a variety of practice settings and reimbursement mechanisms. Given the transition of the NIS from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10) codes in 2015 and the lack of direct correspondence between relevant procedural codes in the 2 systems, only data from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019, were queried. All analyses were conducted, reviewed, or updated on June 9, 2023. Because this study used deidentified administrative data from a national database, it was deemed exempt from review and informed consent by the institutional review board of Rhode Island Hospital. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Participants

We first identified all adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) in the NIS with inpatient hospital encounters for primary diagnoses corresponding to lumbar stenosis and lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and procedure codes corresponding to lumbar or lumbosacral decompression and a single level, but not multilevel, lumbar or lumbosacral fusion. Patients were then categorized as undergoing decompression alone or decompression with fusion. This initial search yielded 191 510 admissions with 2780 corresponding ICD-10 procedure codes.

Patients were excluded if they underwent nonelective surgical procedures, if their admissions were associated with other nondecompression or non–decompression with fusion ICD-10 procedure codes, or if admissions were associated with any ICD-10 procedure codes that implied either revision spine operations or management of nondegenerative pathologies, such as infection or tumor. In total, 121 745 patient admissions were included in the final analysis (Figure 1).

### Persistent spinal pain syndrome: a proposal for failed back surgery syndrome and ICD-11 [^7598bc4b]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms of Pain of Spinal Origin

Chronic pain of spinal origin is a complex diagnosis which includes several categories of pathophysiology arising from:

The vertebral column — discogenic pain, recurrent disc herniation, herniation of adjacent disc(s), facetogenic pain, SI joint dysfunction, pseudarthrosis, adjacent level stress and degeneration, foraminal stenosis, spinal stenosis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, spinal instability, osteoarthritis, scoliosis, and kyphosis.
The nervous system — nerve root compression, adhesion, traction, irritation or injury, chronic radiculopathy, nerve entrapment, neuropathic low back pain, epidural fibrosis, arachnoiditis, dural sac deformity, pseudomeningocele, arachnoid cyst, nociplastic pain, and central sensitization.
The muscles and fascia — myofascial trigger points, abnormalities of gait, and changes following foot drop.
Complications of surgery — infection, hematoma, nerve root damage or division, spinal instability, instrumentation-related, and hardware failure.
Psychosocial factors — depression, anxiety, somatization, poor coping, catastrophizing, personality disorder, preceding traumatic experiences, and persistent litigation. These can contribute significantly or even overwhelmingly to the overall outcome, in line with the biopsychosocial or sociopsychobiomedical construct of chronic pain and are addressed by the "extension codes" of ICD-11 as relevant contributory factors. In many cases these are the predominant issue (and might have contraindicated surgery in the first place), in which case, they can be classified accordingly.

The above factors may interact with each other. Spinal surgery is commonly associated with, and may cause, biomechanical changes that can alter weight distribution, and therefore stresses on, anatomical structures, (e.g. facet joints and their capsular and ligamentous components, causing facet arthropathy). Preexisting degenerative changes in the spine, including spondylolisthesis, may be exacerbated. Facet arthropathy may lead to foraminal stenosis and nerve-root compression. Postsurgical epidural scarring may exacerbate both this and spinal canal stenosis. Surgical lumbar spinal fusion may initiate or exacerbate SI disease. Adjacent-level disease is twice as likely to develop after a second-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion as it is after the first operation. Biomechanical changes may lead to myofascial dysfunction causing pain, both within these structures and at their sites of attachment.

### Pre-pandemic disease trajectories and genetic insights into long COVID susceptibility [^a6d15e30]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 8322 individuals from the COVICAT cohort were analysed, of whom 1029 (12.4%) were classified as long COVID cases. The prevalence was higher in women (15.1% versus 8.5% in men) and in those with severe COVID-19 (66.7% versus 11.5% in non-severe cases) (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of the individuals included in the analysis according to their long COVID status

Prior chronic conditions and long COVID incidence

Among 106 prior chronic conditions examined, 23 showed significant associations with long COVID incidence. In the overall analysis, 22 conditions were significant (28%), while 13 were significant in females (14%) and 3 in males (4%) (Fig. 1, Additional File 2: Table S6). Women exhibited a higher number of comorbidities, averaging 4.6 diagnoses (SD = 3.71) per person, compared to 3.6 (SD = 3.13) in men. Analysis by ICD-10 disease domains revealed no overrepresentation of any specific category (Additional File 2: Table S7). However, the most prevalent conditions were mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (23.7%), followed by diseases of the nervous system (13.2%), digestive system (13.2%), musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (13.2%), endocrine and metabolic diseases (10.5%) and respiratory diseases (10.5%).

### Occupational exposures and inpatient hospital care for lumbar intervertebral disc disorders among finns [^ea4c8daf]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low back disorders are among the most common health problems in industrialized societies. We examined the relationship between occupational exposures and severe lumbar intervertebral disc disorders (LIDD).

Methods

Information on inpatient care for LIDD (ICD-10: M51.1–51.9) in Finnish hospitals during 1996 was linked with the 1995 Population Census, and based on occupational title with the Finnish Job Exposure Matrix and the Occupational Lifestyle Matrix. There were 3,863 individuals hospitalized due to LIDD among occupationally active Finns. Poisson regression analyses were made with the total occupationally active population as reference.

Results

In a multivariate analysis in women, accident risk, job control, and three-shift work were associated with hospitalization, together with age, education, personal income, and average body mass index (BMI) by occupation. In men, accident risk and job control were associated with hospital admissions, allowing for age, education, and income.

Conclusions

Accident risk and job control increased the risk of hospitalization for LIDD in both sexes. Three-shift work and BMI were also predictive of hospital admission among women.

### Changes in the utilization of spinal fusion in the United States [^a5f19381]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Several reports suggest that spine surgery has experienced rapid growth in the past decade. Limited data exist, however, documenting the increase in spinal fusion. The objective of this work was to quantify and characterize the contemporary practice of spinal fusion in the United States.

Methods

Clinical data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the years from 1993 to 2003. All patients with International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes indicating cervical fusion, thoracolumbar fusion, lumbar or unspecified fusion were identified (n = 471,990). Primary ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes were used to determine the rationale for surgical fusion. Population-based utilization rates overall and for each procedure were calculated from United States census data. Rank order of spinal fusion compared with other inpatient procedures from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was reported for the years 1997 to 2003.

Results

Overall utilization increased during the time period for cervical, thoracolumbar, and lumbar fusions by 89, 31, and 134%, respectively. Patients aged 40 to 59 years experienced the rapid rise in utilization for cervical fusions (60–110 per 100,000) and lumbar fusions (35–84 per 100,000). For patients 60 years and older, utilization also increased for cervical (30–67 per 100,000), thoracolumbar (4–9 per 100,000), and lumbar (42–108 per 100,000). Spinal fusion rose from the 41st most common inpatient procedure in 1997 to the 19th in 2003.

Conclusion

Cervical, thoracolumbar, and lumbar spinal fusion have experienced a rapid increase in utilization in isolation and compared with other surgical procedures in contemporary practice. These changes are most pronounced for patients over 40 years of age, and degenerative disc disease seems to account for much of this increase.

### The "tract" of history in the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease [^bf2d306a]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

In this paper past, present, and future treatments of degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine are outlined in a straight forward manner. This is done to review previous knowledge of the disease, define current treatment procedures, and discuss future perspectives. An analysis of a subject of this magnitude dictates that one describes as accurate a history as possible: an anatomical/historical "tract" with emphasis on all possible deviations. Although spinal disorders have been recognized for a long time, the view of DDD as a particular disease entity is a more recent development. In this paper, the authors attempt to outline the history of DDD of the lumbar spine in an unbiased and scientific fashion. Physiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic implications will all be addressed in this study.

### Validation of an administrative coding algorithm for classifying surgical indication and operative features of spine surgery [^da1735d2]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review of medical records and administrative data.

Objective

Validate a claims-based algorithm for classifying surgical indication and operative features in lumbar surgery.

Summary Of Background Data

Administrative data are valuable to study rates, safety, outcomes, and costs in spine surgery. Previous research evaluates outcomes by procedure, not indications and operative features. One previous study validated a coding algorithm for classifying surgical indication. Few studies examined claims data for classifying patients by operative features.

Methods

Patients undergoing lumbar decompression or fusion at a single institution in 2009 for back pain, herniated disc, stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or scoliosis were included. Sensitivity and specificity of a claims-based algorithm for indication and operative features were examined versus medical record abstraction.

Results

A total of 477 patients, including 246 (52%) undergoing fusion and 231 (48%) undergoing decompression were included in this study. Sensitivity of the claims-based coding algorithm for classifying the indication for the procedure was 71.9% for degenerative disc disease, 81.9% for disc herniation, 32.7% for spinal stenosis, 90.4% for degenerative spondylolisthesis, and 93.8% for scoliosis. Specificity was 87.9% for degenerative disc, 85.6% for disc herniation, 90.7% for spinal stenosis, 95.0% for degenerative spondylolisthesis, and 97.3% for scoliosis. Sensitivity and specificity of claims data for identifying the type of procedure for fusion cases was 97.6% and 99.1%, respectively. Sensitivity of claims data for characterizing key operative features was 81.7%, 96.4%, and 53.0% for use of instrumentation, combined (anterior and posterior) surgical approach, and 3 or more disc levels fused, respectively. Specificity was 57.1% for instrumentation, 94.5% for combined approaches, and 71.9% for 3 or more disc levels fused.

Conclusion

Claims data accurately reflected certain diagnoses and type of procedures, but were less accurate at characterizing operative features other than the surgical approach. This study highlights both the potential and current limitations of claims-based analysis for spine surgery.

### Restorative neurostimulation for patients with mechanical chronic low back pain and impaired neuromuscular control of the lumbar spine | A new treatment paradigm [^9ae95c74]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Relevant ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes

Currently, the most appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis code that indicate medical necessity with reporting multifidus dysfunction is M62.85: "for the diagnosis of dysfunction of the multifidus muscles in the lumbar region" bringing the highest level of diagnostic specificity for providers to diagnose this condition. A secondary diagnosis code for reporting symptomatology is M54.59: "for other low back pain" is also appropriate. These codes were updated in the October 2024 ICD-10-CM code update to add a higher level of specificity to the medical condition of the patient, particularly those that are candidates for restorative neurostimulation. The relevant procedure codes for restorative neurostimulation implantation are CPT1 Code 64590: "Insertion or replacement of peripheral or gastric neurostimulator pulse generator or receiver, direct or inductive coupling" and CPT1 Code 64555: "Percutaneous implantation of neurostimulator electrode array, peripheral nerve (excludes sacral nerve)".

Clinical Trial Evidence

Deckers et al first described lumbar medial branch stimulation in 2013; a multicenter feasibility study successfully repurposed SCS leads, which when placed bilaterally at the superior articular process and transverse process of the L3 junction led to at least a 50% pain relief for half of subjects after 5 months. This feasibility study suggested the need for dedicated electrodes for medial branch stimulation and led to the creation of a restorative neurostimulation system including four-electrode leads with passive fixation tines to minimize risk of lead migration.

The subsequent prospective international, multi-center (ReActiv8-A) trial evaluated this proprietary system in 53 subjects with on average 14 years of severe, disabling CLBP. After one year, compared to baseline, 57% of subjects had ≥ 2 point pain reduction on the numeric rating scale (NRS), 60% had ≥ 10 point functional improvement on the ODI, and 81% had ≥ 0.03-point health-related quality of life improvement on the EQ-5D (EuroQOL health-related quality of life measure) index. Mid-study, the surgical implantation technique was modified from two lateral incisions at the L3 level, to one single midline incision at the L4 level from which both leads are inserted towards the L2 medial branches as they cross the L3 transverse process. This new technique mitigated the high incidence of lead fractures from fascial shearing forces observed during the study and remained the approach of choice throughout the most recent prospective, multi-center, randomized, active sham-controlled ReActiv8-B trial.

### Defining the ideal lumbar total disc replacement patient and standard of care [^e1774f85]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Lumbar total disc replacement, now in use since 2004, was determined by the panel to be a standard of care for the treatment of symptomatic single-level lumbar degenerative disc disease in the active patient subpopulation as outlined by the investigational device exemption study criteria. The large body of evidence supporting this statement, including surgeons' experiences, was presented and discussed. Consensus statements focusing on decision-making criteria reflected that efficacy, long-term safety, clinical outcomes with validated measures, and cost-effectiveness should form the basis of decision-making by payers. Diagnostic challenges with lumbar degenerative disc disease patients were discussed among the panel, and it was concluded that although variably used among surgeons, reliable tools exist to appropriately diagnose discogenic back pain.

### Low back pain in adolescents: a 1-year analysis of eventual diagnoses [^42c9c713]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Back pain in adolescents is very common and often seen in the office for evaluation of potential spinal pathology. Pediatric back pain has often thought to be from serious identifiable causes such as spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, tumor, or infection. A follow-up analysis of adolescents initially presenting with back pain to their eventual subsequent diagnosis within 1 year has not been reported on a large scale with a national sample.

Methods

A national insurance database (PearlDiver Patient Records Database) was queried for ICD-9 codes to identify patients aged 10 to 19 years with back pain from 2007 to 2010. These patients were tracked for imaging obtained, and eventual development of subsequent associated spinal pathology diagnoses using CPT and ICD-9 codes for up to 1 year after initial presentation.

Results

A total of 215,592 adolescents were identified presenting with low back pain (LBP) from 2007 to 2010. Over 80% of adolescents with LBP had no identifiable diagnosis within 1 year. The most common associated subsequent diagnoses were lumbar strain/spasm (8.9%), followed by scoliosis (4.7%), lumbar degenerative disk disease (1.7%), and lumbar disk herniation (1.3%). The rates of all other diagnoses including spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, infection, tumor, and fracture had < 1% association with LBP.

Conclusions

In conclusion, adolescent LBP is a common diagnosis for which underlying serious pathology is rare. The most common diagnosis aside from strain or muscle spasm associated with LBP are scoliosis and degenerative disk disease. Pediatric orthopaedists often are consulted on patients with LBP and should always have high suspicion for potential serious spinal pathology, but should recognize the most common etiologies of back pain in adolescence.

### Lumbar discectomy and reoperation among workers' compensation cases in Florida and new york: are treatment trends similar to other payer types? [^40cb31ab]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design and Data Source

This study was a retrospective analysis of outpatient healthcare records from Florida and New York. The reporting of this study followed the recommendations described by the Reporting of Studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Health Data (RECORD) statement. Outpatient encounter data from Florida and New York were collected from State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases (SASD) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). New York and Florida are the 3rd and 4th largest states in terms of WC-covered jobs as of 2017. The largest and second largest states, California and Texas, did not have outpatient data available through HCUP. Data were evaluated from the latest available 3-year period (2014 to 2016) to understand recent trends and provide an adequate multi-year sample for each state. Not all facilities submit data to HCUP, so the volumes are an underrepresentation of the total volumes each year in each state. Therefore, the analyses in this study focused on proportions.

Patient Populations and Variables

This study evaluated adult patients 21 to 75 years of age with an outpatient encounter at HCUP-participating facilities in Florida or New York between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016. Considering the SASD contains encounter-level data, unique patients were identified using the HCUP revisit codes ("VisitLink") within each state. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes were used to identify procedures and LDH-related diagnoses, respectively, for each encounter (Table 1). Analyses based on LDH-related ICD-10 diagnoses were only performed for 2016 data, since transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 occurred during 2015. Analyses based on CPT procedure codes included all 2014 to 2016 data. Primary payer codes, as summarized by HCUP, were utilized to stratify patients according to the general payer type for claims (Medicare, Medicaid, Private, WC, or Other). The HCUP Narrow Surgery Code was used to identify patients with an LDH-related diagnosis that underwent at least one surgery, regardless of surgery type. For analyses specifically evaluating discectomy procedures, encounters with a concurrent lumbar fusion CPT code were excluded.

### Sequence variant at 8q24.21 associates with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation [^1bfe2923]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Study populations and phenotypes

Data on microsurgical excision of herniated lumbar intervertebral discs (LDHsurg) were obtained from the Landspitali National University Hospital (Landspitali) databases of surgical procedures (that is, lumbar microdiscectomy with surgical code ABC16 according to the NOMESCO (Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee) system). The so-defined phenotype is represented in the current paper by 'LDHsurg'. Demographics of the defined sample are presented in Table 1. Landspitali is a tertiary reference centre hospital and the only hospital in Iceland offering neurosurgery. Microdiscectomy consists of removing a portion of the intervertebral disc, the herniated or protruding portion that is compressing the traversing spinal nerve root, by way of a small incision and using a surgical microscope. This well-established technique has become the most common surgery performed by neurosurgeons in Iceland and elsewhere. It was first performed in Landspitali in 1981 and has since become standard treatment for herniated lumbar discs with persistent, painful sciatica or radiculopathy that does not respond to conservative treatment. The data used in the present study cover microdiscectomy surgeries performed in the hospital's Department of Neurosurgery over a period of 18 years (1997–2015). As shown in Table 1, the proportions of genotyped cases out of the total cases undergoing microdiscectomy surgery during this period support non-bias in the discovery phenotype. Data on individuals diagnosed with herniated intervertebral discs with radiculopathy (ICD-10 code M51.1) who did not undergo microdiscectomy (LDHsurg), were obtained from the Landspitali database of discharge diagnoses (for the same time period as LDHsurg, or 1997–2015). During this period, M51.1 was the most prevalent hospital diagnosis preceding LDHsurg, with a total of 6,280 individuals with this diagnosis. The 5,288 individuals who underwent LDHsurg (Table 1) were excluded as were those diagnosed with M51.1 within 6 months of the end of the study period in 2015, to ascertain that we did not include newly diagnosed cases that would within 6 months become candidates for LDHsurg (according to clinical guidelines in Iceland, LDHsurg is performed if symptoms progress and/or severity persists for 2–3 months). Age and gender distribution of this sample of confirmed LDH without LDHsurg was comparable to the larger LDHsurg sample (Supplementary Table 8).

### Descriptive analysis of spinal neuroaxial injections, surgical interventions, and physical therapy utilization for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis within Medicare beneficiaries from 2000 to 2011 [^325784e9]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective, observational study.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the utilization of various treatment modalities in the management of degenerative spondylolisthesis within Medicare beneficiaries.

Summary Of Background Data

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is a condition often identified in symptomatic low back pain. A variety of treatment algorithms including physical therapy and interventional techniques can be used to manage clinically significant degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Methods

This study utilized the 5% national sample of Medicare carrier claims from 2000 through 2011. A cohort of beneficiaries with a new International Classification of Diseases 9th edition (ICD-9) diagnosis code for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis was identified. Current procedural terminology codes were used to identify the number of procedures performed each year by specialty on this cohort.

Results

A total of 95,647 individuals were included in the analysis. Average age at the time of initial diagnosis was 72.8 ± 9.8 years. Within this study cohort, spondylolisthesis was more prevalent in females (69%) than males and in Caucasians (88%) than other racial demographics. Over 50% of beneficiaries underwent at least one injection, approximately one-third (37%) participated in physical therapy, one in five (21%) underwent spinal surgery, and one-third (36%) did not utilize any of these interventions. Greater than half of all procedures (124,280/216,088) occurred within 2 years of diagnosis. The ratio of focal interventions (transforaminal and facet interventions) to less selective (interlaminar) procedures was greater for the specialty of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation than for the specialties of Anesthesiology, Interventional Radiology, Neurosurgery, and Orthopedic Surgery. The majority of physical therapy was dedicated to passive treatment modalities and range of motion exercises rather than active strengthening modalities within this cohort.

Conclusion

Interventional techniques and physical therapy are frequently used treatment modalities for symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis. Understanding utilization of these techniques is important to determine relative clinical efficacies and to optimize future health care expenditures.

### Indications for spine surgery: validation of an administrative coding algorithm to classify degenerative diagnoses [^8998c861]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of Medicare claims linked to a multicenter clinical trial.

Objective

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) provided a unique opportunity to examine the validity of a claims-based algorithm for grouping patients by surgical indication. SPORT enrolled patients for lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis. We compared the surgical indication derived from Medicare claims with that provided by SPORT surgeons, the "gold standard".

Summary Of Background Data

Administrative data are frequently used to report procedure rates, surgical safety outcomes, and costs in the management of spinal surgery. However, the accuracy of using diagnosis codes to classify patients by surgical indication has not been examined.

Methods

Medicare claims were link to beneficiaries enrolled in SPORT. The sensitivity and specificity of 3 claims-based approaches to group patients on the basis of surgical indications were examined: (1) using the first listed diagnosis; (2) using all diagnoses independently; and (3) using a diagnosis hierarchy on the basis of the support for fusion surgery.

Results

Medicare claims were obtained from 376 SPORT participants, including 21 with disc herniation, 183 with spinal stenosis, and 172 with degenerative spondylolisthesis. The hierarchical coding algorithm was the most accurate approach for classifying patients by surgical indication, with sensitivities of 76.2%, 88.1%, and 84.3% for disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis cohorts, respectively. The specificity was 98.3% for disc herniation, 83.2% for spinal stenosis, and 90.7% for degenerative spondylolisthesis. Misclassifications were primarily due to codes attributing more complex pathology to the case.

Conclusion

Standardized approaches for using claims data to group patients accurately by surgical indications have widespread interest. We found that a hierarchical coding approach correctly classified more than 90% of spine patients into their respective SPORT cohorts. Therefore, claims data seem to be a reasonably valid approach to classifying patients by surgical indication.

### Single-level lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease is associated with worse outcomes compared with fusion for spondylolisthesis in a workers' compensation setting [^8b92750c]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

Compare lumbar fusion outcomes, return-to-work (RTW) status in particular, between workers' compensation (WC) subjects undergoing single-level posterolateral fusion for either spondylolisthesis or degenerative disc disease (DDD).

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar fusion for spondylolisthesis tends to yield more consistent outcomes than fusion for DDD and discogenic low back pain. Within the clinically distinct WC population, relatively few studies exist that evaluate lumbar fusion outcomes.

Methods

A total of 889 Ohio WC subjects were identified that underwent single-level posterolateral lumbar fusion with or without posterior interbody fusion between 1993 and 2010 using Current Procedural Terminology procedural and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes. Of the total subjects, 269 underwent fusion for spondylolisthesis, and 620 underwent fusion for DDD. Subjects were considered to have returned-to-work (RTW) status within a reasonable timeline if they made a stable RTW within 2 years of fusion and remained working for greater than 6 months of the following year. To determine predictors of RTW status, we performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis. We measured a number of secondary outcomes.

Results

Fusion for spondylolisthesis was positively associated with RTW status (P = 0.050; odds ratio [OR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.00–2.00). A total of 36.4% of the spondylolisthesis cohort and 24.4% of the DDD cohort returned to work in a reasonable timeline postoperatively. Other negative predictors included age more than 50 years at fusion (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45–0.95), time more than 2 years between injury and index fusion (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41–0.84), permanent disability (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43–0.86), legal representation (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46–0.97), and psychological comorbidity before fusion (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14–0.62). Subjects in the DDD cohort were prescribed opioid analgesics for an average of 294 of additional days postoperatively (P < 0.001), which equated to 24,759 additional milligrams of morphine equivalents (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our study is supportive of the conclusion that DDD is a questionable indication for spinal fusion. Given the generally poor outcomes of this study, future studies should determine if lumbar fusion surgery is an effective treatment modality in similar patients with WC.

### Trends in lumbar fusion procedure rates and associated hospital costs for degenerative spinal diseases in the United States, 2004 to 2015 [^66815afc]. Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Analysis of National Inpatient Sample (NIS), 2004 to 2015.

Objective

Describe recent trends in US rates of lumbar fusion procedures and associated costs, by surgical indication.

Summary Of Background Data

Spinal fusion is appropriate for spinal deformity and instability, but evidence of effectiveness is limited for primary disc herniation and spinal stenosis without instability. It remains controversial for treatment of axial pain secondary to degenerative disc disease. There are potential non-instability, non-deformity indications for fusion surgery, including but not limited to severe foraminal stenosis and third-time disc herniation.

Methods

Elective lumber fusion trends were reported using Poisson regression, grouped by indication as degenerative scoliosis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, disc herniation, and disc degeneration. Generalize linear regression was used to estimate trends in hospital costs, adjusted for age, sex, indication, comorbidity, and inflation.

Results

Volume of elective lumbar fusion increased 62.3% (or 32.1% per 100,000 US adults), from 122,679 cases (60.4 per 100,000) in 2004 to 199,140 (79.8 per 100,000) in 2015. Increases were greatest among age 65 or older, increasing 138.7% by volume (73.2% by rate), from 98.3 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.2, 99.3) in 2004 to 170.3 (95% CI 169.2, 171.5) in 2015. Although the largest increases were for spondylolisthesis (+47,390 operations, 111%) and scoliosis (+16,129 operations, 186.6%), disc degeneration, herniation, and stenosis combined to accounted for 42.3% of total elective lumbar fusions in 2015. Aggregate hospital costs increased 177% during these 12 years, exceeding $10 billion in 2015, and averaging more than $50,000 per admission.

Conclusion

While the prevalence of spinal pathologies is not known, the rate of elective lumbar fusion surgery in the United States increased most for spondylolisthesis and scoliosis, indications with relatively good evidence of effectiveness. The proportion of fusions coded for indications with less evidence of effectiveness has slightly decreased in the most recent years.

### Meeting tomorrow's needs: a single-centre study in geriatric neurosurgery [^a3fa8676]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Change in top five procedures by age group. Legend: This figure shows how the top 5 most common surgeries in the entire geriatric population (≥ 65) treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Haukeland University Hospital, between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2023, changes in different age groups. Code ABC56 defines decompression of lumbar spinal canal and nerve roots. Code ABC36 defines decompression of lumbar nerve roots. Code AAD10 defines evacuation of subdural hematoma. Code AAF05 defines ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Finally, code ABC16 defines excision of lumbar intervertebral disc displacement

Table 2 presents the ten most frequent neurosurgical diagnoses in the geriatric population using ICD-10 codes. Spinal stenosis (M48.0) was the most common diagnosis in the entire geriatric population with a prevalence of 14.43%, followed by lumbar and other disc disorders with myelopathy (M51.1) and traumatic subdural haemorrhage (S06.50), with prevalences of 9.38% and 7.61%, respectively. We found that spinal stenosis (M48.0) was the most prevalent diagnosis in the 65–69 (12.48%), peaking in the 75–79 and 80–84 groups (16.28%). Notably, S06.50 steadily increased in prevalence with advancing age, becoming the most common diagnosis in the 85–89 and ≥ 90 groups, with prevalences of 20.25% and 56.25% respectively. We also observed treatment for malignant neoplasms in the cerebrum (C71.0) decreased with age, while nontraumatic subdural haemorrhage (I62.0), and communicating (G91.0), obstructive (G91.1) and normal-pressure hydrocephalus (G91.3) increased with age. In comparison, the three most prevalent diagnoses in the 18–64 cohort was lumbar and other intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy (M51.1) with a prevalence of 27.20%, cervical disc disorder with myelopathy (M50.1) at 14.04%, and C71.0 at 5.18%.

### The impact of specialised treatment of low back pain on health care costs and productivity in a nationwide cohort [^1f488611]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

Our source population was all individuals aged 18 and older living in Denmark after January 1, 2005. Using the NPR, we identified all patients diagnosed with degenerative spine disease who had not previously undergone spine surgery at the inclusion date January 1, 2007. We used The International Classification of Disease (ICD)−10 to identify the relevant diagnoses: Spondylolisthesis (M43.0–1) Degenerative disk disease (M47.1–9, M99.2–9), Spinal stenosis (M48.0–2, M48.8–9), Disc herniation (M51.0–9). Patients who also had a diagnosis of congenital spinal malformation (Q76.0–4) were excluded. Patients that had LBP due to vertebral fractures, spine infection or tumor, were not included. Within this sample we defined two cohorts; a cohort of individuals who underwent surgical treatment and those who received conservative, non-surgical treatment. The two cohorts were constructed from the study population as described below, which is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1
The selection steps of eligible surgically and conservatively treated patients and their respective background population controls.

Cohort with surgically treated patients

The cohort undergoing surgery encompassed patients who after receiving one of the above-mentioned ICD-10 diagnoses underwent surgery, according to relevant diagnosis following NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures (NSCP) codes for either decompressive surgery or fusion surgery in the period January 1, 2007 – December 31, 2016. The entry date was the date of surgery. The specific codes are detailed in Supplementary Table 1.

Cohort with conservatively treated patients

The cohort who received conservative treatment was defined as a registered hospital outpatient clinic contact of at least 60 days duration with at least one of the above-mentioned relevant inclusion diagnoses as primary diagnosis during January 1, 2007 – December 31, 2016. Non-surgical treatment of LBP with or without associated radiculopathy in Denmark follow national guidelines. It emphasises an interdisciplinary approach with patient education, guided physical exercise, mechanical diagnosis and therapy as well as manual therapy with or without joint mobilization. Patients who underwent surgery within a year after initially receiving conservative treatment were classified as member of the surgically treated cohort.

Background population controls

For each patient that underwent surgical or conservative treatment ten random controls were selected from the source population matched on age, sex, month and year of the study period as well as region of residence using frequency matching. Parity of socioeconomic status was achieved by selecting controls from each patient's region.

### Degenerative spondylolisthesis: an analysis of the nationwide inpatient sample database [^fc8347ce]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database.

Objective

To investigate national trends, risks, and benefits of surgical interventions for degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS).

Summary Of Background Data

The surgical management of DS continues to evolve whereas the most clinically and cost-effective treatment is debated. With an aging US population and growing restraints on a financially burdened health care system, a clear understanding of national trends in the surgical management of DS is needed.

Methods

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was queried for patients with DS undergoing lumbar fusions from 2001 to 2010, using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis and procedure codes. Analyses compared instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF), posterolateral fusion with anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF + PLF), PLF with posterior interbody fusion (P/TLIF + PLF), anterior instrumented interbody fusion (ALIF), and posterior interbody fusion with posterior instrumentation (P/TLIF). Clinical data were analyzed representing the initial acute phase care after surgery.

Results

There were 48,911 DS surgical procedures identified, representing 237,383 procedures. The percentage of patients undergoing PLF, ALIF + PLF, or ALIF increased whereas the percentage of P/TLIF or P/TLIF + PLF decreased over time. Total charges were less (P < 0.001), average length of hospital stay was shorter (P < 0.01), and average age was older (P < 0.01) for patients who underwent PLF compared with any other procedure. Type of procedure varied on the basis of the geographic region of the hospital, teaching versus nonteaching hospital, and size of hospital (P < 0.01). Patients who had P/TLIF + PLF or ALIF had a higher risk of mortality than patients who had PLF (odds ratios: 5.02, 2.22, respectively). Patients were more likely to develop a complication if they had ALIF + PLF, P/TLIF + PLF, ALIF, and P/TLIF than if they had PLF (odds ratios: 1.45, 1.23, 1.49, 1.12, respectively).

Conclusion

Variation in the surgical management of DS related to patient demographics, hospital charges, length of hospital stay, insurance type, comorbidities, and complication rates was found within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. During the acute phase of care immediately after surgery, PLF procedures were found to reduce length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and postoperative complications.

### Predictors of postoperative complications after surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^c9178a83]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

A retrospective review of 253 unique patients undergoing surgical intervention for LSSDS in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was conducted. Patients were included if they had a primary International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) diagnosis code of M43.16 — spondylolisthesis, lumbar region, or a primary ICD-9 diagnosis code 738.4 — acquired spondylolisthesis. Patients were then divided into two groups of surgical approaches based on Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes: fusion (ie, any procedure including a CPT code of 22585, 22586, 22612, 22630, 22633, 22800, 22840, 22558, 22586, 22612, 22614, 22630, 22632, 22633, 22634, 22808, 22840, 22841, 22842, 22849, 22850, 22851, and 22852) and decompression alone (ie, any procedure including a CPT code of 63017, 63030, 63042, 63047, 63267, 64708, 63035, 63047, and 63048 without an accompanying fusion code). Surgeries were also classified as either single level or multilevel, with multilevel cases denoted by the inclusion of additional segment codes (ie, 22585, 22614, 22632, 22842, or 63017).

The primary outcome measure was any complication in the 30 days after surgery. Across the population, the following 30-day complications were observed and included in the analysis: surgical site infection, pneumonia, reintubation, pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infection, blood transfusion, deep vein thrombosis, unplanned return to the OR, and readmission. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM). Chi-square analysis was conducted to compare complication rates between the dichotomous groups and was used as a basis for targeting variables for inclusion in the regression model. Binomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between independent variables and the primary outcome variable and evaluate the predictive power of independent variables.

Study samples and ethics declarations

Icelandic data for this study were analyzed under National Bioethics Committee (NBC) Licenses #VSN-17-035 and #VSN-12-162 (with amendments), issued following review by the Icelandic Data Protection Authority (DPA). Participants donated blood or buccal samples under informed consent allowing the use of their samples and data in NBC-approved projects at deCODE Genetics. All personal identifiers of participants' data were encrypted by a third-party system (IPS-Identity Protection System) approved and monitored by the Icelandic DPA. The phenotype data were obtained in collaboration with Icelandic physicians, from diagnostic data repositories of the Landspitali National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, the Registry of Primary Health Care Contacts, and the Registry of Contacts with Medical Specialists in Private Practice, spanning the years 1983–2017. The primary phenotypes analyzed were defined by physician-assigned International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 codes; M54 Dorsalgia and M51 Other IDD.

The UK Biobank (UKB) study is a large prospective cohort study of ~500,000 study volunteers from across the UK who were 40–69 years old at time of recruitment in 2006–2011. The UKB phenotype and genotype data were collected following an informed consent and the study is overseen by The North West Research Ethics Committee that reviewed and approved UKB's scientific protocol and operational procedures (REC Reference Number: 06/MRE08/65). Data for this study were obtained and research conducted under the UKB application license number 24898. The phenotypes were defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes; M54 Dorsalgia and M51 Other IDD, obtained from General Practice (GP) clinical event records and other sources (Field IDs 42040, 131929 and 131925) and hospital diagnoses (Field IDs 41270 and 41271). Of the about 500,000 participants in the UKB study, 408,653 were genotypically verified of white British/European descent and included in this study.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^c45f76e4]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — future directions for research emphasize that, because of uncertainty about the ideal candidate for decompression alone, a large scale randomized controlled trial may be logistically and ethically difficult to perform in comparison to decompression and fusion. The work group recommends the undertaking of large multi-center registry database studies with long term follow-up evaluating the outcomes of various surgical techniques, including decompression with and without fusion, for the surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, and states that these databases should include comprehensive demographic and radiographic detail to appropriately distinguish cohorts.

### Effect of bone health optimization on osteoporosis screening and treatment before thoracolumbar fusion [^0e281c0b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Spine fusion for lumbar degenerative disk disease in the United States increased 2.4-fold from 2000 to 2009 and continues to grow. Technologic advances in the past 20 years have led to the development of multiple new fusion constructs (e.g. anterior interbody cages, minimally invasive transforaminal interbody cages, and posterior percutaneous pedicle screws). However, structural integrity of the host bone remains an important factor in construct stability, fusion rates, and failure rates. Accordingly, preoperative identification and perioperative management of osteoporosis are of paramount importance.

Multiple database studies have reported osteoporosis prevalence in those undergoing spinal surgery. Using a Nationwide Inpatient Sample, Guzman et alfound osteoporosis in those undergoing cervical spine surgery to be only 2%. In a study on lumbar spine fusion in the State Inpatient Database, Jain et alreported osteoporosis prevalence to be 6%. However, a common shortcoming of database studies is that osteoporosis is often under-reported by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases coding. The burden of osteoporosis in spine surgery is, therefore, likely underestimated. Consistent with this, in single-center studies, osteoporosis has been reported as high as 10% in posterior lumbar fusion and scoliosis populations.

### Chronic opioid therapy after lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease in a workers' compensation setting [^548a49f9]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Objective

To evaluate prescription opioid use after lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease in a workers' compensation (WC) setting.

Summary Of Background Data

Use of opioids for treating chronic low back pain has increased greatly. Few studies have evaluated risk factors for chronic opioid therapy (COT) among the clinically-distinct WC population.

Methods

We used "Current Procedural Terminology" and "International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision" codes to identify 1002 Ohio WC subjects who underwent lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease from 1993 to 2013. Postoperative COT was defined as being supplied with opioid analgesics for greater than 1 year after the 6-week acute period after fusion. 575 subjects fit these criteria, forming the COT group. The remaining 427 subjects formed a temporary opioid group. To identify prognostic factors associated with COT after fusion, we used a multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

Returning to work was negatively associated with COT (P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR] 0.38). COT before fusion (P < 0.001; OR 6.15), failed back syndrome (P < 0.001; OR 3.40), additional surgery (P < 0.001; OR 2.84), clinically diagnosed depression (P < 0.001; OR 2.34), and extended work loss before fusion (P = 0.038; OR 1.61) were positively associated with COT. The rates of postoperative COT associated with these factors were 27.8%, 79.6%, 85.0%, 76.4%, 77.1%, and 61.3%, respectively. Higher preoperative opioid load (P < 0.001) and duration of use (P < 0.001) were positively associated with higher postoperative rates of COT. Within 3 years after fusion, the COT group was supplied with an average of 1083.4 days of opioids and 49.0 opioid prescriptions, 86.2% of which were Schedule II. The COT group had an 11.0% return to work rate, $27,952 higher medical costs per subject, 43.5% rate of psychiatric comorbidity, 16.7% rate of failed back syndrome, and 27.7% rate of additional lumbar surgery.

Conclusion

The majority of the study population was on COT after fusion. COT was associated with considerably worse outcomes. The poor outcomes of this study could suggest a more limited role for discogenic fusion among WC patients.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^22a361fd]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design

Retrospective, non-randomised, registry controlled.

Objective

To develop a conceptual ICD-10 taxonomic framework for population health surveillance across all-phases of spinal cord injury and disorders (SCI/D).

Setting

Public Hospital Admitted Patient Care (APC) collection, South Australian Dept. Health, South Australia, Australia.

Methods

A core ICD-10-Australian Modification (AM) coded dataset was retrieved from the APC hospital patient admission collection (2012–2017). Search filters and key words referenced to the National Library of Medicine thesaurus identified and quantified incident SCI/D cases. Incident SCI/D case data held in the Australian Spinal Cord Injury Registry (ASCIR) of South Australia (2012–2017) tested fidelity. Data linkage to the South Australian Death Registry controlled for cohort attrition. Both unadjusted and case-mix adjusted core data set yields were evaluated. Outcomes were assessed in terms of APC frequency difference (Δ%) versus ASCIR.

Results

3,504 APC cases were extracted, of which 504 (mean, SD age 55 ± 20 yrs; 348 [69%] male, 202 [39%] traumatic; 135 [32%]) cervical; 51 [10.1%] thoracic and (16 [3.2%]) lumbar met criteria. Comparator data were 385 ASCIR new index cases mean, SD age 56 ± 19 yrs, 229 [75%] male, 162 [42%] traumatic. Case-mix adjusted analysis yielded 336 (APC Δ33%) all-cause incident cases (vs. ASCIR −13 Δ%) and 131 incident cases of traumatic aetiologies (vs. ASCIR −19 Δ%).

Conclusions

The ICD-10 core "Health Condition" data-set assembled extends our understanding of SCI/D epidemiology and with further development may create a cost-efficient and sustainable framework that will improve health system performance and equity within and between countries.

### Sequence variant at 8q24.21 associates with sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation [^520001ca]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To further characterize the effects of rs6651255, we identified an independent sample of Icelandic cases from hospital records (N case = 930) diagnosed as the LDHsurg cases, (with intervertebral disc disorder with radiculopathy represented by ICD-10 code M51.1) who, however, had no history of LDHsurg. This indicating that their associated sciatica symptoms resolved over time and did not become severe enough to warrant surgery. There was no association observed with rs6651255 in this sample (OR = 0.95; P = 0.50).

Taken together, these findings suggest that the effect of rs6651255 on risk of undergoing LDHsurg is driven, not primarily by the morphology associated with herniated lumbar discs, but rather by the severity and persistence of associated sciatica. We therefore tested whether rs6651255[C] associated with chronic or neuropathic pain in independent Icelandic samples with fibromyalgia (N case = 2,142), temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD, N case = 1,455) and migraine (N case = 3,816), in addition to a small sample with neuropathic pain as determined by the DN4 screening questionnaire (N case = 394) (Methods). No significant associations with rs6651255 were detected. As larger sample sizes are needed to reach definite conclusions we provide the association results (Supplementary Table 6) to facilitate future meta-analysis efforts.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^8b898534]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (NASS) define how study quality informs recommendation wording and strength. Levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus), and levels are assigned to studies prior to developing recommendations; recommendations are then graded based on the level of evidence. Grades of Recommendation pair evidence tiers with language: A uses Level I studies with consistent findings and the recommendation wording "is recommended"; B uses Level II or III studies with consistent findings and the wording "suggest"; C uses Level IV or V studies and indicates a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option"; I denotes insufficient or conflicting evidence and states that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against". The guideline notes that significant shortcomings in study execution can downgrade a study's potential level of evidence.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^2c1a664c]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — guideline development process describes a structured methodology in which participants submitted and independently ranked clinical questions, multidisciplinary work groups defined search terms and followed a NASS Literature Search Protocol (Appendix D), a medical/research librarian implemented the search, and NASS maintains an Endnote search history; when identifying literature, if Level I, II or III evidence existed, Level IV or V studies were not required for review. Evidence analysis used independent dual review, with at least two work group members assigning levels of evidence, discrepancies addressed, and the consensus level assigned when two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement. Evidence-based recommendations were then formulated, incorporating expert consensus only where Level I-IV evidence was insufficient. For consensus development, work group members ranked recommendations on a scale ranging from 1 to 9; consensus was obtained when at least 80% of members ranked a recommendation as 7, 8 or 9, with up to three rounds of discussion and voting if the 80% threshold was not attained.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^ec3bb226]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective, non-randomised, registry controlled.

Objective

To develop a conceptual ICD-10 taxonomic framework for population health surveillance across all-phases of spinal cord injury and disorders (SCI/D).

Setting

Public Hospital Admitted Patient Care (APC) collection, South Australian Dept. Health, South Australia, Australia.

Methods

A core ICD-10-Australian Modification (AM) coded dataset was retrieved from the APC hospital patient admission collection (2012–2017). Search filters and key words referenced to the National Library of Medicine thesaurus identified and quantified incident SCI/D cases. Incident SCI/D case data held in the Australian Spinal Cord Injury Registry (ASCIR) of South Australia (2012–2017) tested fidelity. Data linkage to the South Australian Death Registry controlled for cohort attrition. Both unadjusted and case-mix adjusted core data set yields were evaluated. Outcomes were assessed in terms of APC frequency difference (Δ%) versus ASCIR.

Results

3,504 APC cases were extracted, of which 504 (mean, SD age 55 ± 20yrs; 348 [69%] male, 202 [39%] traumatic; 135 [32%]) cervical; 51 [10.1%] thoracic and (16 [3.2%]) lumbar met criteria. Comparator data were 385 ASCIR new index cases mean, SD age 56 ± 19yrs, 229 [75%] male, 162 [42%] traumatic. Case-mix adjusted analysis yielded 336 (APC Δ33%) all-cause incident cases (vs. ASCIR -13 Δ%) and 131 incident cases of traumatic aetiologies (vs. ASCIR -19 Δ%).

Conclusions

The ICD-10 core "Health Condition" data-set assembled extends our understanding of SCI/D epidemiology and with further development may create a cost-efficient and sustainable framework that will improve health system performance and equity within and between countries.

### Lumbar disc nomenclature: version 2.0: recommendations of the combined task forces of the North American Spine Society, the American society of spine radiology, and the American Society of Neuroradiology [^f20cb3ce]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

This article comprises a review of the literature pertaining to the normal and pathological lumbar disc and the compilation of a standardized nomenclature.

Objective

To provide a resource that promotes a clear understanding of lumbar disc terminology among clinicians, radiologists, and researchers.

Summary Of Background Data

The article "Nomenclature and Classification of Lumbar Disc Pathology. Recommendations of the Combined Task Forces of the North American Spine Society, American Society of Spine Radiology and American Society of Neuroradiology" was published in 2001 in Spine © Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins and formally endorsed by the 3 boards. Its purpose, which it served for well over a decade, was to promote greater clarity and consistency of usage of spine terminology. Since 2001, there has been sufficient evolution in our understanding of the lumbar disc to suggest the need for revision and updating. The document represents the consensus recommendations of the current combined task forces and reflects changes consistent with current concepts in radiological and clinical care.

Methods

A PubMed search was performed for literature pertaining to the lumbar disc. The task force members individually and collectively reviewed the literature and revised the 2001 document. It was then reviewed by the governing boards of the American Society of Spine Radiology, the American Society of Neuroradiology, and the North American Spine Society. After further revision based on their feedback, the paper was approved for publication.

Results

The article provides a discussion of the recommended diagnostic categories and a glossary of terms pertaining to the lumbar disc, a detailed discussion of the terms and their recommended usage, as well as updated illustrations and literature references.

Conclusion

We have revised and updated a document that, since 2001, has provided a widely accepted nomenclature that helps maintain consistency and accuracy in the description of the properties of the normal and abnormal lumbar discs and that serves as a system for classification and reporting built upon that nomenclature.

### Noninstrumented posterolateral lumbar fusions continue to fade relative to instrumented posterolateral approaches for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis over the past decade [^4a6e2b8e]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Database and Study Cohort

This study queried data from 2012 to 2022 in the PearlDiver M170 Ortho data set, a large national health administrative database. The M170 Ortho data set contains aggregated, deidentified, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant health information for nearly 170 million orthopedic patients in the United States. The use of this database is well-established in spine literature. - Our institutional review board determined studies using the PearlDiver data set exempt from review.

All patients who underwent a single-level PLF, with or without interbody fusion, were identified using the Current Procedural Terminology codes CPT-22612, CPT-22630, or CPT-22633. They were further characterized by having the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes for degenerative spondylolisthesis of ICD-9-D-7384, ICD-10-D-M43.15, ICD-10-D-M43.16, or ICD-10-D-M43.17. Patients were excluded from the study if they were younger than 18 years, had concurrent neoplasm, infection, or trauma, or had less than 90 days of follow-up. They were also excluded if there were additional segment fusion codes or anterior fusion codes.

The instrumented PLF cohort was comprised of patients receiving concurrent coding for posterior nonsegmental instrumentation (CPT-22840) with any single-level PLF with or without interbody. The noninstrumented PLF cohort was the balance of the single-level PLF patients.

Patient variables were then abstracted. These included age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI, a standardized patient comorbidity index constructed using ICD codes), presence of osteoporosis, insurance type (commercial, Medicaid, or Medicare), geographic region of the procedure (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West), surgical specialty of the performing physician (orthopaedic vs. neurological surgery), and year of surgery. Patients who underwent instrumented PLFs were matched in 4:1 ratio to the noninstrumented PLF cohort on the basis of age, sex, and ECI for outcome analysis.

### Gender specific analysis of occupational diseases of the low back caused by carrying, lifting or extreme trunk flexion – use of a prevention index to identify occupations with high prevention needs [^8bcb09c4]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The Occupational Disease of the Lumbar Spine in Germany

The statutory insurance institutions compensate two diseases that include the lumbar spine related to the intervertebral disc. The OD No. 2108 for the lumbar spine is legally defined as "Disc-related diseases of the lumbar spine caused by the lifting or carrying of heavy loads over many years or by performance of work in an extremely bent posture over many years" (German Occupational Disease Act (BKV), 1997). Several local lumbar syndromes as well as radiculopathy or myelopathy associated with radiographically confirmed lumbar disc herniation and/or lumbar disc narrowing can be recognised as OD. No. 2108 (definition as used in Seidler et al.).

The OD No. 2108 is legally defined as long term carrying and lifting of heavy loads and working in extremely bent posture. Thresholds for carrying and lifting are based on a biomechanical model (as applied by Seidler et al.). Commonly, long-term duration required a minimum of 10 years and 60 work shifts per year. The bent posture required a work place with a height of at least 100 cm (corresponding 39.4 inches) or a task requiring bending the upper body from the upright position to approximately 90° and more. Ergonomic/technical experts within the different statutory accident insurance institutions perform the individual retrospective exposure assessment. Assessment includes written or oral interview questionnaires for the employee and the employer, as well as other methods if applicable.

Data

The Seventh Volume of the German Code of Social Law SGB VII regulates the collection of data on insured individuals. The data from the DGUV were provided as an aggregated data set of confirmed cases of OD No. 2108 over a 10-year period (2000–2009). For the analysis, confirmed cases for an OD No. 2108 are chosen because at this point of the OD process the association between disease and exposure has been recognized by the statutory accident insurances. The data set includes information on gender, diagnosis, age at diagnosis, the type of exposure, the duration of exposure, and the occupation that led to the OD No. 2108.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^3694cffe]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The importance of early recognition and diagnosis of TIO

TIO has an initial misdiagnosis rate of 95.1%. Misdiagnosis can result in no treatment, or the wrong treatment being administered. Patients with TIO are misdiagnosed with a variety of rheumatological or musculoskeletal disorders, including lumbar disc herniation, spondyloarthritis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, bone metastases, and connective tissue diseases. Patients are sometimes diagnosed with neurological and muscular disorders, including motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, myositis, stroke, or functional somatization (authors' personal experiences). As parathyroid hormone (PTH) can be elevated because of FGF23 excess in patients with TIO, primary hyperparathyroidism is also a common misdiagnosis. In some cases, TIO goes unrecognized because presenting symptoms are attributed to coexisting medical conditions. Early recognition and diagnosis of TIO can prevent disease progression, reverse damage already incurred by excess FGF23, reduce the risk of permanent deformity, and avert harm from misdiagnosis and inappropriate or lack of treatment. It should be noted that TIO does not have an International Classification of Diseases‐10 code. This is a barrier to monitoring management in health databases and designating the accurate diagnosis in electronic patient records.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^15988bf0]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — age and comorbidities predicting complex postoperative disposition after posterior lumbar fusion — A retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample retrieved data from 66,601 patients; the reference group was defined as the age group 45 to 64 years, and the likelihood of complex disposition was significantly higher for patients in the age group 65 to 84 (OR: 5.8, p < 0.0001), while patients with 3 or more comorbidities were twice as likely to have complex disposition regardless of age (p < 0.0001); this study provides Level II prognostic evidence that increasing age and the presence of three or more comorbidities may increase the risk of a postoperative complex disposition.

### Lag times in reporting injuries, receiving medical care, and missing work: associations with the length of work disability in occupational back injuries [^4fdadfff]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Covariates

The following covariates were used: gender, annual income, industry, litigation status, injury severity, year of injury, age, and tenure. Gender was coded 1 for female and 0 for male. Sixteen ordered categories were used to assess annual income: $0 to $9999, $10000 to $19,999, $20,000 to $29,999, $30,000 to $39,999, $40,000 to $49,999, $50,000 to $59,999, $60,000 to $69,999, $70,000 to $79,999, $80,000 to $89,999, $90,000 to $99,999, $100,000 to $109,999, $110,000 to $119,999, $120,000 to $129,999, $130,000 to $139,999, $140,000 to $149,999, and $150,000 or more. Industry was categorized into 10 groups, including agriculture, forestry and fishing, construction, finance and insurance, manufacturing, mining, retail trade, services, transportation, public administration, and wholesale trade. These industry groupings match the U.S. Department of Labor's Standard Industry Classification (SIC) groups. Litigation status was coded 1 if the workers' compensation insurer assigned an attorney to the claim and 0 if not. Injury severity was coded on the basis of the primary ICD-9 diagnosis. We used a similar procedure to that used by Webster et al. The codes in the more severe and less severe categories can be found in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. Injury severity was coded 1 for having at least one more severe diagnosis within the first 15 days of medical treatment and 0 for having only less severe diagnoses within the first 15 days of medical treatment. The more severe codes generally included diagnoses related to herniated disc, lumbar radiculopathy or neuropathy, spinal stenosis, sciatica, or possible instability. The less severe codes generally referred to diagnoses associated with degenerative changes, nonspecific back pain, or miscellaneous diagnoses. In addition, efforts were made to exclude cases of "complicated" back pain, such as those with diagnoses that were consistent with experiencing multiple work-related injuries or disorders, very severe injuries, or back pain due to cancer, infection, severe trauma, or an autoimmune disorder. Since the database included claims from 2002 to 2008, the analyses were controlled for the year of the injury. Age was measured continuously on the basis of the date of injury. Tenure was also measured continuously on the basis of a claimant's organizational tenure at the time of injury.

### High prevalence of lumbosacral pathology in patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome [^34800369]. Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To establish prevalence of lumbar and lumbosacral pathologies in patients with hip abductor tendon disorders.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients' charts was conducted over a 5-year period, January 2013 to October 2018, using the S76 and M76 International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. Patients with symptomatic and radiologically confirmed hip abductor tendon disorders (partial and full-thickness tear of the gluteus medius tear with or without gluteus minimus tearing) were included in the study. No exclusion criteria were applied. Patient medical history was examined for concurrent diagnoses of lumbar and lumbosacral pathologies (radiculopathy, lumbar stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and neurogenic claudication).

Results

One-hundred and three patients with hip abductor tendon disorders were identified. Forty-seven (45.6%) patients had low-grade partial abductor tears, while 56 (54.4%) of patients had a high-grade partial or complete abductor tear. Fifty (48.5%) patients carried a concomitant lumbosacral diagnosis, with 20 (19.4%) patients being diagnosed with lumbar stenosis and 45 (43.7%) being diagnosed with degenerative disc disease.

Conclusion

Patients with hip abductor tendon disorders were associated with a high prevalence of underlying lumbar and lumbosacral pathologies. Nevertheless, a causal relationship between these conditions cannot be established.

### 90-day readmission rates for single level anterior lumbosacral interbody fusion: a nationwide readmissions database analysis [^e4a05564]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Nationwide Readmissions Database Study.

Objective

To investigate the patterns of readmissions and complications following hospitalization for elective single level anterior lumbobsacral interbody fusion.

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar interbody spine fusions for degenerative disease have increased annually in the United States, including associated hospital costs. Anterior lumbar interbody fusions (ALIFs) have become popularized secondary to higher rates of fusion compared with posterior procedures, and preservation of posterior elements. Prior national databases have sought to study readmission rates with some limitations due to older diagnosis and procedure codes. The newer 2016 International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10 CM) includes more specification of the surgical site.

Methods

We utilized the 2016 United States Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD), this nationally representative, all-payer database that includes weighted probability sample of inpatient hospitalizations for all ages. We identified all adults (≥ 18 yrs) using the 2016 ICD-10 coding system who underwent elective primary L5-S1 ALIF and examined rates of readmissions within 90 days of discharge.

Results

Between January and September 2016, a total of 7029 patients underwent elective stand-alone L5-S1 ALIF who were identified from NRD of whom 497 (7.07%) were readmitted within 90 days of their procedure. No differences in sex were appreciated. Medicare patients had statistically significant higher readmission rates (47.69%) among all payer types. With respect to intraoperative complications, vascular complications had statistically significant increased odds of readmission (OR, 3.225, 95% CI, 0.59–1.75; P = 0.0001). Readmitted patients had higher total healthcare costs.

Conclusion

The 90-day readmission rate following stand-alone single level lumbosacral (L5-S1) ALIF was 7.07%. ALIF procedures have increased in frequency, and an understanding of the comorbidities, age-related demographics, and costs associated with 90-day readmissions are critical. Surgeons should consider these risk factors in preoperative planning and optimization.

### Rates of future lumbar fusion in patients with cauda equina syndrome treated with decompression [^b5d77433]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Database

We conducted a retrospective study of patients from the Mariner national insurance claims database, available through PearlDiver (PearlDiver), consisting of anonymized records from 53 million orthopaedic patients between the years 2010 to 2018. The Mariner database contains insurance claims from multiple payer types, including commercial insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and self-pay. It is searchable by billing codes identified in the database with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and 10 th Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic and procedural codes. All records in PearlDiver are Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant. This study was determined exempt from additional review by our Institutional Review Board.

Patient Selection and Outcomes

Patients who underwent decompression within 1 month of a diagnosis of CES were identified in the database using CPT, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes (Appendix). To account for patients who changed or lost insurance or left the database for other reasons, patients were excluded if they did not have continuously active records in the database over the study period; thus, all patients had a 5-year follow up in this study. Patients in the CES cohort were matched to patients from a LSS control group. The control group underwent similar decompression procedures as the CES group but lacked a diagnosis of CES and instead had an ICD-9 or ICD-10 code specific for LSS (Appendix). To further characterize the patients in the LSS control group, we identified the percentage of patients with an associated diagnosis of facet hypertrophy or disk extrusion. This LSS control group was matched in a 1:1 ratio with the CES cohort by the matching parameters of age, sex, obesity, tobacco use, and diabetes. Patients who underwent lumbar fusion on the same day as the index decompression procedure were excluded from the CES cohort and LSS control group. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year rates of conversion to fusion, as defined by a CPT or ICD procedure code for lumbar fusion (Appendix,), were identified for the two groups.

### The prevalence of MRI-defined spinal pathoanatomies and their association with modic changes in individuals seeking care for low back pain [^edbc7b85]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Modic changes are of increasing interest, however their age and gender prevalence are not well described. To date, the associations between Modic changes and other common vertebral pathologies have only been described in small samples (n < 100). Our aim was, in a large dataset of people with low back pain, to (1) describe the prevalence of a range of spinal pathoanatomies, and (2) examine the association between Modic changes and stages of intervertebral disc (IVD) pathology. Common pathologies were coded from the lumbar spine MRIs from 4,233 consecutive people imaged while attending a publicly-funded secondary care outpatient facility in Denmark. Prevalence data were calculated by pathology and by vertebral level. Prevalence was also calculated by age and gender categories for Modic changes. The association between stages of IVD pathology (degeneration, bulge, herniation) and Modic changes at L4/5 and L5/S1 was expressed using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals. The prevalence of Modic changes and IVD pathology were greater in L4/5 and L5/S1, compared with the upper lumbar spine. There was no significant gender difference in prevalence of Modic changes (p = 0.11). The prevalence of IVD disc pathology occurring concurrently with Modic changes ranged from 11.5 to 17.5% (Type 1), 8.5 to 12.7% (Type 2) and 17.1 to 25.6% (Type 1 and/or 2) while the prevalence occurring in the absence of Modic changes ranged from 0.5 to 6.3% (Type 1), 0.3 to 4.9 (Type 2), 0.8 to 9.7% (Type 1 and/or 2). The associated PR for IVD pathology occurring concurrently with Modic changes ranged from 1.8 to 29.2 (p < 0.05). The highest PR (29.2) was between degeneration and Modic changes, indicating that it is rare for Modic changes to occur without disc degeneration. Spinal pathoanatomy was common in this population, particularly IVD pathologies, and a consistent trend of a relatively greater prevalence in the lower lumbar spine was identified. Modic changes were more likely to be present among individuals with IVD pathology than without, which may implicate mechanical factors as being one aetiological pathway for Modic changes, although other hypotheses may equally explain this association.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^4679ec01]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord".

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### Mortality in patients older than 65 years undergoing surgery for degenerative lumbar spine disease: a comparison with the general population [^0efcdead]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Variables of the study

The date of death was confirmed using the information available from the public Healthcare System. In cases where follow-up was missed because the patient had moved to another region or country, the patient or their relatives were contacted by telephone. The end of follow-up was December 2023 for all surviving patients. Expected deaths were measured from annual data for the entire Spanish national population according to the National Institute of Statistics, adjusted for age and gender for each calendar period (yearly). The information is freely available. Overall survival was calculated as the time from spinal surgery to death or the end of follow-up.

Epidemiological variables (age, gender), clinical variables (Charlson comorbidity index, ASA physical status classification, diagnosis, date of surgery, history of previous spinal surgery, need for subsequent reintervention), and therapeutic variables (complexity of the surgical procedure, intervention of one or more spinal levels, type of intervention according to whether it was emergency or scheduled, hospital stay) were collected from the patient's electronic health record. As degenerative spinal diseases often include a sum of radiological findings that can give rise to several compatible diagnoses (disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, central canal stenosis, etc.), the diagnosis was categorized according to the finding that contributed most to the symptoms and the indication for surgery, although in many cases it was not an isolated diagnosis. The complexity of the procedure was classified according to the EUROSPINE Surgical Spine Centre of Excellence (Table 1). "Small" surgery corresponded to discectomy, foraminotomy, or laminectomy, whereas "medium" surgery corresponded to vertebral fusion (less than 5 segments) with or without one of the above decompression procedures.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^8b2ce403]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

### The validity of administrative data to classify patients with spinal column and cord injuries [^2fee8bf8]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2013). Low credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are used to document patient morbidity in administrative databases. Although administrative data are used for research purposes, the validity of the data to accurately describe clinical diagnostic information is uncertain. We compared the clinical diagnoses for spinal cord and column injuries from a longitudinal patient registry, the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry (RHSCIR), to the ICD-10 spinal injury codes from the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) at one institution. There were 603 RHSCIR participants with data describing the spinal cord injury, and 341 had data on the spinal column injury. The validity of DAD data to describe spinal injuries was evaluated using the sensitivity and positive predictive values of specific ICD-10 codes; 5.3% of the spinal column injuries and 10.9% of the spinal cord injuries documented in RHSCIR were missed in data from the DAD using ICD-10 codes. The most problematic spinal column ICD-10 code was the dislocation of the cervical vertebra (S13.1); only 14.0% of the dislocations of the cervical vertebrae in RHSCIR were correctly coded in the DAD. The most problematic spinal cord injury ICD-10 code was the incomplete lesion of the lumbar spinal cord (S34.1X); 66.7% of incomplete lesions of the lumbar spinal cord in RHSCIR were correctly coded in the DAD. The validity of DAD data to code spinal injuries is variable, and cannot be reliably used to classify all types of spinal injuries. Patient registries, such as RHSCIR, should be used if accurate detailed diagnostic data are required.

### Strengths and limitations of international classification of disease ninth revision clinical modification codes in defining cervical spine surgery [^2698eafb]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Objective

To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of International Classification of Disease Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) hospital discharge codes to define degenerative cervical spine surgery in comparison to patient operative notes in the medical record.

Summary Of Background Data

Population-based studies of spine surgery have often relied on administrative databases as a primary information source, but little is known about the validity of using ICD9-CM codes to identify these operations.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study comparing ICD9-CM billing codes to patient operative notes, the gold standard, for patients undergoing spine surgery in 2006 at a single academic center.

Results

We identified 1090 procedures of which 265 were categorized as cervical spine surgery for degenerative indications based on the operative notes. Compared to operative notes, our ICD9-CM algorithm had high sensitivity and specificity for selecting surgery at the cervical spine level and cervical spine surgery for degenerative indications. Categorization of cases by procedure had high sensitivity and specificity for fusion and surgical approach (> 95%). Categorization of cases by primary diagnosis was generally less accurate. Cervical spondylosis with myelopathy was the most sensitive primary diagnosis. Categorization of cases by procedure had high sensitivity and specificity for fusion and surgical approach (≥ 96%). However, diagnoses such as herniated disc and procedures such as laminectomy had low sensitivity but high specificity.

Conclusion

The use of our ICD9-CM algorithm to define spine surgery at the cervical spine level, and degenerative cervical spine surgery is highly accurate. Although specific diagnoses codes are mostly insensitive, an ICD9-CM algorithm can be used to study these procedures with reasonable precision.

The bottom right panel shows the number of incident cases recorded for each aggregated endpoint during the follow-up period. HR = hazard ratio. NO 2 = nitrogen dioxide.

Figure 3
Hazard of 14 ICD-10 chapter-based endpoints per 10 μg/m 3 higher annual NO 2 exposure in the main models

The solid boxes represent HRs, with the size inversely proportional to the variance of the logarithm of the HR, and the horizontal lines represent 95% CIs. All models were stratified by age-at-risk (in 1-year scale), ten study areas, and sex, and were adjusted for education, household income, smoking status, alcohol intake, cooking fuel type, heating fuel type, self-reported health status, BMI, physical activity level, temperature, and relative humidity. The models fit from the 1st to 99th percentiles of NO 2 concentration. HR = hazard ratio. NO 2 = nitrogen dioxide.

Of the 12 specific diseases across three selected ICD-10 chapters, hypertensive disease, lower respiratory infection, arthrosis, spondylopathies, and intervertebral disc disorders showed supra-linear positive associations, and ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, and asthma showed linear positive associations, whereas intracerebral haemorrhage, other cerebrovascular disease, acute upper respiratory infection, and chronic lower respiratory disease showed null associations with annual NO 2 exposure in the main models (Figure 4, Figure 5). These associations again largely persisted in the two-pollutant models (appendix p 22).

### Effect of preoperative acupuncture and epidural steroid injection on early postoperative infection after lumbar spinal fusion [^96007c30]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This study was approved by the institutional review board of the corresponding author's hospital. The requirement for informed consent was waived because the study involved the retrospective use of anonymized and publicly available data.

Data Selection and Definition of Postoperative Infection

The Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) service of our country is a public agency that evaluates the adequacy of insurance claims. The claims data include prescribed medications, procedures, diagnoses, demographic data, and comorbidities,-. Data of insurance claims were collected from January 2010 to December 2019. Patients > 50 years of age who underwent elective lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative diseases were included. Patients who received treatment for specific diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis or spinal tumors, in the 3 months prior to spinal surgery and patients who had a spinal infection within 3 months or on the day of spinal surgery were excluded.

Identification of ESI and Acupuncture

ESI and acupuncture were identified using procedural codes. Patients who underwent epidural, root, and facet blocks in the thoracolumbar region and those who underwent intervertebral acupuncture within 90 days prior to lumbar fusion surgery were identified. Patients who underwent acupuncture and nerve blocks after spinal surgery were excluded from this study. The patients were divided into 4 groups on the basis of the type(s) of preoperative procedure they received: those who received neither acupuncture nor ESI ("unexposed group"), those who underwent acupuncture only ("acupuncture group"), those who underwent ESI only ("ESI group"), and those who underwent both procedures before spinal surgery ("combined group").

Incidence of and Risk Factors for Postoperative Infection After Spinal Surgery

The primary outcome of this study was the occurrence of postoperative infection. Postoperative infection was considered present if diagnostic codes relating to spinal infection were registered within 90 days of the date of spinal surgery (Table I). Risk factors associated with postoperative infection after lumbar fusion surgery were evaluated. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to identify underlying diseases.

### Utility of a combined current procedural terminology and international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification code algorithm in classifying cervical spine surgery for degenerative changes [^16833c74]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Objective

To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a combined Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) algorithm in defining cervical spine surgery in comparison to patient operative reports in the medical record.

Summary Of Background Data

Epidemiological studies of spine surgery often use ICD-9-CM billing codes in administrative databases to study trends and outcome of surgery. However, ICD-9-CM codes do not clearly identify specific surgical factors that may be related to outcome, such as instrumentation or number of levels treated. Previous studies have not investigated the sensitivity and specificity of a combined CPT and ICD-9-CM code algorithm for defining cervical spine surgical procedures.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study comparing the sensitivity and specificity of a combined CPT and ICD-9-CM code algorithm to the operative note, the gold standard, in a single academic center. We also compared the accuracy of our combined algorithm with our published ICD-9-CM-only algorithm.

Results

The combined algorithm has high sensitivity and specificity for defining cervical spine surgery, specific surgical procedures such as discectomy and fusion, and surgical approach. Compared to the ICD-9-CM-only algorithm, the combined algorithm significantly improves identification of discectomy, laminectomy, and fusion procedures and allows identification of specific procedures such as laminaplasty and instrumentation with high sensitivity and specificity. Identification of reoperations has low sensitivity and specificity, but identification of number of levels instrumented, fused, and decompressed has high specificity.

Conclusion

The use of our combined CPT and ICD-9-CM algorithm to identify cervical spine surgery was highly sensitive and specific. For categories such as surgical approach, accuracy of our combined algorithm was similar to that of our ICD-9-CM-only algorithm. However, the combined algorithm improves sensitivity, and allows identification of procedures not defined by ICD-9-CM procedure codes, and number of levels instrumented and decompressed. The combined algorithm better defines cervical spine surgery and specific factors that may impact outcome and cost.

### Nonoperative care to manage sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis: high costs and medical resource utilization in the United States Medicare population [^23e9c5af]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Low-back pain (LBP) is highly prevalent among older adults, and the cost to treat the US Medicare population is substantial. Recent US health care reform legislation focuses on improving quality of care and reducing costs. The sacroiliac (SI) joint is a recognized generator of LBP, but treatments traditionally have included either nonoperative medical management or open SI joint fusion, which has a high rate of complications. New minimally invasive technologies have been developed to treat SI joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis, so it is important to understand the current cost impact of nonoperative care to the Medicare program. The objective of this study was to evaluate the medical resource use and associated Medicare reimbursement for patients managed with nonoperative care for degenerative sacroiliitis/SI joint disruption.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted using claim-level data from the Medicare 5% Standard Analytical Files (SAFs) for the years 2005–2010. Included were patients with a primary ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) diagnosis code for degenerative sacroiliitis/SI joint disruption (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 720.2, 724.6, 739.4, 846.9, or 847.3) with continuous enrollment for at least 1 year before and 5 years after diagnosis. Claims attributable to degenerative sacroiliitis/SI joint disruption were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (claims with a primary or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of 71x.xx, 72x.xx, 73x.xx, or 84x.xx), and the 5-year medical resource use and Medicare reimbursement (in 2012 US dollars) were tabulated across practice settings. A subgroup analysis was performed among patients who underwent lumbar spinal fusion.

Results

Among all Medicare patients with degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruption (n = 14,552), the mean cumulative 5-year direct medical costs attributable to degenerative sacroiliitis/SI joint disruption was $18,527 ± $28,285 (± SD) per patient. The cumulative 5-year cost was $63,913 ± $46,870 per patient among the subgroup of patients who underwent lumbar spinal fusion (n = 538 [3.7%]) and $16,769 ± $25,753 per patient among the subgroup of patients who had not undergone lumbar spinal fusion (n = 14,014 [96.3%]). For the total population, the largest proportion of cumulative 5-year costs was due to inpatient hospitalization (42.1%), outpatient physician office (20.6%), and hospital outpatient costs (14.9%). The estimated cumulative 5-year Medicare reimbursement across practice settings attributable to SI joint disruption or degenerative sacroiliitis is approximately $270 million among these 14,552 Medicare beneficiaries ($18,527 per patient).

Conclusions

In patients who suffer from LBP due to SI joint disruption or degenerative sacroiliitis, this retrospective Medicare claims data analysis demonstrates that nonoperative care is associated with substantial costs and medical resource utilization. The economic burden of SI joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis among Medicare beneficiaries in the US is substantial and highlights the need for more cost-effective therapies to treat this condition and reduce health care expenditures.

Levels of evidence for primary research questions — therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic, and economic/decision analyses are graded by study design. Level I therapeutic evidence includes "High quality randomized trial with statistically significant difference or no statistically significant difference but narrow confidence intervals" and "Systematic review of Level I RCTs (and study results were homogenous3)". For prognostic Level I, the standard is a "High quality prospective study (all patients were enrolled at the same point in their disease with ≥ 80% follow-up of enrolled patients)", while diagnostic Level I requires "Testing of previously developed diagnostic criteria on consecutive patients (with universally applied reference "gold" standard)", and economic Level I entails "Sensible costs and alternatives; values obtained from many studies; with multiway sensitivity analyses". Level II includes a "Lesser quality RCT (eg, < 80% follow-up, no blinding, or improper randomization)", diagnostic "Development of diagnostic criteria on consecutive patients (with universally applied reference "gold" standard)", and economic analyses with "Sensible costs and alternatives; values obtained from limited studies; with multiway sensitivity analyses". Level III diagnostic evidence is a "Study of non-consecutive patients; without consistently applied reference "gold" standard", and Level III economic analyses are "Analyses based on limited alternatives and costs; and poor estimates". Footnotes define "Systematic review" as "A combination of results from two or more prior studies", "homogenous" as "Studies provided consistent results", and clarify that "Study was started before the first patient enrolled" denotes prospective design whereas "The study was started after the first patient enrolled" denotes retrospective design.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^92bb607c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to spinal decompression, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering lumbar discectomy to speed recovery in patients with radiculopathy due to ongoing nerve root compression failing to improve significantly after 4–6 weeks and appropriate conservative therapy.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^e9df4fda]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Prognostic factors for medical/interventional treatment functional outcomes in lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — Age greater than 60 years versus less than 60 did not have an effect on outcomes at six months after medical/interventional treatment, and this study provides Level I evidence that age has no impact on pain relief from medical/interventional treatment outcomes; furthermore, multivariate analysis found race, sex, employment status, prior low back pain, tobacco history, comorbidity, symptom duration of less than 12 weeks, baseline Oswestry score, herniation level, herniation type, herniation location, herniation morphology, adjusted baseline leg pain and adjusted baseline back pain were not significantly related to outcome at six months.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines facet joint interventions 2020 guidelines [^b67e8c24]. Pain Physician (2020). High credibility.

Facet joint interventions — documentation and medical necessity — require that "Documentation is to provide evidence of information. Documentation includes evaluation and management services, procedural services, and billing and coding", and that medical necessity "requires appropriate diagnosis and coding by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, (ICD-10-CM) to justify services rendered and indicates the severity of a patient's condition". The Balanced Budget Act "requires all physicians to provide diagnostic information for all Medicare/Medicaid patients starting from January 1, 1998". CMS defines medical necessity as "no payment may be made under Part A or Part B for any expense incurred for items or services which. are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a participant", while the AMA defines it as "health care services or procedures that a prudent physician would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms" with criteria including "Clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration", "Not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician or other healthcare provider", being "To meet medical necessity and reasonable and necessary criteria, the service must be: Safe and effective", "Not experimental or investigational", and being "Furnished in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice" and "At least as beneficial as an existing and available medically appropriate alternative".
