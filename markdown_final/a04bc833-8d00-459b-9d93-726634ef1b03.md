## Question

What is the recommended duration of pirfenidone treatment for IPF patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of pirfenidone treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and how to justify that recommendation with references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA label says about treatment duration. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend. Next, I will review pivotal trial durations and long-term extension data. After that, I need to check real-world evidence on persistence and outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note any exceptions or dose-modification considerations that might affect duration decisions.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that anchors duration guidance. The FDA labeling for pirfenidone indicates use for the treatment of IPF but does not specify a fixed treatment duration, implying chronic, ongoing therapy rather than a time-limited course, and it provides detailed dosing and titration instructions without a stop date, which supports indefinite treatment as long as it is tolerated and clinically appropriate [^1142okNh] [^111qWPQC] [^115Vur1N].

> Wait, let me verify what the pivotal trials actually studied, since duration in trials often informs practice. The ASCEND phase 3 trial was 52 weeks, and the CAPACITY trials were at least 72 weeks with some observations extending to approximately 120 weeks; importantly, these trials were designed to demonstrate slowing of FVC decline and progression-free survival rather than a cure, reinforcing that benefit accrues with sustained therapy rather than a short course [^112qkJES] [^116HXrAC] [^112MjEbF].

> I should confirm whether longer-term data support continued benefit beyond one to two years. The RECAP open-label extension enrolled patients who completed CAPACITY and ASCEND and followed them for up to 180 weeks, demonstrating continued tolerability and similar annualized FVC decline rates across disease severities; pooled analyses of the phase 3 trials also showed mortality signals favoring pirfenidone over 120 weeks, supporting the concept of sustained benefit with longer exposure [^112MGRcZ] [^111pKX1m] [^113QZYtK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping rules; I need to check guideline language. The 2015 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guideline gives pirfenidone a conditional recommendation for IPF and emphasizes individualized decisions, while the 2022 update focuses on comprehensive longitudinal management and monitoring rather than specifying a treatment duration, which in practice translates to continuing antifibrotic therapy indefinitely unless contraindicated or not tolerated [^113aLAWj] [^113fmSoc].

> Next, I should review real-world evidence to see how long patients actually stay on therapy and whether outcomes remain favorable. Observational cohorts such as the PROOF registry and the Polish PolExPIR study show median treatment durations around 17 months with sustained lung function and acceptable safety, and Spanish real-world data suggest better persistence with pirfenidone compared with nintedanib, supporting feasibility of long-term therapy in routine care [^117UuAG5] [^1141Ybdy].

> I need to ensure I address dose modifications, because interruptions could be misread as stopping therapy. Pooled analyses show that dose reductions and interruptions are common, especially early, yet treatment benefit persists across dose-intensity strata, and expert consensus recommends proactive adverse-event management to maintain therapy rather than discontinuation, which again supports continuing treatment over time with adjustments as needed [^112eLuVY] [^115rq8ub] [^115T5VeH].

> But wait, what if the disease progresses despite therapy? Should we stop then? Subgroup analyses suggest that even after clinically meaningful progression, continuing pirfenidone may reduce the risk of subsequent major FVC decline or death, so progression alone is not a clear indication to stop. Instead, I should confirm that we reassess goals of care, comorbidities, transplant eligibility, and patient preferences before deciding to discontinue [^1153Smxu] [^113fmSoc].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts this. There is no guideline-specified endpoint for pirfenidone in IPF; the FDA label implies chronic therapy; randomized and extension trials demonstrate benefit extending to 120–180 weeks; and real-world cohorts show acceptable long-term persistence and outcomes. Therefore, the recommended duration is indefinite, continued treatment as long as the patient derives benefit, remains tolerant, and prefers to continue, with periodic reassessment of efficacy, safety, and goals of care at 3–6 month intervals per guideline follow-up principles [^1142okNh] [^113fmSoc] [^113QZYtK] [^1141Ybdy].

> I should double-check practical caveats. If a patient experiences intolerable adverse effects despite optimized mitigation and dose reduction, switching to nintedanib is reasonable; conversely, if nintedanib is not tolerated, pirfenidone can be used long term with ongoing monitoring of liver function and skin protection, consistent with label precautions and expert consensus on adverse-event management [^116vNL83] [^115rq8ub] [^115T5VeH].

Pirfenidone therapy for IPF is **long-term and continuous** [^114h2e2s], with no predefined stop date, to slow disease progression and preserve lung function [^112qkJES]. The standard maintenance dose is **2403 mg/day** (801 mg three times daily with food) [^115Vur1N] [^111qWPQC], and treatment should continue as long as the patient benefits and tolerates therapy [^113MFugU] [^1153Smxu]. Therapy may be interrupted or reduced for adverse effects [^112eLuVY], but stopping is generally not recommended unless there is **intolerable toxicity** or **lack of efficacy** [^113MFugU] [^1153Smxu]. Evidence supports continued treatment even after disease progression, as stopping may worsen outcomes [^1153Smxu].

---

## Recommended duration of pirfenidone therapy

- **Long-term therapy**: Pirfenidone is intended for long-term, continuous use to slow disease progression and preserve lung function [^114h2e2s].

- **No predefined duration**: There is no fixed treatment duration; therapy should continue as long as the patient benefits and tolerates treatment [^115hTM4p].

- **Evidence from clinical trials**: Trials and extensions show sustained benefit with continued therapy, including in advanced disease [^111pKX1m] [^112MGRcZ].

---

## Clinical trial evidence supporting long-term use

| **Trial name** | **Duration** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| ASCEND (Study 016) | 52 weeks | - Reduced FVC decline <br/> - Improved progression-free survival [^112qkJES] |
| CAPACITY (Studies 004 and 006) | 72 weeks | - Reduced FVC decline <br/> - Acceptable safety profile [^116HXrAC] |
| RECAP (extension study) | Up to 180 weeks | Continued benefit and tolerability in advanced disease [^111pKX1m] |

---

These data support **continued therapy** to slow progression and improve outcomes [^1153Smxu].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence treatment duration**:

- **Disease severity and progression**: More advanced disease may require careful management but can still benefit from continued therapy [^111pKX1m] [^111hRhgB].

- **Tolerance and adverse effects**: Common adverse effects (GI upset, photosensitivity, rash) [^112qkJES] can often be managed with dose adjustments or supportive care [^112eLuVY].

- **Patient preferences and comorbidities**: Shared decision-making and comorbidity management guide continuation or modification of therapy [^113fmSoc].

---

## Circumstances under which pirfenidone therapy may be discontinued

Pirfenidone may be stopped for **intolerable adverse effects** despite dose adjustments and supportive measures [^116MZ8BB], or for **lack of efficacy**, defined by significant progression (e.g. ≥ 10% FVC decline) after an adequate trial. Patient preference or severe comorbidities may also necessitate stopping therapy [^117UuAG5].

---

## Impact of discontinuation on disease progression

Stopping pirfenidone can accelerate FVC decline and worsen outcomes; pooled analyses show continued therapy reduces the risk of significant FVC decline or death even after progression [^1153Smxu] [^115hTM4p]. Therefore, **continuation is generally preferred** unless there is a compelling reason to stop [^115rq8ub].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines recommend **continuing pirfenidone** as long as the patient benefits and tolerates therapy, with no fixed stop date [^notfound]. Regular monitoring and individualized decisions are emphasized [^113fmSoc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Long-term therapy**: Continue pirfenidone indefinitely if effective and tolerated [^notfound].

- **No fixed duration**: Treatment is individualized based on response and tolerance [^111jRNqd].

- **Discontinuation**: Consider only for intolerable toxicity, clear lack of efficacy, or patient preference [^116MZ8BB].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess lung function, symptoms, and adverse effects to guide continuation or modification [^113fmSoc].

---

Pirfenidone is intended for **long-term use** in IPF, with no fixed stop date, to slow progression and preserve lung function [^112qkJES]. Therapy should continue as long as the patient benefits and tolerates treatment, with discontinuation considered only for intolerance or lack of efficacy [^1153Smxu].

### Long-term treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a comparative, real-world cohort study [^1125w3b9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given these mixed findings, the question of whether the two antifibrotic therapies have comparable efficacy has not been fully elucidated. Moreover, limited evidence exists regarding the efficacy of different dosages of antifibrotic therapy in IPF patients. The most relevant data on dose adjustment come from a subgroup analysis of the INPULSIS trial by Maher et al. which showed that patients receiving either the full or reduced dose of nintedanib exhibited similar efficacy, with no significant differences in absolute FVC decline at 12 months. However, long-term data beyond this period are lacking, whilst evidence on the efficacy of different dosing regimens of pirfenidone is not available.

In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of pirfenidone and nintedanib in a retrospective cohort of IPF patients over a long follow-up period and sought to assess the impact of reduced antifibrotic dosage on a range of clinical outcomes.

As seen in this CME online activity (available at http://courses.elseviercme.com/chest16/647e), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic progressive fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause. It is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia in adults. Its prevalence among US Medicare beneficiaries has more than doubled in the past 14 years. With the approval of two agents that reduce functional decline and disease progression, and the 2015 update of the American Thoracic Society guidelines on the treatment of IPF, the options for appropriate clinical management of the disease have become well defined. Early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment are of critical importance for long-term clinical outcomes. The diagnostic process, which may require a multidisciplinary team of experts, is centered on excluding systemic diseases and exposures and identifying a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia on high-resolution CT or surgical lung biopsy results. Familiarity with the 2015 American Thoracic Society guidelines is critical with respect to both the treatments that the guidelines recommend and those that they advise against. Standard immunosuppressive therapy is no longer indicated, whereas pirfenidone, nintedanib, and antacid therapy are all conditionally recommended for use. Individualizing treatment is important in light of potential improved adherence to both drug therapy and health behaviors. An early referral to an interstitial lung disease center offers the advantages of comprehensive diagnostic and disease-management expertise, potential enrollment in a clinical trial, and evaluation for transplantation.

### Expert consensus on the management of adverse events and prescribing practices associated with the treatment of patients taking pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a Delphi consensus study [^113MFugU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Dyspepsia

Patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to take their dose with a meal and advised to spread their pills out over the course of the meal. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and antacids like Maalox®, and TUMS® may be prescribed. Dose reductions are recommended for patients with dyspepsia. After exhausting all remedies, pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe dyspepsia occurs and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Education on diet and positional approaches, as well as ensuring that patients take their dose with meals is recommended for patients with GERD. PPIs and H2 (histamine 2) blockers should be prescribed for GERD with dose reductions and drug holidays as additional suggestions. After all remedies are exhausted, pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe GERD occurs and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Nausea

Patients who experience nausea should be advised to take their dose with food and advised to take their pills separately throughout the duration of their meal. Prescribe/add 5-Hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5HT3) receptor antagonists such as ondansetron for patients with nausea, with dose reductions and drug holidays as further suggestions. After all remedies are exhausted, pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe nausea occurs and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Vomiting

PPIs and 5HT3 receptor antagonists are recommended for patients who experience vomiting. Dose reductions and drug holidays are suggested and pirfenidone should be discontinued if severe vomiting occurs. In such situations, treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

Weight loss

Encouraging eating, discussing eating habits, and increasing the frequency and size of meals are recommended for patients with decreased weight. Fatty meals are recommended as well as dietary supplements. Dose reductions are recommended for patients with decreased weight. Pirfenidone could be discontinued if after exhausting all remedies severe weight loss occurs, and treatment with another anti-fibrotic can be considered.

### Efficacy of early antifibrotic treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^11338JVV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although antifibrotic drugs, including nintedanib and pirfenidone, slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), there is little data about the timing of start of antifibrotic treatment in real-world clinical practice. The present study aimed to clarify the efficacy of nintedanib and pirfenidone in patients with early-stage IPF.

Methods

We compared survival and disease progression between patients with IPF with Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) disease severity system stage I with and without oxygen desaturation on the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and increased the gender-age-physiology (GAP) staging. We examined the efficacy of antifibrotic drugs in patients with early-stage IPF.

Results

The severity of stage I IPF (n = 179) according to the JRS criteria consisted of the following GAP staging criteria: stage I, 111 cases; stage II, 58 cases; stage III, 10 cases. The duration from the initial visit to disease progression and survival time was significantly shorter in JRS stage I patients with oxygen desaturation on the 6MWT or with increased GAP staging (unfavorable group) compared with patients without those factors. In the unfavorable group, the relative decline in percentage predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) over 6 months was significantly lower in patients undergoing antifibrotic treatment compared with non-treated patients.

Conclusion

Antifibrotic drugs have a beneficial effect on the decline in %FVC in Japanese patients with early-stage IPF who have oxygen desaturation on the 6MWT or increased GAP staging.

### Expert consensus on the management of adverse events and prescribing practices associated with the treatment of patients taking pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a Delphi consensus study [^115T5VeH]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) treated with pirfenidone (Esbriet®, Genentech USA, Inc. South San Francisco, CA.), effectively managing treatment-related adverse events (AEs) may improve adherence. Due to a lack of clinical evidence and expertise, managing these AEs can be challenging for patients and physicians alike. In the absence of evidence, consensus recommendations from physicians experienced in using pirfenidone to treat IPF are beneficial.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, expert recommendations were developed by a panel of physicians experienced with using pirfenidone for IPF. Over three iterations, panelists developed and refined a series of statements on the use of pirfenidone in IPF. Their agreement on each statement was ranked using a Likert scale.

Results

A panel of 12 physicians participated and developed a total of 286 statements on dosing and administration, special populations, drug-drug interactions, laboratory analysis, warnings and precautions, and AE management. Expert recommendations were achieved with regard to slower initial titrations and slower titrations for AEs, dosing with meal(s) or substantial meals, and adding other prescribed pharmacological agents for AEs.

Conclusion

Until there is further clinical evidence, the resulting consensus recommendations are intended to provide direction on the practical management of IPF with pirfenidone, by encompassing a broad experience from the real world to complement data gleaned from clinical trials.

### Pitfalls in developing new compounds for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112zy1SZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The development and availability of nintedanib and pirfenidone has heralded a new era in the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Both agents demonstrate that the disease can be successfully modulated with therapeutic interventions, but neither are a cure and IPF remains a deadly disease.

Recent Findings

There have been many lessons about the natural history of IPF and clinical trial design, not only from the clinical development programs for nintedanib and pirfenidone, but also the numerous negative trials that predated these.

Summary

In this review, we attempt to synthesize how the field of IPF and clinical trials has evolved, the lessons learnt, and how these might inform and enable more efficient future clinical trial designs that are primed for success.

Therapeutic approach of IPF: A practical guide

For the first time after decades of disappointing results, physicians have now two equally effective treatment options to offer to patients with IPF. Translating the results of the trials into clinical practice proved to be not straightforward though, and some uncertainties are still limiting the management of the heterogeneous IPF population.

The timing for starting treatment might represent the first challenge for physicians approaching those patients newly diagnosed with IPFwho are asymptomatic and have little or no functional impairment. In fact, it is unclear whether they might benefit from any treatment since there is no marker to ascertain the future clinical course of these patients. Recent post-hoc analyses of pooled data from the late phase trials on the efficacy of both nintedanib and pirfenidone showed that in the placebo arms subgroups of patients with more preserved lung function at baseline had a similar rate of progression of the disease as compared to patients with more impaired lung function, while the treated subgroups showed to receive the same benefit from both drugs. This evidence would suggest that an early commencement of anti-fibrotic therapy in patients with IPF is advisable regardless of their functional impairment at baseline. Indeed, until effective markers for predicting disease course are validated, risks and potential benefits of an early start of treatment should be evaluated in the single individual, also keeping an eye on the high costs of the available therapies.

Duration of treatment represents a matter of debate, as it is unknown whether pirfenidone or nintedanib maintain their efficacy for periods longer than 2 years and whether they should be discontinued in those patients experiencing significant disease progression, as there are no markers of response to treatment available yet. A subgroup analysis of data from the CAPACITY and the ASCEND trials showed that in patients who progressed significantly during treatment (predicted FVC decline > 10% after 6 months), those who continued pirfenidone had a lower risk of subsequent FVC decline or death. As for Nintedanib, first evidence on the efficacy of long-term treatment has been recently provided by the open-label INPULSIS-ON trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of nintedanib 150 mg twice daily in patients who completed an INPULSIS trial. Such analysis suggested that patients continuing or starting nintedanib in INPULSIS-ON declined similarly to patients treated with nintedanib in INPULSIS, suggesting that the efficacy of nintedanib is kept for up to 3 years.

### Longitudinal clinical outcomes in a real-world population of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: the PROOF registry [^111R62o2]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient demographics

The PROOF registry enrolled 277 patients with IPF between October 2013 and January 2016. Eight patients were classified as incident cases, defined as a date of diagnosis on or after the date of inclusion in the registry. Although MDT diagnosis was an inclusion criterion for the registry, six patients had not undergone MDT diagnosis and data were missing for one patient. A total of 233 patients were treated with pirfenidone at any time during follow-up, for any duration of treatment. Of these 233 patients, 162 had already initiated treatment with pirfenidone at the time of registry inclusion and 71 patients initiated treatment with pirfenidone after registry inclusion. The remaining 44 patients enrolled in the PROOF registry did not receive pirfenidone at any time during follow-up. The mean time between diagnosis and initiation of pirfenidone treatment was 536.8 (standard deviation [SD] 745.2) days. A total of 28 patients were treated with nintedanib at any time during follow-up in the PROOF registry; of these, 26 had previously received pirfenidone.

The majority of the 277 patients with IPF included in the registry were male (76.9%), white (92.1%), and a former/current (66.8%/6.5%) smoker (Table 1). Mean age was 69.6 (SD 8.6) years. Previous treatment for IPF other than pirfenidone is shown in Table 1; nine patients in total had previously received nintedanib (four patients in the pirfenidone-treated population and five patients who had never received pirfenidone). Further details on demographic and baseline characteristics of this patient population have been recently reported.

### Effect of pirfenidone in patients with more advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111pKX1m]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Data from controlled clinical studies in patients with more advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) could inform clinical practice, but they are limited, since this sub-population is usually excluded from clinical trials. These exploratory post-hoc analyses of the open-label, long-term extension study RECAP (NCT00662038) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with more advanced IPF. Patients were categorised according to the extent of lung function impairment at baseline: more advanced (percent predicted FVC < 50% and/or DLco < 35%) and less advanced (percent predicted FVC ≥ 50% and DLco ≥ 35%). Overall, 596 patients with baseline FVC and/or DLco values available were included in the analyses; 187 patients had more advanced disease, and 409 patients had less advanced disease. Mean percent predicted FVC declined throughout 180weeks of treatment in both more and less advanced disease subgroups. Both subgroups exhibited a similar pattern of adverse events; however, adverse events related to IPF progression were experienced by a higher proportion of patients with more advanced versus less advanced disease. Discontinuation rates due to any reason, adverse events related to IPF progression, or deaths were each higher in the more advanced versus the less advanced disease subgroup. These analyses found that longer-term pirfenidone treatment resulted in a similar rate of lung function decline and safety profile in patients with more advanced versus less advanced IPF, and the data suggest that pirfenidone is efficacious, well tolerated, and a feasible treatment option in patients with more advanced IPF.

### Expert consensus on the management of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease [^115KNt9J]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Pirfenidone has been approved for use in patients with IPF, but not in other progressive fibrotic ILDs. The RELIEF trial, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective phase 2b trial of pirfenidone (2403 mg every day) in patients with fibrotic ILDs other than IPF, was terminated due to futility. However, the results suggest a treatment benefit for patients whose condition deteriorates despite conventional therapy, based on a slower decline of FVC% predicted from baseline compared with placebo. In addition, a trial evaluating the use of pirfenidone in combination with MMF in active and symptomatic SSc-ILD patients is ongoing. These results may further shift our understanding of how antifibrotic drugs can be more appropriately used in the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD.

Predicting the course of SSc-ILD and defining therapeutic goals remain challenging. Panelists agreed that stabilization, as well as improvement, in the signs and symptoms of ILD were indicative of treatment success. Recently, new American Thoracic Society guidelines have placed SSc-ILD within a subgroup of ILDs other than IPF which can manifest progressive pulmonary fibrosis, defining progression as a combination of at least two signs based on symptomological, radiological and physiological findings. For this Delphi, the panel considered changes in FVC, DL CO, HRCT, and symptoms over time as key indicators of disease progression, broadly aligned with this guidance as well as previously published reports. The panel was unable to arrive at a consensus on treatment duration. However, they agreed on the conditions under which patients should be weaned off therapy, including weaning over 1–2 years while conducting PFTs every 6 months.

ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guideline — progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) definition and treatment: PPF was defined as at least two of three criteria (worsening symptoms, radiological progression, and physiological progression) occurring within the past year with no alternative explanation in a patient with an interstitial lung disease (ILD) other than IPF. A conditional recommendation was made for nintedanib, and additional research into pirfenidone was recommended.

### Drug therapies for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review, Bayesian network meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis [^112oxcjV]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease with poor prognosis and a high economic burden for individuals and healthcare resources. Studies of the costs associated with the efficiency of IPF medications are scarce. We aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) and cost-effectiveness analysis to identify the optimum pharmacological strategy among all currently available IPF regimens.

Methods

We first performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched eight databases for eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published, in any language, between January 1, 1992 and July 31, 2022, that investigated the efficacy or tolerability (or both) of drug therapies for the treatment of IPF. The search was updated on February 1, 2023. Eligible RCTs were enrolled, with no restriction on dose, duration, or length of follow-up, if they included at least one of: all-cause mortality, acute exacerbation rate, disease progression rate, serious adverse events, and any adverse events under investigation. A subsequent Bayesian NMA within random-effects models was performed, followed by a cost-effectiveness analysis using the data obtained from our NMA, by developing a Markov model from the US payer's perspective. Assumptions were checked by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity approaches to identify sensitive factors. We prospectively registered the protocol (CRD42022340590) in PROSPERO.

Findings

51 publications comprising 12,551 participants with IPF were analysed for the NMA, and the findings indicated that pirfenidone and N -acetylcysteine (NAC) + pirfenidone were the most efficacious and tolerable. The pharmacoeconomic analysis showed that NAC + pirfenidone was associated with the highest potentiality of being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of US$150,000 and $200,000, on the basis of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality, with the probability ranging from 53% to 92%. NAC was the minimum cost agent. Compared with placebo, NAC + pirfenidone improved effectiveness by increasing QALYs by 7.02, and reducing DALYs by 7.10 and deaths by 8.40, whilst raising overall costs by $516,894.

Interpretation

This NMA and cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that NAC + pirfenidone is the most cost-effective option for treatment of IPF at WTP thresholds of $150,000 and $200,000. However, given that clinical practice guidelines have not addressed the application of this therapy, large well-designed and multicentre trials are warranted to provide a better picture of IPF management.

### Where do we stand with IPF treatment? [^114ZXCu2]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 2011 guideline update on the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) unfortunately did not strongly or weakly recommend any pharmacological agent for use. A strong recommendation was made against the use of corticosteroids, colchicine, cyclosporine A, interferon γ 1b, bosentan and etanercept. Treatments given 'weak no' recommendations were pirfenidone, anticoagulation, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) monotherapy, and triple-therapy with NAC, azathioprine and prednisone. For the latter group, this has meant that they are not to be considered suitable for use in the majority of patients but may be a reasonable treatment choice for a minority of patients. Pirfenidone received this recommendation despite data from a Cochrane meta-analysis supporting its efficacy, although at the time the recommendations were finalised results from two out of four trials used in the Cochrane meta-analysis were yet to be published. Of all medications studied for the treatment of IPF, pirfenidone currently has the highest grade of evidence to support its efficacy and is the only medication approved for use in this indication. Regardless of the 2011 recommendations, triple-therapy with NAC, azathioprine and prednisone is considered standard treatment by some treating physicians in the field of IPF. This is mainly due to data coming from the IFIGENIA study, which despite its numerous limitations suggested preservation of lung function in patients with IPF. A further study of this triple-therapy regimen was underway, but recently the triple-therapy arm of the study was stopped following a planned interim analysis that revealed an increased rate of death and hospitalisation compared with placebo. This regimen is still used in practice, but this is off-label treatment. The impact of data from these studies on the current treatment paradigm will be discussed, along with issues that remain to be addressed by the updated guidelines and the IPF community as a whole.

### A multicentre retrospective observational study on Polish experience of pirfenidone therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: the polExPIR study [^117UuAG5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The drug is available for Polish patients with IPF since 2017. The PolExPIR study aimed to describe the real-world data (RWD) on the Polish experience of pirfenidone therapy in IPF with respect to safety and efficacy profiles.

Methods

This was a multicentre, retrospective, observational study collecting clinical data of patients with IPF receiving pirfenidone from January 2017 to September 2019 across 10 specialized pulmonary centres in Poland. Data collection included baseline characteristics, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) results and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Longitudinal data on PFTs, 6MWT, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), treatment persistence, and survival were also collected up to 24 months post-inclusion.

Results

A total of 307 patients receiving pirfenidone were identified for analysis. The mean age was 68.83 (8.13) years and 77% were males. The median time from the first symptoms to IPF diagnosis was 15.5 (9.75–30) months and from diagnosis to start of pirfenidone treatment was 6 (2–23) months. Patients were followed on treatment for a median of 17 (12–22.75) months. Seventy-four patients (24.1%) required dose adjustments and 35 (11.4%) were chronically treated with different than the full recommended dose. A total of 141 patients (45.92%) discontinued therapy due to different reasons including ADRs (16.61%), death (8.79%), disease progression (6.51%), patient's own request (5.54%), neoplastic disease (3.91%) and lung transplantation (0.33%). Over up to 24 months of follow-up, the pulmonary function remained largely stable. The median annual decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) during the first year of pirfenidone therapy was −20 mL (−200–100) and during the second year was −120 mL (−340–30). Over a study period, 33 patients (10.75%) died.

Conclusions

The PolExPIR study is a source of longitudinal RWD on pirfenidone therapy in the Polish cohort of patients with IPF supporting its long-term acceptable safety and efficacy profiles and reinforce findings from the previous randomised clinical trials and observational studies.

### Dose modification and dose intensity during treatment with pirfenidone: analysis of pooled data from three multinational phase III trials [^1153Smxu]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating, progressive and fatal fibrosing lung disease of ageing. IPF is associated with a poor prognosis, with an estimated median survival of approximately 3 years, when untreated with antifibrotic drugs. The incidence and prevalence of IPF increase with age and are higher in men, and rates appear to be rising worldwide.

Pirfenidone is an oral antifibrotic agent conditionally recommended for the treatment of IPF in universally accepted treatment guidelines. Three pivotal, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase III trials evaluated pirfenidone in patients with IPF — the Clinical Studies Assessing Pirfenidone in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Research of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes (CAPACITY (Study 004 and Study 006)) and the Assessment of Pirfenidone to Confirm Efficacy and Safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ASCEND (Study 016)) trials. Pooled analyses of data from these three trials demonstrated that treatment with pirfenidone for 1 year slowed the disease progression as measured by changes in forced vital capacity (FVC), an independent predictor of mortality. Both pooled and meta-analyses of data from these three trials revealed a reduction in risk of mortality with pirfenidone compared with placebo over 120 weeks. Continuing treatment with pirfenidone after clinically meaningful progression of the disease may reduce the risk of a subsequent ≥ 10% absolute decline in FVC or death.

An integrated safety analysis from five clinical trials demonstrated that pirfenidone was generally well tolerated (median duration of exposure, 1.7 years (range, 1 week–9.9 years)). In the phase III trials, nearly all patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) over 1 year (98.7% and 96.5% in the pirfenidone and placebo groups, respectively). Notably, there were fewer serious TEAEs (20.5% vs 22.3% of patients) and fewer treatment-emergent deaths (2.2% vs 5.1% of patients) in the pirfenidone-treated group than in those receiving placebo. More patients in the pirfenidone group compared with the placebo group discontinued treatment prematurely due to TEAEs (11.9% vs 8.7%). Gastrointestinal and skin-related events were the most common TEAEs, which tended to occur early during treatment and decreased over time.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^113fmSoc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) management pathway — Treatment considerations should include both pharmacological options nintedanib and pirfenidone and nonpharmacological oxygen supplementation (if hypoxemic) and/or pulmonary rehabilitation, with evaluation and treatment of comorbidities including pulmonary hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive sleep apnea, and lung cancer, and involvement of palliative care for symptom control. Patients should be made aware of available clinical trials for possible enrollment at all stages. Patients at increased risk of mortality should be referred for lung transplantation at diagnosis, and patients should be evaluated every 3–6 months or more often for disease progression. To monitor for disease progression, consider pulmonary function testing and the 6‑minute‑walk test every 4–6 months or sooner if clinically indicated; consider annual high‑resolution computed tomography (HRCT) if there is clinical suspicion of worsening or risk of lung cancer; consider an HRCT if there is concern for an acute exacerbation; and consider a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram if there is a clinical concern for pulmonary embolism. Acute exacerbations may be treated with corticosteroids, mechanical ventilation is not recommended for the majority of patients with respiratory failure, and the pathway includes the step to Evaluate and list for lung transplantation.

### The role of pirfenidone in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1173TaUh]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease, with a median survival time of 2–5 years. The search for effective treatment has involved numerous clinical trials of investigational agents without significant success. However, in 2011, pirfenidone was the first drug to be approved for the treatment of IPF in Europe. Four key clinical trials supported the efficacy and tolerability of pirfenidone. In the two recently published Phase III CAPACITY trials evaluating pirfenidone (studies 004 and 006), patients with mild-to-moderate IPF were treated with pirfenidone or placebo. Study 004 and pooled analysis of primary endpoint data from both studies showed that pirfenidone significantly reduced decline in percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) compared with placebo (p < 0.005). Evidence of beneficial effects of pirfenidone treatment was also observed with regard to several secondary endpoints. Pirfenidone was generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal and photosensitivity. Data from the RECAP extension phase of the CAPACITY studies, where patients were treated with pirfenidone for up to three years, further support the manageable tolerability profile of pirfenidone. The efficacy data, coupled with long-term safety data, provide further evidence of a clinically-meaningful treatment effect with pirfenidone in patients with IPF.

### Efficacy of antifibrotic drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, in treatment of progressive pulmonary fibrosis in both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112bc2oK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Research questions To compare the efficacy of nintedanib and pirfenidone in the treatment of progressive pulmonary fibrosis; and to compare the efficacy of anti-fibrotic therapy (grouping nintedanib and pirfenidone together) in patients with IPF versus patients with progressive lung fibrosis not classified as IPF.

Study Design and Methods

A search of databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of pirfenidone or nintedanib in adult patients with IPF or non-IPF patients, and with extractable data on mortality or decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). Random effects meta-analyses were performed on changes in FVC and where possible on mortality in the selected studies.

Results

13 trials of antifibrotic therapy were pooled in a meta-analysis (with pirfenidone and nintedanib considered together as anti-fibrotic therapy). The change in FVC was expressed as a standardised difference to allow pooling of percentage and absolute changes. The mean effect size in the IPF studies was-0.305 (SE 0.043) (p < 0.001) and in the non-IPF studies the figures were-0.307 (SE 0.063) (p < 0.001). There was no evidence of any difference between the two groups for standardised rate of FVC decline (p = 0.979). Pooling IPF and non-IPF showed a significant reduction in mortality, with mean risk ratio of 07.01 in favour of antifibrotic therapy (p = 0.008). A separate analysis restricted to non-IPF did not show a significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.908 (0.547 to 1.508), p = 0.71.

Interpretation

Anti-fibrotic therapy offers protection against the rate of decline in FVC in progressive lung fibrosis, with similar efficacy shown between the two anti-fibrotic agents currently in clinical use. There was no significant difference in efficacy of antifibrotic therapy whether the underlying condition was IPF or non-IPF with progressive fibrosis, supporting the hypothesis of a common pathogenesis. The data in this analysis was insufficient to be confident about a reduction in mortality in non-IPF with anti-fibrotic therapy. Trial Registration PROSPERO, registration number CRD42021266046.

### Use of supplemental oxygen therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: an observational real-life study in 16 003 patients [^112ztSXE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology, causing a significant decline in lung function and worsening dyspnoea, leading to poor quality of life. When untreated, the median survival time from diagnosis is 2–4 years. The disease mainly occurs in older adults, with an incidence estimated at 2.8–18 cases per 100 000 people in Europe and North America.

Antifibrotic treatments available since 2012 (pirfenidone) and 2015 (nintedanib) decrease lung function decline in patients with IPFand improve overall survival, although they do not stop disease progression. Both drugs are recommended for the treatment of IPF following a multidisciplinary discussion. In France, antifibrotics are reimbursed to treat patients with forced vital capacity ≥ 50% and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 30%; however, a significant proportion of patients remain untreated, while guidelines for the use of antifibrotics in patients with IPF were published in France in 2013 and updated in 2017 and 2023. National and international guidelines recommend the use of supplemental, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in patients with chronic respiratory failure including IPF at rest and/or on exertion to improve exercise capacity and health-related quality of life. Specifically, French criteria to initiate LTOT in IPF patients are the following: PaO2 ≤ 55 mm Hg (7.3 kPa) measured at rest in a stable state on two occasions; or PaO2 between 56 and 60 mm Hg (7.3–8.0 kPa) in the presence of at least one of the following criteria: polycythaemia (haematocrit > 55%), signs of pulmonary hypertension, documented signs of right heart failure, non-apnoeic nocturnal desaturations. However, studies highlight some practical and social barriers to its use. To date, data regarding the real-life use of LTOT in patients with IPF, and its association with survival, are sparse.

The objective of the study was to assess the real-life use of LTOT in patients with IPF. Specifically, the aims were to describe the proportion of patients who received LTOT, their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the time to initiation and the duration of LTOT, according to whether they were receiving an antifibrotic treatment or not. In an exploratory analysis, the risk of death was also compared between periods during which patients were using LTOT to periods during which they were not using LTOT over the course of the disease, accounting for antifibrotic treatment use.

### The role of pirfenidone in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115ZadgK]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Tolerability in patients with IPF

Regarding safety, pirfenidone was shown to be generally well tolerated at the 2403 mg/day dose in the CAPACITY studies. There was no significant difference in the number of patients experiencing serious treatment-emergent adverse events between the pirfenidone (pooled data) and placebo groups (33% and 31% respectively). The majority of patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, with the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal, skin disorders and dizziness. These adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of pirfenidone and were usually mild to moderate in severity. Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 15% of pirfenidone-treated patients and 9% of placebo-treated patients. The most common cause of study discontinuation was IPF (3% of patients in each group). The only other causes of treatment discontinuation in the pooled pirfenidone group was nausea (1%) and rash (1%).

An extension phase of the CAPACITY studies (called RECAP) was designed to assess the safety of pirfenidone beyond the duration of the Phase III studies. At Week 72 of the RECAP extension study, patients had been treated with pirfenidone for a mean duration of 2.9 years (range, 1–4). A number of patients (n = 114) had been treated at the full dose for at least three years. Data from the RECAP extension study confirm the tolerability of pirfenidone.

Common adverse events and those considered treatment-emergent occurred in a very similar proportion of patients to those reported during the CAPACITY studies. Almost all patients (98%) reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event, compared with 99% of patients in the CAPACITY studies across both treatment arms. Similar proportions of patients in RECAP experienced serious adverse events to those in the CAPACITY studies (33% vs 33%). The incidence of common adverse events was very similar to that observed in the CAPACITY studies, and were generally mild to moderate in severity. No new or unexpected safety issues were observed.

Rash or photosensitivity occurred in fewer patients from the RECAP extension study than in the CAPACITY studies (20% vs 44%). This was more common among patients initiating treatment with pirfenidone compared with those who were continuing with treatment (28% vs 12%). These data provide further important information on treatment with pirfenidone and demonstrate its tolerability.

### Effect of pirfenidone on mortality: pooled analyses and meta-analyses of clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113QZYtK]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In clinical trials of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, rates of all-cause mortality are low. Thus prospective mortality trials are logistically very challenging, justifying the use of pooled analyses or meta-analyses. We did pooled analyses and meta-analyses of clinical trials of pirfenidone versus placebo to determine the effect of pirfenidone on mortality outcomes over 120 weeks.

Methods

We did a pooled analysis of the combined patient populations of the three global randomised phase 3 trials of pirfenidone versus placebo-Clinical Studies Assessing Pirfenidone in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Research of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes (CAPACITY 004 and 006; trial durations 72–120 weeks) and Assessment of Pirfenidone to Confirm Efficacy and Safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ASCEND 016; 52 weeks)-for all-cause mortality, treatment-emergent all-cause mortality, idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality, and treatment-emergent idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality at weeks 52, 72, and 120. We also did meta-analyses of these data and data from two Japanese trials of pirfenidone versus placebo-Shionogi Phase 2 (SP2) and Shionogi Phase 3 (SP3; trial durations 36–52 weeks).

Findings

At week 52, the relative risk of death for all four mortality outcomes was significantly lower in the pirfenidone group than in the placebo group in the pooled population (all-cause mortality hazard ratio [HR] 0.52 [95% CI 0.31–0.87; p = 0.0107]; treatment-emergent all-cause mortality 0.45 [0.24–0.83; 0.0094]; idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality 0.35 [0.17–0.72; 0.0029]; treatment-emergent idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality 0.32 [0.14–0.76; 0.0061]). Consistent with the pooled analysis, meta-analyses for all-cause mortality at week 52 also showed a clinically relevant and significant risk reduction in the pirfenidone group compared with the placebo group. Over 120 weeks, we noted significant differences in the pooled analysis favouring pirfenidone therapy compared with placebo for treatment-emergent all-cause mortality (p = 0.0420), idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related mortality (0.0237), and treatment-emergent idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-related (0.0132) mortality; similar results were shown by meta-analyses.

Interpretation

Several analytic approaches demonstrated that pirfenidone therapy is associated with a reduction in the relative risk of mortality compared with placebo over 120 weeks.

### Pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CAPACITY): two randomised trials [^116HXrAC]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal lung disease with inevitable loss of lung function. The CAPACITY programme (studies 004 and 006) was designed to confirm the results of a phase 2 study that suggested that pirfenidone, a novel antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory drug, reduces deterioration in lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Methods

In two concurrent trials (004 and 006), patients (aged 40–80 years) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were randomly assigned to oral pirfenidone or placebo for a minimum of 72 weeks in 110 centres in Australia, Europe, and North America. In study 004, patients were assigned in a 2:1:2 ratio to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, pirfenidone 1197 mg/day, or placebo; in study 006, patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day or placebo. The randomisation code (permuted block design) was computer generated and stratified by region. All study personnel were masked to treatment group assignment until after final database lock. Treatments were administered orally, 801 mg or 399 mg three times a day. The primary endpoint was change in percentage predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) at week 72. Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00287729 and NCT00287716.

Findings

In study 004, 174 of 435 patients were assigned to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, 87 to pirfenidone 1197 mg/day, and 174 to placebo. In study 006, 171 of 344 patients were assigned to pirfenidone 2403 mg/day, and 173 to placebo. All patients in both studies were analysed. In study 004, pirfenidone reduced decline in FVC (p = 0.001). Mean FVC change at week 72 was -8.0% (SD 16.5) in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and -12.4% (18.5) in the placebo group (difference 4.4%, 95% CI 0.7 to 9.1); 35 (20%) of 174 versus 60 (35%) of 174 patients, respectively, had a decline of at least 10%. A significant treatment effect was noted at all timepoints from week 24 and in an analysis over all study timepoints (p = 0.0007). Mean change in percentage FVC in the pirfenidone 1197 mg/day group was intermediate to that in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day and placebo groups. In study 006, the difference between groups in FVC change at week 72 was not significant (p = 0.501). Mean change in FVC at week 72 was -9.0% (SD 19.6) in the pirfenidone group and -9.6% (19.1) in the placebo group, and the difference between groups in predicted FVC change at week 72 was not significant (0.6%, -3.5 to 4.7); however, a consistent pirfenidone effect was apparent until week 48 (p = 0.005) and in an analysis of all study timepoints (p = 0.007). Patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group had higher incidences of nausea (125 [36%] of 345 vs 60 [17%] of 347), dyspepsia (66 [19%] vs 26 [7%]), vomiting (47 [14%] vs 15 [4%]), anorexia (37 [11%] vs 13 [4%]), photosensitivity (42 [12%] vs 6 [2%]), rash (111 [32%] vs 40 [12%]), and dizziness (63 [18%] vs 35 [10%]) than did those in the placebo group. Fewer overall deaths (19 [6%] vs 29 [8%]) and fewer deaths related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (12 [3%] vs 25 [7%]) occurred in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day groups than in the placebo groups.

Interpretation

The data show pirfenidone has a favourable benefit risk profile and represents an appropriate treatment option for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Future directions for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) emphasize an absolute need for further and long-term studies across all spectrums of functional impairment, especially for drugs with conditional recommendations such as pirfenidone and nintedanib; while warfarin for IPF without other indications is not beneficial, studies of other anticoagulants may be worthwhile, and triple therapy with prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine is harmful though the harmful component(s) and dosing are unknown, and the feasibility of another trial of triple therapy is questionable.

Conclusions — treatment recommendations update in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) state that significant advances have been made since the 2011 evidence-based guideline, that new evidence for previously conditional (i.e., weak) recommendations has been reviewed with updated recommendations, and that although no pharmacologic interventions received strong recommendations, conditional recommendations have been made for novel agents such as pirfenidone and nintedanib and for antacid treatment; clinicians should individualize decisions with patients and be cautious when comparing the relative net benefit of interventions.

### Antifibrotic therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: time to treat [^1168HBsq]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with a dismal prognosis. The average life expectancy of untreated patients with IPF is only 3 to 4years. Decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with IPF appears to be almost linear, with patients with well-preserved FVC at baseline experiencing the same rate of decline in FVC as patients with more advanced disease. Two antifibrotic therapies have been approved for the treatment of IPF: nintedanib and pirfenidone. These drugs slow decline in lung function and reduce the risk of acute respiratory deteriorations, which are associated with very high morbidity and mortality. Individual clinical trials have not been powered to show reductions in mortality, but analyses of pooled data from clinical trials, as well as observational studies, suggest that antifibrotic therapies improve life expectancy. Despite this, many individuals with IPF remain untreated. In many cases, this is because the physician perceives that the disease is stable and so does not warrant therapy, or has concerns over the potential side-effects of antifibrotic drugs. There remains a need to educate pulmonologists that IPF is a progressive, irreversible and fatal disease and that prompt treatment is critical to preserving patients' lung function and improving outcomes. Most individuals can tolerate antifibrotic therapy, and dose adjustment has been shown to be effective at reducing side effects without compromising efficacy. In addition to anti-fibrotic therapies, individuals with IPF benefit from a holistic approach to their care that includes symptom management and supportive care tailored to the needs of the individual. An animation illustrating the themes covered in this article will be available at: http://www.usscicomms.com/respiratory/maher/treatment-of-IPF.

### Impact of antifibrotic therapy on mortality and acute exacerbation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZJrb4]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Nintedanib and pirfenidone are two antifibrotic medications currently approved for slowing the rate of lung function decline in IPF, but data on treatment effect on mortality and risk of acute exacerbation (AE) remains limited or unknown.

Research Question

Does antifibrotic treatment decrease risk of mortality and AE?

Study Design and Methods

A comprehensive search of several databases, including Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, was conducted. Studies were included if they were original articles comparing mortality or AE events in IPF patients with and without antifibrotic treatment. Relative risk (RR) with 95%CI was pooled using random-effects meta-analyses with inverse variance method, assessing two primary outcomes of all-cause mortality and AE risk.

Results

A total of 12,956 patients across 26 studies (eight randomized controlled trials and 18 cohort studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Antifibrotic treatment was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality with a pooled RR of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.45–0.66) and I 2 of 82%. This effect was consistent across additional subgroup analyses, including stratification by study type, risk of bias, duration of follow-up, and antifibrotic subtype. Antifibrotic treatment also reduced the risk of AE, with a pooled RR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.53–0.76), and I 2 of 0%. Effect on AE risk was consistent across subgroup analyses by study type and for nintedanib but not for pirfenidone.

Interpretation

Antifibrotic treatment appears to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and AE in IPF. Despite greater heterogeneity with pooled analysis, its effect was robust in subgroup analyses by study type, duration of follow-up, and antifibrotic subtype.

### Where do we stand with IPF treatment? [^112hgBrW]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Despite receiving 'weak no' recommendations in the updated guidelines on treating patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), two key treatment options are pirfenidone and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and both are used in clinical practice. The efficacy of pirfenidone is supported by a number of Phase III trials as well as a Cochrane meta-analysis. Tolerability data are also provided by clinical trials and a long-term extension phase of these studies. Pirfenidone is approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate IPF. NAC-based therapy has no such approval, but is commonly used to treat patients. A Phase III trial suggested some benefit of the NAC, prednisone and azathioprine regimen for IPF patients, but the study had many limitations. A further study to investigate this regimen, compared with a placebo alone arm, was recently stopped due to increased mortality in the triple-therapy arm. Discussion of these data and recent findings highlight the importance of a further update to the existing guidelines, so that IPF specialists can provide the most up-to-date advice and treatment to patients in clinical practice.

### The role of pirfenidone in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116f443k]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease, with a median survival time of 2–5 years. The search for effective treatment has involved numerous clinical trials of investigational agents without significant success. However, in 2011, pirfenidone was the first drug to be approved for the treatment of IPF in Europe. Four key clinical trials supported the efficacy and tolerability of pirfenidone.

In the two recently published Phase III CAPACITY trials evaluating pirfenidone (studies 004 and 006), patients with mild-to-moderate IPF were treated with pirfenidone or placebo. Study 004 and pooled analysis of primary endpoint data from both studies showed that pirfenidone significantly reduced decline in percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) compared with placebo (p < 0.005). Evidence of beneficial effects of pirfenidone treatment was also observed with regard to several secondary endpoints. Pirfenidone was generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal and photosensitivity. Data from the RECAP extension phase of the CAPACITY studies, where patients were treated with pirfenidone for up to three years, further support the manageable tolerability profile of pirfenidone. The efficacy data, coupled with long-term safety data, provide further evidence of a clinically-meaningful treatment effect with pirfenidone in patients with IPF.

### Pirfenidone capsule, 267 mg [^112PDyWY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of pirfenidone was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 277) in patients with IPF. Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2. Study 2 compared treatment with either pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 174) or pirfenidone 1197 mg/day (n = 87) to placebo (n = 174), while Study 3 compared pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 171) to placebo (n = 173). Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks. Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (% FVC) from baseline to study end, measured at 52 weeks in Study 1, and at 72 weeks in Studies 2 and 3.

Studies 1, 2 and 3 enrolled adult patients who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF (with or without accompanying surgical lung biopsy), without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis for interstitial lung disease. Eligible patients were to have % FVC greater than or equal to 50% at baseline and a percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) greater than or equal to 30% (Study 1) or 35% (Studies 2 and 3) at baseline. In all three trials, over 80% of patients completed study treatment.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^112mLjbe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Nintedanib

- We suggest nintedanib for the treatment of PPF in patients who have failed standard management for fibrotic ILD, other than IPF (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Remarks: Standard management will differ from patient to patient. In many patients it will be immunosuppressive treatment in an attempt to stabilize or reverse initial disease, but this is not a prerequisite, as in some patients, standard management could be antigen remediation or observation. Besides this, it should be acknowledged that in many ILDs, evidence-based guidance for standard of care is lacking; hence, standard of care may vary from region to region.
- We recommend research into the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of nintedanib in specific types of non-IPF ILD manifesting PPF.

B

Nintedanib is another antifibrotic agent that, like pirfenidone, slows disease progression in IPF. It is an oral intracellular tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks pathways involved in fibrogenesis, which was recommended for treatment of IPF in prior guidelines.

The committee asked, "Should patients with PPF be treated with nintedanib?" Given that many different types of ILD can manifest PPF, this question was also asked for the same eight specific types of ILD that were described in the pirfenidone section above. Critical outcomes included mortality and disease progression (determined by change in FVC). Important outcomes included respiratory symptoms (determined by changes in the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire) and AEs.

S

The systematic review that informed the committee's recommendation is published independently; we summarize the salient findings. The systematic review identified one randomized trial and a post hoc analysis of the trial. The randomized trial (INBUILD) randomly assigned 663 patients with PPF to nintedanibor placebo for 52 weeks, while the post hoc analysis compared the effects of nintedanib with placebo in the individual types of ILD that were manifesting PPF. The type of ILD was determined by the investigators at each study site without prespecified diagnostic criteria being provided to the site investigators, rather than through a central review process, so diagnostic variation across institutions was possible.

### Pirfenidone reduces respiratory-related hospitalizations in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111XeUef]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Respiratory-related hospitalizations of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are more frequent than those for acute IPF exacerbations and are associated with poor outcomes.

Objectives

To compare the risk of nonelective hospitalization by type (all-cause, respiratory related, and non-respiratory related) and death after hospitalization with use of pirfenidone versus placebo over 52 weeks using data derived from three phase III IPF clinical trials.

Methods

Individual patient data was pooled from three phase III randomized, placebo-controlled studies of pirfenidone for IPF (the two CAPACITY [Clinical Studies Assessing Pirfenidone in IPF: Research of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes] trials and the ASCEND [Assessment of Pirfenidone to Confirm Efficacy and Safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis] trial), including all patients randomized to pirfenidone 2,403 mg/d (n = 623) or placebo (n = 624). The risk of hospitalization over 52 weeks was compared using standard time-to-event methods. Among those hospitalized, the risk of death after hospitalization was compared with adjustment for treatment group propensity.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 1,247 patients (692 from the CAPACITY trials and 555 from the ASCEND trial) were included in the pooled analysis. Pirfenidone was associated with lower risk of respiratory-related hospitalization than placebo (7% vs. 12%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.77; P = 0.001), but all-cause (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; P = 0.528) or non-respiratory-related hospitalization (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.92–1.88; P = 0.145) was not. Among those hospitalized for any reason, treatment with pirfenidone was associated with lower risk of death after hospitalization up to 52 weeks after randomization, but this association was no longer significant with longer follow-up.

Conclusions

In a pooled analysis of three phase III IPF clinical trials, patients receiving pirfenidone had a lower risk of nonelective respiratory-related hospitalization over the course of 1 year. The effect of pirfenidone on death after hospitalization is uncertain.

### A phase 3 trial of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112Usz5K]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study ASCEND (pirfenidone) was published by King TE Jr and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the trial question was: what is the role of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis? In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the population was: 555 patients (120 female, 435 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The key exclusion criteria were history of malignancy, severe hepatic impairment, ESRD, unstable deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary disease, pregnancy or lactation, or history of alcohol or substance abuse in the past 2 years. In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the interventions were: n = 278 pirfenidone (2403 mg PO per day for 52 weeks) n = 277 placebo (matching placebo PO for 52 weeks). In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or a ≥ 10% decline in FVC at 52 weeks (16.5% vs. 31.8%; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.83). In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in change in 6-minute walk distance or death at 52 weeks (25.9% vs. 35.7%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.43) No significant difference in death from any cause (4% vs. 7.2%; HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.15). In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in grade 3 GI adverse events (5.4% vs. 1.4%) and grade 3 skin-related adverse events (1.8% vs. 0.4%). In the ASCEND (pirfenidone) study, the conclusion was: in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pirfenidone was superior to placebo with respect to death or a ≥ 10% decline in FVC at 52 weeks.

### Antifibrotic treatment adherence, efficacy and outcomes for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in Spain: a real-world evidence study [^1141Ybdy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disorder associated with increased mortality and morbidity. There are currently two drugs approved for IPF but their safety and efficacy profile in real-world settings in Spain is not well understood.

Methods

An observational, multicentre, prospective study was carried out among patients with IPF who started treatment with pirfenidone or nintedanib from 2015 to 2021. Data regarding clinical characteristics, drug adherence, safety profiles and clinical outcomes between these two drugs were collected.

Results

232 patients were included in the analysis. There were no meaningful differences between both groups at baseline. Patients who started pirfenidone showed a decreased risk for treatment withdrawal compared with those starting nintedanib (HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.94; p = 0.002)). Time to first adverse event and all-cause mortality was similar between study groups. Risk factors for withdrawal were female sex, diarrhoea and photosensitivity.

Conclusions

in this real-world study, both pirfenidone and nintedanib showed similar efficacy profiles. Pirfenidone was associated with less treatment discontinuations due to side effects.

### Where do we stand with IPF treatment? [^113DZ9ha]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Based on the evidence available to date, pirfenidone is proven effective and generally well tolerated in the treatment of patients with IPF. In addition, the tolerability of pirfenidone has been demonstrated in clinical trials and a long-term extension phase. However, an inherent issue with approval of pirfenidone in Europe is that it is indicated for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. The approval in these patients was based on the functional criteria used in the CAPACITY studies, which were: FVC ≥ 50% of predicted value, DL CO ≥ 35% of predicted value, and a 6MWT distance of ≥ 150 m. In clinical practice it is therefore a challenge to define patients with mild-to-moderate disease, particularly in the absence of any current staging or classification system. It is essential that we determine the best way to classify our patients with IPF so that we can give them the most appropriate treatment based on their disease stage. The need for an update to the 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT recommendations document is highlighted by the fact that four published studies and a Cochrane meta-analysis support the patient benefit associated with pirfenidone treatment, along with further safety data from the long-term RECAP Study. In addition, NAC-based therapy is commonly used to treat IPF patients, and we await the results from the PANTHER-IPF study regarding the NAC monotherapy arm.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management? [^115qhoSS]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

IPF treatment guideline development is an archetypal example to examine the positive and negative impacts of evidence-based guidelines. The 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guideline is an excellent summary of the available evidence and provides and implements a new definition of IPF. By upgrading the utility of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and defining the radiological usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, the guideline also significantly changed the diagnostic process, eliminating the need for a surgical lung biopsy for patients with a definite usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on HRCT. Nevertheless, interpretation of HRCT is often not unequivocal, and thus diagnostic uncertainty has increased in many patients. A surgical lung biopsy is performed to rule out uncertainty; however, it is not feasible for a significant number of patients with IPF due to disease severity, comorbidities, frailty, or cost. The multidisciplinary discussion proposed as the gold standard in the guideline leads to a choice of various diagnostic probabilities – definite, probable, and possible; however, the therapeutic implications are defined only for the definite diagnostic category of IPF. The most recent update of the IPF guideline focused on disease treatment and recommended the two available drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, for the majority of IPF patients. However, evidence-based IPF guidelines do not address the treatment of patients with a "probable" or "possible" IPF diagnosis. In this context, it is also imperative to comprehend that guidelines themselves are an intervention in clinical practice, with both potentially beneficial and harmful consequences. Despite this, the net effect of guidelines after their implementation remains to be addressed.

### Recommendations on treatment for IPF [^111VSGni]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Patient management in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is largely based on societal guidelines and recommendations. A recent update by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS), Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) and Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) provided updated guidance on the diagnosis and management of IPF, along with recommendations on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches to patient management. The treatment guidance is based on GRADE criteria, which rates the quality of evidence according to previously published methodology. Here we discuss how to interpret the recent guideline updates and the implications of this guidance for clinical practice. In addition we discuss the assessment and recommendations for a number of pharmacological agents that have been the focus of clinical trials over the past years. Although no single pharmacological agent was recommended by the guidelines committee, we discuss how since then, more recent data have resulted in the approval of pirfenidone in Europe, and preliminary negative findings regarding the safety of a triple therapy regimen consisting of prednisone, azathioprine and N-acetylcysteine have raised the question of whether it is no longer a treatment option. As clinicians, we must interpret the available guidance and recommendations as we consider each individual patient and as we discuss the available clinical data and the patient's own preferences in our approach to the management of this disease.

### Long-term treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a comparative, real-world cohort study [^114UN8WB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Limited data exists on the long-term comparative efficacy and tolerability of pirfenidone and nintedanib, the two approved treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Methods

We retrospectively enrolled IPF patients treated with either pirfenidone or nintedanib at our centre between 2017 and 2023. Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time to death or ≥ 10% decline in % predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and continuous FVC decline were compared between groups defined by antifibrotic type or treatment intensity (full or reduced). Time to drug dose reduction was also compared. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier curves with Log-Rank tests, Cox proportional hazards models and linear mixed-effects models.

Results

A total of 292 IPF patients treated with pirfenidone (n = 142) or nintedanib (n = 150) were included with a mean follow-up time of 32.3 months (SD = 14.5). No significant differences in efficacy were observed between groups by antifibrotic type. Dose reduction was more frequent in the nintedanib group (59.3%) than pirfenidone group (16.9%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that patients on nintedanib had a 4-fold higher risk of dose reduction compared to those on pirfenidone (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between patients with dose reduction and those maintaining the full dose, both in the overall population and when stratified by antifibrotic type.

Conclusion

Nintedanib and pirfenidone exhibited similar long-term efficacy. Dose adjustment was more frequent with nintedanib, however it did not have impact on clinical outcomes.

### Real world experiences: pirfenidone is well tolerated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1165Kz2f]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating condition with life expectancy of two to five years from diagnosis. Treatment strategies for IPF are disappointingly limited and pirfenidone is currently the only licensed drug that has been shown to reduce the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) at six months. We demonstrate our experience in prescribing pirfenidone in a single centre observational study of forty patients involved in a named patient programme (NPP) from September 2011 to January 2013. We demonstrate that improved adherence and compliance can be achieved by specialist nurse and clinician review, support and education of the patient. Twenty three of 40 (58%) patients experienced predominantly gastrointestinal adverse effects. Importantly we have enhanced patient adherence and compliance from an initial discontinuation rate of six patients (15%) at the beginning of the study to a zero discontinuation rate in the subsequent ten months. This study shows that in the real world pirfenidone is well tolerated and with expert regular specialist review adherence can be optimised and improved.

### Management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112UUQ9C]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: Provide information for pharmacists on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and its treatment. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All articles with data from randomized controlled trials of nintedanib or pirfenidone were reviewed. Data Synthesis: IPF is a progressive and ultimately fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by decline in lung function and worsening dyspnea. It is uncommon and mainly occurs in individuals aged > 60 years, particularly men with a history of smoking. Nintedanib and pirfenidone were approved in the United States for the treatment of IPF in 2014 and received conditional recommendations in the 2015 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association treatment guidelines. These drugs slow the progression of IPF by reducing the rate of decline in lung function. Their adverse event profile is characterized mainly by gastrointestinal events, which can be managed through dose adjustment and symptom management. Management of IPF should also include smoking cessation, vaccinations, and supportive care such as patient education, pulmonary rehabilitation, and the use of supplemental oxygen as well as optimizing the management of comorbidities. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review provides clinical pharmacists with information on the course of IPF, what can be expected of current treatments, and how to help patients manage their drug therapy. Conclusions: IPF is a progressive disease, but treatments are available that can slow the progression of the disease. Clinical pharmacists can play an important role in the care of patients with IPF through patient education, monitoring medication compliance and safety, ensuring drugs for comorbidities are optimized, and preventive strategies such as immunizations.

### Safety of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: integrated analysis of cumulative data from 5 clinical trials [^114h2e2s]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Pirfenidone is an oral antifibrotic agent that has been shown to reduce the decline in lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We performed an integrated analysis of safety data from five clinical trials evaluating pirfenidone in patients with IPF.

Methods

All patients treated with pirfenidone in the three multinational Phase 3 studies (CAPACITY (studies 004 and 006), ASCEND (study 016)) and two ongoing open-label studies (study 002 and study 012 (RECAP)) were included in the analysis. Safety outcomes were assessed during the period from the first dose until 28days after the last dose of study drug.

Results

A total of 1299 patients were included in the analysis. The cumulative total exposure to pirfenidone was 3160 person exposure years (PEY). The median duration of exposure was 1.7years (range 1week to 9.9years), and the mean (± SD) daily dose was 2053.8 (± 484.9) mg. Gastrointestinal events (nausea (37.6%), diarrhoea (28.1%), dyspepsia (18.4%), vomiting (15.9%)) and rash (25.0%) were the most common adverse events; these were generally mild to moderate in severity and without significant clinical consequence. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 40/1299 (3.1%) patients (adjusted incidence, 2.3 per 100 PEY). Elevations were generally transient and reversible with dose modification or discontinuation.

Conclusions

A comprehensive analysis of safety outcomes in a large and well-defined cohort of 1299 patients with IPF who were followed prospectively for up to 9.9years demonstrated that long-term treatment with pirfenidone is safe and generally well tolerated.

### Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a position paper from a nordic expert group [^112DGjjd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal progressive lung disease occurring in adults. In the last decade, the results of a number of clinical trials based on the updated disease classification have been published. The registration of pirfenidone and nintedanib, the first two pharmacological treatment options approved for IPF, marks a new chapter in the management of patients with this disease. Other nonpharmacological treatments such as lung transplantation, rehabilitation and palliation have also been shown to be beneficial for these patients. In this review, past and present management is discussed based on a comprehensive literature search. A treatment algorithm is presented based on available evidence and our overall clinical experience. In addition, unmet needs with regard to treatment are highlighted and discussed. We describe the development of various treatment options for IPF from the first consensus to recent guidelines based on evidence from large-scale, multinational, randomized clinical trials, which have led to registration of the first drugs for IPF.

### Qualitative European survey of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: patients' perspectives of the disease and treatment [^116V7mcx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

'Living with IPF and an exploration of Esbriet® – a new treatment' was an exploratory, qualitative, real-world survey of European patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who were receiving treatment with pirfenidone prior to its commercial availability. The aim of the survey was to probe the impact of IPF on patients' quality of life; the role of healthcare professionals and caregivers; the information needs of both patients and their caregivers; and patients' perceptions of pirfenidone as a new treatment option for IPF.

Methods

Patients from the UK, Germany and Italy, with a diagnosis of IPF (duration > 3 months), who were being treated with pirfenidone, were recruited from patient support groups, specialist centres and advocacy groups. Semi-structured, qualitative, in-depth patient interviews of 1-h duration were conducted by an independent researcher. Patients were initially asked about their experiences of living with IPF and then prompted to describe their experiences of taking pirfenidone. Techniques utilised included: the bubble-speech technique; the icon cards projective exercise; and the free association exercise. All interviews were transcribed and analysed by an independent researcher.

Results

Forty-five patients (71% male) were interviewed (mean age 68.5 years; mean time since diagnosis 3.5 years); 87% of patients reported that diagnosis took > 1 year. Patients reported that IPF had a significant physical and emotional impact on their quality of life. The beneficial role played by caregivers and interstitial lung disease specialist nurses (where available) was specifically highlighted. Although most patients were keen for information on IPF, this was often of poor quality, out of date, or in English only. Patients' perceptions of pirfenidone were largely positive and associated with 'hope' but were also influenced by the level of side effects experienced.

Conclusions

This survey highlights the impact of IPF on patients' lives, and the need to adequately support both patients and their caregivers. These findings demonstrate the value of seeking patients' perspectives of a chronic disease such as IPF and how this information can be used to guide improvements in care, to best support the needs of patients with this devastating condition.

### Antifibrotics and reduced mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: immortal time bias [^1174KxWf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Pirfenidone and nintedanib, antifibrotic medications approved for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), have been shown to slow the decline in lung function and are recommended by international treatment guidelines.

Meta-analyses of randomized trials of this treatment have investigated their effects on reducing mortality in patients with IPF, with rather divergent conclusions. Indeed, whereas a meta-analysis concluded that neither pirfenidone nor nintedanib is associated with lower mortality, others found reduced mortality only with nintedanib but not pirfenidone, or vice-versa. Meta-analyses conducted specifically among trials for only one of the antifibrotic drugs concluded a mortality benefit.

On the other hand, observational studies have consistently reported remarkable reductions in mortality with antifibrotic medications. Such remarkable effects from observational studies are often the result of time-related biases, such as immortal time bias that tends to considerably exaggerate the benefit of drugs, including those used to treat respiratory diseases.

Given these inconsistencies, we reviewed the observational studies examining the effect of antifibrotics on mortality in IPF, focusing on time-related biases that could explain these discrepancies.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^117R8Wcu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pirfenidone for progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) and unclassifiable interstitial lung disease (uILD) was evaluated in two randomized trials enrolling 253 and 127 patients with follow-up of 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, with the latter terminated early for futility; aggregated meta-analysis showed pirfenidone reduced the decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) by 100 mL and in percentage predicted FVC by 2.3% over 24 weeks, and in the uILD trial decreased by 1.6 times the likelihood that percentage predicted FVC would decline > 5% and by 1.9 times the likelihood it would decline > 10%. Progression-free survival and mortality were not statistically different in either trial, and changes in FEV1 and total lung capacity (TLC) were not significant, although the RELIEF trial reported pirfenidone reduced the mean decrease in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) by 0.40 mmol/kPa/min and the uILD trial found a 3.7-times reduced risk of a Dlco decline of > 15% with no significant difference in mean change in percentage predicted DLCO. Across trials, pirfenidone attenuated decline in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) by 25.2 m, while the number of patients with 6MWD decline > 50 m was unchanged, and there were no significant differences in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, UCSD-SOBQ, or visual analog cough scores. Adverse events (AEs) increased with pirfenidone, including gastrointestinal discomfort 1.8 times, photosensitivity 4.9 times, any AE 1.2 times, and treatment-related AEs 1.5 times, and the quality of evidence for all outcomes was rated as very low.

### Combination therapy: the future of management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis? [^116XwUyX]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. Future clinical assessment will probably include add-on trials in which a new drug is combined with an intervention with established efficacy; this development is in turn likely to herald the use of combination regimens in clinical practice. Personalised medicine (the selection of monotherapies on the basis of individualised biomarker signal) is an intrinsically attractive alternative approach, but is unlikely to be useful in routine management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the medium-term future because of the complex nature of the disease's pathogenesis. In this Personal View, we review the pleiotropic nature of disease pathogenesis in idiopathic pulmonary disease, the use of combination regimens in other selected chronic lung diseases, and the conceptual basis for combination therapies in interstitial lung disorders other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. On the basis of these considerations, and the emergence of data from add-on trials, we believe that the future of management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lies in the development of combination regimens.

### Sildenafil added to pirfenidone in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and risk of pulmonary hypertension: a phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study-rationale and study design [^112WXXW5]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is commonly observed in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Despite the availability of therapies for both IPF and PH, none are approved for PH treatment in the context of significant pulmonary disease. This study will investigate the use of sildenafil added to pirfenidone in patients with advanced IPF and risk of PH, who represent a group with a high unmet medical need.

Methods

This Phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is actively enrolling patients and will study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sildenafil or placebo in patients with advanced IPF and intermediate or high probability of Group 3 PH who are receiving a stable dose of pirfenidone. Patients with advanced IPF (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ≤ 40% predicted) and risk of Group 3 PH (defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg with pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg on a previous right-heart catheterisation [RHC], or intermediate/high probability of Group 3 PH as defined by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines) are eligible. In the absence of a previous RHC, patients with an echocardiogram showing a peak tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity ≥ 2.9 m/s can enrol if all other criteria are met. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with disease progression over a 52-week treatment period. Safety will be evaluated descriptively.

Discussion

Combination treatment with sildenafil and pirfenidone may warrant investigation of the treatment of patients with advanced IPF and pulmonary vascular involvement leading to PH.

### Sensitivity analyses of the change in FVC in a phase 3 trial of pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111YkM6A]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

FVC outcomes in clinical trials on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be substantially influenced by the analytic methodology and the handling of missing data. We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the statistical finding and the stability of the estimate of the magnitude of treatment effect on the primary end point of FVC change in a phase 3 trial evaluating pirfenidone in adults with IPF.

Methods

Source data included all 555 study participants randomized to treatment with pirfenidone or placebo in the Assessment of Pirfenidone to Confirm Efficacy and Safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ASCEND) study. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess whether alternative statistical tests and methods for handling missing data influenced the observed magnitude of treatment effect on the primary end point of change from baseline to week 52 in FVC.

Results

The distribution of FVC change at week 52 was systematically different between the two treatment groups and favored pirfenidone in each analysis. The method used to impute missing data due to death had a marked effect on the magnitude of change in FVC in both treatment groups; however, the magnitude of treatment benefit was generally consistent on a relative basis, with an approximate 50% reduction in FVC decline observed in the pirfenidone group in each analysis.

Conclusions

Our results confirm the robustness of the statistical finding on the primary end point of change in FVC in the ASCEND trial and corroborate the estimated magnitude of the pirfenidone treatment effect in patients with IPF.

Pirfenidone for non-IPF PPF — committee voting and research needs indicate uncertainty: "The committee's vote was as follows: strong recommendation for pirfenidone, 0 of 34 (0%); conditional recommendation for pirfenidone, 21 of 34 (62%); conditional recommendation against pirfenidone, 0 of 34 (0%); and strong recommendation against pirfenidone, 0 of 34 (0%). Thirteen participants (38%) abstained from voting, 11 citing insufficient evidence to make a recommendation and 2 citing insufficient expertise to render a thoughtful judgment". Among those willing to vote, "there was unanimous consensus in favor of pirfenidone", but "approximately one-third of the committee abstained… yielding a research recommendation". Existing evidence is limited: "The existing randomized trials encompass only 380 patients with PPF, among whom 253 had fibrotic uILD manifesting PPF".

### A phase 3 trial of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112qkJES]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

In two of three phase 3 trials, pirfenidone, an oral antifibrotic therapy, reduced disease progression, as measured by the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) or vital capacity, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; in the third trial, this end point was not achieved. We sought to confirm the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on disease progression in such patients.

Methods

In this phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 555 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to receive either oral pirfenidone (2403 mg per day) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the change in FVC or death at week 52. Secondary end points were the 6-minute walk distance, progression-free survival, dyspnea, and death from any cause or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Results

In the pirfenidone group, as compared with the placebo group, there was a relative reduction of 47.9% in the proportion of patients who had an absolute decline of 10 percentage points or more in the percentage of the predicted FVC or who died; there was also a relative increase of 132.5% in the proportion of patients with no decline in FVC (P < 0.001). Pirfenidone reduced the decline in the 6-minute walk distance (P = 0.04) and improved progression-free survival (P < 0.001). There was no significant between-group difference in dyspnea scores (P = 0.16) or in rates of death from any cause (P = 0.10) or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0.23). However, in a prespecified pooled analysis incorporating results from two previous phase 3 trials, the between-group difference favoring pirfenidone was significant for death from any cause (P = 0.01) and from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0.006). Gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events were more common in the pirfenidone group than in the placebo group but rarely led to treatment discontinuation.

Conclusions

Pirfenidone, as compared with placebo, reduced disease progression, as reflected by lung function, exercise tolerance, and progression-free survival, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment was associated with an acceptable side-effect profile and fewer deaths. (Funded by InterMune; ASCEND ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01366209.).

### Where do we stand with IPF treatment? [^113mjL7b]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

A recent review by Germany's Federal Joint Committee granted the additional benefit of pirfenidone in adults with mild-to-moderate IPF, despite an initial proposal from the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) that concluded 'no proven benefit'. The additional benefit was classified as Stage 4 (a non-quantifiable benefit) in the rating system established under German pharmaceutical law. This means that pirfenidone is considered to have an additional benefit, which will likely be defined in the future via experience in daily clinical use or clinical studies.

In terms of safety, pirfenidone was usually well tolerated at the standard 2403 mg/day dose in the CAPACITY Studies. There was no significant difference in the number of patients experiencing serious treatment-emergent adverse events between the pirfenidone and placebo groups (33% and 31% respectively; pooled CAPACITY data). The most common adverse events being gastrointestinal, skin disorders and dizziness. These are consistent with the known safety profile of pirfenidone and were generally mild-to-moderate in severity. The extension phase of the CAPACITY Studies (RECAP) aimed to assess the safety of pirfenidone beyond the duration of these Phase III Studies. At Week 72 of this extension phase, patients had been treated with pirfenidone for a mean duration of 2.9 years, with 114 patients treated at the full dose for at least three years. Safety data from the RECAP extension phase confirm the tolerability of pirfenidone. Common adverse events observed were very similar to those observed in the CAPACITY Studies, and were generally mild-to-moderate in severity. Rash/photosensitivity occurred in fewer patients from the RECAP Extension phase than in the CAPACITY Studies (20% vs 44%). Interestingly, rash or photosensitivity was more common among patients initiating treatment with pirfenidone compared with those who were on continued treatment (28% vs 12%). These data provide further important information on treatment with pirfenidone and demonstrate its tolerability.

### Safety and tolerability of acetylcysteine and pirfenidone combination therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^113qo2wB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral acetylcysteine (also known as N-acetylcysteine) is used with pirfenidone to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Europe. However, no randomised studies have investigated the safety and tolerability of this combination. The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and tolerability of acetylcysteine combined with pirfenidone in patients with IPF. Exploratory efficacy endpoints were also assessed.

Methods

We did a double-blind randomised trial at 48 sites in eight countries. Patients with IPF aged 40–80 years and established on pirfenidone (at least 1602 mg/day for 8 weeks or longer) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by interactive voice response system to receive concomitant oral acetylcysteine (600 mg, three times daily) or placebo for 24 weeks. A stratified blocked randomisation scheme was used with a block size of 4. Randomisation was stratified by dose of pirfenidone (2403 mg/day [the maximum dose] or < 2403 mg/day). Patients, physicians, study staff and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. The primary endpoint was assessment of adverse events, which were collected at each visit and for 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Exploratory efficacy measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC), carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and 6 min walk distance. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT number 2012–000564–14) and has been completed.

Findings

123 patients participated in the study between June 28, 2013, and Feb 24, 2015. 61 were assigned to the acetylcysteine group (60 received study medication and included in analysis) and 62 were assigned to the placebo group (all included in analysis). The occurrence of at least one adverse event (46 [77%] patients receiving acetylcysteine vs 50 [81%] receiving placebo), adverse events related to study treatment (17 [28%] vs 16 [26%]), and the number of patients experiencing severe adverse events (three [5%] vs two [3%]), life-threatening adverse events (one [2%] vs one [2%]), or death (one [2%] vs three [5%]) was similar between treatment groups. One case of diarrhoea in the acetylcysteine group was considered severe and related to study treatment. Nine serious adverse events were reported by seven patients: dyspnoea, headache, hypertension, intervertebral disc protrusion, and malignant lung neoplasm in the acetylcysteine group, and aortic aneurysm, contusion, forearm fracture, and worsening IPF in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were cough, nasopharyngitis, and diarrhoea. Photosensitivity occurred more frequently with acetylcysteine (eight [13%] patients) than placebo (one [2%] patient; difference 11.7%; 95% CI 2.6–20.9; p = 0.016]), and was not attributable to differences in location, season, or concomitant medication. Four (7%) patients receiving acetylcysteine and three (5%) receiving placebo discontinued study treatment due to adverse events. In the exploratory analysis, change in FVC indicated that clinical benefit from addition of acetylcysteine to pirfenidone is unlikely, with the possibility of a harmful effect in patients with IPF (adjusted rate of decline 125.6 mL/6 months for acetylcysteine vs 34.3 mL/6 months for placebo; difference -91.3 mL; 95% CI -174.4 to -8.3; p = 0.031).

Interpretation

Findings from the PANORAMA study suggest that addition of acetylcysteine to pirfenidone does not substantially alter the tolerability profile of pirfenidone, and is unlikely to be beneficial in IPF.

### Pirfenidone for the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome related to chronic graft-versus-host disease [^1126RPvj]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Its primary mechanism of action involves attenuation of transforming growth factor-β–stimulated collagen synthesis and reduction of fibroblast proliferation. Prior case reports describe the efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with lung transplant complicated by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), and preclinical studies suggest a potential role for pirfenidone in BOS following HCT. Together, these observations prompted the conduct of a prospective study to evaluate pirfenidone as therapy for BOS. We have previously published an interim analysis of 22 patients from a single-arm, single-center, open-labeled, 12-month, phase 1 trial of pirfenidone in persons with HCT-BOS, showing that pirfenidone was tolerated and associated with pulmonary function test (PFT) improvement for 38% of participants over a 12-month period. Here we present results from all 30 participants and a 56-month extension trial to evaluate the long-term tolerability and efficacy of pirfenidone for BOS. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability of pirfenidone at the recommended dose used for treatment of IPF. Secondary study objectives included an assessment of treatment efficacy by PFTs, quantitative computed tomography (qCT) chest scan, laboratory tests, validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, and cGVHD indices.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2011: key updates on guidelines and therapeutics [^113YqNgV]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Presentations then focused on the management of IPF. Professor Luca Richeldi discussed the Cochrane Collaboration approach to analysing clinical trial data and the findings of Cochrane meta-analyses that have been performed to determine the effect of treatments used in the management of IPF. This was followed by Professor Vincent Cottin, who summarised the outcomes from prior clinical trials in IPF and the recently published Phase III studies of pirfenidone that led to its approval in Europe. Following these updates, Professor Jürgen Behr and Luca Richeldi discussed how these data can be interpreted in light of the updated recommendations of the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT Committee regarding treatment of IPF. Professor Carlo Albera outlined the implications of the press release from the NIH regarding the PANTHER-IPF study.

Hopefully the selected proceedings from this meeting will provide IPF clinicians with new insights and support in the management of their patients. The intention is for the AIR meeting to become a fixed date in the calendar for respiratory physicians and researchers dedicated to improving knowledge and bringing new hope for IPF patients.

### Ongoing challenges in pulmonary fibrosis and insights from the nintedanib clinical programme [^111h2g1m]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) of unknown cause in which patients experience worsening lung function resulting from progressive fibrosis. IPF is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Two pharmacological therapies (nintedanib and pirfenidone) have been shown to slow decline in lung function in patients with IPF. The United States Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approvals of nintedanib and pirfenidone changed the treatment paradigm in IPF and increased understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms. However, these approvals raised new questions in the management of ILD, and prior unmet needs remain to be addressed. Such needs can be observed in the following areas: diagnosis; timing of treatment initiation; assessment of treatment response and disease progression; treatment of special patient populations; long-term treatment; and management of other forms of progressive fibrosing ILD (Fig. 1). This review will discuss these challenges in the context of data from the nintedanib clinical programme (Phase II, III and IV clinical trials) and from routine clinical practice in real-world settings (observational cohorts including registries).

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115LBLiY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disorder without an effective therapy to date. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 107 patients were prospectively evaluated for efficacy of a novel compound, pirfenidone. The difference in the change in the lowest oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) during a 6-minute exercise test, the primary endpoint, from baseline to 6 months was not significant between the two groups (p = 0.0722). In a prespecified subset of patients who maintained a SpO2 greater than 80% during a 6-minute exercise test at baseline, the lowest SpO2 improved during a 6-minute exercise test in the pirfenidone group at 6 and 9 months (p = 0.0069 and 0.0305, respectively). Positive treatment effect was demonstrated in secondary endpoints: (1) change in VC measurements at 9 months (p = 0.0366) and (2) episodes of acute exacerbation of IPF occurring exclusively in the placebo group during the 9 months (p = 0.0031). Significant adverse events were associated with pirfenidone; however, adherence to treatment regimen was similar between pirfenidone and placebo groups. In conclusion, treatment with pirfenidone improved VC and prevented acute exacerbation of IPF during the 9 months of follow-up. Future long-term studies are needed to clarify the overall safety and efficacy of pirfenidone in IPF.

### Safety of pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: integrated analysis of cumulative data from 5 clinical trials [^116vNL83]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed a comprehensive analysis of safety outcomes in a large and well-defined cohort of patients with IPF who were treated with pirfenidone and followed prospectively for up to 9.9 years (median 1.7 years; IQR 0.7–4.0 years). Our results provide further evidence that long-term treatment with pirfenidone is safe and generally well tolerated. Consistent with previous reports, gastrointestinal and skin-related events were among the most common adverse events; these were generally mild to moderate in severity and responsive to dose modification or other adverse event mitigation strategies. Of note, study subjects in the Phase 3 trials and the open-label extension study were instructed to take pirfenidone with food and advised to avoid sun exposure and to use sun block during treatment. Additionally, protocol-defined dose modification guidelines for gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events were employed in the Phase 3 and open-label extension studies and subsequently incorporated into the product label. The generally transient nature of these events and the relatively low incidence of treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal or skin-related events over a longer duration of exposure provide further support for these recommendations.

The crude incidence of serious adverse events (unadjusted for differences in duration of exposure) was higher in the integrated population compared with that in the pooled pirfenidone and placebo groups in the Phase 3 clinical trials. However, this difference was driven largely by the increased incidence of worsening IPF — an expected finding given the irreversible nature of the disease and the long duration of observation.

Clinically significant elevations in aminotransferases occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the integrated population than in the pooled pirfenidone group in the Phase 3 trials. Analysis of serial laboratory results showed that these tended to occur within the first 6 months of treatment and were generally transient, reversible and without clinical sequelae. However, in light of the higher incidence of aminotransferase elevations in the pirfenidone group compared with placebo in the Phase 3 trials, the recommendation in the product labels to perform liver chemistry tests at monthly intervals for the first 6 months of treatment and at 3-month intervals thereafter remains consistent with prudent medical management.

### Ongoing challenges in pulmonary fibrosis and insights from the nintedanib clinical programme [^113HnLD9]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The approvals of nintedanib and pirfenidone changed the treatment paradigm in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and increased our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, many challenges and unmet needs remain in the management of patients with IPF and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases. This review describes how the nintedanib clinical programme has helped to address some of these challenges. Data from this programme have informed changes to the IPF diagnostic guidelines, the timing of treatment initiation, and the assessment of disease progression. The use of nintedanib to treat patients with advanced lung function impairment, concomitant emphysema, patients awaiting lung transplantation and patients with IPF and lung cancer is discussed. The long-term use of nintedanib and an up-to-date summary of nintedanib in clinical practice are discussed. Directions for future research, namely emerging therapeutic options, precision medicine and other progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases, are described. Further developments in these areas should continue to improve patient outcomes.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacologic treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115cbaQw]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and deadly disease. The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved two medications for the treatment of IPF - pirfenidone and nintedanib. Given the limited clinical experience with these agents, a number of questions remain regarding their use.

Recent Findings

Both pirfenidone and nintedanib were demonstrated to reduce the rate of decline in forced vital capacity in independent large, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trials. The successful implementation of both agents in clinical practice is dependent on many factors, including which patients to prescribe them in and managing patient expectations regarding efficacy and side effects. Pirfenidone is frequently associated with gastrointestinal upset, malaise, and rash. Nintedanib often causes diarrhea. Both drugs may cause elevations in liver-associated enzymes and require serial monitoring. Despite the side effects mentioned, these drugs are generally well tolerated in the long term. It should be emphasized to patients that these drugs do not represent a 'cure' for IPF and that the goal of therapy is stabilization of their disease.

Summary

Currently many questions remain regarding the use of pirfenidone and nintedanib in IPF, including which drug to prescribe, the optimal patient population to treat, the duration of therapy, and how to define treatment success or failure. It also remains to be seen whether combination therapy with both agents will result in improved outcomes. Hopefully, future randomized controlled trials will address these issues.

### Focus on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: advancing approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [^1113RatU]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

As seen in this CME online activity (available at http://courses.elseviercme.com/694), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive, fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause that is associated with substantial health-care utilization and high rates of mortality. The clinical symptoms of IPF are nonspecific and overlap with many pulmonary and cardiac diseases making differential diagnosis challenging. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) guidelines strongly recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases; however, there are several limitations to the feasibility of this approach in clinical practice. Although early diagnosis is relevant to any chronic, progressive, and irreversible disorder, it is crucially important that effective treatments for IPF are prescribed without delay. A window of opportunity may exist during which time treatment can have optimal outcomes. Evidence on the clinical management of IPF is rapidly evolving, and key updates were made to the most recent ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines. The widely used combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine has now been associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death compared with placebo in patients with IPF. These treatments and others for IPF have been mostly supportive, but recently pirfenidone and nintedanib have demonstrated efficacy in reducing functional decline and disease progression in IPF. A pooled analysis of three phase 3 studies of pirfenidone found a significant 48% reduction in all-cause mortality, and a pooled analysis of a phase 2 and two phase 3 studies of nintedanib found a significant 43% reduction in on-treatment mortality. As patient exposure to these two new drugs increases, data continue to emerge on how and when to use these medications and on how to manage their side effects. Finally, several medications targeting the fibrotic pathobiology of IPF are currently in development. Given the limited treatment options for IPF, enrollment in a clinical trial may be the best chance to delay or prevent progression of IPF. This CME-certified expert video roundtable from CHEST reviews the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines with a specific focus on accurate and timely diagnosis of IPF and the latest data on the treatment of IPF.

### A multicentre retrospective observational study on Polish experience of pirfenidone therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: the polExPIR study [^1124d4Cd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we examined retrospectively longitudinal data on clinical outcomes of pirfenidone therapy in patients with IPF in Poland under real-world conditions. The main findings of our study confirm the long-term acceptable safety and tolerability profiles of pirfenidone in the treatment of IPF and show that the large percentage of patients with IPF receiving pirfenidone experience functional stabilization and in the minority of them a functional improvement may be observed over up to 24 months of follow-up. Moreover, the Polish RWD on the pirfenidone safety and efficacy in IPF are in the line with the results of previous RCTs and other smaller retrospective and observational studies undertaken to date. To sum up, the PolExPIR study is a valuable source of evidence gathered from the large representative real-world population of patients with IPF in Poland.

### Design of a phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of BI 1015550 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (FIBRONEER-IPF) [^112segu9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

There is an unmet need for new treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The oral preferential phosphodiesterase 4B inhibitor, BI 1015550, prevented a decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in a phase II study in patients with IPF. This study design describes the subsequent pivotal phase III study of BI 1015550 in patients with IPF (FIBRONEER-IPF).

Methods and analysis

In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial, patients are being randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 9 mg or 18 mg of BI 1015550 or placebo two times per day over at least 52 weeks, stratified by use of background antifibrotics (nintedanib/pirfenidone vs neither). The primary endpoint is the absolute change in FVC at week 52. The key secondary endpoint is a composite of time to first acute IPF exacerbation, hospitalisation due to respiratory cause or death over the duration of the trial.

Ethics and dissemination

The trial is being carried out in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and other local ethics committees. The results of the study will be disseminated at scientific congresses and in peer-reviewed publications.

### Dose modification and dose intensity during treatment with pirfenidone: analysis of pooled data from three multinational phase III trials [^112eLuVY]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Temporary dose modifications, such as reductions or interruptions, may allow patients to better manage adverse events (AEs) associated with pirfenidone use and continue treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the impact of such dosing adjustments on efficacy and safety is uncertain.

Methods

Patients randomised to receive treatment with pirfenidone 2403mg/day or placebo in the Clinical Studies Assessing Pirfenidone in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Research of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes (CAPACITY (Study 004 (NCT00287716)) and Study 006 (NCT00287729))) and Assessment of Pirfenidone to Confirm Efficacy and Safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ASCEND (Study 016 (NCT01366209)) trials were included in the analysis (n = 1247). Descriptive statistics and a linear mixed-effects model (slope analysis) for annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) by dose intensity were performed. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were summarised and grouped by dose intensity or body size.

Results

Dose reductions and interruptions occurred in 76.9% (95% CI 73.4% to 80.1%) and 46.5% (95% CI 42.6% to 50.6%) of patients receiving pirfenidone vs 72.0% (95% CI 68.3% to 75.4%) and 31.1% (95% CI 27.5% to 34.9%) of patients receiving placebo, respectively. Dose interruptions tended to occur during the first 6 months of treatment, whereas dose reductions exhibited more variability. Less FVC decline from baseline was observed in patients receiving pirfenidone versus placebo at > 90%dose intensity (p < 0.001) or ≤ 90%dose intensity (p = 0.0191), showing treatment benefit in both subgroups of dose intensity. No meaningful relationship between weight and TEAEs was observed.

Conclusion

Dose interruptions, which may be required to manage TEAEs, mostly occurred during the first 6 months of treatment. Despite dose reductions and interruptions, most patients with IPF maintained relatively high dose intensity on pirfenidone, without compromising its treatment effect compared with placebo.

### A multicentre retrospective observational study on Polish experience of pirfenidone therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: the polExPIR study [^116j1NCc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic lung disease, one of the most common among a heterogeneous group of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). The natural history of the disease is characterized by inevitable, progressive decline of lung function, reduction in exercise tolerance, quality of life and premature death. IPF is known to have outcomes worse than many cancers, with a median survival of 3 to 5 years after diagnosis, though the disease course varies significantly in individuals. Two molecules, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been shown to slow the disease progression limiting the decline of lung function in patients with IPF. Both antifibrotics are recognized as an actual standard of pharmacological treatment of the disease. Despite early drug registrations in Europe (pirfenidone in 2011 and nintedanib in 2015), lack of reimbursement for antifibrotics in Poland led to significant limitations in wide access to antifibrotic therapy for Polish patients with IPF. Recent changes in the reimbursement policy for antifibrotics in Poland have resulted in much wider availability of pirfenidone (since January 2017) and nintedanib (since March 2018) for the treatment of Polish patients with IPF.

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on pirfenidone therapy in IPF provided important information on its efficacy and safety profiles. These trials proved that pirfenidone treatment in IPF possesses acceptable safety, significantly reduces the rate of decline of forced vital capacity (FVC) and its use is associated with decreased mortality. However, the follow-up period of pirfenidone RCTs lasted only 52–72 weeks. Moreover, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria of RCTs may limit the possibility of generalization of the results to the real-world setting clinical practice. Therefore, real-world data (RWD) studies based on data obtained outside the context of RCTs generated during routine clinical practice provide additional pieces of evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of particular intervention in the broader real-world patients populations.

Up to date, several RWD studies were published supplementing previous evidence of RCTs on the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in the treatment of heterogenous IPF patients populations, however the scientific significance of many of those studies suffer from a small number of patients included for analysis (< 100 patients). Moreover, no data exist describing the clinical efficacy and safety of long-term pirfenidone use in patients with IPF in Poland.

### Longitudinal clinical outcomes in a real-world population of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: the PROOF registry [^117GrZ12]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Registry design

The PROOF registry is an observational study which aims to monitor disease progression in a real-world population of patients with IPF.

Patients were enrolled across seven centers in Belgium and one center in Luxembourg during the period of October 2013 to January 2016. The majority of IPF diagnoses took place at centers with a highly experienced multidisciplinary team (MDT) present. Patients eligible for inclusion in the PROOF registry were over 18 years of age and had an MDT diagnosis of definite or probable IPF according to 2011 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines. Patients with a history of environmental exposures could be eligible for inclusion if MDT discussions excluded hypersensitivity pneumonitis or other interstitial lung diseases with known cause. Patients were excluded if they were enrolled in a clinical trial at the time of inclusion in the PROOF registry.

The PROOF registry was conducted in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and local legal and regulatory requirements. Patients were required to provide informed consent prior to inclusion.

Analysis populations

Patients were enrolled between October 2013 and January 2016. Analyses were performed at a cut-off date of July 2017 and included all patients with 24 months of data available. For assessment of clinical outcomes, the analysis population included all patients with IPF included in the PROOF registry. For pirfenidone treatment patterns, longitudinal changes in pulmonary function, and time-to-event analyses, the pirfenidone-treated population was used, which consisted of patients treated with pirfenidone at any time during follow-up in the registry (at the time of registry inclusion or after registry inclusion), for any duration of treatment. Longitudinal data for patients treated with nintedanib were not assessed due to low patient numbers (enrollment into the PROOF registry began prior to the introduction of nintedanib).

### Comparative outcomes in patients receiving pirfenidone or nintedanib for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^117QZ6YG]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Real-world data regarding outcomes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are scarce, outside of registries. In France, pirfenidone and nintedanib are only reimbursed for documented IPF, with similar reimbursement criteria with respect to disease characteristics, prescription through a dedicated form, and IPF diagnosis established in multidisciplinary discussion.

Research Question

The data of the comprehensive French National Health System were used to evaluate outcomes in patients newly treated with pirfenidone or nintedanib in 2015–2016.

Study Design and Methods

Patients aged < 50 years or who had pulmonary fibrosis secondary to an identified cause were excluded. All-cause mortality, acute respiratory-related hospitalisations and treatment discontinuations up to 31 December 2017 were compared using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, year of treatment initiation, time to treatment initiation and proxies of disease severity identified during a pre-treatment period.

Results

During the study period, a treatment with pirfenidone or nintedanib was newly initiated in 804 and 509 patients, respectively. No difference was found between groups for age, sex, time to treatment initiation, Charlson comorbidity score, and number of hospitalisations or medical contacts prior to treatment initiation. As compared to pirfenidone, nintedanib was associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.6), a greater risk of acute respiratory-related hospitalisations (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0–1.7) and a lower risk of treatment discontinuation at 12 months (HR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6–0.9).

Interpretation

This observational study identified potential differences in outcome under newly prescribed antifibrotic drugs, deserving further explorations.

### Pirfenidone [^112MjEbF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of pirfenidone was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 277) in patients with IPF. Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2. Study 2 compared treatment with either pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 174) or pirfenidone 1197 mg/day (n = 87) to placebo (n = 174), while Study 3 compared pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 171) to placebo (n = 173). Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks. Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) from baseline to study end, measured at 52 weeks in Study 1, and at 72 weeks in Studies 2 and 3.

Studies 1, 2 and 3 enrolled adult patients who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF (with or without accompanying surgical lung biopsy), without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis for interstitial lung disease. Eligible patients were to have %FVC greater than or equal to 50% at baseline and a percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) greater than or equal to 30% (Study 1) or 35% (Studies 2 and 3) at baseline. In all three trials, over 80% of patients completed study treatment.

A total of 1247 patients with IPF were randomized to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 623) or placebo (n = 624) in these three trials. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. The study population ranged from 40 to 80 years of age (mean age 67 years). Most patients were male (74%), white (95%), and current or former smokers (65%). Approximately 93% of patients met criteria for definite IPF on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Baseline mean %FVC and %DLCOwere 72% and 46%, respectively. Approximately 15% subjects discontinued from each treatment group.

### Nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. results of the INJOURNEY trial [^111pVceE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Nintedanib and pirfenidone slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but the disease continues to progress. More data are needed on the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with nintedanib and add-on pirfenidone.

Objectives

To investigate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and exploratory efficacy endpoints in patients treated with nintedanib and add-on pirfenidone versus nintedanib alone.

Methods

Patients with IPF and FVC greater than or equal to 50% predicted at screening who completed a 4- to 5-week run-in with nintedanib 150 mg twice daily without dose reduction or treatment interruption were randomized to receive nintedanib 150 mg twice daily with add-on pirfenidone (titrated to 801 mg three times daily) or nintedanib 150 mg twice daily alone in an open-label manner for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with on-treatment gastrointestinal adverse events from baseline to Week 12. Analyses were descriptive and exploratory.

Measurements and Main Results

On-treatment gastrointestinal adverse events were reported in 37 of 53 patients (69.8%) treated with nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone and 27 of 51 patients (52.9%) treated with nintedanib alone. Predose plasma trough concentrations of nintedanib were similar when it was administered alone or with add-on pirfenidone. Mean (SE) changes from baseline in FVC at Week 12 were -13.3 (17.4) mL and -40.9 (31.4) mL in patients treated with nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone (n = 48) and nintedanib alone (n = 44), respectively.

Conclusions

Nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone had a manageable safety and tolerability profile in patients with IPF, in line with the adverse event profiles of each drug. These data support further research into combination regimens in the treatment of IPF. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02579603).

### Therapeutic targets in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115mNZKR]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal interstitial lung disease. After many drugs failed in clinical trials, improvements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF led to the approval of two drugs that slow the progression of the disease. However, the prognosis for patients with IPF remains poor and the search continues for drugs that inhibit the pathogenic pathways active in IPF to reduce or even halt the progression of the disease. In this article, we review the mechanisms of action of the two approved therapies for IPF (nintedanib and pirfenidone) and of the investigational compounds that are in Phase II trials and discuss the potential for combination therapy in the treatment of IPF.

### Effect of pirfenidone in patients with more advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111hRhgB]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

These post-hoc analyses of RECAP found that annual rate of FVC decline was similar with longer-term pirfenidone treatment in patients with more and less advanced IPF (3.4–3.9%), and in line with that of the pirfenidone arm at 52 weeks in CAPACITY (~ 5%). Moreover, the safety profile of pirfenidone was generally similar between patients with more and less advanced disease (except for AEs related to IPF progression) and in line with that of pirfenidone in ASCEND and CAPACITY. However, the discontinuation rate, particularly due to AEs related to IPF, was higher for patients with more advanced than less advanced disease, which could reflect the higher severity of IPF in the more advanced versus less advanced disease subgroup.

Limitations of this study include the high discontinuation rate, the relatively small number of patients with more advanced disease, and that these were post-hoc exploratory analyses of an open-label extension study without a placebo arm. Additionally, the study population was biased towards patients who had completed CAPACITY, with patients in the previous pirfenidone subgroup having tolerated pirfenidone treatment for ≥ 72 weeks prior to being categorised by severity of IPF.

In summary, longer-term pirfenidone treatment resulted in a similar rate of lung function decline and safety profile in patients with more advanced versus less advanced IPF. These data suggest that pirfenidone is efficacious, well tolerated and a feasible treatment option in patients with more advanced IPF.

### Pirfenidone improves survival in IPF: results from a real-life study [^114fk2B7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease of unknown etiology, characterized by progressive and irreversible fibrosis of the interstitium of the lung. The prevalence of IPF in Europe and North America has been estimated to be from 3 to 9 cases per 100,000.

Pirfenidone is an orally administered drug with antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that was approved in Europe in 2011 and in USA in 2014 for the treatment of IPF. Together with nintedanib, the second antifibrotic compound, pirfenidone has received the label of "conditional recommendation for IPF treatment" in the recent update of the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2015 statement.

Three multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trials showed that pirfenidone can reduce the rate of IPF progression by 50% on average in 1 year as judged by serial changes in forced vital capacity (FVC). These trials were not powered to explore the effect of pirfenidone on mortality. However, a prespecified pooled analysis showed that pirfenidone reduced the risk of death at 1 year by 48% and the risk of treatment-emergent death due to IPF at 1 year by 68%. More recently, a pooled analysis of these trials and a meta-analysis including also a Japanese phase 2 trial, SP2 (trial duration 9 months), and a Japanese phase 3 trial, SP3 (trial duration 52 weeks) confirmed that pirfenidone is associated with a reduced risk of death compared to placebo and moreover the survival benefit of pirfenidone extended beyond 52 weeks and seemed to persist at 120 weeks.

### Effect of pirfenidone in patients with more advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112MGRcZ]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

RECAP (PIPF-012; NCT00662038) was an open-label, long-term extension study in patients with IPF who had completed ASCEND or CAPACITY (there were no restrictions on disease severity for entry into RECAP), the methods and primary outcomes of which have been described previously. Patients who previously received pirfenidone or placebo in CAPACITY and received pirfenidone 2403 mg/day during RECAP were included in the analyses. Patients from ASCEND were not included due to lack of FVC follow-up data.

Patients were categorised according to IPF severity, assessed by lung function impairment at baseline (entry into RECAP): more advanced (percent predicted FVC < 50% and/or DLco < 35%) and less advanced (percent predicted FVC ≥ 50% and DLco ≥ 35%; FVC ≥ 50% or DLco ≥ 35%, if other lung function data were missing). Efficacy of pirfenidone by IPF severity was assessed by decline in percent predicted FVC and FVC volume over 180 weeks, as measured using change from baseline and linear slope analysis of annual rate of decline. Safety of pirfenidone by IPF severity was assessed by adverse event (AE) occurrence and reasons for discontinuation over 180 weeks.

### Pirfenidone: a novel agent for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116PHrEc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the published clinical literature on the role of pirfenidone for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Data Sources

A systematic literature search was performed using the key words pirfenidone or Esbriet, alone and in combination, with IPF or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (expanded using MESH terminology). MEDLINE (1948-September 2012) was the primary database used for search purposes. In addition, all available articles and abstracts referenced by the articles identified via literature search were included.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The search was limited to English-language publications. All available clinical trials of pirfenidone pertinent to its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety were included.

Data Synthesis

Pirfenidone is the first agent specifically developed for the treatment of IPF. It has been approved for use in Europe and Japan, but not in the US. Although Phase 3 trials have shown pirfenidone to improve certain clinical (6-minute walk test) and functional (change in forced vital capacity) outcomes in patients with IPF, an independent benefit on either mortality or acute exacerbation rates has yet to be demonstrated. Until more definitive supportive data are available, international guidelines have recommended against using pirfenidone to treat most patients with IPF.

Conclusions

Although pirfenidone appears to be an effective treatment for IPF, additional clinical trials are needed to better delineate its risk-benefit profile.

### Drug therapies for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review, Bayesian network meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis [^113ks5jG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease with poor prognosis and a high economic burden for individuals and healthcare resources. Studies of the costs associated with the efficiency of IPF medications are scarce. We aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) and cost-effectiveness analysis to identify the optimum pharmacological strategy among all currently available IPF regimens.

Methods

We first performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched eight databases for eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published, in any language, between January 1, 1992 and July 31, 2022, that investigated the efficacy or tolerability (or both) of drug therapies for the treatment of IPF. The search was updated on February 1, 2023. Eligible RCTs were enrolled, with no restriction on dose, duration, or length of follow-up, if they included at least one of: all-cause mortality, acute exacerbation rate, disease progression rate, serious adverse events, and any adverse events under investigation. A subsequent Bayesian NMA within random-effects models was performed, followed by a cost-effectiveness analysis using the data obtained from our NMA, by developing a Markov model from the US payer's perspective. Assumptions were checked by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity approaches to identify sensitive factors. We prospectively registered the protocol (CRD42022340590) in PROSPERO.

Findings

51 publications comprising 12,551 participants with IPF were analysed for the NMA, and the findings indicated that pirfenidone and N -acetylcysteine (NAC) + pirfenidone were the most efficacious and tolerable. The pharmacoeconomic analysis showed that NAC + pirfenidone was associated with the highest potentiality of being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of US$150,000 and $200,000, on the basis of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality, with the probability ranging from 53% to 92%. NAC was the minimum cost agent. Compared with placebo, NAC + pirfenidone improved effectiveness by increasing QALYs by 7.02, and reducing DALYs by 7.10 and deaths by 8.40, whilst raising overall costs by $516,894.

Interpretation

This NMA and cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that NAC + pirfenidone is the most cost-effective option for treatment of IPF at WTP thresholds of $150,000 and $200,000. However, given that clinical practice guidelines have not addressed the application of this therapy, large well-designed and multicentre trials are warranted to provide a better picture of IPF management.

### Unmet needs in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-insights from patient chart review in five European countries [^115ZtPCx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, debilitating, irreversible, and progressive lung disease characterized by exertional dyspnea and cough. Patients with IPF have a poor prognosis, with median survival following diagnosis previously reported as lower than that for many common types of cancer at between 2 and 5 years.

The reported incidence of IPF has been estimated to range from 2.8 to 9.3 cases per 100,000 population per year, in Europe and North America. The prevalence of IPF in Europe is thought to range from 1.25 to 23.4 cases per 100,000 population. There is evidence that the incidence, prevalence, and number of deaths from IPF may be increasing.

Two antifibrotic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, are approved by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of IPF, and both are recommended in international treatment guidelines. In the Phase III ASCEND and CAPACITY trials, pirfenidone significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death compared with placebo. In the Phase III INPULSIS trials, nintedanib reduced the risk of disease progression versus placebo in patients with IPF.

Following the approval and recommendation of pirfenidone and nintedanib for the treatment of IPF, we conducted a patient chart audit using an online physician survey to investigate pharmacological treatment patterns, understand antifibrotic prescribing, and identify unmet needs in IPF treatment practice in Europe.

### Real-life comparison of pirfenidone and nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a 24-month assessment [^111jPoP9]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Real-life data on the use of pirfenidone and nintedanib to treat patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are still scarce.

Methods

We compared the efficacy of either pirfenidone (n = 78) or nintedanib (n = 28) delivered over a 24-month period in patients with IPF, followed at two regional clinic centers in Italy, with a group of patients who refused the treatment (n = 36), and who were considered to be controls. All patients completed regular visits at 1- to 3-month intervals, where primary [forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO)] and secondary outcomes (side effects, treatment compliance, and mortality) were recorded.

Results

Over time, the decline in FVC and DLCO was significantly higher (p = 0.0053 and p = 0.037, respectively) in controls when compared with the combined treated group, with no significant difference between the two treated groups. Compared to patients with less advanced disease (GAP (Gender, Age, Physiology) stage I), those in GAP stages II and III showed a significantly higher decline in both FVC and DLCO irrespective of the drug taken. Side effects were similarly reported in patients receiving pirfenidone and nintedanib (5% and 7%, respectively), whereas mortality did not differ among the three groups.

Conclusion

This real-life study demonstrated that both pirfenidone and nintedanib were equally effective in reducing the decline of FVC and DLCO versus non-treated patients after 24 months of treatment; however, patients with more advanced disease were likely to show a more rapid decline in respiratory function.

### Where do we stand with IPF treatment? [^116AUVhf]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Despite receiving 'weak no' recommendations in the updated guidelines on treating patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), two key treatment options are pirfenidone and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and both are used in clinical practice. The efficacy of pirfenidone is supported by a number of Phase III trials as well as a Cochrane meta-analysis. Tolerability data are also provided by clinical trials and a long-term extension phase of these studies. Pirfenidone is approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate IPF. NAC-based therapy has no such approval, but is commonly used to treat patients. A Phase III trial suggested some benefit of the NAC, prednisone and azathioprine regimen for IPF patients, but the study had many limitations. A further study to investigate this regimen, compared with a placebo alone arm, was recently stopped due to increased mortality in the triple-therapy arm. Discussion of these data and recent findings highlight the importance of a further update to the existing guidelines, so that IPF specialists can provide the most up-to-date advice and treatment to patients in clinical practice.

### Modification of the course of disease progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by pirfenidone: evidence of the potential for disease reversal [^115Dxzo3]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrosing pneumonia of unknown causation with a chronic, progressive course that may be modified by treatment with the antifibrotic agents, pirfenidone and nintedanib. Both drugs have been shown to slow disease progression, but, in rare cases, pirfenidone has been shown to stabilise and even improve lung function. We present a case of a patient whose lung function and pathognomonic features on CT imaging improved significantly on commencement of treatment with pirfenidone. Withholding pirfenidone was associated with a functional and morphological deterioration on imaging that subsequently reversed and stabilised following recommencement of this treatment. We discuss potential mechanisms that might explain this treatment response, compare our case to others described previously and the potential consequences that restricted prescribing within a specified range of vital capacity may have on the opportunity to influence the natural history of IPF early before irreversible fibrosis develops.

### Expert consensus on the management of adverse events and prescribing practices associated with the treatment of patients taking pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a Delphi consensus study [^115rq8ub]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Delphi process was used to develop expert consensus recommendations on the use of pirfenidone in managing patients with IPF to keep patients on therapy and improve outcomes. The recommendations aim to provide useful guidance on appropriate clinical management of IPF with pirfenidone, encompassing a broad experience from the real world than what has been studied in the trials.

### Pirfenidone vs. nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a retrospective cohort study [^114H4yen]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Two antifibrotic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, are licensed for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, there is neither evidence from prospective data nor a guideline recommendation, which drug should be preferred over the other. This study aimed to compare pirfenidone and nintedanib-treated patients regarding all-cause mortality, all-cause and respiratory-related hospitalizations, and overall as well as respiratory-related health care costs borne by the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study with SHI data was performed, including IPF patients treated either with pirfenidone or nintedanib. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on propensity scores was applied to adjust for observed covariates. Weighted Cox models were estimated to analyze mortality and hospitalization. Weighted cost differences with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CI) were applied for cost analysis.

Results

We compared 840 patients treated with pirfenidone and 713 patients treated with nintedanib. Both groups were similar regarding two-year all-cause mortality (HR: 0.90 95% CI: 0.76; 1.07), one-year all cause (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.95; 1.25) and respiratory-related hospitalization (HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.72; 1.08). No significant differences were observed regarding total (€- 807, 95% CI: €- 2977; €1220) and respiratory-related (€- 1282, 95% CI: €- 3423; €534) costs.

Conclusion

Our analyses suggest that the patient-related outcomes mortality, hospitalization, and costs do not differ between the two currently available antifibrotic drugs pirfenidone and nintedanib. Hence, the decision on treatment with pirfenidone versus treatment with nintedanib ought to be made case-by-case taking clinical characteristics, comorbidities, comedications, individual risk of side effects, and patients' preferences into account.

### Management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^114sHuSs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Nintedanib and pirfenidone have predominantly been investigated in patients with mild or moderate impairment in lung function, and more data are needed on the efficacy and safety of these drugs in patients with advanced disease. Data from the open-label INPULSIS-ON study of nintedanib and RECAP study of pirfenidone suggest that the efficacy and safety of these treatments are similar in patients with severe lung function impairment (FVC ≤ 50% predicted in INPULSIS-ON and FVC < 50% and/or DLco < 35% predicted in RECAP) as in those with less advanced disease. In the INSTAGE trial, which enrolled patients with IPF and DLco ≤ 35% predicted, the decline in FVC over 24 weeks in patients treated with nintedanib alone was similar to that observed in patients with less advanced disease in the INPULSIS trials. Treatment with nintedanib plus sildenafil did not provide a significant benefit on health-related quality of life compared with nintedanib alone but was associated with a reduction in FVC decline. The efficacy and safety of pirfenidone plus sildenafil in patients with DLco ≤ 40% predicted are under investigation.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) — pirfenidone: We suggest that clinicians use pirfenidone in patients with IPF (conditional recommendation, moderate confidence in estimates of effect). In the CAPACITY trials, study 004 included 435 patients randomized to one of three treatment groups (high-dose pirfenidone [2,403 mg/d], low-dose pirfenidone [1,197 mg/d], and placebo), whereas study 006 had 344 patients randomized to only two treatment groups (high-dose pirfenidone [2,403 mg/d] and placebo). In study 004, pirfenidone showed a reduction in decline of FVC during the 72-week treatment period, whereas study 006 did not show a benefit; patients assigned to receive high-dose pirfenidone reported increased rates of nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, anorexia, photosensitivity, and rash compared with placebo. The ASCEND trial randomized 555 patients with IPF to either high-dose pirfenidone (2,403 mg/d) or placebo, used stricter selection such as a FEV1/FVC ratio below 0.8, and of 1,562 screened patients, 1,007 were excluded because of these predefined exclusion criteria. Pirfenidone significantly reduced the proportion of patients who had a more than 10% decline in their FVC during the 52-week follow-up period, increased 6-minute walk distance and progression-free survival when compared with placebo, while mortality or dyspnea scores did not differ. Pooled results suggested improved mortality with pirfenidone (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47–1.02; moderate confidence) and reduced the rate of FVC decline (standardized mean difference, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06–0.41; high confidence); pooled analysis showed increased rates of photosensitivity (high confidence), fatigue (moderate confidence), stomach discomfort (moderate confidence), and anorexia (high confidence) in patients treated with pirfenidone.

### Management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the elderly patient: addressing key questions [^111pQDss]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is strongly associated with advanced age. Making an accurate diagnosis of IPF is critical, as it remains only one of many potential diagnoses for an elderly patient with newly recognized interstitial lung disease. Optimal management of IPF, especially in older-aged patients, hinges on such factors as balancing the application of standard-of-care measures with the patient's overall health status (robustness vs frailty) and considering the patient's wishes, desires, and expectations. IPF is known to be associated with certain comorbidities that tend to be more prevalent in the elderly population. Until recently, options for the pharmacologic management of IPF were limited and included therapies such as immunosuppressive agents, which may pose substantial risk to the elderly patient. However, the antifibrotic agents pirfenidone and nintedanib have now become commercially available in the United States for the treatment of IPF. The monitoring and treatment of patients with IPF, especially elderly patients with comorbid medical conditions, require consideration of adverse side effects, the avoidance of potential drug-drug interactions, treatment of comorbidities, and the timely implementation of supportive and palliative measures. Individualized counseling to guide decision-making and enhance quality of life is also integral to optimal management of the elderly patient with IPF.

### Design of a phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of BI 1015550 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (FIBRONEER-IPF) [^112NCNTH]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

IntroductionThere is an unmet need for new treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The oral preferential phosphodiesterase 4B inhibitor, BI 1015550, prevented a decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in a phase II study in patients with IPF. This study design describes the subsequent pivotal phase III study of BI 1015550 in patients with IPF (FIBRONEER-IPF).

Methods and Analysis

In this placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial, patients are being randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 9 mg or 18 mg of BI 1015550 or placebo two times per day over at least 52 weeks, stratified by use of background antifibrotics (nintedanib/pirfenidone vs neither). The primary endpoint is the absolute change in FVC at week 52. The key secondary endpoint is a composite of time to first acute IPF exacerbation, hospitalisation due to respiratory cause or death over the duration of the trial.

Ethics and Dissemination

The trial is being carried out in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the International Council on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and other local ethics committees. The results of the study will be disseminated at scientific congresses and in peer-reviewed publications.
