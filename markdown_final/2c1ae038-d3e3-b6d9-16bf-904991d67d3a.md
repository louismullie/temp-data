## Question

Does long-term aspirin help bone density?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether long-term aspirin use helps bone density. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hierarchy of evidence and identify the highest-quality data. Then, I should verify what randomized trials say about fractures and whether they measured bone mineral density. Next, I will review observational data on bone density and consider confounding. After that, I need to check mechanistic plausibility and dose effects. Finally, I will weigh benefits versus risks and align with guideline positions to reach a practical conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the evidence hierarchy so I don't jump to conclusions from lower-quality data. Randomized controlled trials and their meta-analyses sit at the top for causal inference, followed by cohort and cross-sectional studies, with mechanistic and animal data providing biological plausibility but not definitive clinical answers, so I should prioritize RCTs and fracture outcomes over BMD associations from observational designs [^111mfSC1].

> Now, I will examine the highest-quality randomized evidence. The ASPREE randomized trial and its fracture substudy in healthy older adults found that daily low-dose aspirin 100 mg did not reduce fracture risk over a median 4.6 years and, in fact, increased serious falls requiring hospital presentation, which is a critical safety signal for older adults; importantly, this trial did not show a BMD benefit signal, and its fracture endpoint is more clinically relevant than BMD alone [^111rHtH6] [^117Q7wBz].

> Wait, let me verify whether any RCT directly measured BMD changes with aspirin. I need to check the ASPREE publications and related summaries; I do not find RCT data demonstrating improved BMD with aspirin, and the pivotal fracture outcome was neutral, which argues against a clinically meaningful bone-density benefit from long-term low-dose aspirin in this population [^117FYWw4].

> Next, I should review observational data on BMD, but I must be cautious about confounding. Several cross-sectional and cohort studies associate aspirin use with higher BMD, including the Health ABC cohort and analyses in older men and women; however, these are observational, often lack dose specificity, and are vulnerable to healthy-user and indication bias, so they cannot establish causality and may overestimate benefit [^114ok6pa] [^117FYWw4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from BMD alone; I should confirm whether higher BMD in aspirin users translates to fewer fractures. The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures found higher axial BMD in aspirin or NSAID users yet no reduction in nonspine fractures over 4 years, reinforcing that BMD associations do not guarantee fracture risk reduction and may be misleading in observational settings [^1144fScy].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility and dose effects. Low-dose aspirin primarily inhibits COX-1, whereas higher-dose NSAID effects on bone are more tied to COX-2 and prostaglandin signaling; prostaglandins regulate both bone formation and resorption, so COX inhibition can have complex, context-dependent effects on remodeling, and animal data show variable or conflicting results depending on model and duration, which limits extrapolation to humans [^112KG9yJ] [^117SpydG].

> But wait, what if aspirin indirectly helps bone via anti-inflammatory effects in specific diseases? Let me consider that. Even in inflammatory conditions, evidence is mixed and largely observational; for example, in ankylosing spondylitis, NSAID use has been associated with both lower and higher fracture risk in different studies, underscoring confounding and the lack of a consistent signal that would support aspirin for bone protection [^1176FLf6].

> I should double-check safety trade-offs because they matter for older adults considering long-term aspirin. Beyond the lack of fracture benefit, aspirin increases serious bleeding, including gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage, and in ASPREE it increased serious falls; these risks accumulate with age, and major guidelines advise against routine aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention in adults 60 years and older, which further weakens any hypothetical bone rationale given the absence of skeletal benefit [^111rHtH6] [^111Aj1c8] [^116SLPuU].

> Next, I should review authoritative osteoporosis guidance to see if aspirin is mentioned as therapy. Contemporary guidelines from ACP, Endocrine Society, and ACOG do not list aspirin as a treatment to improve BMD or prevent fractures; instead, they recommend evidence-based pharmacotherapies such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, or anabolic agents for patients at high fracture risk, which reinforces that aspirin has no role in osteoporosis management [^1171HMRv] [^112TMEzz] [^117VWKno].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a niche benefit. The best available RCT shows no fracture reduction and increased serious falls with low-dose aspirin, observational BMD associations are likely confounded and inconsistent across studies, mechanisms are biologically plausible but not clinically validated for bone benefit, and major guidelines do not endorse aspirin for bone health; therefore, long-term aspirin should not be used to improve bone density or prevent fractures outside of a trial [^111rHtH6] [^111Aj1c8].

> Final answer: No, long-term low-dose aspirin does not help bone density in a clinically meaningful way; it does not reduce fracture risk and may increase serious falls in older adults, so it should not be used for the purpose of improving bone health [^111rHtH6] [^117Q7wBz].

---

Long-term aspirin use does not improve bone density in humans. Observational studies suggest small, inconsistent associations with higher BMD, but these are likely confounded and not supported by randomized data [^117FYWw4]. The ASPREE randomized trial found **no fracture benefit** and even a higher risk of serious falls with daily low-dose aspirin, indicating no skeletal advantage [^111rHtH6]. Mechanistically, aspirin may both suppress bone formation and reduce resorption, yielding no net gain in bone mass [^112f7eMc]. Current guidelines do not recommend aspirin for bone health, and it should not be used for this purpose.

---

## Evidence from observational studies

Several observational studies have explored the association between aspirin use and BMD, with mixed results:

- **Health ABC cohort**: Higher BMD in aspirin users, but confounded by comorbidities and medications [^114ok6pa].
- **NEO study**: Slightly higher BMD in low-dose aspirin users, not statistically significant after adjustment [^117FYWw4].
- **Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project**: Higher spinal BMD in aspirin users, but observational and confounded [^117FYWw4].

These studies suggest a possible association, but **confounding by indication and comorbidities** limits causal inference [^117FYWw4].

---

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the highest-quality evidence. The ASPREE trial, a large RCT in healthy older adults, found **no reduction in fracture risk** with daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg) and a higher risk of serious falls, indicating no skeletal benefit [^111rHtH6]. No RCTs to date have demonstrated improved BMD or reduced fracture risk with aspirin.

---

## Biological mechanisms

Aspirin's effects on bone are complex and dose dependent:

- **Low-dose aspirin**: Primarily inhibits COX-1, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which may suppress osteoblast function and bone formation [^112WYLHF].
- **High-dose aspirin**: More COX-2 inhibition, potentially reducing osteoclast activity and bone resorption [^112WYLHF].
- **Net effect**: Likely neutral or negative on bone mass, with no consistent benefit in human studies [^112f7eMc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend aspirin** for bone health or osteoporosis prevention. Aspirin is indicated for cardiovascular purposes, not skeletal benefits [^112PpSbE].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Long-term aspirin use carries risks that may offset any hypothetical bone benefit:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Increased risk of ulcers and bleeding [^117XzRnF].
- **Hemorrhagic stroke**: Increased risk, especially in older adults [^111Aj1c8].
- **Serious falls**: Higher incidence in ASPREE, compounding fracture risk [^111rHtH6].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Long-term aspirin use **does not improve bone density** or reduce fracture risk in humans. Observational associations are likely confounded, and RCTs show no skeletal benefit. Given the risks, aspirin should not be used for bone health. Patients should use evidence-based osteoporosis therapies (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab) and maintain lifestyle measures (calcium, vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise) to protect bone health [^1171HMRv] [^112TMEzz].

Introduction

Bone remodeling plays a vital role in renewing and sustaining the integrity of bones throughout the whole life. In specific health states, such as the menopause in women or general ageing in both sexes, the process of bone remodeling can be accelerated resulting in an imbalance between osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation. With age, this will lead to microstructural deterioration and decreasing bone volume, which creates a marked deficit in the structural strength of bone and increases fragility.

Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is one of the most commonly used medicines, with an estimated 40,000 metric tons of ASA produced per year globally. Different doses of aspirin may exhibit diverse biological effects, and to date, the precise regulatory mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. Generally, low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg per day) inhibits the COX-1 isozyme more robustly than COX-2, and it is commonly prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Conversely, high-dose aspirin (> 1000 mg per day) more potently inhibits COX-2 than COX-1, suppressing the conversion of prostaglandin E2 and therefore it is widely taken to alleviate pain and the inflammatory response.

Recently, various studies have growing interests in the potential for aspirin to offer broader medical benefits, rather than simply cardiovascular protection, particularly in the prevention of age-related conditions, including osteoarthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, age-related hearing loss, and age-related macular degeneration. Increasingly, studies have begun to focus on the relationship between aspirin use and bone biology and have discovered that aspirin use is highly correlated with bone remodeling and bone mineral density (BMD).

Positive results of aspirin use on BMD suggest that it may exert beneficial effects on bone health and may even prevent osteoporosis (comparably to how widely it is currently used to prevent cardiovascular events). According to the literature the exact effects of low-dose aspirin on bone remodeling in preclinical studies remains unclear, and to date no human studies have been designed to investigate the impact of low-dose aspirin on bone remodeling. Considering the high prevalence of low aspirin use amongst the elderly population, who are most susceptible to osteoporosis, investigating its potential impact upon bone remodeling and BMD is of high clinical value. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the precise impacts of low-dose aspirin use on bone remodeling biomarkers and BMD.

Conclusion

This cross-sectional study demonstrated that chronic use of low-dose aspirin was associated with significantly lower serum concentrations of BAP in hospital-based patients with T2DM. The mechanism underpinning the insignificantly elevated BMD observed in chronic aspirin users discovered in this study in addition to the significant increase in BMD reported in previous studies, requires further clarification in future clinical trials.

Despite the negative correlation between low-dose aspirin use and the bone formation biomarker BAP, our study discovered that low-dose aspirin use was not associated with lower BMD, but with insignificantly higher BMD at all sites. This result was consistent with another cross-sectional analysis, The Netherland BMDs Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study including 6,671 residents 45 to 65 years old. In this NEO study, the mean vertebral BMD and femoral BMD of low-dose aspirin users were insignificantly higher than non-users. However, the majority of other studies in the literature reported that aspirin use consistently led to significant increases in BMD. In animal models, aspirin use at dose of 9.0 mg/kg/d up to 45 mg/kg/d significantly increased BMD, compared with control animals In the Health ABC cohort comprised of 2,853 adults (mean age: 73.6 years), aspirin users had significantly higher BMD across the whole body according to DXA and at both the trabecular and cortical spine according to quantitative CT. In 7,786 white postmenopausal women over the age of 65, daily use of aspirin was associated with an increased BMD of the hip and spine, both prior to and following full adjustment. In The Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project, which involved 1,705 men aged 70–97, aspirin use was associated with elevated spinal BMD in multivariate regression models. In a partially randomized comprehensive cohort study comprised of 2,016 perimenopausal women on hormone therapy. Aspirin users presented a significant increase in spinal BMD from baseline to ten years compared to non-users. It should be noted that very few of these human studies disclosed the exact dose of aspirin use and therefore it is not clear whether aspirin users in these studies are low-dose users. Considering the biological differences between low-dose and high-dose aspirin use, clinical data are lacking regarding the association between chronic low-dose aspirin use and BMD in the general population.

Methodology

Subjects

This study was designed as a single center, hospital-based, cross‐sectional study involving consecutively hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) admitted to the Second People's Hospital of Wuhu. Only patients who consented to participate in the study were included. T2DM was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The study period spanned three months, between September and November of 2019. The primary inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients are aged ≥ 50 years at the time when informed consent was obtained; (2) patients have a diagnosis of T2DM. Participants were excluded if they had: (1) concurrent treatment for a malignancy; (2) clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (diagnosis of diabetes and insulin use before the age of 35); (3) concurrent medication likely to influence skeletal metabolism (excluding calcium supplements of 500 mg daily or below); (4) known malabsorptive states; (5) underlying metabolic bone disease (e.g. osteomalacia); (6) calcium disorders (other than primary hyperparathyroidism); (7) chronic kidney disease. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Second People's Hospital of Wuhu and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided full written informed consent to the use of the collected data in all analyses.

Data collectors approached 702 subjects throughout the study period. Of these, 135 were excluded from the study, thus a total of 567 patients with a median age of 69 years were enrolled in the study (Fig. 1).

Relationship between chronic low-dose aspirin use and BMD

BMD values at two sites of low-dose aspirin users were invariably elevated compared to those of non-users, although this difference was not statistically significant, irrespective of adjustment (Table 2). For example, low-dose aspirin users had insignificantly higher vertebral BMD (0.95 ± 0.19 vs 0.91 ± 0.21, p = 0.185), femoral neck BMD (0.80 ± 0.15 vs 0.78 ± 0.17, p = 0.309) and Ward's triangle BMD (0.46 ± 0.14 vs 0.44 ± 0.13, p = 0.209) compared with non-users. Following full adjustment, there were no significant differences between aspirin users and non-users for vertebral BMD, NCKBMD and WRDBMD (Table 2). No collinearity was detected in these models.

Based on our study, these paradoxical results regarding the impact of low-dose aspirin on bone formation and BMD might be ascribed to its multiple, yet conflicting mechanisms of action on bone metabolism. It has been reported that low-dose aspirin increases physiologically relevant nitric oxide (NO) production, which may result in decreased osteoblast and increased osteoclast activity, in turn reducing BMD. On the other hand, low-dose aspirin could increase BMD by limiting the formation of osteoclasts through inhibiting the NFκB pathway and stimulating the formation of osteoblasts by blocking apoptosis of its progenitor stem cells. Thereby, in theory, aspirin can have both positive or negative effects on bone metabolism and consequently BMD. However, considering the diverse and complex biological effects of aspirin at different doses, the paradoxical results from this cross-sectional analysis must be interpreted with great caution.

Our analysis had several strengths and limitations. This study was especially designed to investigate the association between chronic low-dose aspirin use and bone remodeling biomarkers alongside BMD in a specific population group (patients with T2DM from a single center, over 50 years old). Furthermore, low-dose aspirin use was confirmed to be present for a minimum of one year to up to 32 years in the study participants, suggesting relative stability of exposure. However, the study population was comprised of a limited number of patients with T2DM and the findings may not translate into younger, healthy individuals. In this study actually all the results were statistically not significant, except serum BAP. Therefore, we should not exclude the possibility that this BAP result arose by chance and that all of the results in this study were negative. In addition, it has been reported that different anti-diabetic drugs may exert conflicting effects on bone health, but in this study further analyses attempting to eliminate this influencing factor were not conducted. Moreover, our study was unable to explore the impact of aspirin use on alternative bone resorption biomarkers, for example cathepsin K and TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase), and most vitally, on fracture risks.

Results

Characteristics of the study population

Of the 567 patients, 210 (37%) reported chronically using low-dose aspirin on a daily basis for a mean of 8.6 years (from one year to up to 32 years). Thecharacteristics of chronic low-dose aspirin users and non-users are displayed in Table 1. The mean age of recruited patients was 65.03 years (ranging from 50–94). Compared with non-users, chronic low-dose aspirin users were older (67.14 ± 9.72 vs 63.91 ± 11.16 years old, p = 0.011), and were more likely to have a self-reported history of brain diseases (42.9% vs 11.7%, p < 0.001) and hypertension (62.9% vs 41.2%, p < 0.001). Additionally, chronic low-dose aspirin users were less likely to take combined calcium and vitamin D (14.7% vs 24.3%, p = 0.037) and acid-inhibitory drugs (3.3% vs.14.6%, p = 0.001). However, they were more likely to take statins (82.8% vs 40.1%, p < 0.001), blood pressure medication (53.3% vs 30.5%, p < 0.001), and cardiovascular drugs (15.2% vs 6.2%, p = 0.008).

BMD and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry methods

BMD, defined as total bone mineral content (g) divided by the area (cm²), was used to measure the quantity of calcium in the bone (bone density) and to determine the fracture risk. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was employed to measure absolute BMD in g/cm² for the lumbar spine (L1-L4, vertebral BMD), femoral neck (NCKBMD) and Ward's triangle (WRDBMD) using a Hologic QDR4500 Acclaim densitometer in all participants. The precision error of this instrument was 1%. Additionally, total fat mass (kg) was determined according to whole body DXA scans. All DXA scans were performed in the same center.

Statistical analysis

Characteristics of participants were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or proportion, stratified by chronic use of low-dose aspirin. Continuous variables were initially evaluated by a normal distribution test; if they were not normally distributed, they were transformed into standard normal variables and assessed using independent t-tests. However, if the continuous variables failed to be converted into normally distributed variables, a nonparametric 2-Independent-Samples test was chosen to compare between these groups. Meanwhile, categorical variables were examined with the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Crude and adjusted mean differences in serum bone remodeling biomarkers and BMD values between chronic aspirin users and non-users alongside the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using linear regression analysis. Differences were anticipated between these two groups, which may influence bone biology and BMD. Therefore, adjustments were made for the following potential confounding factors: age, medical history of brain diseases or hypertension, use of calcium and vitamin D, statins, antihypertensive drugs, and acid-inhibitory drugs. P values below or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25.

### Does chronic low-dose aspirin use benefit bone health? A cross-sectional study on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114vZkXn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Numerous studies have reported the striking result that aspirin use is associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD), suggesting its potential as a population-wide osteoporosis prevention measure. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of chronic low-dose aspirin use on bone remodeling biomarkers and BMD in an aging population.

Materials and methods

Between September and November of 2019, clinical data regarding the medication use, serum bone remodeling biomarkers, and BMD of 567 consecutively hospitalized patients, a minimum of 50 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), were collected. The cross-sectional associations between chronic low-dose aspirin use and serum concentrations of bone remodeling biomarkers and BMD were estimated separately using linear regression. Potential confounding variables were controlled for, including age, sex, and comorbidities.

Results

Low-dose aspirin users had significantly lower serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) concentrations than non-users (82.44 ± 28.03 U/L vs 90.71 ± 32.79 U/L, p = 0.025). On the other hand, low-dose aspirin users had insignificantly higher vertebral BMD (0.95 ± 0.19 vs 0.91 ± 0.21, p = 0.185), femoral neck BMD (0.80 ± 0.15 vs 0.78 ± 0.17, p = 0.309) and Ward's triangle BMD (0.46 ± 0.14 vs 0.44 ± 0.13, p = 0.209), regardless of adjustment.

Conclusions

This cross-sectional study demonstrated that chronic use of low-dose aspirin was associated with significantly lower serum concentrations of BAP in hospitalized patients with T2DM. The mechanism causing the insignificantly higher BMD observed in chronic aspirin users in this study and the significant increments in BMD reported in previous studies requires further clarification in other clinical trials.

Discussion

This analysis implies that chronic low-dose aspirin use is associated with lower concentrations of serum BAP, meanwhile it is correlated with insignificantly elevated BMD, regardless of adjustment. Epidemiological studies demonstrated that T2DM is associated with an increased risk of fractures, and suggested that T2DM should be considered as a cause of more fractures. Therefore, this research only studied patients with T2DM aged over 50 years old, since this population are more susceptible to osteoporosis. This analysis, conducted in a well-documented, hospital-based clinical study, enabled the identification of and adjustment for multiple confounders.

We believe this is the first clinical study that has reported the association between low-dose aspirin use and bone remodeling biomarkers. In the literature, previous cell studies and animal experiments have explored this association but found inconsistent results. Low-dose aspirin (1–10 μM) significantly suppressed osteoblastic differentiation and decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) synthesis in the MG-63 cell line. Nonetheless, in animal studies, aspirin-treated OVX mice (fed with 0.6 mg/ml aspirin) exhibited a significant increase in the expression of bone formation biomarkers, such as RUNX2, ALP, and osteocalcin. Also, low-dose aspirin treatment (200 µg/kg) significantly raised osteocalcin levels in adult male mice. This result concurred with that of higher dose of aspirin use (9.0 mg/kg/d), which significantly increased dynamic bone formation parameters (including MS/BS and Ob.S/BS) and the osteocalcin concentration in OVX rats. Our study illustrated the significant, negative correlation between low-dose aspirin use and the bone formation biomarker BAP in human study, though this still requires further investigation to definitively clarify the impact on bone health.

### Potential impact of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on bone metabolism in health and disease [^112KG9yJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Prostaglandins are potent local regulators of bone cell function and may play a critical role in both physiologic and pathologic changes in the human skeleton. The availability of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors, which are likely to be used frequently and for long periods because of their improved safety profile, mandates an investigation of their possible effects on bone. This is particularly important in older individuals, who are at risk of developing bone loss as a result of estrogen deficiency and aging. This review describes the major effects of prostaglandins on bone resorption and formation and outlines an approach to further studies on the potential effect of COX-2-specific inhibitors on bone remodeling, thereby possibly answering some of the key questions about their benefits and potential risks.

### Association of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level with risk of fractures in healthy older adults [^116b92zC]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been associated with osteoporosis. Preclinical studies have reported that HDL-C reduces bone mineral density by reducing osteoblast number and function. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear.

Objective

To determine whether higher HDL-C levels are predictive of an increased fracture risk in healthy older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study is a post hoc analysis of data from the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) clinical trial and the ASPREE-Fracture substudy. ASPREE was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial of aspirin that recruited participants between 2010 and 2014. These comprised community-based older adults (16 703 Australians aged ≥ 70 years, 2411 US participants ≥ 65 years) without evident cardiovascular disease, dementia, physical disability, and life-limiting chronic illness. The ASPREE-Fracture substudy collected data on fractures reported postrandomization from Australian participants. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Data analysis for this study was performed from April to August 2022.

Exposure

Plasma HDL-C.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Fractures included were confirmed by medical imaging and included both traumatic and minimal trauma fractures. Fractures were adjudicated by an expert review panel.

Results

Of the 16 262 participants who had a plasma HDL-C measurement at baseline (8945 female participants [55%] and 7319 male [45%]), 1659 experienced at least 1 fracture over a median (IQR) of 4.0 years (0.02–7.0 years). In a fully adjusted model, each 1-SD increment in HDL-C level was associated with a 14% higher risk of fractures (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.08–1.20). The results remained similar when these analyses were stratified by sex. Sensitivity and stratified analyses demonstrated that these associations persisted when the analyses were repeated to include only (1) minimal trauma fractures, (2) participants not taking osteoporosis medications, (3) participants who were never smokers and reported that they did not drink alcohol, and (4) participants who walked outside for less than 30 minutes per day and reported no participation in moderate/vigorous physical activity and to examine only (5) statin use. No association was observed between non-HDL-C levels and fractures.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that higher levels of HDL-C are associated with an increased fracture risk. This association was independent of common risk factors for fractures.

### Association between bone mineral density and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin: impact of cyclooxygenase selectivity [^114ok6pa]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BMD was examined in users of NSAIDs (by COX selectivity) and aspirin in the Health ABC cohort (n = 2853). Significantly higher BMD was found in users of relative COX-2 selective NSAIDs with aspirin (COX-2/ASA) compared with nonusers. This suggests a role for COX-2/ASA in osteoporosis.

Introduction

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, by cyclo-oxygenase selectivity (COX), and aspirin use on bone mineral density (BMD) in participants from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) population-based cohort. It is known that NSAIDs inhibit the COX enzyme and decrease production of prostaglandins, which are involved in regulation of bone turnover. COX has two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. Production of prostaglandins associated with bone loss is primarily mediated through the COX-2 pathway. In addition, aspirin may have effects on bone independent of the prostaglandin pathway.

Materials and Methods

NSAID (by COX selectivity) and aspirin use and BMD were assessed in 2853 adults (49.5% women, 50.5% men: 43.1% black, 56.9% white; mean age: 73.6 years) from the Health ABC cohort. For the purposes of this analysis, relative COX-1 selective NSAIDs were defined as having a ratio of COX-1 IC50 to COX-2 IC50 of > 1 in whole blood, and relative COX-2 selective NSAIDs were defined as having a ratio of COX-1 IC50 to COX-2 IC50 of < 1 in whole blood. Analysis of covariance was used to compare BMD across each NSAID use and aspirin use category adjusting for age, race, gender, weight, height, study site, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, Womac score, history of rheumatoid arthritis, history of arthritis other than rheumatoid, and smoking status.

Results

After adjustment for possible confounders, current use of relative COX-2 selective NSAIDs with aspirin was associated with higher BMD at the whole body (4.2%, 1.2–7.3 CI) and total hip (4.6%, 0.5–8.8 CI) by DXA and at both trabecular (34.1%, 15.4–52.7 CI) and cortical spine (12.8%, 2.3–23.3 CI) by quantitative computed tomography.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that the combination of relative COX-2 selective NSAIDs and aspirin is associated with higher BMD at multiple skeletal sites in men and women.

### Long-term outcomes of warfarin versus aspirin after fontan surgery [^112ro5DF]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Because of the nature of the Fontan physiology, patients are at an increased risk of thromboembolic complications. As such, warfarin or aspirin is generally prescribed lifelong for thromboprophylaxis. This study aimed to compare long-term rates of cerebrovascular injury, thrombosis, bleeding, bone mineral density, and quality of life in people living with Fontan circulation receiving warfarin compared with aspirin.

Methods

This was a multicenter study of a selected cohort from the Australia and New Zealand Fontan population. Participants underwent cerebral magnetic resonance imaging to detect the presence of cerebrovascular injury (n = 84) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to assess bone mineral density (n = 120). Bleeding (n = 100) and quality of life (n = 90) were assessed using validated questionnaires: Warfarin and Aspirin Bleeding assessment tool and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, respectively.

Results

Stroke was detected in 33 participants (39%), with only 7 (6%) being clinically symptomatic. There was no association between stroke and Fontan type or thromboprophylaxis type. Microhemorrhage and white matter injury were detected in most participants (96% and 86%, respectively), regardless of thromboprophylaxis type. Bleeding rates were high in both groups; however, bleeding was more frequent in the warfarin group. Bone mineral density was reduced in our cohort compared with the general population; however, this was further attenuated in the warfarin group. Quality of life was similar between the warfarin and aspirin groups. Home international normalized ratio monitoring was associated with better quality of life scores in the warfarin group.

Conclusions

Cerebrovascular injury is a frequent occurrence in the Australia and New Zealand Fontan population regardless of thromboprophylaxis type. No benefit of long-term warfarin prophylaxis could be demonstrated over aspirin; however, consideration must be given to important clinical features such as cardiac function and lung function. Furthermore, the association of reduced bone health in children receiving warfarin warrants further mechanistic studies.

### Aspirin and omeprazole (yosprala) [^112X8bzL]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.6 Renal Failure

Avoid YOSPRALA in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute). Regular use of aspirin is associated in a dose-dependent manner with an increased risk of chronic renal failure. Aspirin use decreases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow especially with patients with pre-existing renal disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.7 Presence of Gastric Malignancy

In adults, response to gastric symptoms with YOSPRALA does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional gastrointestinal follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who experience gastric symptoms during treatment with YOSPRALA or have a symptomatic relapse after completing treatment. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.

5.8 Acute Interstitial Nephritis

Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including omeprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue YOSPRALA if acute interstitial nephritis develops [see Contraindications (4)].

5.9 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Published observational studies suggest that PPI-containing therapy like YOSPRALA may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD), especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of YOSPRALA appropriate to the condition being treated.

5.10 Bone Fracture

Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of YOSPRALA therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Manage patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures according to established treatment guidelines [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Potential adverse effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on bisphosphonate efficacy: an exploratory post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial of clodronate [^1144fScy]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs have been widely documented to impact on skeletal metabolism, particularly bone remodeling, in both preclinical and clinical studies. This has led to many studies of the relationship between NSAID use and osteoporotic fracture risk, but with conflicting results ranging from it being either a protective factor or a risk factor, through to no effect on fracture risk. The level of documentation in our study and conclusions are similar to those reported from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). In the SOF, daily use of aspirin or NSAIDs examined prospectively in a cohort of almost 8000 white women > 65 years found that axial BMD was slightly higher in users of either medication compared to nonusers. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for weight, a variety of medications, self‐reported arthritis, and for radiographic findings of osteoarthritis. Despite this, and similar to our results, the risk of all nonspine fractures over 4 years of follow‐up was not different in users compared to nonusers (relative risk 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8–1.2 for both medications). In contrast, during prospective follow‐up of the Danish Osteoporosis Prevention Study (DOPS), a partly randomized cohort study of hormone therapy (HT), NSAID use was reported to be associated with a 44% increase in fracture risk, after adjustment for a higher body weight and BMD. In the placebo arm of our study, we likewise saw an increase in fracture risk in the adjusted model, but this was far from statistical significance. The magnitude of effect was much greater in the clodronate treatment arm, suggesting an interaction with treatment efficacy. Whether the relationship of NSAID to fracture risk was independent of HT use was not presented in the DOPS publication.

### No effect of NSAID use on efficacy of zoledronate: a post hoc analysis of a randomized trial in osteopenic older women [^114f797V]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also widely used among the older population group at high risk of fractures. NSAIDs have been shown to impact on bone turnover, and a recent reanalysis of a clinical trial of clodronate found that NSAID use at baseline abrogated any effect of clodronate on either bone density (BMD) or fracture risk. To determine whether NSAIDs influence the efficacy of other bisphosphonates, we have reanalyzed our 6-year randomized controlled trial of zoledronate in 2000 osteopenic postmenopausal women. NSAID use was reported at baseline in 38% of the cohort and anytime use was reported by 65%. The evolution of the zoledronate effects on BMD were almost identical whether or not women were using NSAIDs at baseline and were significant in both subgroups at all BMD sites (p < 0.0001). The significant reduction in the risk of fracture in those allocated to zoledronate (p < 0.0001) showed no interaction with baseline use of NSAIDs (p = 0.33) nor with NSAID use at any time during the study (p = 0.28). The odds of fracture were significantly reduced in both NSAID users and nonusers. We conclude that the present analysis provides no support for the suggestion that NSAIDs interfere with the efficacy of potent bisphosphonates in terms of their effects on bone density or fracture. © 2023 The Authors.

### Osteoporosis [^115kSiGJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. Evidence-based screening strategies improve identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from drug treatment to prevent fracture. In addition, careful consideration of when pharmacotherapy should be started, choice of medication, and duration of treatment maximizes the benefits of fracture prevention while minimizing potential harms of long-term drug exposure.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: a position statement of the American diabetes association, a scientific statement of the American Heart Association, and an expert consensus document of the American college of cardiology foundation [^115geMav]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

For stroke, our random-effects meta-analysis of the nine trials found a reduction in the risk of stroke of 10% (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71–1.13) that was not statistically significant. There was some heterogeneity (χ² = 11.0, P = 0.20, I² = 27.2%). The results of these diabetes-specific analyses are consistent with the findings of the ATT meta-analysis and suggest that aspirin likely produces a modest reduction in CVD risk, but limitations in the amount of available data preclude a precise estimate of effect. We also do not have access to sufficient patient-level data in patients with diabetes to consider whether the effect of aspirin on CHD events and stroke differs by sex, the dose of aspirin used, or other clinical factors.

Other recent meta-analyses have examined the effect of aspirin on CVD events in patients with diabetes. DeBerardis and colleagues included six of the nine trials included in our analysis (they did not include HOT, BMD, or TPT due to lack of data on patients with diabetes in the original publications) and found estimates of effect with aspirin similar to those of our analysis: for MI, RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.61–1.21) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 62.2%), mainly due to inclusion of WHS and PHS. For stroke, they included five trials (excluding PHS) and calculated a summary RR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.60–1.14) and also noted moderate heterogeneity (I² = 52.5%), mainly due to inclusion of WHS. They also identified potentially important effect modification by sex: aspirin reduced MI for men (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34–0.94) but not for women (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.71–1.65).

### Aspirin and omeprazole (aspirin and omeprazole delayed-release tab) [^111Bm2Rp]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.10 Bone Fracture

Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Manage patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures according to established treatment guidelines [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.11 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.

The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE), and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment, but some cases occurred days or years after initiating treatment. SLE occurred primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.

Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serologicial testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serologicial test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.

### Timing of ibuprofen use and bone mineral density adaptations to exercise training [^1168xFoS]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Potential reasons for the smaller than expected BMD changes in the placebo-only group should be considered. One possibility is that because they did not receive any NSAID treatment, the physical discomforts that sometimes occur with vigorous exercise training may have caused them to reduce their physical activity level outside the exercise program. We think that this was unlikely because all participants were instructed to take acetaminophen if they had a need for analgesic therapy. This recommendation was based on the long-standing belief that, in contrast to NSAIDs, the mechanism by which acetaminophen relieves pain does not involve COX suppression. However, recent evidence suggests that acetaminophen does, indeed, act through COX-related mechanisms. To our knowledge, the effect of acetaminophen on the bone-formation response to loading has not been studied. However, if effects are similar to those of NSAIDs, and if the group on placebo-only therapy used more acetaminophen than the groups on ibuprofen, then this may have contributed to the small changes in BMD in the placebo group.

### Timing of ibuprofen use and bone mineral density adaptations to exercise training [^117SpydG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Because of the potential antiresorptive actions of COX inhibitors, several animal studies have evaluated whether NSAIDs prevent the bone loss that occurs following ovariectomy as a result of the increase in bone turnover. Indeed, in one of the early studies, 6 weeks of naproxen treatment reduced ovariectomy-related bone loss by approximately 70% in adult rats. However, in a follow-up study, the same investigators found that 12 weeks of naproxen was ineffective in preventing ovariectomy-related bone loss in adult rats. Others have confirmed that NSAIDs are ineffective or only partially effective in attenuating ovariectomy-related decreases in bone volume or BMD.

Chronic NSAID use also has been found to cause bone loss in laboratory animals. In ovariectomized adult rats, 24 weeks of indomethacin treatment caused greater decreases in lumbar spine BMD, trabecular bone volume, and trabecular thickness than vehicle treatment. Similarly, treatment of young rats with ibuprofen for 28 days had an independent adverse effect on trabecular bone volume in intact, ovariectomized, ovariectomized estrogen-treated, and ovariectomized tamoxifen-treated animals. Male gonad-intact rats treated with a COX-2 selective inhibitor for 30 days had an increase in bone resorption and a decrease in formation but, paradoxically, BMD was preserved. However, as with the studies of naproxen discussed earlier, a longer duration of treatment with a COX-2 selective inhibitor may be necessary to determine the true effects of COX-2 inhibitors on BMD. These studies of laboratory animals highlight the complex and variable effects of NSAIDs on bone metabolism, which may be influenced by the age of the animal, bone turnover state, type and dose of NSAID, and duration of treatment.

In contrast to the variable effects of chronic NSAID treatment on bone metabolism in animals, a consistent finding is that NSAIDs impair the bone-formation response to acute mechanical loading. PGE 2 was identified as playing a role in mechanical transduction in bone more than 20 years ago. Key evidence that prostaglandins are essential for bone formation came from in vivo mechanical loading experiments in which the expected osteogenic response to mechanical loading was absent when indomethacin was administered. Subsequent studies revealed that the bone-formation response is mediated by COX-2. However, in mice lacking COX-2 (i.e. null mutation), a normal bone-formation response to mechanical stimulation was achieved through a compensatory increase in COX-1. This suggests that nonselective COX inhibitors may suppress bone formation to a greater extent than COX-2 selective inhibitors when used chronically.

### Daily low-dose aspirin and risk of serious falls and fractures in healthy older people: a substudy of the ASPREE randomized clinical trial [^111rHtH6]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Falls and fractures are frequent and deleterious to the health of older people. Aspirin has been reported to reduce bone fragility and slow bone loss.

Objective

To determine if daily low-dose aspirin (100 mg) reduces the risk of fractures or serious falls (fall-related hospital presentations) in healthy older men and women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This substudy of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial studied older adult men and women in 16 major sites across southeastern Australia. The ASPREE-FRACTURE substudy was conducted as part of the Australian component of the ASPREE trial. Between 2010 and 2014 healthy (free of cardiovascular disease, dementia or physical disability), community-dwelling volunteers aged 70 years or older were recruited to participate in the ASPREE trial. Potentially eligible participants were identified by medical practitioners and trial personnel and were then sent a letter of invitation to participate. Interested participants were screened for suitability. Eligible participants with medical practitioner authorization and adherent to a 4-week run-in medication trial were randomized. Data were analyzed from October 17, 2019, to August 31, 2022.

Interventions

Participants in the intervention group received a daily dose of oral 100 mg enteric-coated (low-dose) aspirin. The control group received a daily identical enteric-coated placebo tablet.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome of ASPREE-FRACTURE was the occurrence of any fracture. The secondary outcome was serious fall resulting in hospital presentation.

Results

In total, 16 703 people with a median (IQR) age of 74 (72–78) years were recruited, and 9179 (55.0%) were women. There were 8322 intervention participants and 8381 control participants included in the primary and secondary outcome analysis of 2865 fractures and 1688 serious falls over the median follow-up of 4.6 years. While there was no difference in the risk of first fracture between the intervention and control participants (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87–1.06; P = 0.50), aspirin was associated with a higher risk of serious falls (total falls 884 vs 804; incidence rate ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03–1.33; P = 0.01). Results remained unchanged in analyses that adjusted for covariates known to influence fracture and fall risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this substudy of a randomized clinical trial, the failure of low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of fractures while increasing the risk of serious falls adds to evidence that this agent provides little favorable benefit in a healthy, White older adult population.

Trial Registration

This substudy is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000347561).

### Aspirin: promise and resistance in the new millennium [^115gLMMt]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2008). Low credibility.

Although conceived at the end of the 19th century, aspirin remains the gold standard of antiplatelet therapy. Approximately 100 randomized clinical trials have established its efficacy and safety in the prevention of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and vascular death among high-risk patients treated for a few weeks, at one end of the spectrum, and in low-risk subjects treated up to 10 years at the other. Despite this wealth of data, several issues continue to be debated concerning the use of aspirin as an antiplatelet agent, and novel opportunities appear on the horizon for this 110-year-old drug. These issues include: (1) the optimal dose for cardiovascular prophylaxis; (2) the uncertain threshold of cardiovascular risk for its use in primary prevention; (3) the apparent gender-related difference in its cardioprotective effects; (4) the increasingly popular theme of aspirin "resistance"; (5) the opportunities of chemoprevention in colorectal cancer; and (6) the renewed interest in aspirin as an analgesic agent in osteoarthritic patients at high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this review is to address these issues by integrating our current understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of the drug with the results of clinical trials and epidemiological studies of aspirin as an antiplatelet drug.

### Potential adverse effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on bisphosphonate efficacy: an exploratory post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial of clodronate [^115oRx8o]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to have weak but beneficial effects on bone health, including fracture risk, but many epidemiological studies are likely confounded. We explored the relationship between NSAIDs and fracture risk in a post hoc analysis of a well-documented, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the bisphosphonate, clodronate, in which treatment reduced osteoporotic fracture risk by 23%. Concurrent medication use at baseline was used to identify those prescribed oral NSAIDs. Only verified, incident fractures were included in the analysis. A total of 1082 (20.8%) women reported use of NSAIDs at baseline. They were slightly, but significantly, younger (mean 79 versus 80years, p = 0.004), heavier (mean 66.7 versus 64.7kg, p < 0.001) than nonusers, with slightly higher femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD, 0.66 versus 0.64g/cm², p < 0.001). In an adjusted model, NSAID use was associated with a significant increase in osteoporotic fracture risk over the 3-year study period (hazard ratio [HR] 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.62; p = 0.039). However, this increase in risk was not statistically significant in the placebo group (HR 1.11; 95% CI, 0.81–1.52). In women receiving clodronate, the effect of the bisphosphonate to reduce osteoporotic fracture risk was not observed in those receiving NSAIDs (HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.65–1.41; p = 0.81) in contrast to those not using NSAIDs (HR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.89; p = 0.002). In a subset with hip BMD repeated at 3years, BMD loss during clodronate therapy was greater in those women receiving NSAIDs than in nonusers (eg, total hip -2.75% versus -1.27%, p = 0.078; femoral neck -3.06% versus -1.12%, p = 0.028), and was not significantly different from that observed in women receiving placebo. The efficacy of the bisphosphonate, clodronate, to reduce fracture risk was largely negated in those receiving NSAIDs. Although the mechanism is unclear, this clinically significant observation requires exploration in studies of commonly used bisphosphonates. © 2022 The Authors.

### Bone protective therapy in the young patient with fractures and chronic disease: what drug (s) should be given and for how long? [^1128WHd6]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Fractures are fortunately rare in younger people even with severe chronic disease but when they occur they need to be carefully evaluated. When considering such a patient there needs to be an assessment of the risk of future fractures and their type, a search for potentially modifiable risk factors and an evaluation of the risks vs. benefits of bone protective therapy. These factors will have to be considered in the context of the underlying chronic disease and the way that this impacts on the patient. In those individuals where bone protective therapy is given a clear plan is needed relating to how long the treatment is used and what type of monitoring is warranted.

### Aspirin and cancer: has aspirin been overlooked as an adjuvant therapy? [^112mcbnn]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Aspirin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase (Cox), and there is a significant body of epidemiological evidence demonstrating that regular aspirin use is associated with a decreased incidence of developing cancer. Interest focussed on selective Cox-2 inhibitors both as cancer prevention agents and as therapeutic agents in patients with proven malignancy until concerns were raised about their toxicity profile. Aspirin has several additional mechanisms of action that may contribute to its anti-cancer effect. It also influences cellular processes such as apoptosis and angiogenesis that are crucial for the development and growth of malignancies. Evidence suggests that these effects can occur through Cox-independent pathways questioning the rationale of focussing on Cox-2 inhibition alone as an anti-cancer strategy. Randomised studies with aspirin primarily designed to prevent cardiovascular disease have demonstrated a reduction in cancer deaths with long-term follow-up. Concerns about toxicity, particularly serious haemorrhage, have limited the use of aspirin as a cancer prevention agent, but recent epidemiological evidence demonstrating regular aspirin use after a diagnosis of cancer improves outcomes suggests that it may have a role in the adjuvant setting where the risk:benefit ratio will be different.

### USPSTF recommendation: aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease… [^111Aj1c8]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Fatal cardiovascular events were less common, so pooled analyses showed that low-dose aspirin use was not associated with a statistically significant effect on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality. 14, 25 Although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect of aspirin on CVD outcomes is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk. In the Thrombosis Prevention Trial30, 31, low-dose aspirin use was associated with a statistically significant lower risk of CRC mortality at 18. 3 years of follow-up. A pooled analysis of 11 trials showed an increase in intracranial bleeds in the aspirin group compared with the control group.

Low-dose aspirin use was not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of fatal hemorrhagic stroke. 14, 25. The primary model outcomes were net quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained or lost over a lifetime as a result of aspirin use. Also considered was the effect of stopping aspirin that had been initiated for primary prevention over 5-year age intervals from ages 65 to 85 years. 26, 27. Modeling data estimated that aspirin use in both men and women aged 40 to 59 years with 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk generally provides a modest net benefit in both quality-adjusted life-years and life-years gained. Initiation of aspirin use in persons aged 60 to 69 years results in quality-adjusted life-years gained that range from slightly negative to slightly positive depending on CVD risk level, and life-years gained are generally negative.

In persons aged 70 to 79 years, initiation of aspirin use results in a loss of both quality-adjusted life-years and life-years at essentially all CVD risk levels modeled. 26, 27 The USPSTF thus determined that aspirin use has a small net benefit in persons aged 40 to 59 years with 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk and that initiation of aspirin use has no net benefit in persons 60 years or older.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women [^114UM5Yk]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention in women on an individualized basis for those aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 10% or more and without increased bleeding risk. Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention is not advised for low-risk women or women aged 60 years or older.

### Potential adverse effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on bisphosphonate efficacy: an exploratory post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial of clodronate [^116SfErh]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, although we found little evidence for NSAID use as a risk factor for incident osteoporotic fractures among elderly community‐dwelling women, the observation that NSAID use significantly reduced the ability of clodronate to prevent bone loss and fractures is unique and of high clinical importance. The marked reduction in efficacy does not appear to be mediated by imbalances in baseline characteristics or lower compliance. Although possible mechanisms need further exploration, there is an urgent need to examine this interaction in studies of other bisphosphonates in osteoporosis and other bone diseases.

### Osteoporosis [^1128Rxbk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. However, management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention strategies are often not addressed by primary care clinicians, even in older patients with recent fractures. Evidence-based screening strategies will improve identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from drug treatment to prevent fracture. In addition, careful consideration of when pharmacotherapy should be started and choice of medication and duration of treatment will maximize the benefits of fracture prevention while minimizing potential harms of long-term drug exposure.

### Patients with osteoporosis: children of a lesser god [^116K2Jmr]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparisons with other non-communicable diseases

As mentioned above, expenditures directly related to osteoporosis medications are decreasing worldwide. Such decline is not the case for other non-communicable diseases, which have similar societal costs. As an immediate example: drugs for CV represent more than 25% of total direct and indirect costs, while for osteoporosis the proportion is shockingly lower (less than 3%). This is exemplified by the case of antiplatelet agents for the prevention of cardiovascular events. With no doubt, antiplatelet medications, given in patients at high risk of CV events, are life-saving treatments. However, the number needed to treat (NNT) for 1 year to prevent a non-fatal cardiovascular event with aspirin is far greater than the NNT for alendronate or zoledronate to prevent a hip fracture (333vs 166vs 90, respectively). NNT is even lower when considering major osteoporotic fractures and longer treatment duration (10 years) with bisphosphonates (3.9 for alendronate and 3.2 for zoledronate). Nonetheless, aspirin is largely and inappropriately overprescribed, in direct contrast with many guidelineswhereas more than 75% of the patients with a hip fracture will never receive an antiosteoporosis drug.

Age-related bleeding risk and discontinuation timing notes that the net benefits generally become progressively smaller with advancing age because of an increased risk for bleeding, and modeling data suggest that it may be reasonable to consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: a position statement of the American diabetes association, a scientific statement of the American Heart Association, and an expert consensus document of the American college of cardiology foundation [^114GyRfK]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The BMD and TPT studies enrolled relatively few patients with diabetes and did not identify important reductions in CVD risk for those with diabetes, but in each case confidence intervals were quite wide. The WHS trial, the only trial that focused exclusively on women and used the lowest dose of aspirin (100 mg every other day), did not find a reduction in risk for CHD with aspirin overall or for the subset with diabetes (N = 1,027; RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.85–2.12). They did, however, identify a reduction in stroke with aspirin for women with diabetes (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25–0.82).

Three trials focused on the effect of aspirin exclusively among patients with diabetes. The ETDRS trial examined the effect of 650 mg of aspirin daily versus placebo among 3,711 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes between ages 18 and 70 years who had some degree of retinopathy. Approximately one-half of participants reported some history of CVD, although it should be noted that the definition of CVD included the use of antihypertensive medication. Fewer than 10% had had a previous MI or stroke, and 9% had claudication. Intervention patients experienced a decreased risk of nonfatal or fatal MI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73–1.00). In contrast, stroke occurred more frequently with aspirin, although the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.18, 99% CI 0.88–1.58). Men appeared to derive more benefit from aspirin than women for prevention of MI (RR for men 0.74, 99% CI 0.54–1.00; RR for women 0.91, 99% CI 0.65–1.28), but this difference was not statistically significant and could represent a chance finding.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women [^115wVN1T]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

For primary prevention, low-dose aspirin should be considered in women aged 40 to 70 years with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 20% or more or in women with diabetes and a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 10% or more. The risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits in low-risk women and in women aged 70 years and older.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1125SJyG]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — benefits of preventive medication reports 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161 680 participants; most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day, with mean ages ranging from 53 years to 74 years. In pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin, decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.96]) across 11 trials (n = 134 470) and decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–1.00]) across 5 trials (n = 54 947). Low-dose aspirin was not associated with statistically significant effects on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up, and although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: a position statement of the American diabetes association, a scientific statement of the American Heart Association, and an expert consensus document of the American college of cardiology foundation [^112kCxmy]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Zhang and colleagues included seven trials in their meta-analysis (they did not include BMD or TPT) and also found similar results (for MI, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65–1.11; for stroke, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63–1.10). They performed meta-regression and identified important differences in outcomes by sex. They found no evidence of publication bias based on funnel plots using Begg and Egger tests. Calvin and colleagues included seven trials from our meta-analysis of patients with diabetes (they did not include TPT or BMD) and for MI found RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.67–1.11) using the seven trials. For ischemic stroke, they found RR 0.62 (95% CI 0.31–1.24) using only the results of WHS and JPAD for their analysis.

The trials pooled in all of the meta-analyses varied widely in the CHD event rates in the control group. If the RR reduction (the metric being pooled) is consistent across patients of differing underlying absolute risk, as suggested by secondary prevention trials and the individual patient-level meta-analysis, then such analyses seem to be reasonable. Taken together, the other meta-analyses reinforce our main findings: aspirin appears to produce a modest-sized reduction in MI and stroke in patients with diabetes, but current evidence is not conclusive because there have been too few events in the available trials to precisely estimate its effects and because our findings rely on analyses of subgroups within larger trials, which have more potential for bias. The currently available data also reinforce that the possible differences in outcomes for men and women require further study.

### Is aspirin useful in primary prevention? [^112YLe5M]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

There is no evidence that aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, although it may change the way that they present. Indeed, there is no evidence that long-term aspirin should be given to patients even with known cardiovascular disease. Theoretical arguments that aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events by reducing the propagation of thrombus are countered by evidence that plaque haemorrhage from vasa vasorum may also cause plaque growth and instability. There is evidence that aspirin causes serious bleeding into the brain and the gut. Aspirin may also detract from the benefits of drugs that have definite cardiovascular benefits, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Meta-analysis is prone to multiple biases in favour of aspirin, including publication bias, bias due to trial and endpoint selection and bias due to interpretation. Meta-analysis should not be relied on in preference to adequately powered clinical trials. Unfortunately, the benefits of aspirin, if they exist, may be so small that a very large study indeed would be required to demonstrate that its benefits outweigh its risks. The evidence that aspirin might reduce cancer is intriguing but relies on data from trials conducted many decades ago using a wide range of aspirin doses. There is no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50–100 mg/day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.

### A randomised controlled trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of fractures in healthy older people: protocol for the ASPREE-fracture substudy [^114yGxfQ]. Injury Prevention (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Disability, mortality and healthcare burden from fractures in older people is a growing problem worldwide. Observational studies suggest that aspirin may reduce fracture risk. While these studies provide room for optimism, randomised controlled trials are needed. This paper describes the rationale and design of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE)-Fracture substudy, which aims to determine whether daily low-dose aspirin decreases fracture risk in healthy older people.

Methods

ASPREE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial designed to assess whether daily active treatment using low-dose aspirin extends the duration of disability-free and dementia-free life in 19000 healthy older people recruited from Australian and US community settings. This substudy extends the ASPREE trial data collection to determine the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on fracture and fall-related hospital presentation risk in the 16500 ASPREE participants aged ≥ 70years recruited in Australia. The intervention is a once daily dose of enteric-coated aspirin (100mg) versus a matching placebo, randomised on a 1:1 basis. The primary outcome for this substudy is the occurrence of any fracture-vertebral, hip and non-vert-non-hip-occurring post randomisation. Fall-related hospital presentations are a secondary outcome.

Discussion

This substudy will determine whether a widely available, simple and inexpensive health intervention-aspirin-reduces the risk of fractures in older Australians. If it is demonstrated to safely reduce the risk of fractures and serious falls, it is possible that aspirin might provide a means of fracture prevention.

Trial Registration Number

The protocol for this substudy is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000347561).

### The underexplored crosstalk between hemostasis and bone metabolism: from mechanisms to clinical implications [^1152Rn5J]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemostasis and bone metabolism, traditionally considered as distinct physiological systems, are now recognized to share a complex and bidirectional interplay. Emerging evidence reveals that several components of the hemostatic cascade-including coagulation factors and platelets-may modulate bone cell function and remodeling. Conversely, key regulators of bone and mineral metabolism, such as calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone, exert significant effects on vascular and hemostatic pathways. This interplay is especially relevant in aging populations, where the incidence of thrombotic disorders and skeletal fragility increases, and the two conditions often coexist, with long-term use of anticoagulants or osteoporosis therapies potentially affecting both systems. In this narrative review, we synthesize current insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the hemostasis-bone interaction. We also discuss how disorders of mineral metabolism influence coagulation, and conversely, how hemostatic conditions may affect skeletal health. Moreover, we examine how pharmacologic agents-such as anticoagulants and osteoporosis therapies-may impact the hemostasis-bone axis. While most available evidence is preclinical or observational, emerging data point to potential clinical implications that warrant further investigation. A deeper understanding of this interplay could support more effective therapeutic strategies and improve risk assessment in patients with concurrent coagulation and skeletal disorders.

### The benefit-risk consideration in long-term use of alternate-day, low dose aspirin: focus on colorectal cancer prevention [^117XzRnF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Evidence has recently showed that aspirin may provide prophylaxis for cancer, primarily colorectal cancer, but also gastric cancer as well as breast, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancer. It is reported that the benefits increase with use duration and an earlier effect was shown in trials using higher doses. However, these meta-analyses were limited to trials of daily aspirin use. Previous analyses from the Women's Health Study (WHS) found no effect of alternate-day low dose aspirin on cancer risk, including colorectal cancer, over a mean follow up of 10 years.

Recently, the WHS published a follow up for cardiovascular and cancer outcomes since its active drug intervention in 2004. The extended study primarily aimed to examine long-term, a median 18-year follow-up effects of alternate-day, low-dose aspirin on cancer risk, particularly colorectal cancer, in healthy women. 39,876 women aged 45 years or older were enrolled in a median 10-year intervention of aspirin or placebo, and 33,682 women were observed in a post-trial follow up through March 2012. Participants were sent annual supplies of monthly calendar packs containing aspirin or placebo in a blinded fashion during the intervention period. At 6 and 12 months and then yearly, participants were mailed questionnaires on drug adherence, adverse effects, non-study aspirin use, clinical endpoints, and risk factors. At the end of the active intervention, participants were opted in or out for further annual follow up. The results showed that over the entire follow-up period, aspirin had no effect on overall (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95%CI 0.92–1.03, P = 0.31), breast (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.90–1.07, P = 0.65), or lung (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.86–1.26, P = 0.67) cancer risk. However, colorectal cancer was reduced in the aspirin group (HR 0.80, 95%CI 0.67–0.97, P = 0.021), primarily proximal colon cancer (HR 0.73, 95%CI 0.55–0.95, P = 0.022). The difference emerged after 10 years, with a post-trial reduction of 42% (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.42–0.80, P < 0.001). Among participants in the aspirin group, not using post-trial aspirin was associated with 33% lower rate of colorectal cancer (HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.43–1.02), while participants who continued to use aspirin had 43% lower cancer rate (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.35–0.93); the difference not being statistically significant. There was no extended effect on cancer deaths or colorectal polyps, when the analyses were restricted to participants having endoscopy at least once during overall follow up. More gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings (HR 1.14, 95%CI 1.06–1.22, P < 0.001) and peptic ulcers (HR 1.17, 95%CI 1.09–1.27, P < 0.001) occurred in the aspirin group. The between-group differences for GI bleeding and peptic ulcers were restricted to the trial period, with no further post-trial carry over effect. The authors concluded that long-term use of alternate-day, low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk for colorectal cancer, but it also increases the risk for GI bleeding.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.

5.1 Bone Effects

Use of letrozole may cause decreases in bone mineral density (BMD). Consideration should be given to monitoring BMD. Results of a safety study to evaluate safety in the adjuvant setting comparing the effect on lumbar spine (L2 to L4) BMD of adjuvant treatment with letrozole to that with tamoxifen showed at 24 months a median decrease in lumbar spine BMD of 4.1% in the letrozole arm compared to a median increase of 0.3% in the tamoxifen arm (difference = 4.4%) (P < 0.0001) [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Updated results from the BMD substudy (MA-17B) in the extended adjuvant setting demonstrated that at 2 years patients receiving letrozole had a median decrease from baseline of 3.8% in hip BMD compared to a median decrease of 2.0% in the placebo group. The changes from baseline in lumbar spine BMD in letrozole and placebo treated groups were not significantly different [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

In the adjuvant trial (BIG 1–98) the incidence of bone fractures at any time after randomization was 14.7% for letrozole and 11.4% for tamoxifen at a median follow-up of 96 months. The incidence of osteoporosis was 5.1% for letrozole and 2.7% for tamoxifen [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the extended adjuvant trial (MA-17), the incidence of bone fractures at any time after randomization was 13.3% for letrozole and 7.8% for placebo at a median follow-up of 62 months. The incidence of new osteoporosis was 14.5% for letrozole and 7.8% for placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### Association of sex and aspirin use with postoperative bleeding in patients with lower extremity long bone fractures [^116GZM1c]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this study. Primarily, this was a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study that was powered a posteriori. We are initiating an adequately powered confirmatory prospective cohort study to evaluate the association between aspirin use and bleeding outcomes by sex. Antiplatelet use was documented in the original study as a covariate and therefore additional characteristics about aspirin use are unknown, including the dosage of aspirin and continuation or interruption of aspirin during the perioperative period. Aspirin dosage, duration and continuation are being collected as part of the prospective study, as well as relevant laboratory markers that are indicative of aspirin metabolism or blood loss. Likewise, we did not collect data on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or oral contraceptive use because biological sex was originally a covariate; whereas our female population's median age of 77 years was beyond menopause, non-elevated estrogen-related platelet effects may still be a factor in the relationship we observed and we will be collecting HRT and contraceptive status in the upcoming study. Next, there were institutional preferences in whether to order and when to initiate VTE chemoprophylaxis. Most facilities prefer 30 mg Lovenox two times per day and between 40% and 80% of patients begin initiation postoperatively, whereas one facility prefers 40 mg Lovenox one time per day and 71% of patients are initiated preoperatively. There was no interaction between timing of VTE chemoprophylaxis, postoperative bleeding events, and hospital, and all facilities were modeled together. Still, patients who never received VTE chemoprophylaxis were excluded from the analysis. Next, only one institution had a transfusion management guideline that outlined a transfusion threshold, and this center considered hemoglobin < 7 g/dL as a restrictive transfusion threshold. Finally, hemoglobin values are higher for patients living at higher altitudes and most (68%) study participants were treated at hospitals in Colorado (~5,000–6,000 feet elevation). Also, hemoglobin values were documented at prescribed intervals only, so it cannot be addressed whether patients on aspirin were more likely to have a postoperative decline in hemoglobin.

### Aspirin, 110 years later [^117LwW86]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Although conceived at the end of the 19th century as a synthetic analgesic agent with improved gastric tolerability vs. naturally occurring salicylates, acetylsalicylic acid (marketed as aspirin in 1899) turned out to be an ideal antiplatelet agent about 90 years later, following the understanding of its mechanism of action, the development of a mechanism-based biomarker for dose-finding studies, and the initiation of a series of appropriately sized, randomized clinical trials to test its efficacy and safety at low doses given once daily. At the turn of its 110th anniversary, aspirin continues to attract heated debates on a number of issues including (i) the optimal dose to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity; (ii) the possibility that some patients may be 'resistant' to its antiplatelet effects; and (iii) the balance of benefits and risks in primary vs. secondary prevention.

### Effects of long-term low-molecular-weight heparin on fractures and bone density in non-pregnant adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113kdQFb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Adults who require long-term anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) such as cancer patients or the elderly may be at increased risk of fractures.

Objective

To determine the effects of LMWH therapy of at least 3 months' duration on fractures and bone mineral density (BMD) in non-pregnant adult populations.

Methods

We systematically reviewed electronic databases (e.g. MEDLINE, EMBASE), conferences and bibliographies until June 2015 and included comparative studies in non-pregnant adult populations that examined the effects of LMWH (≥ 3 months) on fractures and BMD. We synthesized evidence qualitatively and used random-effects meta-analysis to quantify the effect of LMWH on fractures.

Results

Sixteen articles reporting 14 studies were included: 10 clinical trials (n = 4865 participants) and four observational cohort studies (3 prospective, n = 221; 1 retrospective, n = 30). BMD and fractures were secondary outcomes in the majority of trials, while they were primary outcomes in the majority of observational studies. In participants with venous thromboembolism and underlying cardiovascular disease or cancer (5 RCTs, n = 2280), LMWH for 3–6 months did not increase the relative risk of all fractures at 6–12 months compared to unfractionated heparin, oral vitamin K antagonists or placebo [pooled risk ratio (RR) = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.23–1.43; I² = 12.5%]. No statistically significant increase in the risk of fractures at 6–12 months was found for cancer patients (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.31–3.75; I² = 4.4%). Based on the data from two prospective cohort studies (n = 166), LMWH for 3–24 months decreased mean BMD by 2.8–4.8% (depending on the BMD site) compared to mean BMD decreases of 1.2–2.5% with oral vitamin K antagonists.

Conclusions

LMWH for 3–6 months may not increase the risk of fractures, but longer exposure for up to 24 months may adversely affect BMD. Clinicians should consider monitoring BMD in adults on long-term LMWH who are at increased risk of bone loss or fracture.

### Potential adverse effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on bisphosphonate efficacy: an exploratory post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial of clodronate [^111Vwpj8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications for various acute and chronic musculoskeletal or inflammatory diseases. In European countries, NSAIDs account for ~5% to 11% of all medications prescribed every year. In the United States, a recent survey showed that 63% of adults reported having used NSAIDs within the past 12 months. Among elderly patients > 65 years, the prevalence of ever NSAID use could reach at as high as 96.4%, and the proportion exposed to chronic use (ie, took NSAIDs regularly for more than 1 month) was 32.9%.

NSAIDs commonly exert their anti‐inflammatory and analgesic properties by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins via cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX). Because prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), are involved in bone remodeling, the relationship between NSAIDs use and fracture risks has been widely reported in the literature. However, conclusions derived from these studies are conflicting and variously suggest that NSAIDs use is a protective factor, a risk factor for fracture, or has no effect on fracture risk. Thus, the true impact of NSAIDs use on fracture risks, if any, remains unclear, reflecting the inability to adjust for other fracture‐related risk factors in most of these studies.

Bisphosphonates remain the most widely used therapeutic class in the treatment of various metabolic bone diseases associated with excessive bone resorption, particularly osteoporosis. Clodronate, a first‐generation, non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonate, has shown efficacy in reducing fracture risk in osteoporosis, skeletal events in metastatic breast cancer and myelomatosis, and the prevention of bone metastases in early breast cancer. Following a pilot study, we conducted a single‐center, prospective, randomized, placebo‐controlled study of clodronate 800 mg in community‐dwelling women age ≥ 75 years, with the purpose of identifying risk factors for fracture and determining the efficacy of an intervention to reduce fracture risk in women unselected for bone mineral density (BMD)‐defined osteoporosis. Treatment with clodronate was associated with a 23% reduction in osteoporotic fracture risk over 3 years. The comprehensive collection of data on fracture risk and other information captured systematically as part of the trial, including concomitant medications, enabled an exploration of the hypothesis that NSAID use influences future fracture risk.

### Assessing fracture risk and effects of osteoporosis drugs: bone mineral density and beyond [^116Qt6EM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Although there have been numerous advances in the assessment of bone strength and fracture risk, the majority of these techniques can only be performed in research laboratories, making them largely unavailable to practicing clinicians. Prospective epidemiologic studies have identified risk factors that can be assessed within the clinic and combined with bone mineral density to allow clinicians to better identify untreated individuals at heightened risk for fracture and to make informed treatment decisions based on 10-year absolute fracture risk. This article discusses the assessment of fracture risk in clinical practice, reviews currently and soon-available bone measurement tools, and details the impacts of osteoporosis therapies on fracture risk.

### Potential adverse effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on bisphosphonate efficacy: an exploratory post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial of clodronate [^1178Pn8L]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to have weak but beneficial effects on bone health, including fracture risk, but many epidemiological studies are likely confounded. We explored the relationship between NSAIDs and fracture risk in a post hoc analysis of a well‐documented, randomized, placebo‐controlled study of the bisphosphonate, clodronate, in which treatment reduced osteoporotic fracture risk by 23%. Concurrent medication use at baseline was used to identify those prescribed oral NSAIDs. Only verified, incident fractures were included in the analysis. A total of 1082 (20.8%) women reported use of NSAIDs at baseline. They were slightly, but significantly, younger (mean 79 versus 80 years, p = 0.004), heavier (mean 66.7 versus 64.7 kg, p < 0.001) than nonusers, with slightly higher femoral neck bone mineral density (FN‐BMD, 0.66 versus 0.64 g/cm², p < 0.001). In an adjusted model, NSAID use was associated with a significant increase in osteoporotic fracture risk over the 3‐year study period (hazard ratio [HR] 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.62; p = 0.039). However, this increase in risk was not statistically significant in the placebo group (HR 1.11; 95% CI, 0.81–1.52). In women receiving clodronate, the effect of the bisphosphonate to reduce osteoporotic fracture risk was not observed in those receiving NSAIDs (HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.65–1.41; p = 0.81) in contrast to those not using NSAIDs (HR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.89; p = 0.002). In a subset with hip BMD repeated at 3 years, BMD loss during clodronate therapy was greater in those women receiving NSAIDs than in nonusers (eg, total hip −2.75% versus −1.27%, p = 0.078; femoral neck −3.06% versus −1.12%, p = 0.028), and was not significantly different from that observed in women receiving placebo. The efficacy of the bisphosphonate, clodronate, to reduce fracture risk was largely negated in those receiving NSAIDs. Although the mechanism is unclear, this clinically significant observation requires exploration in studies of commonly used bisphosphonates. © 2022 The Authors.

Long-term PPI issues — regarding the safety of long-term PPI usage for GERD, we suggest that patients should be advised as follows: PPIs are the most effective medical treatment for GERD. High-quality studies have found that PPIs do not significantly increase the risk of any of these conditions except intestinal infections, and for GERD the well-established benefits of PPIs far outweigh their theoretical risks. For tolerability, switching PPIs can be considered for minor side effects. For bone health, in patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for bone disease, we do not recommend raising intake of calcium or vitamin D or routine bone mineral density monitoring.

Comparative pharmacotherapy signals include that evidence from randomized controlled trials suggested there may be no differences between bisphosphonates and denosumab in fracture risk reduction at 36 months or beyond, and that raloxifene probably reduced radiographic fractures compared with placebo but increased risk for withdrawal due to adverse events in RCTs and was associated with higher risk for venous thromboembolism in observational studies with at least 36 months of follow‑up compared with bisphosphonate users and other drug classes.

### Aspirin: latest evidence and developments [^1174qCkh]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is a foundation drug of the pharmaceutical industry originally derived as an analgesic/anti-inflammatory agent but serendipitously discovered to have use as a prophylactic drug for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Its modern-day utility in this latter role relies on its efficacy/safety balance in a contemporary population where, at least in high-income countries, age-standardised incident rates for MACE are falling, and where there are now competing therapeutic agents. Its future may be determined by its potential role as a chemoprophylactic or adjunct agent for cancer or other disease states. It therefore will continue to be the subject of further clinical research.

### Clopidogrel and the risk of osteoporotic fractures: a nationwide cohort study [^116sbeCY]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The P2Y(12) inhibitor clopidogrel inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease. It is widely used and, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid, is the standard of care for acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention. The mode of action of clopidogrel involves pathways that are important to the metabolic activity in bone cells, although to our knowledge whether P2Y(12) receptors are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the association between clopidogrel use and risk of fractures.

Methods

We investigated the association between clopidogrel use and fracture incidence in a nationwide cohort study within the Danish population of approximately 5.3 million individuals. All patients who were prescribed clopidogrel during the years 1996–2008 were included in the study (n = 77 503), and three nonusers were randomly selected, matched for age and gender (n = 232 510), for each clopidogrel-treated subject.

Results

Treatment with clopidogrel was associated with both increased overall fracture risk and increased risk of osteoporotic fractures, especially in subjects with a treatment duration of more than 1 year. However, individuals with low exposure to clopidogrel (< 0.01 defined daily dose) had a lower risk of fracture than never users.

Conclusions

Use of the P2Y(12) inhibitor clopidogrel is associated with risk of fractures. There seems to be a biphasic relation so that lower doses are associated with decreased fracture risk, whereas higher doses (recommended dose range) are associated with increased risk. More studies are warranted to determine the potential in vivo effect of platelet aggregation inhibitors on bone metabolism.

### Aspirin, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in older adults: extended follow-up of the ASPREE trial [^111naE26]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Another strength of this long-term follow-up of the ASPREE trial was the continued collection of data concerning aspirin use. This enabled us to ascertain that randomized aspirin and placebo groups had similar levels of aspirin use post-trial. It also enabled us to perform as-treated analyses to estimate the effects of ongoing aspirin use. However, this analysis was limited as we could only establish aspirin use to the nearest annual visit and the exact timing of changes in its use (between annual visits) could not be assessed.

Follow-up of participants from other aspirin trials has produced further insights into the drug's other long-term and legacy effects. In other analyses of ASPREE post-trial follow-up, we are examining evidence for long-term effects in older adults on cancer and on dementia, which may develop over many years and for which ASPREE did not see any shorter-term beneficial effects. It is also possible that individual patient characteristics are important to inform individualized treatment plans, especially consideration of acknowledged markers of CVD risk, and possibly biomarkers such as lipoprotein(a) and genotypes associated with higher levels.

In summary, acknowledging the limitation of this being a non-randomized comparison, increased MACE risk post-trial in those initially randomized to aspirin has several possible theoretical explanations. Other research suggests that certain subgroups might benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. However, established bleeding risks and also the possible absence of long-term MACE benefit need to be considered in clinical decision-making.

### Potential adverse effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on bisphosphonate efficacy: an exploratory post hoc analysis from a randomized controlled trial of clodronate [^114h6GqN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has several limitations and strengths. Although the test for interaction between treatment and NSAID use was not statistically significant (p = 0.18–0.20), the proportion of women taking NSAIDs was somewhat smaller than those not exposed to NSAIDs, so that the analysis is underpowered to detect a true difference, a factor that should be borne in mind in interpretation of the interaction analysis. This was a post hoc analysis of a study not designed to address this particular question; nonetheless, the high quality and wide‐ranging data capture permitted a much more nuanced analysis of the effects of NSAIDs on fracture risk. Our study population comprised elderly, community‐dwelling women, and the findings might not be translatable into men or younger individuals of either sex, though biological reasons for potential differences are hard to identify. Our analysis was based on self‐reported NSAID use at entry to the study, though this was verified against GP prescriptions where available. The clinical, biochemical, and hematological characteristics of the NSAID users at entry were in keeping with those that might be expected in those exposed to such medications (eg, more osteoarthritis, lower hemoglobin, increased platelets, higher serum creatinine). It is, of course, possible that exposures to NSAIDs might have altered during the trial, but NSAID use was documented to be present for over several years in the users in this study, suggesting relative stability of exposure. It is unlikely that many of those not taking NSAIDs were subsequently prescribed them given that the average age of the women was 79 years at entry and guidance recommends relative avoidance of such drugs at older ages. Finally, although the observed effect of NSAIDs reducing the effect of the oral bisphosphonate clodronate on fracture risk could be a chance observation, the fact that an effect was also observed on a second outcome measure, BMD, suggests that the phenomenon is worthy of exploration in other clinical trials.

Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses

The results in men and women for continuous and categorical total hip and femoral neck BMD were similar after additionally adjusting for aspirin, digitalis use, or waist circumference.

In sensitivity analyses excluding participants with NT‐proBNP ≥ 190 pg/mL or starting follow‐up 2 years after DXA scan, findings were similar in women. After exclusion of individuals with NT‐proBNP ≥ 190 pg/mL in nonblack men, lower total hip BMD remained significantly associated with higher HF risk (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03–1.40 [P = 0.020]), and lower femoral neck BMD was stronger and significantly associated with higher HF risk (HR, 1.22 per 0.1 g/cm²; 95% CI, 1.02–1.46 [P = 0.030]). In black men, the association of total hip BMD with incident HF became weaker and no longer statistically significant (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61–1.07 [P = 0.142]), although evidence of an interaction of BMD with race remained (P = 0.013). The association between femoral neck BMD with HF in black men was similar in the fully adjusted model (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61–1.08 [P = 0.147]).

The sensitivity analysis starting follow‐up 2 years after DXA scan showed similar findings. In nonblack men, lower total hip BMD remained significantly associated with higher HF risk (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01–1.28 [P = 0.032]) and lower femoral neck BMD again was significantly associated with higher HF risk (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02–1.34 [P = 0.030]). In black men, the association of total hip BMD with HF was attenuated (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63–1.07 [P = 0.149]). For femoral neck BMD, the results were similar (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62–1.07 [P = 0.144]).

### A systematic comparison of rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^116uroGf]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) play different roles in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). In RA there is minimal evidence that NSAIDs are able to alter the course of disease or prevent joint destruction and, therefore, they should mostly be used as a short-term bridging therapy. In contrast to RA, in AS NSAIDs are considered as a cornerstone of the treatment not only because of a high symptomatic efficacy, but also because they might even retard osteoproliferation and radiographic progression. Considering younger age of AS patients and lower prevalence of comorbidities, they are probably at lower risk for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of short- and long-term NSAID therapy in comparison to RA.

North American Menopause Society 2021 — osteoanabolic therapies — These bone-building drugs stimulate bone formation and restore trabecular structure; because effects diminish over time, therapy with anabolic agents is limited to treatment intervals of 12 to 24 months. Bone mineral density is lost rapidly when osteoanabolic agents are discontinued, so to maximize benefits these therapies should always be followed by an antiresorptive drug. Osteoanabolic therapies are more effective than antiresorptive agents at increasing BMD and reducing fractures and should be the initial therapy for osteoporosis in women at very high or imminent risk of fracture.

### Inflammation, bone loss and fracture risk in spondyloarthritis [^1176FLf6]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Effect of pharmacological treatments on osteoporosis

NSAIDs

In a primary care-based nested case control study, the risk of any clinical fracture was decreased in patients with AS taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (OR: 0.65 (0.50, 0.84)), after adjustments. In a population-based cohort study, the increased risk of fractures in patients with AS was apparent only in those not on regular NSAIDs treatment. However, this result was not confirmed by a nationwide case–control study: after stratifying by NSAID use, the excess risk of any clinical fracture in patients with AS is higher in NSAID users, which may be related to a higher utilisation of NSAIDs in patients with a more severe disease. All these data should thus be interpreted with caution.
