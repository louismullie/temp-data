## Question

A 12-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 6-day history of gradually worsening left knee pain. The pain is exacerbated by movement and kneeling. There is no pain at rest and no history of trauma to the knee. He is concerned because his soccer tryouts are in a few days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows mild swelling and tenderness to palpation of the left anterior, superior tibia. Extension of the left knee against resistance reproduces the knee pain; flexion is limited by pain. There is no local erythema or effusion of the left knee. A lateral view of an x-ray of his left knee is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
A. Impingement of the infrapatellar fat pad
B. Chondromalacia patella
C. Traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle
D. Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about determining the most likely diagnosis for a 12-year-old boy with activity-related anterior knee pain, tibial tubercle tenderness, and pain reproduced by resisted knee extension, and wants to know which answer choice best explains his symptoms and why the alternatives are less likely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and whether they fit a classic pediatric overuse pattern. Then, I should verify which diagnosis best matches the anatomic location and provocative maneuvers. Next, I will review the differential and actively exclude alternatives that conflict with the history or exam. Finally, I will confirm the diagnosis and outline practical implications for management and return-to-play advice, making sure I anchor each step to evidence.

> Let me first confirm the salient clinical features: a 12-year-old boy with a 6-day history of gradually worsening left knee pain that is activity-related and improves with rest, no trauma, focal tenderness at the anterior superior tibia (tibial tubercle), pain reproduced by resisted knee extension, and limited flexion due to pain, with no erythema or effusion. This constellation immediately makes me think of a traction apophysitis at the tibial tubercle rather than an intra-articular process, especially given the adolescent athletic context and the mechanical nature of symptoms [^114xTQG4] [^113sejqK].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic match and pathophysiology before I jump ahead: the tibial tubercle is the distal insertion of the patellar tendon, and during growth spurts and repetitive quadriceps loading (running, jumping, soccer), the apophyseal cartilage can undergo microavulsion and inflammation, producing localized pain and swelling that is classically worsened by kneeling and resisted extension. That aligns perfectly with this presentation and the epidemiology of Osgood-Schlatter disease in active adolescents [^114xTQG4] [^113sejqK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should review the differential and actively exclude alternatives. Option A, infrapatellar fat pad impingement, typically causes diffuse anterior knee pain aggravated by hyperextension and often coexistses with effusion or mechanical catching; here, the pain is focal at the tibial tubercle and there is no effusion, which makes fat pad impingement less likely in this specific pattern [^notfound]. Option B, chondromalacia patellae (patellofemoral pain), usually presents with diffuse anterior knee pain under the patella, worse with stairs or prolonged sitting, and may have crepitus; focal tibial tubercle tenderness and pain with resisted extension point away from isolated patellofemoral pain in this case [^notfound]. Option D, osteochondritis dissecans, often causes vague, poorly localized pain with mechanical symptoms (locking, catching) and may be associated with effusion; the absence of mechanical symptoms and the precise tibial tubercle localization argue against OCD here, although I should acknowledge that OCD can mimic other causes of adolescent knee pain and may require MRI if symptoms persist or mechanical features emerge [^115r8tis] [^113sejqK].

> I should double-check that the clinical maneuvers truly support the leading diagnosis: pain reproduced by resisted knee extension implicates the patellar tendon and its insertion at the tibial tubercle, which is exactly the pathoanatomy of Osgood-Schlatter disease. This finding, coupled with focal tibial tubercle tenderness and activity-related pain in a skeletally immature athlete, strengthens the diagnosis and helps distinguish it from intra-articular entities that would more often provoke pain with weight bearing, effusion, or mechanical symptoms [^114xTQG4] [^113sejqK].

> Let me consider imaging briefly, even though it is not always required: in classic cases, diagnosis is clinical, but lateral knee radiographs may show fragmentation or irregularity of the tibial tubercle apophysis, which supports the diagnosis. Importantly, the vignette notes a lateral knee x-ray is available, and such imaging can help exclude alternative bony pathology while corroborating apophyseal changes consistent with traction apophysitis, though I should confirm that imaging is adjunctive rather than mandatory in straightforward cases [^114xTQG4].

> Next, I should review management implications to ensure the conclusion is clinically actionable: the cornerstone is activity modification with relative rest from aggravating sports, ice, NSAIDs as needed, and quadriceps and hamstring stretching/strengthening. Most cases resolve with growth completion, though symptoms can persist for months to a couple of years, and rare refractory cases may benefit from surgical options such as tibial tubercle fixation in select scenarios. Return-to-play should be guided by pain, allowing participation if pain is low and improves with rest, which fits this patient's timeline and goals around soccer tryouts [^114xTQG4] [^114Rr6a9].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle, i.e. Osgood-Schlatter disease, given the patient's age, activity profile, focal tibial tubercle tenderness, pain with resisted knee extension, and absence of trauma, effusion, or mechanical symptoms. The alternatives either do not match the anatomic localization or the mechanical pattern, making them less likely in this specific presentation [^114xTQG4] [^113sejqK].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle (Osgood-Schlatter disease)** [^114xTQG4], given the classic presentation of a 12-year-old athlete with **anterior knee pain localized to the tibial tubercle** [^113sejqK], pain worsened by activity and kneeling, and reproduction with resisted knee extension [^notfound]. The absence of trauma, erythema, or effusion, along with the lateral knee radiograph showing prominence and possible fragmentation of the tibial tubercle, further support this diagnosis [^notfound]. Management is **conservative**, with activity modification, ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy; symptoms typically resolve with skeletal maturity [^114xTQG4].

---

## Clinical features supporting traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle

- **Age and activity**: The patient is a 12-year-old boy participating in soccer, aligning with the typical age range (10–14 years) and activity level associated with Osgood-Schlatter disease [^114xTQG4].

- **Pain characteristics**: The pain is localized to the anterior superior tibia (tibial tubercle), worsens with activity and kneeling, and improves with rest, which is characteristic of traction apophysitis [^114xTQG4].

- **Physical examination**: Tenderness at the tibial tubercle and reproduction of pain with resisted knee extension are classic findings [^114xTQG4].

- **Absence of systemic signs**: No fever, erythema, or joint effusion, making inflammatory or infectious etiologies less likely [^113sejqK].

---

## Radiographic findings

Radiographs may show **prominence of the tibial tubercle**, irregularity, or fragmentation of the apophysis, consistent with traction apophysitis [^notfound]. These findings, while not specific, support the clinical diagnosis when correlated with symptoms and examination [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Radiographic findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Osgood-Schlatter disease | - Anterior knee pain <br/> - Tibial tubercle tenderness <br/> - Pain with resisted extension <br/> - No trauma | Prominent tibial tubercle, fragmentation |
| Patellar tendinopathy | - Anterior knee pain <br/> - Patellar tendon tenderness <br/> - Pain with jumping | No specific radiographic findings |
| Osteochondritis dissecans | - Intermittent pain <br/> - Mechanical symptoms <br/> - Effusion possible | Osteochondral lesion, loose body |
| Septic arthritis | - Fever <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Effusion <br/> - Severe pain | Joint effusion, osteomyelitis |
| Meniscal injury | - Mechanical symptoms <br/> - Effusion <br/> - Joint line tenderness | Meniscal tear, effusion |

---

Given the clinical and radiographic features, **Osgood-Schlatter disease remains the most likely diagnosis** [^113sejqK].

---

## Management

Management is **primarily conservative**, with activity modification to avoid aggravating activities (e.g. jumping, kneeling) [^114Rr6a9], ice application, NSAIDs for pain control, and physical therapy focused on stretching and strengthening the quadriceps and hamstrings [^notfound]. Most patients experience resolution of symptoms with skeletal maturity, though symptoms may persist in some cases [^114xTQG4] [^114Rr6a9].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle (Osgood-Schlatter disease)** [^114xTQG4]. Conservative management is appropriate, and symptoms are expected to resolve with skeletal maturity [^114xTQG4].

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition in which physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively explore a patient's presentation. The Morning Report section continues this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and clinical course, inviting readers to develop a differential diagnosis and uncover the final diagnosis alongside the authors. This report details the story of a previously healthy 7-year-old boy who presented with 10 days of fever after travel to Bangladesh. Through targeted history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script is developed. As the case progresses, the differential diagnosis is refined until a final diagnosis is established.

### Atypical presentation of perforated peptic ulcer disease in a 12-year-old boy [^111V3F8S]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old boy was referred to the surgical unit with 4h history of severe lower abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. No other symptoms were reported and there was no significant medical or family history. Examination revealed tenderness in the lower abdomen, in particular the left iliac fossa. His white cell count was elevated at 19.6×10(9)/L, with a predominant neutrophilia of 15.8×10(9)/L and a C reactive protein of < 0.3mg/L. An abdominal X-ray revealed intraperitoneal gas and a chest X-ray identified free air under both hemidiaphragms. Subsequent diagnostic laparoscopy identified a perforated duodenal ulcer that was repaired by means of an omental patch. The case illustrates that although uncommon, alternate diagnoses must be borne in mind in children presenting with lower abdominal pain and diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful tool in children with visceral perforation as it avoids treatment delays and exposure to excess radiation.

Case presentation

A ten-week-old male was brought to the emergency unit due to prolonged diarrhea and abdominal distention. He was born at gestational age of 40 weeks with birth weight and Apgar score of 2800 g and 7/8, respectively. He had no history of formula feeding. Two weeks before being admitted to the hospital, the patient had frequent diarrhea with fever. In the emergency unit, he was found lethargic and dehydrated. His vital signs were heart rate 143 beats per minute, respiratory rate 45 breaths per minute, temperature 37 °C, and lack of urine output. After 4 h rehydration program, his urine output was 1.6 mL/kg/hour. Laboratory findings were hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, white blood cell count of 7300/μL (differential white blood cell counts were as follows: neutrophil 58.5%, lymphocyte 23.2%, monocyte 17.9%), platelet of 73,000/μL, procalcitonin of 88.83 ng/mL, prothrombin time of 64.3/13.1 s, and activated partial thromboplastin time of 43/29.3 s. After he was resuscitated, he was then transferred into the ward. During 1 week in ward, while in intensive medical management, he showed a continuous clinical deterioration, including prolonged diarrhea accompanied by vomiting and abdominal distension. Laboratory findings were hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, white blood cell count of 16,490/μL (differential white blood cell counts were as follows: neutrophil 40%, lymphocyte 19%, monocyte 22%), platelet of 76,000/μL, procalcitonin of 1.56 ng/mL, prothrombin time of 37.3/12.5 s and activated partial thromboplastin time of 111.2/28.5 s. The patient, then, was consulted to us. He presented with abdominal distension, absence of bowel sounds and abdominal tenderness. His vital signs were heart rate 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and temperature 37.2 °C, and lack of urine output for 6 h. After 4 h rehydration program, his urine output was 1.0 mL/kg/hour. He did not receive any pressor medicines such as dopamine, dobutamine or norepinephrine. Plain abdominal x-ray (Fig. 1 a) and CT scan (Fig. 1 b) showed gastric and intestinal dilatation with gasless condition at the colon, suggesting a small bowel obstruction, and bowel wall thickening indicating peritonitis, without any free subdiaphragmatic air (pneumoperitoneum). All findings were suggestive of intestinal inflammation with clinical deterioration. The patient did not have a congenital heart disease according to echocardiography. Moreover, there was not any maternal health issues during the antenatal maternal care. The mother had a routine antenatal care without any issues like diabetes, drug abuse, preeclampsia, or premature rupture of the membranes. The labour process took time about 29 h to complete the delivery.

### A toddler with a persisting limp after a minor trauma [^112pHXVe]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

A 3-year-old toddler was admitted for a 5-day history of worsening painful limping on his left leg. History was remarkable only for a minor trauma 2days before the onset of symptoms; the boy fell on his buttocks but was walking normally in the following days. No fever was reported. Pain was also present at night, with no response to oral ibuprofen. On physical examination, the patient refused to stand on his left leg, palpation of the left buttock evoked pain, and exorotation and abduction of the left hip were only moderately limited, without local signs of inflammation such as redness, swelling or skin warming. Blood tests showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (98mm/hour, normal value < 20 mm/hour) with normal C reactive protein (CRP) level (0.5mg/dL, normal value < 0.5mg/dL). His white cell count was 12 110 x 10 9 /L, haemoglobin was 127g/L and PLT was 430 x 10 9 /L. Creatine kinase values were within the normal range. An X-ray of the pelvis was unremarkable. An ultrasound of the left hip showed a 2mm articular effusion.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium [^112WyByu]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium have not been established in pediatric populations.

Amlodipine

Amlodipine (2.5 to 5 mg daily) is effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known.

Atorvastatin

Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)

Safety and effectiveness of atorvastatin have been established in patients 10 years to 17 years of age with HeFH as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels when, after an adequate trial of diet therapy, the following are present:

- LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, or

- LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and

a positive family history of FH, or premature CVD in a first, or second-degree relative, or
two or more other CVD risk factors are present.

Use of atorvastatin for this indication is supported by evidence from [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.11)]:

- A placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration in 187 boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 years to 17 years of age. Patients treated with 10 mg or 20 mg daily atorvastatin had an adverse reaction profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls

- A three year open-label uncontrolled trial that included 163 pediatric patients 10 to 15 years of age with HeFH who were titrated to achieve a target LDL-C < 130 mg/dL. The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C appeared generally consistent with that observed for adult patients, despite limitations of the uncontrolled study design.

Advise postmenarchal girls of contraception recommendations, if appropriate for the patient [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

The long-term efficacy of atorvastatin therapy initiated in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.

The safety and efficacy of atorvastatin have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH.

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)

Clinical efficacy of atorvastatin with dosages up to 80 mg/day for 1 year was evaluated in an uncontrolled study of patients with HoFH including 8 pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.10)].

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old boy was referred to our hospital with an anterior mediastinal mass. This was discovered by chest radiography performed when the boy was examined after being caught by an elevator door about 2 weeks earlier. The patient had been born full term without any complications during pregnancy or delivery. No clinical symptoms were observed during this presentation, and he had no history of previous infections.

### Sudden onset of severe cervical pain in an adolescent girl: case report and review of literature [^115DRNvV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 13-year-old girl presented with a 9-day history of acute onset severe neck pain associated with limited range of movement. Medical evaluation at day 2 was suggestive of muscle contracture, and she was discharged home with diazepam, antiinflammatory agents, and rest; however, she returned because of progressive clinical worsening with left arm distal paresthesia and paralysis since day 3. There was no history of trauma or other systemic complaints, and her familial medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed left cervical and paravertebral tenderness on palpation with severe limitation of cervical and trunk movements; neurologic examination revealed left forearm and hand weakness and paralysis (grade II/V) with thenarhypothenar atrophy. Laboratory studies including coagulation profile were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an epidural hematoma from C4-T1 without underlying cause apparent on magnetic resonance angiography. On day 12, she underwent C3–7 laminotomy with laminoplasty and complete drainage of the hematoma. After 5 months of follow-up, she displays no neurological deficits. The spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is a rare neurosurgical emergency in children. It usually presents acutely with neurologic deficits, but the initial presentation may be atypical or insidious, delaying diagnosis and intervention. Definitive diagnosis is made by magnetic resonance imaging and implies a high index of suspicion. Surgical drainage of the hematoma is the mainstay of treatment with favorable prognosis even in cases with a delayed diagnosis.

### Optimising the surgical outcome in a case of post-traumatic cataract using ultrasound biomicroscopy [^113tFgxu]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old boy was brought with the chief complaint of diminution of vision in his left eye for the past 1 month. History revealed a blunt trauma to his left eye with a wooden stick 6â€‰weeks ago. Visual acuity was 20/20 and hand movement close to face in right and left eye, respectively, without any relative afferent pupillarydefect. Slit-lamp examination showed a total cataractous lens with signs suggestive of suspected posterior capsular (PC) defect. The PC defect was screened initially using B-scan ultrasound of the posterior segment, followed by confirmation of the same using ultrasound biomicroscopy. Left eye lens aspiration along with limited anterior vitrectomy followed by placement of multipiece intraocular lens in the sulcus was performed. Best-corrected visual acuity at 6 months of follow-up was 20/20.

### Pediatric stone disease: an evolving experience [^1152A7UK]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The presentation and management of pediatric stone disease have changed due to early identification and treatment of congenital urological conditions, as well as technological advances. Therefore, we reviewed our 12-year experience.

Materials and Methods

A total of 123 patients with 158 stones presented from 1991 to 2003. The 46 boys and 77 girls were 8 months to 25 years old, including 5 boys (4%) younger than 3 years, 46 (37%) 4 to 12 years old and 72 (59%) older than 13 years. A 24-hour urine collection was done in 50 patients (41%) and serum chemistry studies were performed in 66 (54%).

Results

The seasons of presentation were fall in 41% of cases, summer in 24%, spring in 22% and winter in 13%. Of the patients 94 (76%) had loin pain, 10 (8%) had urinary tract infections, 13 (11%) had a history urinary tract infection, 18 (15%) had gross hematuria, 14 (11%) had structural urological abnormalities and 7 (6%) had neurogenic bladder. Metabolic abnormalities were uncommon and included hypercalciuria in 12%, hyperoxaluria in 2% and cystinuria in 2%. A total of 57 patients (46%) passed the stones and 34 (28%) underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, of whom 24 (71%) became stone-free. Ureteroscopy was performed in 10 patients (8%) 6 to 19 years old, percutaneous nephrostolithotomy was done in 4 (3%) and 4 (3%) underwent open surgery. Stone analysis showed calcium based in 88% of the cases, struvite in 7% and cystine in 5%.

Conclusions

The majority of patients had no congenital abnormalities. Early diagnosis of urological abnormalities and urinary infection, and appropriate management of neurogenic bladder may have reduced the incidence in those groups. Most stones are calcium based but occur in the absence of metabolic disturbances. More patients presented in the fall, perhaps reflecting the increased concentration of urine in the summer. Half of the patients passed the stones and shock wave lithotripsy was curative in most others. Ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrostolithotomy and open surgery were rarely required.

### Complete resolution of the symptoms of refractory Osgood-Schlatter disease following percutaneous fixation of the tibial tuberosity [^114Rr6a9]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common cause of anterior knee pain in adolescents. In a good proportion of cases the pain is relieved through stopping sport alone, or by doing so in conjunction with undertaking physiotherapy. However, resolution of symptoms may take several years. A proportion of teenagers are prevented from participating in sport for a prolonged period as a result of the condition, and some have persisting knee pain into adulthood. We report the use of a new surgical treatment for this disease. We describe the case of a 12-year-old boy who was unable to play rugby for a year due to this pain. Following percutaneous fixation of the tibial tuberosity his symptoms entirely resolved and he returned to competitive sport 6weeks after surgery. A year later the screw was removed. As soon as he resumed sport his symptoms immediately returned and he requested that the screw be replaced. Following replacement his symptoms once more resolved.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^1179az9i]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Erythrodermic psoriasis — case 6 presents a 29-year-old man with a family history of psoriasis who developed plaque type psoriasis at 12 years of age initially treated with low-potency topical corticosteroids, with progressive worsening over the subsequent 6 years. He was treated initially with 15 mg per week of oral methotrexate (MTX) that led to significant elevations in his liver function test (LFT) findings after 9 months of therapy requiring discontinuation, failed to respond to a 12-week course of intramuscular alefacept, and thereafter obtained significant improvement with etanercept; approximately 7 months after his last etanercept dose an upper respiratory infection led to rapid worsening with involvement of most of his body surface area (BSA) sparing only the palms and soles. On examination he was afebrile with other vital signs within normal limits and had generalized erythematous inflammatory patches and plaques covering 95% of his BSA with superficial exfoliation of the face, palms, and soles, pitting edema of the lower extremities, and swelling of the toes without any specific individual joint tenderness.

### Adolescent with abdominal pain poorly responsive to analgesia [^116hi6ms]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentationA 14-year-old boy, with autism spectrum disorder, presented with a 1-day history of colicky abdominal pain, non-bilious vomiting, anorexia and loose normal-coloured stool. Two days previously, he had a poorly reheated takeaway chicken. On examination, body mass index (BMI) was > 99th centile. He had inconsistent epigastric, periumbilical and umbilical tenderness, and guarding, with normal bowel sounds. Observations were within normal limits, but his pain was poorly responsive to paracetamol, ibuprofen, hyoscine butylbromide, codeine and morphine. Investigations are in table 1. On day 3, his temperature increased to 38.5° and a CT scan was performed, which showed concerning features (figure 1).

### Intravitreal clindamycin as first-line therapy for toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis: a case series [^1117JALU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case 3

A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with active toxoplasmosis based on his presentation with a CDVA of 6/18, 2+ vitreous cells, and focal juxtamacular retinitis (Figure 3A) in the RE. There was no history of consumption of undercooked meat or contact with animals. The examination of LE was unremarkable with normal IOP in both eyes. SD-OCT of RE revealed macular edema with increased retinal thickness, sub-retinal fluid, and vitreous hyperreflectivity (Figure 3C). He was treated with two injections of intravitreal clindamycin 1mg/0.1mL and oral corticosteroid 1mg/kg/day in a tapering regime over 4 weeks. One month later, CDVA improved to 6/6 with the sharpening of the lesion borders, resolution of vitritis and macular edema (Figure 3B and D). He remained free of inflammation with a CDVA of 6/6 at 3 months. No recurrence was observed for 2 years until the last follow-up.

Case 4

A 22-year-old male presented with a CDVA of 6/9, 2+ vitreous cells, and an active juxtapapillary retinitis (Figure 4A) in the RE. He had no history of consuming undercooked meat, ingesting contaminated water, or contact with animals. The examination of LE was normal, with a CDVA of 6/6. A positive titre of IgG antibody to Toxoplasma gondii confirmed the diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis. He was administered intravitreal clindamycin 1mg/0.1mL twice and given oral corticosteroid 1mg/kg/day in a tapering fashion over 4 weeks. CDVA improved to 6/6 at 1 month with a quiescent toxoplasmic lesion free of inflammation (Figure 4B). The disease remained inactive at 3 months, maintaining a CDVA of 6/6. No reactivation was seen till 2 years follow-up.

### Generalized yellow-white papules in a patient with acute joint pain [^111nN59m]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

A 46-year-old male with a history of obesity and prediabetes presented with a 3-day history of left wrist and elbow pain and swelling along with a 6-month history of intermittent left knee pain that had recently worsened. He had also reported painless abdominal bumps and nodules for 8 months, which expressed a white material (Figs 1 and 2). Examination demonstrated yellow to white milia-like papules and nodules distributed across the abdomen, flanks, chest, arms, and legs. Several lesions on the abdomen were exophytic with central extrusion of chalky white material, accompanied by surrounding pink to red erythema. A subset of these lesions also exhibited ulceration with overlying crust (Fig 1). His left knee, bilateral elbows, left wrist, and first carpometacarpal joints were erythematous, swollen, and tender with reduced motion. His vital signs were within normal limits. Laboratory results showed normal renal function with a hemoglobin A1c of 5.9%.

### Changes in headache prevalence between pre-school and pre-pubertal ages [^1132povy]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence rates of headache in first-born children were determined at the ages of 6 and 12 years in over 1000 families. A headache questionnaire was mailed to 1132 families when the children were 6 years old, and to 1126 families when the children were 12 years old. Seven hundred and ninety-eight families responded to both questionnaires. The prevalence of headache before the 6 months preceding the questionnaire ('previous headache') was 19% when the children were 6 years of age and 31% when the children were 12 years of age. The corresponding prevalences of headache during the 6 months immediately proceeding the questionnaire ('present headache') were 16% and 19%. Variation in occurrence of headache was high during follow-up years. Maternal frequent headache (≥ 1/month) was significantly associated with the increase in prevalence of present headache in boys between the ages of 6 and 12 years. Frequent headache in mothers, fathers and siblings, and the occurrence of chronic illness, were also significantly associated with headache in the 12-year-old children.

### Tenosynovial giant cell tumor mimicking acute septic arthritis of the hip: a case report [^117TLvQ9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency department with a 5-day history of atraumatic, progressively worsening right hip pain and inability to ambulate. He was afebrile and had elevated inflammatory markers (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR]: 42 mm/hr, C-Reactive Protein [CRP]: 6.6 mg/dL) with a normal white blood cell count of 6050 cells/mm3. Given the clinical concern for septic arthritis, joint aspiration of the right hip was done and demonstrated a bloody appearance with a WBC count of 54,999 cells/mm3 and RBC count of 7,000 cells/mm3. MRI of the right hip demonstrated an intra-articular mass suggestive of tenosynovial giant cell tumor/pigmented villonodular synovitis. Subsequent biopsy and excision of the mass confirmed the diagnosis. The acute presentation of tenosynovial giant cell tumor with features mimicking septic arthritis is uncommon. This rare presentation of an already uncommon diagnosis should be considered in a child with an equivocal presentation for severe hip pain because misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary or inadequately planned surgical treatment of the condition.

### Physeal injury in a skeletally immature male athlete [^1172kFnT]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 12-year-old skeletally immature male athlete presented for evaluation with acute bilateral knee pain. Initial radiographs revealed subtle lucency of the medial proximal tibial physis and MRI was recommended. On MRI, broad-based intravasation of the physis into the proximal femoral and tibial physes was observed. This represented physeal widening, a phenomenon that has been observed in skeletally immature athletes presenting for acute knee pain. While such changes to the physis may be quite prominent on MRI, conventional radiographic findings may be much more subtle. As many causes of chronic knee pain in this population are managed with active rehabilitation, a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis in the presence of physeal abnormalities may warrant evaluation with MRI. The literature suggests this pathology will resolve with rest, but, if weight-bearing activities are continued, there is a risk for significant growth abnormalities.

### Bifrontal epidural hemorrhage secondary to scurvy in a 10-year-old boy [^116nYKDP]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

Introduction

Scurvy, caused by the prolonged deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), was once a malady predominantly associated with sailors in the 1600s and 1700s. However, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2003–2004 found the overall prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in the United States to be 7.1%, suggesting that this is a more significant contributor to medical illness today than previously recognized. While in the pediatric population the prevalence is < 2% in 6- to 11-year-old children and < 4% in adolescents, its frequency is increased in children/adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, many of whom manifest food selectivity and have restricted diets. The relative rarity often leads to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of scurvy and its complications. In this case, we report a unique presentation of scurvy in a 10-year-old boy with unilateral leg pain and bifrontal epidural hemorrhages.

Presentation, Diagnosis, and Outcome

A 10-year-old Asian boy with a history of food allergies, anemia, and speech delay presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of unexplained worsening left knee pain and swelling, intermittent headaches, and diarrhea. There was no obvious trauma history. He was unable to ambulate unassisted, with his mother often carrying him due to debilitating pain. On evaluation, he was hypotensive, with diffuse bilateral lower extremity ecchymoses and limited left knee flexion and extension.

His neurological examination was initially normal. However, while undergoing evaluation, he suddenly developed a severe frontal headache followed by a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure ≤ 1 minute in duration. He developed asymmetric pupils and became obtunded. He was emergently intubated and treated for seizures and elevated intracranial pressure.

### Bipartite patella in a young athlete [^114JY8ek]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

The patient was a 12-year-old male with a chief complaint of right anterior knee pain for the past 3 months. The patient was referred to physical therapy by an orthopaedic surgeon with a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain and bipartite patella. The patient was advised to avoid painful activities and a quadriceps-strengthening program was initiated. At the time of discharge, the patient had normal quadriceps strength and pain-free knee range of motion. Often an asymptomatic and incidental finding, bipartite patella results when secondary ossification centers do not fuse to form a single bone. Treatment typically entails rest and conservative management; however, in individuals with persistent symptoms that are not responsive to conservative measures, surgical intervention may be necessary.J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2009;39(7):560. doi:10.2519/jospt.2009.0407.

We describe the case of a 3-year-old girl with a 15-day clinical history of lower back pain. We diagnosed a spondylodiscitis of vertebral bodies L5-S1 caused by Salmonella species group B that totally recovered with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Spondylodiscitis in children is a rare condition and Salmonella infection is one of the rarest aetiology. A high index of suspicion is needed for prompt diagnosis to ensure better long-term outcome. Microbiological diagnosis is essential for the appropriate choice of antibiotic treatment.

### A 29-year-old woman with jaundice [^11627mH4]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition in which physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively explore a patient's presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of this case. This report examines the story of a 29-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with jaundice and oral mucosal bleeding, 2 days after delivering an infant at home at 36 weeks and 2 days of gestation. Using targeted questions, history-taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script emerges. As the case unfolds, the differential diagnosis is refined until a final diagnosis is reached.

This is the first reported case of bilateral sleeve fractures of the patellae in a child with crouch gait. A 12-year-old boy with hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP), who was found to have mid-stance crouch of 20° on previous gait analysis, presented with pain of gradual onset and limited mobility. There was no history of trauma. Three-dimensional gait analysis showed that extensor mechanism function during loading response was intact, but knee flexion in swing was significantly reduced, indicating protective guarding by rectus femoris. X-rays showed bilateral minimally displaced sleeve fractures of the patellae. These were treated with immobilisation in cylinder casts in extension for 4 weeks. Follow-up X-rays showed that the fractures had successfully united and the patient progressed to full weight bearing and mobility as tolerated.

### Noma in a boy with septic shock: a case report [^114WV8nZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

On January 16, 2016, a six-year-old male presented with two days of swelling of the right maxillofacial region with fever and two hours of weakness. He was diagnosed with noma and septic shock, and was admitted to the PMICU at Xinhua Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China. The patient is of Chinese Han nationality/ethnicity. He had access to a clean water source, no previous related disease, no weight loss, no history of direct contact with poultry and feces, good general nutritional status, was up to date on his immunizations (at the appropriate age according to national regulations), an absence of any known family history of immunodeficiencies, with unknown sanitation in the home and with unknown oral hygiene status.

The right side of the mouth and the maxillofacial area were swollen and tender 36 h before admission. Then, the swollen area gradually expanded to the entire region of the right maxillofacial tissues. Moreover, the local skin color developed to a darkened red, and his temperature was noted to be 39.4 °C. Two hours before admission, the patient lacked energy and developed significant weakness. One day after the onset of symptoms, the patient developed diarrhea, passing seven to eight loose stools per day.

Admission examination revealed the following: a weight of 23.0 kg (71.0% for 6-year-old boy), a height of 123 cm (85.4% for 6-year-old boy), and a BMI of 15.20. The patient was listless (mental status), had a temperature of 37.4 °C, a heart rate of 163 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, a blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg, and a SaO 2 of 90%. Results of the laboratory examinations are shown in Table 1.

### Unusual presentation of miliary tuberculosis in a 12-year-old girl: a case report [^111y9QQf]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present case report, the miliary TB evidence was presented in a 12 years old girl. Miliary TB has been more prevalent in middle age and older people than children. Also, 60% of the cases are male with a mean age of 55 years in studies. Although the mean age of miliary TB patients has increased, the rates remain relatively low in children. In the present study, the unusual miliary TB pattern was seen in a 12 years old girl. The miliary TB in young patients is reported in TB-endemic countries. Based on the results of a retrospective descriptive study in South Africa, 32.7% of children were TB meningitis. Also, the recent study reported 43.3% of children drug resistant was the main reason for hospitalization. But, in our case, the girl had no drug resistance. Approximately 13% of the TB cases suffer from HIV infections. TB becomes more generalized and affects more than one organ when progressive immunosuppression occurs. However, the present case didn't have HIV infection as co-infection or other immunodeficiency condition. Corticosteroid therapy can reactivate cryptic TB. Song et al. reported a 36-year-old man who underwent corticosteroid therapy and two weeks later, he experienced an acute exacerbation of miliary TB. But in our study, the patient had no history of recent corticosteroid therapy. Considering increased the number of BCG-vaccinated children and improving the diet status of children, we see the modified clinical profile of neurotuberculosis including TB meningitis nowadays with wide varieties of clinical manifestations according to the site of the brain lesion. The clinical presentation of neurotuberculosis may be nonspecific leading to delayed treatment and poor clinical outcome. The present case had diffuse multiple rim-enhancing nodules in both cerebral, cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem in the brain. The brain and central nervous systems are two target organs of mycobacterium tuberculosis that cause serious and dangerous forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The most obvious initial clinical symptoms of our case were fever, weight loss, anorexia and seizure. Other studies reported fever, cough, seizure, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice, anorexia and weight loss as the most common clinical presentations in children. A male three-months Brazilian infant was admitted with nocturnal fever, sweating and coughing 10 days before hospitalization and he was not responsive to antibiotic therapy. The results of the chest X-ray showed bilateral miliary TB and also CNS TB based on the CT-scan report. Similar to our case, the recent case showed early diagnosis and treatment in endemic areas. Delayed diagnosis in miliary TB patients can cause serious complications including cranial nerve involvement, convulsions and death as a seizure occurred in our case. Machida et al.'s report showed 1% of TB patients had CNS involvement which is about a high mortality rate and permanent neurological sequelae. Fortunately, in the present case, follow-up interventions showed no neurological sequelae and she was in good general condition. Multiple diagnostic tests are provided to detect miliary TB, including PCR, sputum smear and acid-fast staining, in addition to histopathological findings but radiology plays a major role in this regard. In this case, despite the absence of respiratory symptoms and non-significant lung involvement in chest X-ray, extensive lung involvement was seen including diffuse multiple miliary nodules. Also, a chest CT scan revealed some scattered micronodules in a random distribution in both lungs associated with patchy consolidation in lower lobes in favor of pulmonary TB. Additionally, in the brain, some central hypo-intense with hyper-intense rim nodules in the pons, right cerebral peduncles and lentiform nucleus, multiple diffuse rims enhancing nodules in both cerebral, cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem were obvious.

### Non-operative treated spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma in a 12-year-old boy [^116e1N95]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) has been reported as a rare condition especially in childhood. Because its symptoms are atypical, it is not easy to diagnose the onset of SSEH. However, with wider use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), several SSEH cases, especially not requiring surgical intervention, have been reported. We report on a 12-year-old boy who presented with a 5-day history of progressive pain in his back and extremities and numbness of his lower legs. An MRI of the spine demonstrated a dorsal epidural hematoma extending from C4 to T4, and the axial scan of the MRI revealed a posterior hematoma. Neurological deficit was estimated as not severe and not progressive, therefore surgery was postponed, and the patient was discharged without surgical intervention. Seven months later, MRI and myelography were performed, and we confirmed that the spinal epidural hematoma was absorbed. There have been some cases showing spontaneous regression of SSEH, and in younger than 18 years old, most of those cases that were treated with hematopathy such as hemophilia and spontaneous regression after SSEH correlated to larger size of hematoma. Because of bleeding tendencies in these cases the spinal cord was not pressed by the hematoma; this contributed conclusively to the prognosis. On the contrary, the 12-year-old boy, not having bleeding tendency, had the larger lesion of SSEH and recovered spontaneously without surgical intervention. Evaluation of MRI findings and neurological deficits in SSEH cases is important for deciding the indication of surgical intervention.

2 Case Presentation

A 7‐year‐old Caucasian patient arrived at the pediatric emergency room with symptoms of acute dyspnea. His parents reported that he had been quite well the previous day and that during the night he had suddenly woken up with shortness of breath. Apart from abnormal growth at the third percentile, this was a healthy patient with no significant past medical history. The patient was born to a primigravida mother at 38 weeks of gestation, with normal postnatal adaptation and up‐to‐date vaccinations (Figure 1a). On arrival, he was febrile (38.1°C) tachypneic (60 breaths/min), and dyspneic, with a dry cough and marked tachycardia (144 beats/min). The peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) was 83% on room air without apparent cyanosis. The physical examination revealed a shallow breathing pattern, and prolonged active expiration with apparent retractions of subcostal and jugular regions. On auscultation, there were both expiratory wheezing and rhonchi. An intensive bronchodilation therapy with short‐acting β agonist (SABA) was started and the patient was admitted to the inpatient department where, on oxygen therapy (3 L/min via a face mask) his SpO 2 normalized. The physician then ordered a C‐reactive protein (CRP), full blood count (CBC), chest radiograph, and an antigen panel for common respiratory viruses. The CRP was elevated (77.8 mg/L, reference range: 0–5 mg/L), and the CBC showed marked leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance (33.0 × 10 9 /L, reference range: 4.5–14.5 × 10 9 /L). The chest radiograph (Figure 1b) revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, while the left middle and left lower fields showed a marked increase in opacity. After obtaining nasal swabs, oral swabs, and sputum samples for microbiology cultures, antibiotic treatment was administered with ampicillin 300 mg/kg/day divided into three doses, repeated bronchodilation therapy (salbutamol, 100 µg/dose) and intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 days (1.1 mg/kg/day).

### Sebelipase alfa (Kanuma) [^1111KstU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Infants with Rapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency Presenting within the First 6 Months of Life

A multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical study of KANUMA was conducted in 9 infants with LAL deficiency who had growth failure or other evidence of rapidly progressive disease prior to 6 months of age. The age range at entry was 1 to 6 months. Patients received KANUMA at 0.35 mg/kg once weekly for the first 2 weeks and then 1 mg/kg once weekly. Due to suboptimal clinical response, doses in all 6 surviving patients were escalated to 3 mg/kg once weekly, between 4 and 88 weeks (median 11 weeks) after starting treatment at 1 mg/kg.

The efficacy of KANUMA was assessed by comparing the survival of the 9 KANUMA-treated patients (followed in the open-label, single-arm trial) at 12 months of age to the survival in an untreated, historical cohort of 21 patients with a similar age at disease presentation and clinical characteristics. Of the 9 KANUMA-treated patients, 6 patients survived beyond 12 months of age, compared to 0 of 21 patients who survived in the historical cohort, all of whom had died by 8 months of age. The median age of the 6 surviving KANUMA-treated patients was 18.1 months (range 12 to 42.2 months).

Following initiation of treatment with KANUMA 1 mg/kg once weekly, weight-for-age (WFA) z-scores improved in 3 of 5 surviving patients with growth failure, and all 6 surviving patients demonstrated improvements in WFA z-scores following dose escalation to 3 mg/kg once weekly.

Continuation Treatment

Across Study 1 and another study, Study 3, in infants with rapidly progressive LAL Deficiency, 9 patients received successive dose escalations up to 5 mg/kg once weekly due to suboptimal clinical response [see Recommended Dosage (2.2)]. The median duration of exposure to 5 mg/kg for the 9 patients whose doses were escalated to 5 mg/kg once weekly was 33 months (range 27 to 39 months) for patients in Study 1 and 15 months (range 5 to 24 months) in Study 3.

Of the 9 patients whose KANUMA dose was escalated to 5 mg/kg once weekly, 6 were alive at their last follow up at 3 years, and 2 were alive at their last follow up at 5 years. Of these 9 patients, 6 experienced normalization of ALT and/or AST which had remained abnormal on the lower KANUMA dose.

### Voriconazole [^116794dj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The study enrolled 31 patients with possible, proven, or probable IA. Fourteen of 31 patients, 5 of whom were 2 to less than 12 years old and 9 of whom were 12 to less than 18 years old, had proven or probable IA and were included in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) efficacy analyses. No patients with rare mold were enrolled. A successful global response was defined as resolution or improvement in clinical signs and symptoms and at least 50% resolution of radiological lesions attributed to IA. The overall rate of successful global response at 6 weeks in the MITT population is presented in Table 18 below.

The second study enrolled 22 patients with invasive candidiasis including candidemia (ICC) and EC requiring either primary or salvage therapy. Patients with ICC aged 2 to less than 12 years and 12 to 14 years with body weight less than 50 kg received an intravenous voriconazole loading dose of 9 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours followed by an 8 mg/kg intravenous maintenance dose every 12-hours. After completing 5 days of intravenous therapy patients had an option to switch to oral voriconazole. The oral maintenance dose was 9 mg/kg every 12 hours (maximum dose of 350 mg). All other pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years received the adult voriconazole dosage regimen. Voriconazole was administered for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. A maximum of 42 days of treatment was permitted.

### Knee pain, joint loading, and structural abnormalities on MRI in 13-year-old children in a population-based birth cohort [^115ADstT]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurements: Questionnaires

Demographics

Information on the child's sex was obtained from the midwife and hospital records at birth, and age was registered during the visit.

Knee Pain

To assess the presence of pain, children were asked whether they had pain in the past 6 weeks. If so, the location was checked on a pain mannequin with 61 possible locations, at both the front and back sides of the body. In this study, knee pain was defined as pain in the front or back of the left or right knee. No knee pain was defined as children without pain or children with pain in any other pain locations not including the knee. Additional questions on pain characteristics (available for 325 participants) included the frequency of occurrence (constant, daily, multiple days per week, weekly, monthly, or less than monthly), pain duration (number of weeks or months), onset of pain (sudden or gradual), relationship to sports (yes or no), and pain intensity (numeric rating scale 0–10). Pain was classified as chronic if the reported pain duration was > 3 months.

Physical Activity

Questionnaire data were used to evaluate physical activity. Physical activity behavior was evaluated by assessing sports participation (yes or no), active transport to and from school, and the amount of physical activity (amount of days per week with at least 1 hour of physical activity). The cutoff for a child being physically active was defined as at least 1 hour per day for at least 4 days per week (ie, more than half of the week). Active transport to and from school was defined as having at least 1 trip of walking or cycling to school per week.

For the history of physical activity and sports participation, the parent-reported questionnaire at the age of 9 years was used. In that questionnaire, parents were asked if their children participated in sports and how many hours per week their children spent doing sports. Being physically activity at the age of 9 was defined as 2 to 4 hours of physical activity (sports, physical education, and active transport) per week.

3.4 Clinical Features of EV‐D68‐Positive Children

On the whole, 25 out of 55 (45.5%) pediatric cases were EV‐D68‐positive, with a mean age of 4 years. As documented in Table 1, clinical manifestations in this population spanned from mild to severe symptoms. In fact, only 12 out of 25 (48.0%) children were hospitalized with an average hospital stay of 4 days. Among these, the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was necessary for 3 out of 25 (12%) with one child showing clinical signs of meningitis (ID10), while the others were affected by acute respiratory insufficiency. Specifically, ID106 presented pneumomediastinum and ID102, an ex‐premature boy, experienced convulsive epilepticus status.

Table 1
Clinical features of pediatric EV‐D68‐positive patients.

The most common clinical sign was acute wheezing, observed in 12 out of 25 patients (48.0%), including children with predisposing co‐morbidities: 5 children (ID107, ID45, ID106, ID119, ID09) with a known history of allergic asthma or atopy (age range: 3–13 years) and a 3‐year‐old boy (ID04), who was born at 32 weeks of gestation, had neonatal respiratory distress and suffered from recurrent airways infections. Furthermore, EV‐D68 infection presented with bronchiolitis in 2 babies (ID05 and ID07), with acute upper airways infection in other 6 patients (including ID47, a one 6‐month‐old boy who developed acute otitis media as a complication), or with pneumonia in 2 subjects (ID02 and ID42), who had congenital encephalopathy.

Restricted mouth opening in case 2 patient.

On clinical examination, maximum interincisal distance was 13 mm. Intraoral examination revealed palpable fibrous bands over labial and buccal mucosa along with blanching of palate, soft palate and floor of mouth (figure 5A–C). Tongue movements were restricted and the uvula was shrunken. Histopathological examination showed moderately hyalinised collagen in connective tissue stroma. Few areas show thickened collagen bundles. Inflammatory exudate chiefly consists of lymphocytes and plasma cells.

### Clinical response to oral tofacitinib in pediatric patients with alopecia areata [^114nZqkK]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Cases

Case 1

A 12-year-old boy presented for a 6-year history of patchy AA. He failed intralesional steroid (ILS) injections and topical clobetasol gel. On physical exam, the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score was 40%. He was prescribed 5 mg oral tofacitinib twice a day. After 1 month of treatment (electively taken once daily), he experienced full hair regrowth without side effects.

Case 2

A 13-year-old boy presented for a few month-history of alopecia universalis (AU). He had tried ILS, topical, and oral steroids without response. SALT score was 100%. He had positive scalp hair pull test, intact eyebrows and eyelashes, pitting nails, and patchy hair loss across bilateral arms and legs. He was therefore put on 10 mg oral tofacitinib BID. The patient presented after one month of treatment with full regrowth and no side effects other than mild facial acne.

Case 3

A 13-year-old girl with atopic dermatitis presented for a 1-year history of rapid hair shedding unresponsive to topical steroids or ILS. SALT score was 60% and right eyelashes were substantially affected. After one month of well tolerated 10 mg oral tofacitinib BID, she experienced full hair regrowth.

Case 4

A 13-year-old boy presented for a few months of functionally impairing AU. The SALT score was 80%. He had over 50% eyelash and eyebrow loss with severe eye irritation, no hair on arms, axillae, or legs, and significant nail pitting. He was therefore prescribed 10 mg oral tofacitinib twice a day. Two months later, he exhibited full regrowth without complaints.

Case 5

A 10-year-old girl presented for worsening patchy AA dating back to months prior to presentation. Prednisone and ILS were unsuccessful. Upon examination, the SALT score was 50% with eyebrow and eyelash involvement. After 1 month of 5 mg oral tofacitinib twice a day, she had regrown her eyebrows and coronal patches, achieving a 20% SALT score (ophiasis). The dose was hence doubled (10 mg twice a day). After 2 months, she experienced complete regrowth without adverse events.

### What parents need to know about knee pain in active children… [^114xTQG4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Usually, knee pain stems from minor injuries caused by using the knee over and over again without giving it time to recover. This is called an overuse injury. One of the most common overuse injuries of the knee is Osgood-Schlatter disease. OSD, also known as jumper's knee, is a common cause of knee pain in children who play sports. This is especially common in sports that require jumping and running. These movements strain the kneecap tendon and the shinbone, which causes inflammation and knee pain. One in 10 children may be affected by OSD. This condition usually develops during a growth spurt and resolves after the bone stops growing. This means girls aged 8 to 13 years and boys aged 12 to 15 years frequently have this knee pain. It is most common in children actively participating in sports that involve jumping, squatting, kicking, and running. The sports with the highest risk include basketball, volleyball, sprinting, and soccer.

OSD causes knee pain and swelling that are worse with physical activity and improve with rest. The pain is in a specific place: immediately below the knee joint at the tibial tubercle, where the kneecap tendon attaches to the shinbone. Most children experience pain in 1 knee, but in 30% of cases, children have pain in both knees. The severity of pain and swelling can vary and can sometimes limit walking, daily activities, and sports participation. In most cases, the history of symptoms and a complete physical examination by a physician are enough to make the clinical diagnosis of OSD. Special tests of the knees are not usually necessary to make the diagnosis. If a child has other symptoms, especially pain in other locations, a physician may recommend imaging studies like radiography. These unusual symptoms may be associated with rare conditions, such as bone injuries, tumors, or infections.

The decision to return to sports depends on each child's healing and pain tolerance. Children may continue to play with a low level of pain, as long as the pain improves with rest. Parents, coaches, and other sports leaders need to be supportive of children and never push them to ignore their pain. This way, children can enjoy the benefits of sports and exercise without pressure and pain.

### Bilateral osteochondral defects of the patellae in an 11-year-old girl [^115r8tis]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Osteochondral defect or osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee usually affects young, active populations. It is a challenging diagnosis as patients typically present with poorly localised activity-related pain, which is non-specific and covers many differentials. We present an active 11-year-old girl with bilateral osteochondral defects of the patellae: a rare clinical disorder which was affecting her sporting activities. She had a 12-month history of bilateral anterior knee pain before the diagnosis was achieved with appropriate imaging. Her pain significantly improved with activity modification and physiotherapy. Follow-up will require outpatient clinic assessment and imaging to determine if non-operative management continues to be successful or surgery may be required. This case report emphasises the importance of appropriate high index of suspicion when managing patients with non-specific knee pain. It also demonstrates the importance of judicious use of imaging to avoid a missed or delayed diagnosis.

OVERDOSAGE

Approximately 11/2 hours after the reported ingestion of from 7 to10 Ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), a 19-month old child weighing 12 kgwas seen in the hospital emergency room, apneic and cyanotic, responding only to painful stimuli. This type of stimulus, however, was sufficient to induce respiration. Oxygen and parenteral fluidswere given; a greenish-yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomachwith no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen. Two hoursafter ingestion the child's condition seemed stable; she still respondedonly to painful stimuli and continued to have periods of apnea lastingfrom 5 to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care andsodium bicarbonate was administered as well as infusions of dextroseand normal saline. By four hours post-ingestion she could bearoused easily, sit by herself and respond to spoken commands. Blood level of ibuprofen was 102.9 µg/mL approximately 81/2 hoursafter accidental ingestion. At 12 hours she appeared to be completelyrecovered.

In two other reported cases where children (each weighingapproximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae. Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 µg/mL — about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies. A 19-year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over aperiod of a few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus wasnoted. After hospitalization, parenteral hydration and three days bedrest, he recovered with no reported sequelae.

In cases of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied byvomiting or lavage, though little drug will likely be recovered if morethan an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Because the drug is acidicand is excreted in the urine, it is theoretically beneficial to administeralkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures, the useof oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption andreabsorption of Ibuprofen tablets.

### Tuberculosis revisted: classic imaging findings in childhood [^112sf8hc]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous tenosynovitis is an unusual manifestation of extrapulmonary TB, predominantly affecting the flexor tendon sheaths of the hands. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and evaluating the extent of disease. Diffuse thickening of the tendons and synovium with minimal synovial sheath effusion is usually seen, in contrast to the predominant effusions seen in suppurative tenosynovitis.

MRI helps to precisely delineate the extent of disease. Tuberculous tenosynovitis can occur with osteomyelitis (Fig. 38).

A 29-year-old African American male presented to our emergency department with a 5-day history of perineal pain and tender swelling of the left perineal body with no evidence of trauma. Physical examination revealed a firm left proximal corpus cavernosum body. Laboratory tests were within normal limits. Pelvic MRI confirmed the presence of a large left-sided unilateral corporal cavernosum partial thrombosis filling the proximal third of the left corpus cavernosum. The patient was managed conservatively with anticoagulation, pain control, and pelvic rest. At 3-month follow-up, perineal imaging showed reduction of thrombus size and resolution of pain and swelling. At 6-month follow-up, a penile ultrasound demonstrated almost complete resolution of the thrombus.

A 6-year-old boy was evaluated for a 6-week history of low back pain. Initially, the pain was exacerbated by movements, eventually showing a milder and fluctuating trend. History was unremarkable for previous traumatic events, fever or nocturnal pain. Physical examination revealed localised pain at palpation of the spinous processes at the lumbosacral level. Blood tests showed a normal blood count, negative C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, normal lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase. A posterior-anterior radiograph of the lumbar spine resulted normal. An MRI scan revealed a lumbosacral transitional vertebra with bone oedema of the posterior arch until the spinous process. For better bone definition, a CT scan was performed (figure 1).

### A comprehensive review of neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 and management of pre-existing neurologic disorders in children [^112Nciau]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

One case report from Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, describes a previously healthy 11-year-old who presented with status epilepticus and cerebrospinal fluid evidence of encephalitis after a 2-day history of generalized weakness and no respiratory symptoms. Nasopharyngeal swab confirmed COVID-19 and rhinovirus/enterovirus; however, cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for the latter, which suggests possible COVID-19 etiology. However, it is unclear whether the patient's cerebrospinal fluid was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Management of status epilepticus required 4 anticonvulsant therapies, but the child recovered fully after 6 days without further treatment. Dugue et aldescribed a 6-week-old term infant with a family history of simple febrile seizures, who presented with fever, cough, and 2 brief episodes of sustained upward gaze deviation and bilateral leg stiffening. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus C. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. The infant was discharged after 1 day without further complications. A case report by Chacón-Aguilar et aldescribed a 26-day-old infant who presented after several minutes of upward gaze deviation and generalized hypertonia, followed by another several minute episode of generalized hypertonia and facial cyanosis. The infant had a 12-hour history of fever, rhinorrhea, and vomiting at presentation. Extended (36-hour) electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring found no evidence of seizure activity. PCR testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARs-CoV-2, and all other infectious workup was negative. After a 6-day hospitalization, the infant was discharged without further complications. Bhatta et alreported a previously healthy 11-year-old boy who presented initially with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure witnessed by his mother, followed by another seizure in the emergency department necessitating 2 mg intravenous lorazepam. Of note, he was afebrile and did not feel unwell. PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Furthermore, head computed tomograph and chest radiograph were both normal. He was treated with levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily and discharged the next day. No other symptoms or recurrence of seizures were reported at a 1-week follow-up. This case highlights an unusual presentation of new-onset seizure in the absence of any other COVID-19 symptoms.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 1%) in PTPs reported in clinical trials for REBINYN were itching and injection site reactions. Common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 1%) in PUPs reported in clinical trials for REBINYN were rash, FIX inhibitors, hypersensitivity, itching, injection site reaction, and anaphylactic reaction.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Previously Treated Patients (PTPs)

In five multicenter, prospective, non-controlled, open-label clinical trials, 115 PTPs [0 to 6 years old: 12 subjects (10%); 7 to 12 years old: 13 subjects (11%); 13 to 17 years old: 18 subjects (16%); ≥ 18 years old: 72 subjects (63%)] received at least one dose of REBINYN as part of routine prophylaxis, on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes, perioperative management of major and minor surgery, or pharmacokinetic evaluation [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A PTP was defined as a subject with a history of at least 150 exposure days to other Factor IX products (adolescent/adult subjects) or 50 exposure days to other Factor IX products (pediatric subjects), and no history of inhibitors. A total of 15,167 injections were administered over a median of 733 days (range: 29–2951 days), equivalent to 15,137 exposure days and 292 patient-years.

Adverse reactions in PTPs are listed in Table 3.

### Slipped capital femoral epiphysis associated with vitamin C deficiency in a 7-year-old boy [^115K9py3]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 7-year-old boy presented to our outpatient department with a history of pain and swelling in multiple joints for 6 months and refusal to walk and sit for 1 month. The child was apparently normal 6 months before, when he had fever for few days documented at 101°F to 102°F, which responded to antipyretics. Subsequently, his parents first noticed swelling of the right ankle followed by bilateral knee swelling associated with minimal pain. The child had lower back pain and bilateral hip pain after few days with painful limping followed by difficulty to sit from a lying position. He was diagnosed to have juvenile spondyloarthropathy and was started on antirheumatic medications. After 6 weeks of using the medications, pain and swellings persisted. He was confined to bed over the past 1 month. The child had recurrent abdominal pain with loss of appetite, which the parents attributed to the effect of medications. He was mainly feeding on milk, juice, and biscuits.

There was no history of trauma, fever, morning stiffness, and small joints involvement. There was no history of skin rash or bleeding manifestations. There was no history of recurrent infections. Birth and vaccination history was insignificant. No behavioral changes were observed. He is a student in the second year of elementary school. There was no family history of similar complaints or any chronic diseases.

On general examination, the child was alert and oriented. Face, hair, and eyes were normal. Mild gingivitis was noted along the upper incisors. No lymphadenopathy and no skin lesions were observed. The body mass index was calculated to be 27.8 kg/m 2. Respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examination findings are normal.

The child was lying on the bed with lower limbs in frog-like position and semiflexed at hips and knees. Both knee joints were swollen, warm, and tender. Overlying skin was normal, and thigh muscle wasting was noted. The child was apprehensive and resisted examination of movements at hip and knee joints.

1 CLINICAL HISTORY

A previously healthy 7‐year‐old boy presented with generalized tonic‐clonic seizures for approximately 1 month. He was the first child of unrelated, healthy parents and had exhibited normal development. MR imaging demonstrated a large, right‐sided temporal lobe mass‐like lesion measuring 44 × 25 × 24 mm. The lesion exhibited hypointense on T1‐weighted images and a distinct heterogenous high signal intensity on T2/FLAIR images with nodular contrast enhancement (Figure 1). He underwent surgical gross total resection of the tumor and postoperatively he was free of symptoms. Eight months post‐surgery, neuroimaging gave no indication of tumor recurrence.

### Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome presenting with a 12-year history of intermittent proteinuria and anemia: a case from the middle east [^112EPcku]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Imerslund-Gräsbeck Syndrome (IGS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by selective cobalamin (vitamin B12) malabsorption and often accompanied by proteinuria. Mutations in CUBN or AMN genes underlie the condition, which usually manifests in childhood with megaloblastic anemia, failure to thrive, or recurrent infections.

Case Presentation

We report a 15-year-old Iranian boy with a 12-year history of recurrent anemia and intermittent proteinuria. He presented with fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. Laboratory evaluation showed pancytopenia, macrocytic anemia (Hb 7.5 g/dL → 6.9 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (91×10³/µL → 38×10³/µL), and a severely reduced serum vitamin B12 level (74.4 pg/mL). Liver enzymes were elevated (AST 346 U/L, ALT 225 U/L), while renal function was preserved. Bone marrow aspiration confirmed megaloblastic changes. Despite the lack of confirmatory genetic testing, the diagnosis of IGS was made based on clinical findings and hematologic response. Treatment with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin (1000 mcg/day) and folic acid resulted in marked improvement, with hemoglobin rising to 11.4 g/dL and normalization of blood counts within three weeks. Intermittent proteinuria persisted.

Conclusion

This case emphasizes the importance of considering IGS in children and adolescents with unexplained macrocytic anemia and proteinuria, particularly in the Middle East where the condition is underdiagnosed. Early recognition and lifelong vitamin B12 supplementation are critical to prevent irreversible complications such as neurological deficits, developmental delay, and growth impairment.

Case Report

A 12-year-old girl was referred to the pediatrics department in our institution because of a 7-day history of fever (maximum 39.0°C) of unknown origin. No previous infections, trauma, or surgery, and remarkable medical history were found. On examination, her vital signs were normal except for the fever. No respiratory or central neurologic symptoms were observed. The rest of the physical examination performed by a pediatrician was negative. Laboratory evaluations included the following: white blood cell count (WBC) 10,200 × 10 2 /μL (76.1% neutrophils), C-reactive protein (CRP) 17.8 mg/dL, procalcitonin 0.2 ng/mL, and negative influenza. Two sets of blood cultures were collected at the time of admission.

She was admitted to the pediatrics department the same day with the suspicion of infection, neoplasm, or collagen disease. Empirical treatment with intravenous cefotaxime was prescribed. On day 2 after admission, she reported of left buttock pain, but without neurologic symptoms. On day 3, the fever was still present, and blood culture revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureu s. To detect any focus of infection immediately, pediatricians performed echocardiography and CT at thoracic-to-pelvic levels to identify the origin of the fever. Echocardiography showed no vegetation. CT with intravenous contrast, however, revealed a large epidural mass in the paramedian left spinal canal, from L3 to S1 (Figure 1). On day 4, gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the lumbar spine revealed a large mass with ring enhancement in the same area (Figure 2).

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^116ZZzhk]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Review and Discussion

"Silent" intra-articular FBs are relatively uncommon in pediatric medical settings. We present the largest series of such cases reported to date. The deceptive presentation of symptoms poses a unique diagnostic challenge. The often-unremarkable nature of the injury combined with apparently negative radiographs and nonspecific soft-tissue inflammation on MRIs, frequently lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Our case 1 illustrates these features. The clinical picture was misleading, and the imaging results were noninformative, whereas the arthroscopy procedure revealed and enabled the removal of an intra-articular FB. This case underscores the significance of vigilance and awareness of subtle clinical presentations, particularly when initial imaging assessments yield normal or ambiguous results. Patients may present with recurrent or persistent joint pain, swelling, and numbness weeks or even months after an injury that may have not been remarkable enough to recall as the cause of joint trauma. This is particularly relevant to the pediatric population, especially with regard to patients without rheumatological characteristics and those who already have a history of trauma to the affected joint with no signs of skin penetration on physical examination.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old boy was referred to our institution because of nausea and vomiting for 1 day. He had also been experiencing shortness of breath for more than 1 year. This symptom had progressed so that he could no longer run or walk upstairs without chest discomfort. There was no associated fever, diarrhea, or coughing. He had a history of heart murmur that was diagnosed in another clinic 4 years ago. Echocardiogram 4 years prior suggested mild to moderate biatrial enlargement with trivial mitral valve regurgitation. He did not go in for any follow-up until this admission. He had no other associated diseases, nor use of medicine.

### Toxoplasma, toxocara and tuberculosis co-infection in a four year old child [^113X9Auo]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

A 4 year-old, previously healthy boy was admitted to the surgical unit of the Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka with an abscess in the left big toe. No fever or local lymphadenopathy was present at initial presentation. The abscess was drained, treated with antibiotics and the child was discharged. Two weeks later the child was re-admitted with an infection at the site of original abscess and left sided inguinal lymphadenopathy. Full blood count (FBC) revealed an eosinophilia of 12.5% (WBC count 19,800, N 40.8%, L 35.9%). Blood picture showed moderate eosinophilia with reactive changes suggestive of either a parasitic infection, or an allergic/drug reaction. A blood sample was sent for the detection of Toxoplasma and Toxocara antibodies to the Medical Research Institute (MRI), Colombo. Empirical treatment was commenced with Diethyl Carbamazine 6 mg/kg/body weight for 14 days and Mebendazole 50 mg twice a day for 3 days (based on body weight of 13 kg) together with intravenous antibiotics. The lymph node enlargement which persisted during the wound infection resolved with treatment and the child was discharged 14 days after admission.

Three months later the child was referred to the Paediatric Unit of the same hospital with reports of the blood sample taken at the time of previous admission indicating positive serology for both Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara spp (Toxoplasma antibody IgG Negative, IgM Positive and Toxocara antibody IgG Positive). Examination of the child at this instance revealed bilateral cervical (2 cm) and left side inguinal (3 cm) lymph nodes, and non tender hepatomegaly approximately 2 cm from the costal margin. No splenomegaly was noted. There was no history of fever, cough, wheezing or recurrent infections. No weight loss, night sweats or chronic cough suggestive of tuberculosis was recorded. There was no contact history of tuberculosis though intensive questioning of the parents revealed a history of lymphadenopathy due to tuberculosis in the elder sibling, approximately one year before this child was born. The sibling had been treated with the full course of anti-tuberculosis treatment based on the WHO recommendations and was healthy thereafter. There was no association with cats or ingestion of undercooked meat though there was a history of close contact with dogs which were not de-wormed.

Case 9

A 12-year-old girl with celiac disease presented for deteriorating AA that first appeared at the age of 4 years. She reported losing patches of eyebrows and eyelashes with severe chronic ocular inflammation. She tried clobetasol and ILS without response. On examination, the SALT score was 90% (ophiasis pattern) and arms and legs were hairless. After 3 months on 10 mg oral tofacitinib twice a day, the SALT score was reduced to 20%. She achieved full regrowth after 6 months without side effects.

Case 10

A 12-year-old treatment-naïve girl presented for a 1-year history of severe patchy AA. The SALT score was 95%. After 4 months on 5 mg oral tofacitinib twice a day, the SALT score was reduced to 10% (ophiasis). After 5 months on 10 mg oral tofacitinib twice a day, she achieved full regrowth and was doing well.

A 6-year-old girl presented with a history of leg pain and cramping that progressively worsened over a 2- to 3-week period of time. Her examination was notable for normal vital signs, limited range of motion of her left hip, and a limp. Inflammatory markers were slightly elevated, but the serum electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium, complete blood cell count and differential, and creatine kinase level were normal. She was hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation and was noted to have abnormal muscle movements classified as myokymia (continuous involuntary quivering, rippling, or undulating movement of muscles). Electromyography confirmed the myokymia but did not reveal evidence of a myopathy or neuropathy, prompting additional evaluation for a systemic etiology.

Case 6

A previously healthy 16-year-old boy was evaluated for 6-month history of left limping with recurrent left knee arthritis treated with intra-articular corticosteroid injection with transient benefit but, afterwards, swelling recurrence. His past medical history and familiar history were unremarkable. He was evaluated at our Institute during the third episode of swollen knee, 2 months after the first episode. Despite the swelling, he did not report morning stiffness or joint pain. The physical examination was unremarkable except for a warm, swallen right knee with limited ROM. CBC, ESR, CRP and autoantibody profiles (ANA and anti-DNA) were normal. Knee US showed significant intra-articular effusion and synovial thickening, with no positivity to color-doppler signal. Oligoarticular JIA was suspected and a knee arthrocentesis was performed with 270 mL of bloody fluid drained (Fig. 6). Synovial fluid analysis showed a mild increase in WBC count (20.267cells/uL), with negative bacterial culture. One month after arthrocentesis, the joint picture appeared to have improved; however, slight intra- articular effusion persisted on US. Based on the pattern of recurrent arthritis, although the boy denied any travel to endemic areas or tick bites, second level analysis were performed that showed seropositivity for Borrelia Burgdorferi, confirmed by positive immuno-blot; diagnosis of Lyme arthritis (LA) was made and antibiotic therapy with Amoxicillin 50 mg / kg/ day for 28 days was started.

### Pubertal development of transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients in the era of oral chelation with deferasirox: results from the French registry [^1124LzkK]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

A total of 50 patients, treated in 24 registry-participating centers, accumulated at least three years of DFX therapy before puberty in their history of chelation therapy and met the inclusion criteria of this study (Figure 1). Their median age at last visit was 20 years for girls (N = 25, range 14–24) and 18 years for boys (N = 25, range 14–24). Regular transfusions and chelation therapy were initiated early, at 1.3 years old (range 0.3–4) and 3 years old (range 1–6), respectively. The median duration of DFX chelation before 13 years in girls and 14 years in boys was seven years (range 3–12). All 50 patients were evaluable for pubertal delay, defined as lack of pubertal onset by 13 years in girls and 14 years in boys. All had spontaneous puberty onset, at a median age of 12.5 years in girls (range 10.5–14) and 13.5 years in boys (range 12.5–15). Eight patients (16%) experienced delayed puberty, mostly (7/8) simple pubertal delay, with a delay ranging from 6 to 12 months (Table 2). Among the 7 patients with simple pubertal delay, 5 were boys. Only one patient, suffering from a pubertal delay, presented with primary amenorrhea out of the 24 girls who had either menstruated or who were > 15 years old (4.2%). Median age at first menstruation was 13.5 years (range 12–17). Two girls had their first menstruation delayed, at 16 and 17 years old, both after a simple pubertal delay.

### A 22-month-old girl with 3 weeks of dyspnea [^115JSv3H]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 22-month-old girl presented to the ED with a 3-week history of dyspnea on exertion. A chest radiograph showed a right upper-lobe opacity suspicious for pneumonia (Fig 1A). The patient was prescribed amoxicillin but returned to the ED 7 days later with cough and persistent dyspnea and tachypnea. At that time, a repeat chest radiograph was concerning for worsening pneumonia (Fig 1B). Treatment with azithromycin and albuterol was initiated, and amoxicillin was discontinued. Her symptoms briefly improved; however, she returned to the ED 10 days later because of worsening cough and tachypnea, and a 2-day history of increased irritability, decreased oral intake, decreased urine output, and intermittent perioral cyanosis. She was afebrile throughout this period per parent report and vital sign documentation at each ED visit.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^113YBzT2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Ultraviolet B case — A 51-year-old postmenopausal woman with a 25-year history of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis had 15% BSA involvement and reported excess alcohol intake (12–18 beers each weekend). In this context, narrowband (NB)-UVB is an attractive treatment option; NB-UVB is well tolerated, cost effective, and can be used safely in patients with demyelinating disease, in which the use of TNF-α–inhibiting biologic agents is contraindicated. NB-UVB can be administered in an outpatient setting or in a day hospital, while PUVA photochemotherapy is likely to be more efficacious in darker-skinned individuals or those with very thick lesions because of the better penetration of UVA compared with UVB. NB-UVB has many advantages over PUVA, including a lower long-term photocarcinogenic risk, lack of need for oral medication before each treatment session or photoprotective eyewear between treatments, and safety in pregnancy, though remission duration with NB-UVB is shorter. UV-based therapy often requires 2 to 3 visits per week; after clearance, home NB-UVB phototherapy for maintenance is an attractive alternative. If adequate response is not obtained after approximately 20 to 30 treatments with NB-UVB given 2 to 3 times weekly, PUVA, traditional systemic agents, or biologic agents should be considered, and because of significant alcohol intake, MTX would be contraindicated in this patient.

### Infected ptosis surgery-a rare complication from a multidrug-resistant organism [^11434BMj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

A 7-year-old Chinese boy with no known medical history, presented with history of right eye ptosis since he was 10 months old. He was diagnosed with right-eye congenital ptosis. He had a marginal reflex distance of 1 mm, with levator function of 3 mm in the right eye. The marginal reflex distance of the left eye was 2 mm, with 7 mm levator function. There was absence of upper lid crease on both eyes. He underwent ptosis surgery on the right eye as he developed mild amblyopia in the right eye, with the best-corrected vision of 6/12.

A right eye frontalis sling procedure with modified Fox's pentagon methodwas done using Gore-tex material in Selayang Hospital, Malaysia. There was no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complication. Chloramphenicol ointment was applied 8-hourly to the surgical wound site on the right upper eyelid. The patient was discharged on day 1 postoperation, with plan to review after 1 week. Chloramphenicol ointment was given to the patient till review.

However, he defaulted his follow-up and only came back 1 month after surgery. He had used his medication for only 1 week and had stopped thereafter. At this presentation, he complained of painful swelling (of 7 days duration) of the right upper eyelid. The right upper eyelid swelling was associated with pus discharge from the surgical wound site. The vision in the right eye was not getting worse.

On examination, the patient was generally alert, conscious, and afebrile. His best-corrected visual acuity was 6/12 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye. His right upper eyelid was swollen causing complete ptosis with an area of redness. There was presence of crusted pus at the surgical wound site (Figure 1). The extraocular movements were full on all gazes. The conjunctiva was white with no chemosis. Anterior segment and fundus examination were unremarkable. A diagnosis of right eye preseptal abscess secondary to the infected surgical wound was made.

### Knee pain in adults and adolescents: the initial evaluation | AAFP… [^113sejqK]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

History When evaluating knee pain, key aspects of the patient history include age; location, onset, duration, and quality of pain; mechanical or systemic symptoms; history of swelling; description of any precipitating trauma; and pertinent previous medical or surgical procedures. Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe pain, immediate swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with acute trauma, which suggests fracture, dislocation, or tendon or ligamentous rupture. Referral is also indicated for possible joint infection signs such as fever, swelling, and erythema with limited range of motion. Insidious onset of anterior knee pain in adolescents during rapid growth periods with concomitant overuse suggests Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome.

Prepatellar bursitis causes patella-localized pain and swelling and can occur with isolated blunt trauma, repetitive injury, or infection of the overlying skin.
18. In adolescents, atraumatic or unexplained diffuse knee pain that worsens with activity warrants imaging to assess for osteochondrosis 8; similar pain that persists at rest or that worsens at night should raise suspicion for malignancy.
26. MECHANICAL SYMPTOMS Mechanical symptoms, such as locking, buckling, or catching, suggest internal derangement and possible instability but can also occur in medial plica syndrome 18. A popping sensation at the time of injury may occur in meniscal or ligamentous tears. A knee that is "locked" in flexion and that cannot be extended should be examined for a meniscal tear. 4, 14, 15. SWELLING If the patient has an acute injury, a knee joint effusion strongly suggests internal derangement.

14, 26 Swelling that occurs immediately after injury suggests a ligament rupture, intra-articular fracture, or patellar dislocation; swelling that appears within hours to a few days suggests a meniscal tear. 15, 19 Atraumatic swelling with erythema or palpable warmth implies gout or pseudogout, arthritic flare, or infection. Swelling that is limited to the borders of the patella suggests prepatellar bursitis. 4, 14, 15. 3, 27, 34, 44 The authors thank Ms. Rhonda Allard, who was invaluable during the literature search.

### Corneal laceration caused by river crab [^1114boa1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old boy presented with right eye pain associated with tearing and photophobia of 1-day duration. He gave a history of playing with a river crab when suddenly the crab clamped his fingers. He attempted to fling the crab off, but the crab flew and hit his right eye. Ocular examination revealed a right eye corneal ulcer with clumps of fibrin located beneath the corneal ulcer and 1.6 mm level of hypopyon. At presentation, the Seidel test was negative, with a deep anterior chamber. Culture from the corneal scrapping specimen grew Citrobacter diversus and Proteus vulgaris, and the boy was treated with topical gentamicin and ceftazidime eyedrops. Fibrin clumps beneath the corneal ulcer subsequently dislodged, and revealed a full-thickness corneal laceration wound with a positive Seidel test and shallow anterior chamber. The patient underwent emergency corneal toileting and suturing. Postoperatively, he was treated with oral ciprofloxacin 250 mg 12-hourly for 1 week, topical gentamicin, ceftazidime, and dexamethasone eyedrops for 4 weeks. Right eye vision improved to 6/9 and 6/6 with pinhole at the 2-week follow-up following corneal suture removal.

### Parkes-Weber syndrome in the emergency department [^111JgJgh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 20-year-old woman with no relevant previous medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with 1 day of painful, acute worsening of her chronic left thigh swelling without an identifiable trigger. She denied additional symptoms, trauma, personal and family history of thrombosis or coagulopathy, and tobacco or illicit substance use. A routine workout 2 days prior was unchanged from her usual described intensity. The pain was described as 'tightness', which was relieved by rest and aggravated by movement. The patient reported that her chronic asymmetry was never investigated by previous physicians because it was only slightly wider in girth and non-painful since childhood. Her only prescribed medication was a levonorgestrel intrauterine device, and family history was significant for ulcerative colitis and coronary artery disease.

The physical examination revealed her to be in no acute distress with normal vital signs. Relevant findings included a left thigh, which was roughly double the circumference, but the same length, as the right. Otherwise, both thighs had soft compartments without erythema, crepitus, warmth or tenderness to palpation (figure 1). Her neurovascular function was normal bilaterally, there was no pitting oedema or calf swelling, and no discomfort was noted behind the knee on forced dorsiflexion. Finally, no urine colour changes were noted. All other findings were either normal or not clinically relevant. Notably, capillary malformations in the patient's left thigh had been present since birth but were not noted on the treating physician's examination.

### Grease-gun injury of the orbit: two cases report and literature review [^112Ly9oi]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The grease-guns injury is an uncommon injury to the orbit. We present the twelfth and thirteenth cases of grease-gun injury to the orbit to be reported in the English language literature since 1964. Here we discus and review the presentation, investigation, and treatment of this unusual trauma.

Case Presentation

Case 1 was a 29-year-old man who presented 1 day after a grease-gun injury of the left orbit with severe pain, marked periorbital swelling, and proptosis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed penetration of grease into his left orbit. Following surgical removal, proptosis decreased. The limitation of extraocular movement and loss of visual acuity to finger count was discovered after the initial surgery. Motility gradually returned. Visual acuity recovered after phacoemulsification, capsular tension ring and intraocular lens implantation for traumatic cataract and subluxation. Case 2 was a 6-year-old boy who was referred 2 months after a grease-gun injury for worsening swelling with sinus, necrosis and slight ptosis of the upper left eyelids. This is a case of orbital chronic inflammation from grease-gun injuries masquerading as orbital cellulitis. The imaging findings of CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not typical. Surgical exploration and debridement was inevitable and actually relieved the symptoms.

Conclusions

Grease-gun injuries can damage the orbit in different degrees. Careful history inquiry and taking is important to establish the diagnosis. Imaging examinations using CT or MRI are helpful to determine depth of trauma and foreign bodies in the orbit at diagnosis. We suggest that surgical exploration and debridement is a key step in the management.

### Human babesiosis, yucatán state, Mexico, 2015 [^1176bTCo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Case Reports

All 4 patients were from a small municipality in eastern Yucatán and had disease onset during July 2015. All patients lived in close proximity but in different households. After dengue fever was excluded at the local rural health center, blood samples were sent to the Parasitic and Infectious Diseases Laboratory at the Medicine Faculty of the University Autonomous (Yucatán, Mexico) for rickettsiosis diagnosis. Molecular test and immunofluorescence indirect assay for Rickettsia infection were negative in all samples. Independent from clinical management, we conducted additional testing on stored samples, and on the basis of the common history of risk factors, ticks, and rodent presence, we suspected babesiosis. Deidentified medical record information was limited about history, clinical presentation, and treatment.

Patient 1 was a 13-year-old boy who was seen at the health service center with signs and symptoms that included fever (39°C), myalgia, fatigue, and arthralgia that started 3 days before his clinic visit. His mother indicated he had frequent contact with vegetation because of work in agricultural activities and close contact with dogs, cats, birds, and cows and noted that ticks parasitized domestic animals and rodents surrounding the house.

Patient 2 was a 12-year-old girl who had a history of fever (38°C) during the previous 3 days that was unresponsive to medication, myalgia, fatigue, nonsevere arthralgia, drowsiness, and paleness. On the day of her clinic visit, myalgia was severe. Fever was initially treated at home with medicinal plants and later with paracetamol (500 mg/6 h). She lived with her parents and performed housework that included close contact with dogs and goats.

Patient 3 was a 14-year old male student with 14 days of symptoms that included fever (38°C), myalgia, arthralgia, and headache. Four days after symptom onset, he went to a private clinic and began treatment with amoxicillin and ambroxol but did not recover. On day 14, fever and other symptoms persisted, in addition to weight loss and drowsiness. He mentioned observing ticks feeding on backyard dogs and having close contact with vegetation while gardening at school.

### Synovial sarcoma masquerading as juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^116fvdmL]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

An early adolescent girl presented with chronic deforming monoarthritis. Initially misdiagnosed with skeletal tuberculosis, she received empirical treatment despite the absence of microbiological evidence. Her symptoms were managed intermittently with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but the persistence and progression of her condition over the past 4months raised suspicions of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Her clinical presentation deteriorated, with severe knee arthritis and rapid calf swelling, prompting differential diagnosis including necrotising fasciitis or a ruptured Baker's cyst. Imaging confirmed synovitis with localised necrotising myositis, while persistent pain after fascial release and systemic inflammation without signs of infection indicated a more sinister underlying condition. Histopathological analysis of the biopsied tissue revealed synovial sarcoma, with subsequent PET-CT confirming skeletal and pulmonary metastasis. Despite timely diagnosis, the patient ultimately succumbed to her illness.

### Case report: a 5-year-old with new onset nephrotic syndrome in the setting of COVID-19 infection [^1147gHBf]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Clinical presentation

A 5-year old, previously healthy female was admitted to the hospital in December 2020 with a 2-week history of periorbital swelling, with progressive involvement of abdominal and ankle swelling. Prior to admission, the child had developed isolated left eye swelling which was not associated with any other symptoms or vision changes. A week later, evaluation at her primary care physician (PCP)'s office was notable for 4+ protein on urinalysis. The child was then referred to pediatric nephrology for further evaluation and management. In the renal clinic, on examination she was noted to have moderate abdominal swelling with ascites and pretibial edema. She had further gained 2 kg of weight since her visit to the pediatrician's office 1 week prior. The child's mother denied any recent illnesses such as fevers, chills, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, gross hematuria, or diarrhea, and there were no known sick contacts. There was no known family history of kidney diseases.

### Prospective study of children with cyanotic and pallid breath-holding spells [^111f912x]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

In this investigation, we sought to prospectively document the natural history of severe breath-holding spells (BHS) among children with both cyanotic and pallid BHS who were referred for neurologic consultation.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

A structured interview was undertaken at the time of initial consultation and at subsequent 1-year intervals regarding type of BHS, frequency of spells, associated phenomenon, sequelae, family history, and age at termination of spells.

Results

A total of 95 children (48 boys, 47 girls) with BHS were identified and followed over a 9-year interval. There were no significant differences between genders. Median onset age was between 6 and 12 months old with 15% presenting younger than 6 months. A median frequency of spells was weekly with 30% experiencing 1 or more spells per day. The median age at peak frequency was between 12 and 18 months old with a range extending from 6 months to 4 years of age. Of the patients whose BHS had remitted for > 12 months' time (n = 67), the last spell occurred at a median age of 37 to 42 months. Of those children whose BHS were still occurring, the oldest age at time of latest spell was at 7 years old. Hypoxic convulsions were associated with BHS in ≤ 15% of all participants. A positive family history of BHS was identified in 34% of all families with equal frequency distributed between paternal and maternal sides.

Conclusions

In this study, new data concerning the natural history of BHS have been determined. The information is important for family counseling and identifying intervention strategies, and serves as baseline data to evaluate the efficacy of future treatment approaches.

### Pyogenic spondylitis and paravertebral abscess caused by Salmonella saintpaul in an immunocompetent 13-year-old child: a case report [^111EDjD2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 13-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to our outpatient clinic due to back pain with fever. He had been well until approximately 4 months before admission, when he occasionally had high fever. He started to complain of the lower back pain during 3 months before admission, but he thought it was caused by his daily training of track and field. 4 days before admission, high fever developed. His back pain became so severe 3 days ago that he was seen by his family doctor. His symptoms did not improve in spite of acetaminophen administration.

His past medical history was unremarkable, without any trauma, surgical history, or recurrent bacterial infections. He was a junior high school student, and a track and field athlete. He always trained by himself around the corner of zoo, and had no contact history with animal. The patient had raw poultry eggs which were directly purchased from a neighborhood farm just a few weeks before he started complaining of occasional high fever.

On admission, the patient was conscious complaining of severe lumbar pain which was exacerbated according to any movement, and it was hard for him to walk without support due to the severe pain. On physical examination his vital signs were normal except a body temperature of 38 °C. Neurological examination demonstrated no motor or sensory deficits, and other physical findings were nonspecific, and any gastrointestinal signs were not identified.

Laboratory exams showed a slight increase in white blood cell count (WBC 10,100 /μL; neutrophils 61%, lymphocytes 29%) and elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP 7.27 mg/dL). Initial blood cultures were negative. His immunoglobulin G, A, M level were within normal range. Interferon-γ based release assay (QuantiFERON-TB GOLD) was negative. Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormal findings. The lumbar lateral radiologic findings showed inhomogeneous appearance of the inferior wall of the L4 and anterior wall of the L5 vertebral bodies (Fig. 1). Thoracic and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal high signal of the vertebral bodies of L4–5 in sequences of T2-weighted images and paravertebral low diffusion in sequences of T1-weighted images. The interior of the vertebral canal was intact (Fig. 2).

Case report

A 6-year-old boy suffered from progressive deterioration of vision bilaterally during the previous 2 years. His past ophthalmic history included poor vision since early childhood and motor development delays (holding head up at 6–7 months old, walking at 1.5 years old). The patient was diagnosed with micropenis in the pediatric outpatient clinic. Both of his parents were emmetropic without any visual or systemic medical disorders. No other family history was noted. Whole Exome Sequencing was conducted on the patient and their parents, with chromosomal karyotype analysis being exclusively performed on the patient. No significant abnormalities were observed in the parents' results.

Physical examination revealed tall stature (127 cm) compared to the normal value of 117.4 ± 5.0 for 6-year-old boys in Han. The patient is present with craniofacial dysmorphology characterized by ocular hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, and epicanthic folds. Sparse hair was observed in the occipital region. Cycloplegic refraction revealed Bilateral high myopia and astigmatism (RE: -9.75DS/-3.50DC*177°, LE: -12.50DS/-3.50DC*12°). Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was LogMAR 0.4 (Snellen 20/50) in the right eye and LogMAR 0.54 (Snellen 20/70) in the left, respectively. Anterior segment was unremarkable. Vitreous Liquification and tessellated fundus were noted. The optic disc was surrounded by a ring of chorioretinal atrophy. In addition, multiple thin emanating vessels and posterior staphyloma centered with the optic disc were observed. (Fig. 1).

### A 2-year-old with 4 weeks of daily fever [^113X6UB3]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old female presents for evaluation of 4 weeks of daily fevers. When the fevers began, she had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which quickly resolved. The fevers persisted, however, with a maximum of 40°C. The child's review of symptoms was significant for a 1-kg weight loss over the past month. Ten months before presentation, she had moved from Saudi Arabia with her family. One week before the onset of symptoms, she had visited a petting zoo. During episodes of fever, the patient was ill-appearing and had an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. On examination, she was found to be thin, febrile, tachycardic, and with scattered lymphadenopathy. Results of laboratory tests were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 16,100 cells per uL with a neutrophilic predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 99 mm/h and 27 mg/dL, respectively. A chest radiograph indicated a small amount of fluid in the interlobar fissures. Our expert panel examines her case, offers a definition of fever of unknown origin, and makes diagnostic considerations.

An adolescent boy presented to the clinic with upper chest pain, anterior neck pain and difficulty swallowing 3weeks following a COVID-19 infection. The pain started a few days before while participating in football practice. He reported no significant trauma or specific incidence when the pain began. His vital signs were stable and within normal limits. There was tenderness to palpation in the upper sternal area and low anterior neck. A chest X-ray was performed and was originally read by the primary care physician as unremarkable. This was followed by the official radiology read, which identified a spontaneous pneumomediastinum. A follow-up CT was confirmatory. The physician recommended rest and minimal activity, and the symptoms gradually resolved in 1week. A follow-up 1week after the initial visit revealed complete resolution by radiograph. One week later, a final set of radiographs confirmed sustained resolution of free air in the mediastinum. He was able to gradually return to normal activity.

Case-2

A 6-year-old girl, who had experienced a high-grade fever for two days approximately one week prior to her visit, was referred to our outpatient Clinic due to her left side lower extremity limp. She complained of polyartheralgia in several joints including both knees and wrists with a predominant left lower limb pain in groin region and knee. She was born from a consanguineous marriage from a repeat cesarean section with a birth weight of 2.7 Kg. She had a history of right side hydronephrosis, which had gradually improved. The patient also had a history of limping three years ago, which had led to her hospitalization and aspiration of the right hip joint fluid. She had been unsuccessfully treated for septic arthritis by an orthopedic surgeon. Her mother is a nurse, who had been working in a secondary hospital facility for COVID-19 patients. At the time visit, the patient was thoroughly examined; she did not have fever and her vital signs were within the normal range. She could not bear weight on her lower left limb and had an antalgic gait. During examination, she showed no evidence of muscle involvement, but she had some limitations in the range of movements of her left hip joint and scant tenderness in both wrists. Despite the hip joint involvement, she did not have any compensatory gait pattern, any other limitations such as knee flexion, or any remarkable foot and ankle positioning. Her laboratory evaluation were as followings: WBC: 9.6810 9 /L (Neutrophils = 5.6910 9 /L & Lymphocyte = 10 9 /L), platelet count: 511,000/µL, Hemoglobin: 11.9 g/dl, ESR = 39mm/h and CRP = 12 mg/L. She also tested positive for Coronavirus using PCR analysis. Serological investigation for both IgM and IgG of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a mild increase in IgM level to 1.2 (with a 1.1 cut off) without increasing the IgG level (Table 1). Further hip X-Ray was normal. The hip ultrasound showed evidence of mild joint effusion in both hip joints especially in the anterior part of her left side (Fig. 2). This patient was also diagnosed with post coronavirus reactive arthritis, and successfully treated with Ibuprofen 40 mg/kg/day administered in three doses during the day. She completely recovered and her laboratory and ultrasound findings became normal after 4 days. Her follow up at least for 45 days later did not show any subsequent signs or sequels.

### Methylene blue [^113tphx2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Available vital sign data including blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate were reviewed at baseline and compared to data collected within 2 hours post methylene blue infusion. Prior to treatment with methylene blue, 12 of the 18 (67%) of patients had a respiratory rate exceeding the upper limit of normal (≥ 20 bpm). Of these, 8 of the 12 (67%) experienced a normalization of respiratory rate within 2 hours post methylene blue infusion. There was minimal impact on other vital signs.

At baseline, the most common prespecified signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (reported by ≥ 2 subjects [8.3%] overall) were fatigue (33.3%), dyspnea (29.2%), cyanosis (12.5%), depressed CNS (12.5%), dizziness (8.3%), headache (8.3%), and weakness (8.3%). Following treatment with methylene blue, signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia improved.

The efficacy of methylene blue in the treatment of methemoglobinemia in pediatric patients was assessed in 14 patients in two retrospective case series (2 patients received methylene blue and 12 who received another methylene blue product). The ages ranged from 6 days to 16 years. The efficacy outcomes were consistent across the pediatric and adult populations.

### An unusual case of knee pain [^113cMowv]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis of the patella is a rare disease, which primarily affects the pediatric population. We present a case of hematogenous osteomyelitis of the patella with secondary development of septic arthritis of the knee. There is often a delay in diagnosis, as illustrated by our case report, due to the rarity of the condition and nonspecific presentation. There is usually no history of trauma. Focal tenderness over the patella is the most helpful clinical sign. A small joint effusion may be present which is usually sterile and reactionary due to inflammation of the patella. Treatment of osteomyelitis of the patella is similar to treatment of osteomyelitis in other areas. Function and range of motion of the knee usually returns to normal after completion of treatment. A delay in diagnosis may lead to progression of disease and complications such as septic arthritis of the knee.

### Children and adolescents… [^113sEoqh]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

PATELLAR TENDONITIS On physical examination, the patellar tendon is tender, and the pain is reproduced by resisted knee extension. There is usually no effusion. Radiographs are not indicated. 7 The patient reports vague, poorly localized knee pain, as well as morning stiffness or recurrent effusion. If a loose body is present, mechanical symptoms of locking or catching of the knee joint also may be reported. On physical examination, the patient may demonstrate quadriceps atrophy or tenderness along the involved chondral surface. A mild joint effusion may be present. The patient with iliotibial band tendonitis reports pain at the lateral aspect of the knee joint. The pain is aggravated by activity, particularly running downhill and climbing stairs. On physical examination, tenderness is present at the lateral epicondyle of the femur, approximately 3 cm proximal to the joint line. Soft tissue swelling and crepitus also may be present, but there is no joint effusion.

Radiographs are not indicated. 11 The patient usually reports hearing or feeling a "pop" at the time of the injury, and must cease activity or competition immediately. Swelling of the knee within two hours after the injury indicates rupture of the ligament and consequent hemarthrosis. On physical examination, the patient has a moderate to severe joint effusion that limits range of motion. The anterior drawer test may be positive, but can be negative because of hemarthrosis and guarding by the hamstring muscles. The Lachman test should be positive and is more reliable than the anterior drawer test (see text and. Medial Collateral Ligament Sprain Injury to the medial collateral ligament is fairly common and is usually the result of acute trauma. The patient reports a misstep or collision that places valgus stress on the knee, followed by immediate onset of pain and swelling at the medial aspect of the knee.

11 On physical examination, the patient with medial collateral ligament injury has point tenderness at the medial joint line. Valgus stress testing of the knee flexed to 30 degrees reproduces the pain (see text and. On physical examination, the knee joint is erythematous, warm, tender, and swollen. Even minimal range of motion is exquisitely painful. Arthrocentesis reveals clear or slightly cloudy synovial fluid. Analysis of the fluid yields a WBC count of 2, 000 to 75, 000 per mm.

Results

General data

The TA group was comprised of four boys (36.4%) and seven girls (63.6%). The mean age of disease onset was 9.4 ± 3.9 years (range, 1.4–14 years). One of the eleven was 1.4 and younger than 5 years of age, four were aged 5–10 years, and six were aged over 10 years. Girls showed a later age of onset (11.3 ± 1.7 years) than boys (6.1 ± 4.1 years) (p < 0.05).

The mean time to diagnosis was 40.6 ± 21.6 days (range, 12–90 days), with a mean of 59.6 days for boys and 29.6 days for girls (p < 0.05). None of the patients had a family history of vasculitis.

Clinical features

All 11 children had hypertension (nine at the first clinic visit and two at follow-up). The common manifestations are listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Clinical manifestations

According to the above data, six onset patterns can be summarized. The most common patterns were headache with convulsions and kidney damage, with three patients showing each of these patterns. Table 2 shows the onset pattern, initial presentation, and PVAS/ITAS-2010/ITAS-A scores at the first clinic visit.

### Rehabilitation of avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity following Osgood-Schlatter disease [^115Enfgw]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

A sixteen-year-old boy suffered from sharp pain in the knee during a jump while playing basketball. He had a positive history of Osgood Schlatter disease. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated an avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity Type III according to the classification of Watson-Jones. Rehabilitation after avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity is an important consideration for this relatively uncommon adolescent injury. In such avulsion fractures, landing on the ground with the knee fully extended after a jump is the most likely cause. This case report reviews the rehabilitation program, and selected functional outcome measures after rehabilitation are reported. The patient returned to sporting activity after 12 months.

### Bilateral fungal keratitis with ring infiltrates: a rare scenario [^111e5Ejx]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of pain, redness, discharge and diminution of vision in both eyes over the previous 20 days. There was no history of preceding trauma, contact lens use, any eye drop usage or ocular surgery. Systemic history was not significant. Presenting uncorrected visual acuity in his right eye was counting fingers at 1 m and 20/200 in the left eye, with accurate projection of rays in both eyes. Slit lamp biomicroscopy showed the presence of bilateral diffuse conjunctival congestion, corneal ring infiltrates and epithelial defect with corneal oedema. Potassium hydroxide wet mount showed the presence of septate fungal hyphae. The patient was treated with topical 5% natamycin and 1% voriconazole over a period of 6 weeks. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/600 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye at 6-month follow-up.

Hospitalization (Table 4)

The duration of hospitalization ranged from 4 to 34 days, with a mean of 13.2 ± 5.9 days. The hospitalization periods of the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups were 13.6 ± 6.2 and 12.6 ± 5.1 days, respectively, and the mean duration of viral shedding was 8.5 ± 4.9 and 9.2 ± 5.1 days, respectively. There was no statistical difference in hospitalization duration and nucleic acid negative conversion. The average ages of lung positive and negative groups were 5.7 ± 4.8 years and 7.0 ± 4.2 years, respectively, and the average body temperature was 37.1 ± 1.0 °C and 36.8 ± 0.9 °C, respectively. The average hospital stay was 12.8 ± 6.0 days and 13.1 ± 5.9 days, respectively, with statistical differences in age and body temperature between the lung positive and negative groups. About 48.8% (98/201) of the children with symptoms and pulmonary CT abnormalities were 5.1 ± 4.9 years old. The median duration from the first symptom to laboratory confirmation was 6.3 ± 4.5 days and to CT examination was 4.8 ± 5.1 days, and the time interval between CT manifestation abnormality and nucleic acid examination was 3.2 ± 2.9 days.

A 14-month-old child was brought to the pediatric emergency unit in the morning, after his parents discovered inflammatory lesion on his left thigh. Three hours later, he was admitted to our unit, his vital signs were normal and his physical examination revealed a round swollen lesion of 7–8 cm in diameter with blisters on the surface and an additional inflammatory reaction of his left thigh (Figs. 1 and 2). The parental interview provides the cause. The child was discharged after the lesion was dressed and a follow-up scheduled.

### Long-term remission after first-line single-agent treatment with arsenic trioxide of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia in an 8-year-old boy [^112xotDe]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been proven to be highly effective in adults with newly diagnosed or relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Only very limited data are published on the use of ATO as a single agent for first-line therapy of relapsed APL. The authors present a case of a 8-year-old boy with a bone marrow relapse of APL 7 years after first diagnosis, who achieved durable molecular remission with ATO as single agent: induction therapy for 12 weeks, consolidation for 4 weeks, then 6 cycles of 10 days over a period of 6 months. In total, 140 doses of ATO (0.15 mg/kg/day) were given (21 mg/kg). Consecutive promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α (PML-RARα) RT-PCR analyses were negative with a follow-up of 48 months. Acute or late side effects of arsenic were not observed. At present, the boy is in complete remission 4 years after the diagnosis of the relapse.

### Ischiopubic and odontoid synchondrosis in a boy with progressive pseudorheumatoid chondrodysplasia [^114atgZo]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

The patient, a 14-year-old-boy, was referred to the department of pediatric department for clinical assessment because of short stature, progressive joint enlargement, stiffness, pain, rigid and scoliotic back and a progressive waddling gait. The onset was at the age of 6 years and the initial diagnosis at the department of rheumatology was that of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. However, further investigations revealed no active inflammatory parameters. The patient was born to normal parents who were first-degree relatives. His mother was a 27-year-old-gravida 3, abortus 1, married to a 33-year-old man. Both were healthy, as was an older sister. At birth the patient's length, weight and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) were around the 10 th percentile. His intellectual development was normal.

When seen at 11 years of age, his height was 120 cm (-4SD), his face was slightly dysmorphic with a prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, long philtrum and thin lips. There was a generalised joint stiffness with multiple contractures (figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). All joints were prominent and there was a loss of normal lumbar lordosis. Limitation of neck movements was noticed and it was associated with occasional suboccipital pain (figures 6, 7, 8, 9). There was no history of trauma. Both knees were swollen and felt firm. There was limited flexion and extension of the knees, the wrists and the elbows. Neurological examination was normal as were vision, hearing and mental development. All the routine biochemical tests including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatic factors, and antinuclear antibodies were negative.

### Concurrent perforated Meckel's diverticulum and intestinal malrotation in an 8-year-old boy [^116YQng9]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with a history of recurrent abdominal pain presented with a 12 h history of severe periumbilical pain, nausea and vomiting. On examination, he was found to have a tender, erythematous, paraumbilical mass. At operative exploration, an abscess cavity was identified and followed to reveal a gangrenous Meckel's diverticulum, perforated at its tip to create the abscess. Around this Meckel's diverticulum, the small bowel had torted to produce a significant small bowel volvulus on a shortened mesentery. The caecum and ascending colon were found to be in the left upper quadrant and an intraoperative diagnosis of malrotation was made. Following resection of the Meckel's diverticulum and surgical correction of the malrotation, the child made an excellent recovery. His abdominal pain has not recurred in 6 months of follow-up since the operation.

### A young child with a history of wheeze [^115rF5bp]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Case study
The parents of a 3 year old boy have come to see their family doctor about their son whose recurrent episodes of wheeze and respiratory symptoms are causing concern. They are frustrated that no-one seems able to give them a clear diagnosis, and worried because the treatment they have been given is not controlling his symptoms. They would like a referral to a specialist to see if they can get some answers.
Looking back through the records, the first episode of wheeze was at the age of 6 months. This was diagnosed as bronchiolitis and resulted in a brief admission. He had one further admission the following winter that was labelled as 'viral associated wheeze', and two subsequent attendances at the emergency department, on the last occasion being told that he had 'asthma'. In addition there are six primary care consultations for 'wheeze' or 'chest infections'. These episodes have been variously treated with bronchodilators, steroids (inhaled and oral) and/or antibiotics — none of which have had any convincing effect.

He was a normal full term delivery and thrived well from birth. Mother had hay fever as a teenager, and father smokes (though 'never in the house')

A clinical case, such as this 3-year old boy with recurrent wheeze, raises many questions that need to be explored in order to address parental concerns and manage the child's condition. The boy is thriving, height and weight just above the 50th centile.
