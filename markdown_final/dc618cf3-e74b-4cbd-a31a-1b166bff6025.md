## Question

How long is Keflex dose for local soft tissue infection on face

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of Keflex (cephalexin) for a local, uncomplicated soft tissue infection on the face, likely nonpurulent cellulitis or erysipelas, and whether shorter courses are acceptable with clinical improvement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely pathogens and whether MRSA coverage is necessary. Then, I should verify guideline-based duration recommendations. Next, I will check FDA labeling and common dosing regimens. After that, I will review contemporary evidence for shorter courses and consider whether facial location changes management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, response-guided recommendation and key caveats [^112cLfcS].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and pathogens. For nonpurulent cellulitis of the face, the predominant organisms are beta-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and routine empiric MRSA coverage is not recommended unless there is purulence or specific risk factors, which supports using a beta-lactam like cephalexin as first-line therapy [^116PoWQe].

> I should verify that cephalexin covers the likely organisms and is labeled for this use. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin with reliable activity against streptococci and MSSA and is FDA-labeled for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, so it is an appropriate choice for uncomplicated nonpurulent facial cellulitis [^116sX1X2].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled dosing and duration, because I recall multiple SPL entries. FDA SPLs list several acceptable oral regimens for SSTI with a consistent duration band: 250 mg four times daily for 7–14 days, 500 mg four times daily for 7–14 days, and 500 mg twice daily for 7–14 days, so although the dose frequency varies across entries, the labeled duration consistently spans 7–14 days [^112aLdjy] [^1168v5nK] [^112eXHDZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about duration just from labeling; I should confirm what IDSA says about course length. The 2014 IDSA SSTI guideline recommends treating cellulitis for at least 5 days and extending if there is inadequate improvement, and in other sections indicates that 7–14 days are used in most bacterial SSTIs, while the 2011 MRSA-related guidance suggested 5–10 days individualized to response, so the guideline signal is to use response-guided durations with a 5-day minimum and extension as needed [^116PoWQe] [^114ge6ZK] [^114Z8V8r].

> I need to check whether more recent consensus endorses shorter courses when patients improve promptly. The American College of Physicians advises a 5–6 day course of an agent active against streptococci for nonpurulent cellulitis in patients who can self-monitor and have close follow-up, and contemporary systematic reviews show short courses can be noninferior to longer courses in SSTIs when diagnosis is sound, the antibiotic is appropriate, and patients are clinically improving [^111gsSaf] [^116rgAo8].

> But wait, what if the facial location changes the plan. Let me consider this carefully. For uncomplicated facial cellulitis without orbital involvement, necrosis, bites, or immunocompromise, guidelines do not specify a longer duration solely due to facial location, so treatment principles mirror other nonpurulent SSTIs with duration individualized to clinical response and close reassessment for early complications given the anatomic region [^116PoWQe].

> I should double-check adherence and dosing practicality, because that can influence outcomes even with the same total daily dose. Both BID and QID cephalexin regimens appear in the SPLs for SSTIs, and using BID may aid adherence when clinically appropriate, but dosing must be adjusted for renal impairment to avoid accumulation, with specific maximum doses and extended intervals at low creatinine clearance, while duration remains guided by response [^112eXHDZ] [^1168v5nK] [^113bcM3J] [^116GDChX] [^115wfJ2B].

> Let me first confirm whether adding MRSA coverage improves outcomes in nonpurulent cellulitis, because that could change duration considerations if therapy is broadened. Randomized trials show that adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin does not improve cure in uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, supporting beta-lactam monotherapy targeting streptococci as sufficient in typical cases, reserving anti-MRSA agents for purulent infections or defined risk factors [^1112uFJm] [^1148wif9] [^116PoWQe].

> Synthesizing all of this, my recommendation is as follows: for a local, uncomplicated nonpurulent facial soft tissue infection treated with cephalexin, a response-guided course with a typical target of 7–10 days is reasonable, acknowledging the FDA-labeled range of 7–14 days, but if there is clear clinical improvement within the first 48–72 hours, a shorter 5–7 day course is appropriate with reliable follow-up, and extend toward 10–14 days if improvement is slow or if severity, comorbidities, or complications warrant it [^112eXHDZ] [^1168v5nK] [^112aLdjy] [^116PoWQe] [^111gsSaf] [^116rgAo8].

---

For a local soft tissue infection on the face, the recommended duration of Keflex (cephalexin) is **5–7 days** [^111gsSaf] [^116rgAo8] for uncomplicated, non-purulent infections, with extension to 10–14 days [^112eXHDZ] [^114ge6ZK] if the infection is severe, purulent, or slow to respond. Therapy should **continue until clear clinical improvement** [^116PoWQe], and be extended if there is delayed response, immunosuppression, or complications. If MRSA is suspected [^114Z8V8r] or the patient does not improve, **add or switch to an agent with MRSA activity** [^113KrirW].

---

## Recommended duration of keflex therapy

| **Severity of infection** | **Recommended duration** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated, non-purulent | 5–7 days | Shorter courses (5–6 days) [^111gsSaf] are effective [^116rgAo8] for non-purulent cellulitis with close follow-up |
| Severe, purulent, or slow response | 10–14 days [^112eXHDZ] | Extend if slow response, immunosuppression, or complications [^116PoWQe] [^114Z8V8r] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and evidence

- **IDSA 2014 guidelines**: Recommend at least 5 days [^116PoWQe], extending if no improvement [^114ge6ZK].
- **ACP 2021 guidelines**: Recommend 5–6 days [^111gsSaf] for non-purulent cellulitis with close follow-up [^114ch8sU].
- **FDA labeling**: Recommends 7–14 days for skin and soft tissue infections [^112eXHDZ] [^1168v5nK].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

- **Severity of infection**: Severe or complicated infections require longer courses [^114ge6ZK].
- **Clinical response**: Extend [^116PoWQe] if slow or incomplete response [^114Z8V8r].
- **Patient comorbidities**: Immunosuppression or chronic illness may require longer therapy [^116BbNeu].
- **Presence of abscess**: Incision and drainage plus antibiotics may be needed [^111VtADd] [^111tWNDR].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Clinical response should be assessed within 48–72 hours. During this window, **improvement** should prompt continuation and completion of the course, whereas **no improvement** warrants reassessment, consideration of MRSA [^114Z8V8r], and adjustment of therapy.

---

## Risks of prolonged or inadequate therapy

Prolonged therapy increases **adverse effects, resistance, and costs** [^114ch8sU], whereas inadequate therapy increases the risk of **recurrence, complications, and resistance** [^116rgAo8].

---

## Alternative antibiotics

- **Clindamycin**: Covers MRSA and streptococci [^112cLfcS].
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: Effective for MRSA [^116zAVhn].
- **Doxycycline**: Effective for MRSA [^1125JJvB].
- **Linezolid**: For severe MRSA infections [^114Z8V8r].

---

The recommended duration of Keflex therapy for local soft tissue infections on the face is **5–7 days** [^111gsSaf] for uncomplicated infections, and 10–14 days [^112eXHDZ] for severe or complicated infections. Therapy should be individualized [^116PoWQe] based on severity, response, and comorbidities, with close follow-up and adjustment as needed.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: What do we know and where do we go from here [^116rgAo8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). High credibility.

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed more than 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in seven common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis, and sinusitis.

- **Sources**: Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

- **Content**: Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, six weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

- **Implications**: With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials.

### Randomized controlled trial of cephalexin versus clindamycin for uncomplicated pediatric skin infections [^113gEFYz]. Pediatrics (2011). High credibility.

To compare clindamycin and cephalexin for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused predominantly by community-associated (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a study was conducted. We hypothesized that clindamycin would be superior to cephalexin (an antibiotic without MRSA activity) for treating these infections.

Patients aged 6 months to 18 years with uncomplicated SSTIs not requiring hospitalization were enrolled from September 2006 through May 2009. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either cephalexin or clindamycin for 7 days. Primary and secondary outcomes were clinical improvement at 48 to 72 hours and resolution at 7 days, respectively. Cultures were obtained and tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin status.

Of the 200 patients enrolled, 69% had MRSA cultured from their wounds. Most MRSA strains were USA300 or subtypes, positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and susceptible to clindamycin, consistent with CA-MRSA. Spontaneous drainage or a drainage procedure was conducted in 97% of subjects. By 48 to 72 hours, 94% of subjects in the cephalexin group and 97% in the clindamycin group showed improvement (P = .50). By 7 days, all subjects showed improvement, with complete resolution in 97% of the cephalexin group and 94% of the clindamycin group (P = .33). Fevers and age less than 1 year, but not initial erythema larger than 5 cm, were associated with early treatment failures, regardless of the antibiotic used.

There is no significant difference between cephalexin and clindamycin for treating uncomplicated pediatric SSTIs caused by CA-MRSA.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

The importance of this study lies in the increase of emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States, coinciding with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis cases without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. There is an ongoing debate on whether antimicrobial regimens with in vitro MRSA activity offer improved outcomes compared to treatments without MRSA activity.

The objective was to determine whether a combination of cephalexin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate for uncomplicated cellulitis compared to cephalexin alone.

This study was designed as a multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial conducted across five US emergency departments. The participants included were outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis, without a wound, purulent drainage, or abscess. Enrollment took place from April 2009 through June 2012, with soft tissue ultrasonography performed at enrollment to rule out abscesses. The final follow-up was completed in August 2012.

- **Interventions**: Participants either received cephalexin, 500 mg four times daily, combined with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily for seven days (n = 248 participants), or cephalexin plus placebo for seven days (n = 248 participants).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome, determined a priori in the per-protocol group, was clinical cure. Clinical cure was defined by the absence of specific clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits, including fever; a greater than 25% increase in erythema, swelling, or tenderness by days 3–4; lack of a decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness by days 8–10; and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness by days 14–21.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs, ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. Additionally, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections — are they applicable today [^117Hg2MC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are significant causes of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial, caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains.

Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must consider the presence of resistant pathogens. It depends on administering appropriate antimicrobial therapy — the correct spectrum, route, and dose — in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration, and the timely implementation of source control measures. Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available to guide the management of these infections. However, the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens complicates the antibiotic selection process.

Several pathogens of concern include:

- **Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus**: Responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs.
- **Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria**: Includes CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains.
- **Multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis**: A particular concern in the management of these infections.

New empirical regimens that take advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options may be needed for treating certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^115ogxyS]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

For the medical management of Vibrio vulnificus infection, particularly regarding cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend administering doxycycline at 100 mg either orally or intravenously twice daily for 7–14 days. Additionally, a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftazidime 1–2 g IV/IM every 8 hours, is advised as the first-line therapy for patients with Vibrio vulnificus wound infections. It is important to recognize that a single-agent regimen using a fluoroquinolone — such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or gatifloxacin — has been reported to be at least as effective as a regimen combining doxycycline and a cephalosporin in animal studies.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^1162smbQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections**: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures, such as incision and drainage or debridement, were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin-treated patients and 14% of the comparator-treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

- **Complicated skin and skin structure infections**: Two randomized, active-controlled trials of cSSSI were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label international study compared moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 21 days to sequential intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the moxifloxacin-treated and 53% of the comparator-treated patients.

### Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections [^1145FNnq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial etiologies of skin and soft-tissue infections, with virulence ranging from very mild to limb- or life-threatening. Antibiotic coverage recommendations vary and are subject to controversy. Antibiotic resistance patterns are evolving with many different biochemical mechanisms. Rapid bacterial identification using mass spectrometry is on the horizon. Therapeutic considerations should include cost and adherence issues.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^1125JJvB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent.

Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for the treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections, and dicloxacillin and cephalexin are recommended for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly for suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams.

Options for the treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

### Bactroban [^114YSTE2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

The efficacy of topical Bactroban cream for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions (e.g. lacerations, sutured wounds, and abrasions not more than 10 cm in length or 100 cm² in total area) was compared to that of oral cephalexin in two randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trials. Clinical efficacy rates at follow-up in the per protocol populations (including adults and pediatric patients) were 96.1% for Bactroban cream (n = 231) and 93.1% for oral cephalexin (n = 219). Pathogen eradication rates at follow-up in the per protocol populations were 100% for both Bactroban cream and oral cephalexin.

- **Pediatrics**: There were 93 pediatric patients aged 2 weeks to 16 years enrolled per protocol in the secondarily infected skin lesion studies, although only 3 were less than 2 years of age in the population treated with Bactroban cream. Patients were randomized to either 10 days of topical Bactroban cream 3 times daily or 10 days of oral cephalexin (250 mg 4 times daily for patients > 40 kg or 25 mg/kg/day oral suspension in 4 divided doses for patients ≤ 40 kg). Clinical efficacy at follow-up (7 to 12 days post-therapy) in the per protocol populations was 97.7% (43/44) for Bactroban cream and 93.9% (46/49) for cephalexin. Only 1 adverse event (headache) was thought to be possibly or probably related to drug therapy with Bactroban cream in the intent-to-treat pediatric population of 70 children (1.4%).

### Testing for methicillin-resistant in the anterior nares for antibiotic de-escalation in patients presenting with acute skin and soft tissue infections: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uka5j]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Low credibility.

This review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024524640). Six databases (PubMed, MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from the date of first entry through January 1, 2025. Title, abstract, and keywords were searched for terms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (or MRSA), skin (or cutaneous or derm*), skin and soft tissue infection (or SSTI or pyoderma or skin infection), and nasal (or nose or nares). The exact searches are described in the supplementary table.

The search was restricted to English language articles with human participants, and there were no publication date restrictions. Published and peer-reviewed studies, including observational or randomized controlled trials, were included. To avoid undefined estimates of the screening test, case reports and case series were excluded. Review articles, conference abstracts, and grey literature were also excluded.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if: (1) they included data on the MRSA nasal carriage status of at least 15 people presenting with acute SSTIs; (2) samples of the nares and the SSTIs were obtained within 72 hours of each other; and (3) the reports included enough information to form a 2×2 contingency table. To ensure the meta-analysis results were representative of a random patient presenting with an acute SSTI and, thus more generalizable, we excluded studies if the inclusion criteria required participants to have a particular comorbid disease/illness.

### Treatment of bacterial skin infections in ED observation units: Factors influencing prescribing practice [^114jJpxo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015).

The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) publishes evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. How closely physicians follow these guidelines is unknown, particularly in the emergency department observation unit (EDOU), where increasing numbers of patients are treated for these infections. Our objectives were to describe: (1) the antibiotic treatment patterns for EDOU patients, (2) physicians' adherence to the IDSA guidelines, and (3) factors that influence physicians' prescribing practices.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort enrolled adult patients discharged from an EDOU at an academic medical center after treatment for a skin or soft tissue infection. Information was collected from chart reviews and patient interviews pertaining to the patients' sociodemographic characteristics, presenting illnesses, and antibiotic treatment regimens. Treatment regimens were compared with national guidelines.

- **Results**: The study included 193 patients, of which only 43% were treated according to IDSA guidelines, 42% were overtreated, and 15% were undertreated. Women were more likely to be undertreated (relative risk, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.06), whereas patients aged 50 years and older were at risk for overtreatment (relative risk, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.02). Women also received shorter courses of antibiotic therapy, with an average of 9.6 days of treatment compared with 10.6 days for men.

- **Conclusions**: Physician antibiotic prescribing practices demonstrated poor adherence to IDSA guidelines and were influenced by patient demographics.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116XRX5P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

For empirical coverage of CA-MRSA in outpatients with SSTI, oral antibiotic options include clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline), and linezolid. If coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and CA-MRSA is required, options include clindamycin alone or TMP-SMX or a tetracycline in combination with a β-lactam (e.g. amoxicillin) or linezolid alone.

For hospitalized patients with severe SSTI, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics, empirical therapy for MRSA should be considered pending culture data. Options include intravenous (IV) vancomycin, either PO or IV linezolid 600 mg twice daily, daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily, clindamycin 600 mg IV or PO three times a day, and tigecycline 100 mg IV loading dose, then 50 mg twice daily.

Glycopeptides have long been the microbiological agents of choice for challenging Gram-positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although increasing minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics. Increased resistance to glycopeptides has driven the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, especially for severe soft tissue infections where aggressive antimicrobial management is recommended. These new agents include linezolid, tigecycline, and daptomycin.

Linezolid is considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). It offers the advantage of an early intravenous-to-oral switch, with the oral preparation having v

### Optimizing antibiotic treatment of skin infections in pediatric emergency and urgent care centers [^113JVLPg]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The objective was to optimize antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) discharged from pediatric emergency departments (EDs) and urgent cares (UCs).

Pediatric patients aged 0 to 18 years discharged from 3 pediatric EDs and 8 UCs with a diagnosis of uncomplicated SSTIs were included. Optimal treatment was defined as 5 days of cephalexin for nonpurulent SSTIs and 7 days of clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for purulent SSTIs. Exclusion criteria included erysipelas, folliculitis, felon, impetigo, lymphangitis, paronychia, perianal abscess, phlegmon, preseptal or orbital cellulitis, and cephalosporin allergy. Baseline data were collected from January 2018 to June 2019. Quality improvement (QI) interventions began in July 2019 with a revised SSTI guideline, discharge order set, and maintenance of certification (MOC) QI project. MOC participants received three educational sessions, monthly group feedback, and individual scorecards. Balancing measures included return visits within 10 days requiring escalation of care. Data were monitored through March 2021.

In total, 9306 SSTIs were included. The MOC QI project included 50 ED and UC physicians (27% of eligible physicians). For purulent SSTI, optimal antibiotic choice and duration increased from a baseline median of 28% to 64%. For nonpurulent SSTI, optimal antibiotic choice and duration increased from a median of 2% to 43%. MOC participants had greater improvement than non-MOC providers (P < .010). Return visits did not significantly change pre- to…

### Cefuroxime sodium [^115Uif9r]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The usual adult dosage range for cefuroxime for injection is 750 mg to 1.5 grams every 8 hours, usually for 5 to 10 days. In uncomplicated urinary tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, disseminated gonococcal infections, and uncomplicated pneumonia, a 750-mg dose every 8 hours is recommended. In severe or complicated infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended.

In bone and joint infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended. In clinical trials, surgical intervention was performed when indicated as an adjunct to therapy with cefuroxime for injection. A course of oral antibiotics was administered when appropriate following the completion of parenteral administration of cefuroxime for injection.

In life-threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, 1.5 grams every 6 hours may be required. In bacterial meningitis, the dosage should not exceed 3 grams every 8 hours. The recommended dosage for uncomplicated gonococcal infection is 1.5 grams given intramuscularly as a single dose at 2 different sites together with 1 gram of oral probenecid.

For preventive use for clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated surgical procedures, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously just before surgery (approximately one-half to 1 hour before the initial incision) is recommended. Thereafter, give 750 mg intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 hours when the procedure is prolonged.

For preventive use during open heart surgery, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia and every 12 hours is recommended.

### Empiric outpatient therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, or clindamycin for cellulitis [^114ha5U7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Limited data exist on optimal empiric oral antibiotic treatment for outpatients with cellulitis in areas with a high prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 3-year retrospective cohort study of outpatients with cellulitis empirically treated at a teaching clinic of a tertiary-care medical center in Hawaii. Patients who received more than one oral antibiotic, were hospitalized, or had no follow-up information were excluded. Treatment success rates for empiric therapy were compared among commonly prescribed antibiotics in our clinic: cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin. Risk factors for treatment failure were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: Of 544 patients with cellulitis, 405 met the inclusion criteria. The overall treatment success rate of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher than the rate of cephalexin (91% vs. 74%; p < 0.001), whereas clindamycin success rates were higher than those of cephalexin in patients who had subsequently culture-confirmed MRSA infections (P = .01), had moderately severe cellulitis (P = .03), and were obese (P = .04). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was recovered in 72 of 117 positive culture specimens (62%). Compliance and adverse drug reaction rates were not significantly different among patients who received these three antibiotics. Factors associated with treatment failure included therapy with an antibiotic that was not active against community-associated MRSA (adjusted odds ratio 4.22; 95% confidence interval).

### Clinical trial: Comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: A randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except for purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are commonly and increasingly prescribed for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to a lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

- **Methods**: We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for less than one week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization [clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130]. All participants received cephalexin and were additionally randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for at least one week, stopping three days after they felt the infection was cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at two weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at one month.

- **Results**: We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. The median age was 29, ranging from 3 to 74 years. Of the intervention participants, 62 out of 73 (85%) were cured versus 60 out of 73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence).

In patients with beta-lactam allergy, the recommended regimen includes ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours plus metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours. First-generation cephalosporins, such as cephalexin, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, macrolides such as erythromycin, and clindamycin, all exhibit poor in vitro activity against Pasteurella multocida and should be avoided, especially in cases of animal bites.

- **In patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first-line therapy**: Consider adding one of the following oral antibiotics:
	- Minocycline 100 mg every 12 hours
	- Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800–320/1600 mg every 12 hours
	- Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours

### Treatment of MRSA soft tissue infections: an overview [^111mRWsg]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming increasingly common worldwide. With the emergence of new highly spreadable strains, known as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), novel presentations of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are being observed. Recurrent SSTI, including folliculitis, furunculosis, and abscesses, account for an increasing proportion of SSTI seen in the emergency department.

Empirical antimicrobial management choices can be difficult, but clues to the nature of the MRSA may be gleaned from the patient's history and clinical presentation. More severe SSTI, such as necrotizing fasciitis and purpura fulminans, are emerging and warrant the broadest possible empirical Gram-positive coverage. Ideally, this includes antimicrobials that inhibit exotoxin production and, in some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin to neutralize exotoxins that have already been produced.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112cLfcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs, ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care: Cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^114ch8sU]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Evidence about the contribution of excessive treatment duration to antibiotic overuse in primary care is limited. A recent study from the US showed that more than two-thirds of antibiotic courses for acute sinusitis in adults were 10 days or longer, whereas the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends treatment of uncomplicated cases for five to seven days. A small study from the Manitoba region in Canada, which focused on urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, skin or soft tissue infections, and pneumonia, estimated that 15% of prescriptions with the appropriate antibiotic were for treatments longer than guideline-based recommendations.

An up-to-date picture of prescribed antibiotic durations for common infections in English primary care is lacking. Such an overview is especially relevant given the increasing evidence from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses that shorter antibiotic courses clear infection comparable to longer courses while minimising selection, proliferation, and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the likelihood of side effects from antibiotic use.

We therefore assessed the extent to which durations of antibiotic courses prescribed for common infections in English primary care are in line with relevant guidelines. If substantial proportions of antibiotic prescriptions are longer than recommended, this would indicate that there is potential to safely reduce total antibiotic use simply by better application of guidelines in clinical practice.

### Multiple crusted plaques on lower portion of the legs and abdomen [^115ZzASM]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the treatment of choice for this patient?

	- **A. Doxycycline**: Correct. Rickettsialpox tends to be mild and self-limiting; however, doxycycline may decrease the recovery time to a few days and is considered the treatment of choice, even for children and pregnant patients. This patient's condition resolved after taking doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10 days.

	- **B. Cephalexin**: Incorrect. First-generation cephalosporins work well against gram-positive bacteria; however, R. akari is a gram-negative bacterium and this is not the preferred treatment.

	- **C. Prednisone**: Incorrect. Prednisone alone would likely not benefit the patient in her recovery. Antibiotics such as doxycycline are the first-line treatment for rickettsialpox.

	- **D. Chloramphenicol**: Incorrect. Although chloramphenicol is an acceptable alternative antibiotic for rickettsialpox, it is not typically used due to its significant side effect profile.

	- **E. Streptomycin**: Incorrect. This medication is typically associated with the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a moderate-to-severe infection. Rickettsialpox is a milder infection.

- **Question 3**: What is the key diagnostic indicator in this patient's history and laboratory workup?

The purpose of our study was to determine if cephalexin 500mg, taken orally four times daily, was non-inferior to cefazolin 2g administered intravenously daily plus probenecid 1g taken orally daily in the management of patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) presenting to the emergency department (ED).

This was a prospective, multicentre, double dummy-blind, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial conducted at two tertiary care teaching hospitals in Canada. Patients were enrolled if they presented to the ED with an uncomplicated SSTI and were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to receive either oral cephalexin or intravenous cefazolin plus oral probenecid for up to 7 days. The primary outcome was the failure of therapy at 72 hours. Clinical cure at 7 days, transition from intravenous to oral medication, admission to the hospital, and adverse events were also evaluated.

A total of 206 patients were randomised, with 104 patients in the cephalexin group and 102 in the cefazolin and probenecid group. The proportion of patients failing therapy at 72 hours was similar between the treatment groups (4.2% and 6.1%, risk difference 1.9%, 95% CI -3.7% to 7.6%). Clinical cure at 7 days was not significantly different (100% and 97.7%, risk difference -2.3%, 95% CI -6.7% to 0.8%).

In conclusion, cephalexin at appropriate doses appears to be a safe and effective alternative to outpatient parenteral cefazolin in the treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate SSTIs for patients who present to the ED.

### Avelox [^1139i3YU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

- **Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections**: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of Avelox 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures, such as incision and drainage or debridement, were performed on 17% of the Avelox-treated patients and 14% of the comparator-treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for Avelox and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

- **Complicated skin and skin structure infections**: Two randomized, active-controlled trials of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential IV/PO Avelox 400 mg QD for 7–14 days to an IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label international study compared Avelox 400 mg QD for 7–21 days to a sequential IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in treating patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of whom were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement were performed on 55% of the Avelox-treated and 53% of the comparator-treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication.

### Advances in the medical management of skin and soft tissue infections [^115csuj1]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are some of the most common infectious disease diagnoses in both inpatient and outpatient settings. With bacterial resistance to antimicrobials growing, decision-making on empiric antibiotics is becoming increasingly difficult. Additionally, the most recent guidance from a professional society on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections was published in 2014 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and is now two years old. New antimicrobial agents have been developed and approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections since then, and more are in the pipeline. This review summarizes the evidence on treatments that are new or in development and the potential repurposing of old antimicrobials. The clinical utility of these treatments is also discussed.

### Avoidable antibiotic exposure for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in the ambulatory care setting [^1137MrAc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent indications for outpatient antibiotics. A detailed understanding of prescribing practices is necessary to optimize antibiotic use for these conditions.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adults treated in the ambulatory care setting for uncomplicated cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess between March 1, 2010, and February 28, 2011. We assessed the frequency of avoidable antibiotic exposure, defined as the use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity, combination antibiotic therapy, or treatment for 10 or more days. Total antibiotic-days prescribed for the cohort were compared with antibiotic-days in four hypothetical short-course (5–7 days), single-antibiotic treatment models consistent with national guidelines.

- **Results**: A total of 364 cases were included for analysis (155 cellulitis, 41 wound infection, and 168 abscess). Antibiotics active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were prescribed in 61% of cases of cellulitis. Of 139 cases of abscess where drainage was performed, antibiotics were prescribed in 80% for a median of 10 (interquartile range, 7–10) days. Of 292 total cases where complete prescribing data were available, avoidable antibiotic exposure occurred in 46%. This included use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity in 4%, combination therapy in 12%, and treatment for 10 or more days in 42%. Use of the short-course, single-antibiotic treatment strategies would have reduced prescribed antibiotic-days.

### WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-e/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^112yqtNg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Empiric antibiotic regimens are recommended for patients with normal renal function. The target pathogens include S. aureus and streptococci. One of the following oral antibiotics may be used: amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g every 8 h or cephalexin 500 mg every 6 h. In patients at risk for CA-MRSA, such as those with immunocompromised status, previous personal or household contact with MRSA infection or colonization in the past 12 months, prior antibiotic use for 5 days during the last 90 days, or who do not respond to first-line therapy, one of the following oral antibiotics should be added: minocycline 100 mg every 12 h, doxycycline 100 mg every 12 h, or trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg every 12 h.

For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, clindamycin 300 mg every 8 h is recommended.

In cases of recurring skin abscess, it is crucial to identify and correct any local factors and check for the presence of foreign materials that may contribute to the infection. Bacterial culture testing is necessary to determine the causative bacteria and assess antibiotic susceptibility to guide targeted therapy.

If an abscess is treated with prolonged antibiotics without drainage, sterile pus surrounded by thick fibrous tissue may form, resulting in a hard lump that can sometimes mimic malignancy. The preferred treatment in such cases is surgical drainage with excision of the fibrous wall.

### Mupirocin [^112fspZ2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The clinical studies examined the efficacy of topical mupirocin cream in treating secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions. These lesions included lacerations, sutured wounds, and abrasions not exceeding 10 cm in length or 100 cm² in total area. The study compared mupirocin cream with oral cephalexin across two randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trials. The clinical efficacy rates at follow-up in the per-protocol populations, which included both adults and pediatric subjects, were 96.1% for mupirocin cream (n = 231) and 93.1% for oral cephalexin (n = 219). Pathogen eradication rates at follow-up were 100% for both treatments.

- **Pediatrics**:
	- There were 93 pediatric subjects aged 2 weeks to 16 years enrolled per protocol in the trials for secondarily infected skin lesions. Of these, only 3 were younger than 2 years of age in the population treated with mupirocin cream. Subjects were randomized to receive either 10 days of topical mupirocin cream, applied 3 times daily, or 10 days of oral cephalexin. The oral cephalexin dosage was 250 mg 4 times daily for subjects weighing more than 40 kg, or an oral suspension of 25 mg per kg per day, divided into 4 doses, for subjects weighing 40 kg or less. Clinical efficacy at follow-up, 7 to 12 days post-therapy, was 97.7% (43 of 44) for mupirocin cream and 93.9% (46 of 49) for cephalexin.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration for uncomplicated bloodstream infections in critically ill children: a multicentre observational study [^111oUkve]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The three most common organisms causing infections were Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Enterococcus species (12%), and Klebsiella species (10%). The violin plots in Fig. 2 compare the distribution of treatment durations according to pathogen groups. Across pathogens, the median (IQR) treatment durations were generally similar, with the exception of infections caused by other staphylococci (including coagulase-negative staphylococci), which were treated for a shorter duration (median 11 days, IQR 7–13) compared to the other pathogens. Infections caused by Candida species were treated for a median duration of 30 days (IQR 17–34).

- **Treatment durations according to pathogens**: Boxplots indicating the median, IQR, and the upper and lower adjacent values are overlaid within each violin plot. In some cases, more than one treatment duration peak is evident in the violin plots, reflecting the multimodal nature of treatment durations used to treat the same pathogen or pathogen group(s). The amplitude of the peaks relative to each other expresses the density of observations seen along the spectrum of treatment durations plotted.

- **Infection characteristics and treatment duration**:
	- IQR: Interquartile range
	- CONS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci
	- a: Wilcoxon rank sum
	- b: Kruskal-Wallis test
	- c: Other sources include three retropharyngeal abscesses, one possibly related to cardiac surgery, one endovasculitis, and one unspecified.

In violin plots illustrating the distributions of treatment duration according to underlying sources, it is evident that different treatment durations were applied based on the specific pathogen and its characteristics.
