Fecal matter transplant

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and why FMT is mechanistically plausible. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of efficacy data across randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine safety signals and evolving risk landscapes. After that, I need to check guideline positions and indications, including special populations. I will then review delivery methods, predictors of failure, and the regulatory shift toward defined products. Finally, I should integrate practical clinical recommendations and acknowledge uncertainties and future directions, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and pathophysiology. Recurrent CDI is common, with recurrence rates around 20–30% after an initial episode and rising to 40–60% after a first recurrence, driven by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis that undermines colonization resistance and perpetuates relapse cycles; this dysbiosis paradigm is precisely why microbiome restoration with FMT is mechanistically compelling [^113BHu4j] [^116tfVif] [^114kKMFz].

> I need to verify the core efficacy signal from randomized trials. The pivotal RCT by Cammarota et al. showed donor FMT via colonoscopy achieved 90.9% cure versus 62.5% with autologous stool, and earlier RCTs demonstrated marked superiority of FMT to vancomycin alone, aligning with the broader RCT literature showing roughly 80–90% efficacy in immunocompetent adults with rCDI; pooled analyses corroborate a substantial benefit over antibiotics with an NNT near 2–3, which is clinically meaningful [^114vxJXQ] [^113BHu4j] [^112Et6kv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniformity across delivery routes. Meta-analyses suggest lower GI delivery, particularly colonoscopy, may outperform upper GI routes, and repeat FMT meaningfully increases week-8 response compared with single treatment; however, I should double-check capsule data because some contemporary capsule trials have been neutral, indicating route and product heterogeneity can influence outcomes and that patient selection and preparation matter [^112Et6kv] [^113Rsie1] [^112yViAA].

> Next, I should review safety with precision. Serious adverse events directly attributable to FMT are uncommon, with pooled estimates around or below 1% in large meta-analyses, but the risk landscape evolved after FDA-documented transmissions of multidrug-resistant organisms, prompting enhanced donor screening for ESBL-producing E. coli and other pathogens; long-term safety remains incompletely defined, though observational cohorts have not shown clear disease clustering, and immunocompromised hosts warrant heightened caution due to infectious risk [^117AMzuL] [^116aSGJN] [^112jB6JA] [^112wXqk1].

> I will now examine guideline positions to anchor indications. Major societies converge on recommending FMT for patients with multiple recurrences, typically after two or more appropriately treated episodes, with ACG and IDSA/SHEA endorsing colonoscopy or capsules as preferred delivery and suggesting repeat FMT if recurrence occurs within 8 weeks; ESCMID and BSG/HIS similarly endorse FMT after repeated recurrences, and AGA 2024 extends consideration to mildly or moderately immunocompromised adults while advising against use in severely immunocompromised patients [^115Gnp27] [^115GsL31] [^111Ydbvv] [^113ue2qN] [^113hXiqf] [^116SkKh9] [^111ZByS6].

> But wait, what about special populations and edge cases. In pediatrics, guidance supports considering FMT after multiple recurrences, with emerging safety data but still limited high-quality pediatric RCTs; in transplant recipients and other immunocompromised hosts, evidence is sparse and risk-benefit must be individualized, with some centers proceeding cautiously alongside enhanced screening and antimicrobial stewardship; for severe or fulminant CDI not responding to standard therapy, expert guidelines suggest select use of conventional FMT as an adjunct in carefully chosen patients [^115kuaBX] [^113CLWxV] [^112u1GYC] [^115GsL31].

> Let me consider predictors of failure to refine selection and preparation. Multivariate analyses and meta-analyses consistently identify systemic antibiotics around the time of FMT, inflammatory bowel disease, poor bowel preparation, and severe CDI as risk factors for failure; conversely, optimizing pre-FMT antibiotics, ensuring high-quality bowel prep, and minimizing post-FMT systemic antibiotics improve outcomes, supporting a protocolized approach and counseling about modifiable risks [^116ppsmS] [^114PbBe2].

> I should confirm the regulatory and product evolution. The FDA has moved from enforcement discretion to approval of defined live biotherapeutic products for rCDI prevention, reflecting a shift toward standardized, pathogen-screened microbiota therapeutics; stool banking initiatives and international consensus aim to harmonize donor screening, processing, and traceability, addressing historical variability that complicated safety and access [^116jBRGS] [^112QGUjP] [^111zZs1E].

> Next, I should review practical clinical recommendations. For immunocompetent adults with a second or further recurrence, offer FMT after completing standard-of-care antibiotics, preferring colonoscopy or capsules; if capsules are unavailable or declined, enema is reasonable but may have lower efficacy; counsel on modifiable failure risks, screen donors rigorously for MDROs and SARS-CoV-2, and plan for repeat FMT if symptoms recur within 8 weeks; in immunocompromised patients, avoid FMT in severe immunosuppression and proceed selectively in mild to moderate cases with enhanced precautions [^115Gnp27] [^113Kziwt] [^111Ydbvv] [^116SkKh9] [^111ZByS6].

> Hold on, I should verify the economic angle because it influences adoption. Cost-effectiveness modeling suggests FMT is cost-effective even for first recurrence when available, largely by reducing downstream recurrences and hospitalizations; this complements the strong clinical efficacy signal and supports earlier deployment in appropriately selected patients, pending confirmatory trials [^1169fosC].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. While FMT is the most effective therapy for rCDI, optimal timing, dosing, and product standardization remain active questions; capsule formulations have shown promise but heterogeneous results underscore the need for head-to-head trials and clearer regulatory pathways; long-term microbiome and clinical sequelae require continued surveillance, and expansion to non-CDI indications should remain investigational pending robust RCTs [^111EqRrM] [^112yViAA] [^115CVqZC].

> In summary, after verifying the evidence base and guidelines, FMT should be offered to immunocompetent adults with multiple rCDI episodes after appropriate antibiotics, delivered via colonoscopy or capsules with attention to modifiable failure risks and rigorous donor screening; select use can be considered in mildly to moderately immunocompromised patients, whereas severe immunosuppression remains a contraindication, and the field is rapidly evolving toward defined, regulated microbiota therapeutics that may further improve safety and access [^115Gnp27] [^116SkKh9] [^111ZByS6] [^116jBRGS].

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for **recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI)** [^113BHu4j], with cure rates of 80–90% after one treatment and 90–98% with repeat dosing [^112Et6kv]. It is recommended by major guidelines for patients with multiple recurrences or refractory disease [^113Kziwt] [^113ue2qN] [^113hXiqf]. FMT is generally safe, but rare serious adverse events can occur, including transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms [^112jB6JA]; therefore, rigorous donor screening and standardized protocols are essential [^112QGUjP]. Capsule formulations are noninferior to colonoscopy and offer a less invasive option [^112yViAA] [^111kLfgk]. FMT is not yet standard for other conditions due to limited evidence, and ongoing research aims to refine safety, efficacy, and regulatory frameworks [^111EqRrM] [^115CVqZC].

---

## Indications and clinical applications

FMT is **primarily indicated** for rCDI, particularly after failure of standard antibiotic therapy [^113Kziwt]. Major guidelines recommend FMT for patients with multiple recurrences or refractory disease:

- **ACG 2021**: Strong recommendation for FMT after the second or further recurrence of CDI [^114w94MX].
- **IDSA/SHEA 2018**: Consider FMT for patients with multiple recurrences after appropriate antibiotic treatments [^113M11WS].
- **ESCMID 2021**: FMT recommended after standard antibiotic pretreatment for second or further recurrence [^114dQnbP].

FMT is also being investigated for other conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [^114mNZn5], irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [^115CVqZC], and metabolic syndrome [^116NAp3D]; however, **evidence remains limited** and it is not yet standard care for these indications [^111EqRrM].

---

## Mechanisms of action

FMT restores **gut microbiota diversity and function**, thereby re-establishing colonization resistance against C. difficile [^112E56Kb]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Restoration of microbial diversity**: FMT replenishes beneficial bacteria, restoring a healthy gut ecosystem [^114vxJXQ].
- **Competitive inhibition**: Beneficial bacteria outcompete C. difficile for nutrients and space, reducing pathogen colonization [^116tfVif].
- **Metabolic restoration**: FMT restores bile acid metabolism and short-chain fatty acid production, inhibiting C. difficile growth and toxin production [^116jBRGS].
- **Immune modulation**: FMT modulates host immune responses, reducing inflammation and promoting pathogen clearance [^111fsiJW].

---

## Clinical efficacy

FMT demonstrates **high efficacy** in treating rCDI, with cure rates of 80–90% after a single treatment and 90–98% with repeat dosing [^112Et6kv]. Comparative studies show FMT significantly outperforms standard antibiotic therapies, such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin, in preventing recurrence [^113BHu4j] [^112Et6kv].

| **Study type** | **Cure rate (%)** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Randomized controlled trials | 80–90 | Single treatment [^114dZ4Ec] [^114vxJXQ] |
| Meta-analyses | 90–98 | Repeat dosing [^112Et6kv] |
| Comparative studies | Superior to antibiotics | Prevents recurrence [^113BHu4j] [^112Et6kv] |

---

## Safety profile and adverse events

FMT is **generally safe**, but adverse events can occur. Serious adverse events are rare but include transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) [^112jB6JA], which has prompted enhanced donor screening protocols [^112jB6JA]. Common adverse events are mild and self-limited, including diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and bloating [^117AMzuL]. Long-term safety remains under investigation, but current data suggest no significant increase in chronic diseases or malignancies [^notfound].

---

## Donor selection and screening

Donor selection is critical to FMT safety and efficacy. Donors undergo **rigorous screening** for infectious diseases, MDROs, and other potential pathogens [^111kLfgk]. Stool banks have been established to standardize donor screening, stool processing, and storage, improving safety and accessibility [^111zZs1E].

---

## Methods of administration

FMT can be administered via several routes, including colonoscopy, enema, nasoduodenal tube, and oral capsules. Colonoscopy and oral capsules are the **most commonly used** and have demonstrated similar efficacy rates [^111kLfgk]. Capsule formulations offer a less invasive, more acceptable option for patients [^112yViAA].

---

## Regulatory considerations

FMT is regulated differently across countries. In the United States, the **FDA** exercises enforcement discretion for FMT used to treat rCDI, provided strict safety protocols are followed [^112jB6JA]. In Europe, FMT is considered a **medicinal product** and is subject to regulatory oversight [^notfound]. Standardization of FMT protocols, donor screening, and product quality is essential for regulatory compliance and **patient safety** [^111zZs1E].

---

## Current limitations and challenges

Despite its efficacy, FMT faces several challenges:

- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Lack of standardized regulations across jurisdictions complicates implementation [^112QGUjP].
- **Safety concerns**: Rare transmission of MDROs necessitates rigorous donor screening and monitoring [^112jB6JA].
- **Limited evidence for non-CDI indications**: More research is needed to establish FMT efficacy in other conditions [^115CVqZC].
- **Patient acceptance**: Psychological barriers and misconceptions about FMT persist [^111tksBd].

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

Future research aims to address current limitations and expand FMT applications:

- **Defined microbial consortia**: Development of standardized microbial mixtures to replace whole-stool FMT, improving safety and efficacy [^113692P5].
- **Personalized medicine**: Tailoring FMT to individual patient microbiomes and clinical profiles [^1174FTNV].
- **Expanded indications**: Ongoing trials investigating FMT in IBD, IBS, metabolic syndrome, and other conditions [^113TsaAe].
- **Long-term safety studies**: Continued monitoring of long-term outcomes and adverse events [^112wXqk1].

---

FMT is a highly effective treatment for rCDI, restoring gut microbiota diversity and function to prevent recurrence. It is **generally safe**, but rare adverse events necessitate rigorous donor screening and standardized protocols. FMT is recommended by major guidelines for rCDI, and ongoing research aims to expand its applications and improve safety and efficacy [^113Kziwt] [^113ue2qN].

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) [^113BHu4j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I² = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I² = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates.

Authors' Conclusions

In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections [^111LxVTS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, Clostridium difficile infections have become more frequent, more severe, more refractory to standard treatment, and more likely to recur. Current antibiotic treatment regimens for Clostridium difficile infection alter the normal gut flora, which provide colonization resistance against Clostridium difficile. Over the past few years, there has been a marked increase in the knowledge of the gut microbiota and its role in health maintenance and disease causation. This has, fortuitously, coincided with the use of a unique microbial replacement therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, in the treatment of patients with multiple recurrent Clostridium difficile infections. We briefly review current knowledge of the gut microbiota's functions. We then review the indications for use of fecal microbiota transplantation in Clostridium difficile infection, the techniques employed, and results of treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation has been shown to be efficacious for patients with multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (reported cure rates of 90%), with an excellent short-term safety profile, and has been included in the American College of Gastroenterology treatment guidelines for this troublesome disease.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZGbQr]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). CDI is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and 22–32% experience prolonged or recurrent infections unresponsive to standard antibiotics. Recurrent CDI is associated with a high mortality, and preventing the infection poses a substantial therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options. During the last decade, FMT has emerged as a viable treatment for recurrent CDI. With effect rates of up to 94% in clinical trials, FMT is now recommended by scientific societies and National Health agencies for patients with 2 or more recurrences of CDI.

Previous systematic reviews have confirmed the high clinical effect of FMT for recurrent CDI and indicated that the treatment effect may depend on the method of delivery and treatment regimens. Still, no clear clinical evidence exists for the cumulative effect of FMT following single or repeated treatment regimens, and the quality of evidence for FMT compared with standard antibiotics has been rated as moderate in previous systematic reviews and guidelines due to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies have resulted in caution and questioned the position of FMT in the CDI treatment algorithm until the evidence for FMT has been evaluated in more detail. Now, further to these earlier systematic reviews, more evidence has accumulated, and new methods of delivery have emerged; as such, an update of the evidence with the latest data is pivotal to guide clinical decisions and improve the future recommendations for FMT in managing patients with recurrent CDI.

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to establish the evidence for using FMT in recurrent CDI, to provide updated effect estimates specific to different delivery methods and treatment regimens, and to compare the effect of FMT with that of standard antibiotics.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile: mechanisms and pharmacology [^11267aqk]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a remarkably successful treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection that cannot be cured with antibiotics alone. Understanding the complex biology and pathogenesis of C. difficile infection, which we discuss in this Perspective, is essential for understanding the potential mechanisms by which FMT cures this disease. Although FMT has already entered clinical practice, different microbiota-based products are currently in clinical trials and are vying for regulatory approval. However, all these therapeutics belong to an entirely new class of agents that require the development of a new branch of pharmacology. Characterization of microbiota therapeutics uses novel and rapidly evolving technologies and requires incorporation of microbial ecology concepts. Here, we consider FMT within a pharmacological framework, including its essential elements: formulation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. From this viewpoint, multiple gaps in knowledge become apparent, identifying areas that require systematic research. This knowledge is needed to help clinical providers use microbiota therapeutics appropriately and to facilitate development of next-generation microbiota products with improved safety and efficacy. The discussion here is limited to FMT as a representative of microbiota therapeutics and recurrent C. difficile as the indication; however, consideration of the intrinsic basic principles is relevant to this entire class of microbiota-based therapeutics.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^114kKMFz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014-present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### The role of the gut microbiome in colonization resistance and recurrentinfection [^116tfVif]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The species composition of the human gut microbiota is related to overall health, and a healthy gut microbiome is crucial in maintaining colonization resistance against pathogens. Disruption of gut microbiome composition and functionality reduces colonization resistance and has been associated with several gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases. One prime example is Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and subsequent recurrent infections that occur after the development of systemic antibiotic-related dysbiosis. Standard-of-care antibiotics used for both acute and recurrent infections do not address dysbiosis and often worsen the condition. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies, recommended in conjunction with standard-of-care antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent CDI in patients at high risk of recurrence, reduce recurrences but do not address the underlying dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an evolving therapeutic strategy in which microbes are harvested from healthy donor stool and transplanted into the gut of a recipient to restore the gut microbiome. Although effective in the prevention of recurrent CDI, some existing challenges include screening and the standardization of stool acquisition and processing. Recent safety alerts by the US Food and Drug Administration raised concern about the possibility of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via FMT. Increased knowledge that microbes are beneficial in restoring the gut microbiome has led to the clinical development of several newer biotherapeutic formulations that are more regulated than FMT, which may allow for improved restoration of the gut microbiome and prevention of CDI recurrence. This review focuses on mechanisms by which gut microbiome restoration could influence colonization resistance against the pathogen C. difficile.

Plain language summary

The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Clostridioides difficile Infection

Introduction:

A rich and diverse gut microbiome is key to immune system regulation and colonization resistance against pathogens.
A disruption in the gut microbiome composition can make the gut more vulnerable to diseases such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), caused by the bacterium C. difficile.
CDI management presents a therapeutic dilemma, as it is usually treated with antibiotics that can treat the infection but also can damage the microbiome.
Treatment of CDI using antibiotics can further reduce microbial diversity and deplete beneficial bacteria from the gut leading to a condition called dysbiosis.
Antibiotic treatment can be followed by therapies that restore the gut microbiota, boost colonization resistance, and prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.
It is important to evaluate treatment options to determine their safety and effectiveness.

Methods:

The researchers provided an overview of the mechanisms that the gut microbiome uses to prevent colonization of the gut by pathogens.
They subsequently reviewed the efficacy and shortcomings of the following treatments for CDI: - Antibiotics - Monoclonal antibodies - Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)

Results:

Commensal intestinal bacteria prevent colonization of the gut by pathogens using mechanisms such as: - Competition for key nutrients - Production of inhibitory bile acids - Short-chain fatty acid production - Lowering the luminal pH - Production of bacteriocins
Antibiotic therapy is recommended as a standard treatment for CDI. However, patients are vulnerable to recurrent CDI after discontinuation of the therapy.
Monoclonal antibodies that inactivate C. difficile toxins may be recommended along with antibiotics to prevent recurrent CDI. However, this approach does not restore the microbiome.
FMT is one method of microbial restoration, where stool is harvested from a healthy donor and transplanted into a patient's colon.
Although FMT has shown some efficacy in the treatment of recurrent CDI, the procedure is not standardized.
Safety concerns have been raised about the possibility of transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens via FMT.

Conclusion:

Treatment methods that can efficiently restore the diversity of the gut microbiome are crucial in preventing recurrence of CDI.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^111wBcGh]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders. The mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT are not fully understood. Importantly, FMT remains a crucial treatment in managing CDI and understanding the mechanisms that underpin its success will be critical to improve its clinical efficacy, safety and usability. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of this may allow us to expose FMT's full potential as a therapeutic tool for other disease states. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^111F7o96]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has now been established into clinical guidelines for the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Its therapeutic application in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is currently at an early stage. To date, there have been four randomized controlled trials for FMT in IBD and a multitude of observational studies. However, significant gaps in our knowledge regarding optimum methods for FMT preparation, technical aspects and logistics of its administration, as well as mechanistic underpinnings, still remain. In this article, we aim to highlight these gaps by reviewing evidence and making key recommendations on the direction of future studies in this field. In addition, we provide an overview of the current evidence of potential mechanisms of FMT in treating IBD.

### Clostridioides difficile in transplant patients: early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^112u1GYC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridioides difficile infection is common in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These populations are also underrepresented in clinical trials, making optimal management difficult. Because of this, management of these populations follows national guideline recommendations. This review aims to summarize the recent relevant literature pertaining to the clinical management of C. difficile infection in transplant patients, with a particular focus on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

Recent Findings

Early diagnosis of C. difficile colonization may mitigate both horizontal and vertical transmission (progression from colonization to colitis) of infection. Once diagnosed, recent literature suggests antibiotic treatment should align with that recommended by national guidelines. Fecal microbiota transplant is an emerging therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection, and recent data have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Prevention strategies including antimicrobial stewardship, probiotic administration, antibiotic administration, and bezlotoxumab may be beneficial in transplant populations, but more data are needed to confirm recent findings.

Summary

Studies evaluating C. difficile infection in transplant patients are only recently starting to emerge. Further research is needed to identify optimal treatment and prevention strategies, and to examine novel strategies such as microbiome manipulation.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^112jegQK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The potential role of faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been explored in the treatment of a multitude of diseases, both gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI, structural and functional in nature. A significant proportion of the initial evidence for its efficacy was derived from observational studies, primarily in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – Despite the small size and heterogeneity of early studies, the consistently positive findings led to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which confirmed the therapeutic role of FMT for this indication. It is recognized that distinctive alterations of both the composition and function of the gut microbiota characterize other GI diseases as well as other non-GI conditions. In particular, some of the initial evidence for its utility in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) came from subgroup analysis of RCTs of CDI and a handful of observational studies. – Although we may be able to translate our knowledge around principles and methodology from FMT studies in CDI, there are specific uncertainties and challenges for the therapeutic use of FMT for IBD that need to be addressed. In this review, we aim to summarize the current gaps in our knowledge regarding FMT in IBD from a clinical and mechanistic perspective, and to highlight potential areas to target and optimize in future studies.

### Clinical practice and infrastructure review of fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection [^1157Bzfi]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) cases recur after completion of antibiotic therapy, and antibiotic cure rates diminish with each recurrence of CDI. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent FMT, which otherwise requires prolonged or indefinite antibiotic treatment. FMT is performed by introducing the fecal microbial community obtained from a healthy donor or pool of donors into the stomach, small intestine, or colon of a patient with CDI. Multiple clinical trials support the usefulness of FMT in treating recurrent CDI, and CDI treatment guidelines now include consideration of FMT at the third CDI recurrence. However, there remain challenges to incorporating FMT into clinical practice. First, methods of fecal bacterial community processing vary, as do methods of FMT administration. Second, the optimal dosing strategy and expected benefit of FMT for refractory CDI, particularly for severe and severe complicated cases, are uncertain. Third, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers FMT an investigational treatment. Fourth, insurance reimbursement for FMT usually falls short of FMT administration costs. In the setting of rising C difficile incidence and growing evidence for FMT efficacy, the demand for FMT has increased. However, uncertainty surrounding optimal FMT preparation and administration methods, FDA oversight, and insurance reimbursement presently limits the clinical practice of FMT.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112wXqk1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Goals

We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI).

Background

FMT has emerged as a promising therapy for patients with rCDI unresponsive to standard medical therapy, though long-term efficacy and safety data are scarce.

Materials and Methods

A multicenter retrospective study was performed on patients treated with FMT for rCDI with ≥ 6 months of clinical follow-up post-FMT. Patients were contacted to document sustained efficacy, potential adverse events, and antibiotic exposure. The electronic medical record was reviewed to confirm patient-reported outcomes and obtain additional data. The primary outcome was sustained cure, as defined by the absence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) at any timepoint after FMT.

Results

Of 528 patients treated, 207 were successfully contacted. The mean follow-up post-FMT was 34 (range: 6 to 84) months. One hundred fifty-seven patients (75.8%) reported sustained cure at the time of follow-up. One hundred patients (48%) reported the use of antibiotics for non-CDI indications post-FMT, of whom 11 (11%) had experienced CDI post-FMT. Fifty-two of the original 528 patients (9.8%) treated with FMT had died at the time of follow-up contact; none were felt attributable to the procedure. New medical conditions or diagnoses post-FMT were reported in 105 patients (50.5%). Fifteen reported improvement post-FMT in previously diagnosed medical conditions.

Conclusions

In this largest and longest study to date on efficacy and safety after FMT for treatment of rCDI, we found that the majority of patients experienced long-term cure. Although a number of new conditions developed post-FMT, there was no clustering of diseases associated with dysbiosis.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [^117Gt23Q]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile, a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea due to perturbation of the normal gastrointestinal microbiome, is responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures. The incidence and severity of C difficile infection (CDI) is increasing, and recurrent disease is common. Recurrent infection can be difficult to manage with conventional antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which involves instillation of stool from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of the patient, restores the gut microbiome to a healthy state. FMT has emerged as a promising new treatment for CDI. There are limited data on FMT for treatment of primary CDI, but FMT appears safe and effective for recurrent CDI. The safety and efficacy of FMT in patients with severe primary or severe recurrent CDI has not been established. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who undergo FMT for CDI may be at increased risk of IBD flare, and caution should be exercised with use of FMT in that population. The long-term safety of FMT is unknown; thus, rigorously conducted prospective studies are needed.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the management of Clostridium difficile infection [^111dVDqJ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

This article discusses the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The disruption of the normal gut microbiota is central to the pathogenesis of CDI, and disruption persists in recurrent disease. The use of FMT for recurrent CDI is characterized by a high response rate and short term safety is excellent, although the long-term effects of FMT are as yet unknown.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112EWRdz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a significant burden on the health system, especially due to high recurrence rates. Since the beginning of the CDI epidemic in early 2000s, many strategies for combatting recurrence have been explored, with moderate success so far. This review will focus on the most recent developments in recurrent CDI prevention and treatment.

Recent Findings

There are two main mechanisms of CDI recurrence: alteration in microbiome and poor antibody response. Development of new antibiotics aims to minimize damage to the microbiome. Fecal transplant or other microbiome replacement therapies seek to replenish the missing elements in the microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplant is the most effective treatment for prevention of CDI recurrenceso far, but is difficult to standardize and regulate, leading to efforts to develop microbiome-derived therapeutics. A deficiency in developing antibodies to C. difficile toxins is another mechanism of recurrence. Active immunization using toxoid vaccines or passive immunization using mAbs address this aspect.

Summary

There are promising new treatments for recurrent CDI in development. Fecal microbiota transplant remains the most effective therapy for multiply recurrent CDI. New antibiotics, microbiome-derived therapeutics, and immunologic therapies are in development.

### Expert opinion on fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment ofinfection and beyond [^113ZJUPi]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure involving transfer of stool from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a diseased recipient to restore intestinal microbial composition and functionality. FMT's tremendous success in recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) catalyzed gut microbiota research and opened the door to microbiome-based therapy for various gastrointestinal and other disorders. Areas covered: We used PubMed search engine to identify significant publications in the field of CDI and FMT. Here we present an overview of the current literature on FMT's use for recurrent, non-severe, severe, and fulminant CDI and on promising future application. Expert opinion: FMT as the best tool for treatment of antibiotic-refractory CDI has gained immense popularity over the last decade. The future of gut microbiota-based therapy should include oral formulations that contain well-described ingredients in effective doses, clear mechanism of action, and excellent safety profile.

### Safety and efficacy of encapsulated fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^117FhBHg]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be effective for the treatment of recurrent clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The efficacy and safety of freeze-dried encapsulated FMT for the treatment of recurrent CDI is unclear. We performed a systematic review to evaluate and analyze the current evidence in this respect.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases until December 2017 to identify all original studies that investigated the role of administration of encapsulated FMT in recurrent CDI. The study included patients of all ages. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of publications; a third investigator resolved any discrepancies.

Results

A total of six studies, five case series and one randomized-controlled trial, were included in this review. Overall, 341 patients completed treatment with encapsulated FMT. Only three major adverse events were reported and no deaths occurred directly related to FMT. In all, 285 patients responded to the first treatment, with no recurrence during the specified follow-up period set to meet the primary endpoint. Forty-two patients underwent a second treatment, with resolution of symptoms in 28 patients. At least five patients were reported to undergo a third treatment, with resolution in three of them. Only one patient was reported to have received four treatments without long-term resolution of symptoms.

Conclusion

Low-quality to moderate-quality evidence showed that encapsulated FMT is safe and cost-effective for the treatment and prevention of recurrent CDI. Its efficacy is not inferior to FMT performed through the nonoral route. Randomized-controlled trials are necessary to compare its efficacy with oral antimicrobial drugs and also to evaluate the potential adverse effects associated with the treatment.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^114dZ4Ec]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is not well-known.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of FMT for CDI.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1980 to January 2015), Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by hand-searching references from systematic reviews and identified studies.

Study Selection

Any study of FMT to treat adult patients with CDI; case reports were only used to report harms.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted by 1 author and verified by another; 2 authors independently assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Two randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); 28 case-series studies; and 5 case reports were included. Two RCTs and 21 case-series studies (516 patients receiving FMT) reported using FMT for patients with recurrent CDI. A high proportion of treated patients had symptom resolution; however, the role of previous antimicrobials is unclear. One RCT comparing FMT with 2 control groups (n = 43) reported resolution of symptoms in 81%, 31%, and 23% of the FMT, vancomycin, or vancomycin-plus-bowel lavage groups, respectively (P < 0.001 for both control groups vs. FMT). An RCT comparing FMT route (n = 20) reported no difference between groups (60% in the nasogastric tube group and 80% in the colonoscopy group; P = 0.63). Across all studies for recurrent CDI, symptom resolution was seen in 85% of cases. In 7 case-series studies of patients with refractory CDI, symptom resolution ranged from 0% to 100%. Among 7 patients treated with FMT for initial CDI, results were mixed.

Limitation

Most studies were uncontrolled case-series studies; only 2 RCTs were available for analysis.

Conclusion

Fecal microbiota transplantation may have a substantial effect with few short-term adverse events for recurrent CDI. Evidence is insufficient on FMT for refractory or initial CDI treatment and on whether effects vary by donor, preparation, or delivery method.

### An infectious diseases perspective on fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile infection in children [^115jjmf4]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is efficacious for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDIs). Pediatric experience with FMT for rCDIs is increasing, particularly at large centers. While retrospective studies suggest that FMT is generally safe in the short term, particularly in immunocompetent patients and with rigorous donor screening, additional large prospective studies are needed. This particularly includes those at high risk for infectious complications, such as immunocompromised hosts. Further, long-term implications of altering the intestinal microbiome with FMT are not well understood. The role of FMT in children, particularly in high-risk patients, will require continual reexamination with future availability of pediatric safety and efficacy data. This review summarizes key points for infectious diseases physicians to consider when evaluating a child for FMT.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: benefits and barriers [^113i9DLc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have increased worldwide in the past two decades. A principal function of the gut microbiota is to protect the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Increasingly, the gut microbiota have been shown to influence susceptibility to other genetic and environmentally acquired conditions. Transplantation of healthy donor fecal material in patients with CDI may re-establish the normal composition of the gut microbiota and has been shown to be effective in recurrent CDI. We intend to review the most recent data on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and critically discuss potential advantages and handicaps of this new therapeutic approach.

Recent Findings

Evidence from case series and only one randomized clinical trial suggests that FMT is able to restore the wide diversity of microflora, improve C. difficile-related symptoms and prevent CDI recurrence.

Summary

FMT is a promising treatment option for serious and recurrent CDI, and current evidence (although weak) demonstrates consistent and excellent efficacy in clinical outcomes. However, many questions should be answered before it may be recommended as routine standard treatment. Mechanisms of action need to be better understood. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine long-lasting effects (including the association with autoimmune diseases).

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Et6kv]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but inconsistent effect rates and uncertain evidence levels have warranted caution. To clarify, we aimed to establish the evidence of FMT for recurrent CDI, updated across different delivery methods, treatment regimens, and in comparison with standard antibiotics.

Methods

In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Clinical Key, and Svemed+ for FMT literature published in English until November 11, 2019. We included observational and clinical trials with or without antibiotic comparators and excluded studies with below 8 weeks follow-up and fewer than 15 patients. The primary outcome was clinical outcome by week 8. We comprehensively extracted patient and procedural data. In a random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated the clinical effect for repeat or single FMT, different delivery methods, and versus antibiotics. We rated the evidence according to the Cochrane and GRADE methods. The PROSPERO preregistration number is CRD42020158112.

Findings

Of 1816 studies assessed, 45 studies were included. The overall clinical effect week 8 following repeat FMT (24 studies, 1855 patients) was 91% (95% CI: 89–94%, I² = 53%) and 84% (80–88%, I² = 86%) following single FMT (43 studies, 2937 patients). Delivery by lower gastrointestinal endoscopy was superior to all other delivery methods, and repeat FMT significantly increased the treatment effect week 8 (P < 0.001). Compared with vancomycin, the number needed to treat (NNT) for repeat FMT was 1.5 (1.3–1.9, P < 0.001) and 2.9 (1.5–37.1, P = 0.03) for single FMT. Repeat FMT had high quality of evidence.

Interpretation

High-quality evidence supports FMT is effective for recurrent CDI, but its effect varies with the delivery method and the number of administrations. The superior NNT for FMT compared with antibiotics suggests that patients may benefit from advancing FMT to all instances of recurrent CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^114gXJCH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

As a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are listed by the Centres for Disease Control and prevention as one of the top 5 urgent threats in the United States. CDI occurs from gut microbiome dysbiosis, typically through antibiotic-mediated disruption; however, antibiotics are the treatment of choice, which can result in recurrent infections. Here, we highlight new treatments available and provide a perspective on different classes of future treatments.

Recent findings

Due to the reduced risk of disease recurrence, the microbiome-sparing antibiotic Fidaxomicin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for C. difficile infection. Based on the success of faecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) in treating CDI recurrence, defined microbiome biotherapeutics offer a safer and more tightly controlled alterative as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Given the association between antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the recurrence of CDI, future prospective therapies aim to reduce the dependence on antibiotics for the treatment of CDI.

Summary

With current first-in-line antibiotic therapy options associated with high levels of recurrent CDI, the availability of new generation targeted therapeutics can really impact treatment success. There are still unknowns about the long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics, but efforts to expand the CDI treatment toolbox can offer multiple solutions for clinicians to treat this multifaceted infectious disease to reduce patient suffering.

### A randomized controlled trial of efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant for preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^113Rsie1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals, with 15%-30% of patients experiencing recurrence. The aim of our randomized, double-blind clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of capsule-delivered fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) versus placebo in reducing recurrent diarrhea and CDI recurrence. The secondary aim was FMT safety assessment.

Methods

Between 2018 and 2022, Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration system with recurrent CDI who responded to antibiotic treatment were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to oral FMT or placebo capsules. Randomization was stratified by number of prior CDI recurrences (1 or ≥ 2). The primary endpoint was clinical recurrence by day 56, defined as > 3 unformed stools daily for ≥ 2 days with or without laboratory confirmation of C. difficile, or death within 56 days.

Results

The study was stopped due to futility after meeting prespecified criteria. Of 153 participants (76 FMT, 77 placebo) with an average age of 66.5 years, 25 participants (32.9%) in the FMT arm and 23 (29.9%) in the placebo arm experienced the primary endpoint of diarrhea and possible or definite CDI recurrence or death within 56 days of capsule administration (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% confidence interval, -11.7% to 17.7%]). Stratification by number of recurrences revealed no statistically significant differences. There were no clinically important differences in adverse events.

Conclusions

FMT therapy versus placebo did not reduce CDI recurrence or death at 56 days. There were no meaningful differences in adverse events between treatment groups.

### Predictors and management of failed fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^116ppsmS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Goals

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurs in 10% to 15% after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). We identify predictors, and describe management and outcome of patients with recurrent CDI after FMT in a predominantly outpatient cohort.

Methods

A nested case-control study of patients undergoing FMT for recurrent CDI from August 2012 to January 2017 was performed. FMT failure was defined as recurrent diarrhea with positive C. difficile stool test during follow-up (≥ 2mo). Controls (patients without FMT failures) were matched to cases 1:1 for sex and timing of FMT ± 1 month.

Results

Overall, 522 patients underwent FMT; 70 [13.4%; median age 53.8 years (range, 18 to 89y), 54.3% females] recurred within a median 5.6 months (range, 0.2 to 34.9mo). Number of prior CDI episodes, prior CDI treatment, and prior CDI-related hospitalizations were similar in cases and controls. Systemic antibiotics after FMT (54.3% vs. 21.4%, P < 0.0001), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (34.3% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.01), pseudomembranes at FMT (4.3% vs. 0%, P = 0.03), and poor bowel preparation (68.5% vs. 31.4%, P = 0.01) were associated with FMT failure. On multivariate analysis, IBD [odds ratio (OR) 4.34; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24–15.15], systemic antibiotics (OR 7.39; 95% CI, 3.02–18.07), and poor bowel preparation (OR 3.84; 95% CI, 1.59–9.28) predicted FMT failure with an area under the curve of 0.78. Among FMT failures, 37 (52.8%) were managed with antibiotics, 32 (45.7%) with repeat FMT after antibiotics and 1 with colectomy.

Conclusions

Use of systemic antibiotics, IBD, and poor bowel preparation predict FMT failure. Patients with FMT failure can be managed with antibiotics and/or repeat FMT.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129p6Xw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has emerged as a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality. It is now estimated that CDI has an incidence up to 32.6 per 100,000 person-years, with a direct care cost of $4.8 billion per year in the United States alone. This gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe is the most common cause of pseudomembranous colitis — a condition characterized by intractable diarrhea with the formation of intestinal pseudomembranes of cellular material in the colon. As a result of these physical characteristics, as well as the development of multidrug resistance, the challenge of effectively treating CDI continues to grow.

Given the prevalence and increasing antibiotic resistance of CDI, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is emerging as an exciting alternative to antibiotic therapies in preventing recurrent and complicated CDI. Since its initial implementation, the frequency of use has grown significantly. Current guidelines recommend FMT for patients with multiple recurrences of antibiotic-treated CDI. Accurate study of FMT is challenging, given the heterogeneity of administration protocols. One issue that arises is the variation in stool preparation — studies have described usage of both fresh and frozen stool, various sources of stool (family, pooled, or standardized preparation), and inconsistent donor and stool screening protocols. An additional challenge has been the quality of these studies; many of the randomized controlled trials that have compared FMT to antibiotic therapy have limited follow up as well as antibiotic protocols not within the standard of care. Regardless, FMT has been shown to be of comparable efficacy to standard medical management. Evidence regarding its efficacy with various routes of administration shows inconsistent results, but has widely demonstrated significant efficacy.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114crr6Z]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Supplementary File 1) and the instructions described in the Cochrane Handbook. The review protocol was preregistered and is accessible at(CRD42020158112).

Overall, the review addressed three principal questions:
1 What is the overall effect of FMT in treating recurrent CDI?
2 Does the effect of FMT vary according to delivery method or treatment regimen?
3 What is the effect of FMT compared with standard antibiotics in patients with recurrent CDI?

2.1 Data sources and searches

We searched the medical databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Clinical Key, and Svemed+ for all available literature published until November 11, 2019. The search string was constructed to include the different terminologies used to describe the procedure (Supplementary Table 1).

2.2 Study selection

Inclusion criteria were: published randomised clinical trials (RCT) and observational cohort studies with more than 15 patients. We included English language studies using FMT to treat recurrent CDI, with or without an antibiotic comparator, in an adult population (18+ years) with no prior FMT treatments and a follow-up period of at least 8 weeks. We defined FMT as the transfer of processed faeces from healthy, allogenic donors. We excluded autologous FMT and microbial treatments sourced from cultured microbial consortiums. As a cut-off value to restrict the study population to recurrent CDI only, studies were excluded if they included ≥ 10% adolescents or ≥ 10% patients with refractory, index CDI. Studies that failed to report clinical outcomes or had selective reporting were excluded. For studies reporting outcomes from the same population at different time points, we included the most recent if the superseding study was of equal quality. Subsidiary studies conducting additional sub-analyses were omitted in favour of the original study with more details.

All references were imported and managed in Covidence (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia.). Two independent reviewers (SMDB and MM) screened and fully read potential articles for eligibility, and one reviewer (CH) arbitrated discrepancies. Two reviewers (BHM and JRM) challenged the robustness of the final search strategy by checking for potential missing studies and inconsistencies.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1146JxGY]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbiota, consisting of the community of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoa organisms that inhabit a mammalian host, can impact susceptibility to a range of diseases including cancer, diabetes, allergy, obesity, and infection –. An altered or dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is observed in all of these disease states suggesting that resetting the intestinal microbiota with a composition of bacteria from healthy individuals could treat disease. This theory is supported by animal studies demonstrating alleviation of disease through transplantation of bacteria into the diseased host's intestinal tract –. Significant advancements have been made in defining the community of microbial species that are important in supporting human health –. Translating these findings into viable microbiota-based therapies has had limited success in the clinic, however, and is not yet considered a treatment option for most diseases impacted by microbial dysbiosis. One notable exception is the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT treatment of C. difficile infection is the first microbiota-based therapy clinically proven to ameliorate disease. Before such treatment strategies can be broadly implemented, the underlying principles determining success for microbiota-based therapy need to be elucidated.

C. difficile, a gram positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe is currently the most common nosocomial infection encountered by hospitalized patients, with nearly a half million patients infected and an estimated 13,000–30,000 deaths annually in the United States alone –. This opportunistic pathogen infects the large intestine following perturbation of the intestinal microbiota. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first line treatment options that effectively target the vegetative form of C. difficile, but fail to resolve the underlying condition that promotes infection, a dysbiotic microbiota. Recurrence of C. difficile infection due to repeated failed antibiotic treatments is estimated as high as 25–35% and can cause potentially lethal fulminant colitis. The high recurrence rate following standard antibiotic treatment has spurred the development of new treatment modalities such as FMT. In 2013, the first controlled, double-blinded study reported the superior efficacy of FMT compared to antibiotics in treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. Subsequent studies demonstrate FMT has an 80–90% cure rate in individuals and this treatment option is now incorporated as standard care for recurrent disease in both Europe and the United States –.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^114w94MX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — management of CDI recurrence and prevention specify that we suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy, particularly when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). For a first recurrence, we suggest tapering/pulsed dosing of vancomycin be considered after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and we recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy or capsules for treatment of recurrent CDI; we suggest delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 wk of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with rCDI who are not candidates for FMT, who relapse after FMT, or who require ongoing or frequent courses of antibiotics, suppressive oral vancomycin may be used to prevent further recurrences (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Oral vancomycin prophylaxis may be considered during subsequent systemic antibiotic use in patients with a history of CDI who are at high risk of recurrence to prevent further recurrence (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest bezlotoxumab be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest against discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in patients with CDI, provided there is an appropriate indication for their use (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: current promise and future needs [^112E56Kb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The use of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased rapidly over the past few years. In this review, we highlight clinical studies of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI and discuss the safety, standardization and future of this treatment option. The major risk factor for CDI is prior antibiotic use, which results in an altered state of the gut microbiota characterized by decreased microbial diversity. This altered gut microbiota increases the patient's susceptibility to CDI. In patients with recurrent CDI, the microbiota remains in a state with decreased diversity, and FMT from a healthy individual restores the gut microbiota and subsequently colonization resistance against the pathogen.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown the success rate for FMT as treatment for recurrent CDI being greater than 90%. Standardized, frozen preparations of faeces can be used, which increases the availability of faeces for FMT and decreases the cost of screening individual donors. In addition, there have been recent advances in identifying a defined microbial community isolated from faeces that can restore colonization resistance against C. difficile.

Summary

The use of FMT is a successful treatment for recurrent CDI when primary treatment options have failed. However, more work needs to define potential long-term consequences of this treatment and understand how specific members of the gut microbiota can restore colonization resistance against C. difficile.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^114jn6xa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

With the increasing prevalence of recurrent/refractory Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), alternative treatments to the standard antibiotic therapies are being sought. One of the more controversial of such alternative treatments is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Although the notion of FMT is foreign-even startling-and not esthetic to most people, the concept has been around for many decades. Its benefit and efficacy dates back > 50 years to its use for staphylococcal pseudomembranous colitis, and now FMT is showing a great promise as an inexpensive, safe, and highly efficient treatment for recurrent and refractory CDI. Moreover, with a better understanding of the intricacies of the colonic microbiome and its role in colonic pathophysiology, FMT has the potential to become the standard of care for CDI treatment, and a potential answer to other intestinal disorders in years to come.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: the evolving risk landscape [^112jB6JA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended in clinical guidelines for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). However, it is considered investigational by most regulatory agencies. As the adoption of FMT has increased from a small group of CDI experts alone to more widespread use, there has been a corresponding increase in concern regarding potential risk. FMT is largely considered a safe procedure although risks described range from mild gastrointestinal symptoms to serious infection. Currently, there is variability in how "FMT" is characterized specifically regarding testing approach, which, in turn, impacts the risk profile. This has been highlighted by the rare cases of multidrug-resistant organisms, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia and enteropathogenic E. coli, recently reported, where these organisms were not screened. These cases have prompted additional screening mandates from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has maintained its policy of enforcement discretion for the use of FMT for CDI not responding to standard therapy. Here, we examine the evolving risk landscape of FMT.

### The evolution of the use of faecal microbiota transplantation and emerging therapeutic indications [^111EqRrM]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Developments in high-throughput microbial genomic sequencing and other systems biology techniques have given novel insight into the potential contribution of the gut microbiota to health and disease. As a result, an increasing number of diseases have been characterised by distinctive changes in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota; however, whether such changes are cause, consequence, or incidental to the disease in question remains largely uncertain. Restoration of the gut microbiota to a premorbid state is a key novel therapeutic approach of interest, and faecal microbiota transplantation-the transfer of prescreened stool from healthy donors into the gastrointestinal tract of patients-is gaining increasing importance in both the clinical and research settings. At present, faecal microbiota transplantation is only recommended in the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, although a large number of trials are ongoing worldwide exploring other potential therapeutic indications.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: a review on current formulations ininfection and future outlooks [^114vdorm]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The role of the gut microbiota in health and the pathogenesis of several diseases has been highlighted in recent years. Even though the precise mechanisms involving the microbiome in these ailments are still unclear, microbiota-modulating therapies have been developed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown significant results against Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and its potential has been investigated for other diseases. Unfortunately, the technical aspects of the treatment make it difficult to implement. Pharmaceutical technology approaches to encapsulate microorganisms could play an important role in providing this treatment and render the treatment modalities easier to handle.

Areas Covered

After an overview of CDI, this narrative review aims to discuss the current formulations for FMT and specifically addresses the technical aspects of the treatment. This review also distinguishes itself by focusing on the hurdles and emphasizing the possible improvements using pharmaceutical technologies.

Expert Opinion

FMT is an efficient treatment for recurrent CDI. However, its standardization is overlooked. The approach of industrial and hospital preparations of FMT are different, but both show promise in their respective methodologies. Novel FMT formulations could enable further research on dysbiotic diseases in the future.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117AMzuL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly efficacious procedure used most commonly for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Despite the high value of incorporating FMT into practice, there remain concerns about its safety. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been an updated meta-analysis reporting pooled rates of adverse events in FMT for CDI.

Methods

A search for studies of FMT in patients with CDI was performed with the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to FMT evaluated as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included SAEs unrelated to FMT and minor adverse events associated with FMT. A pooled analysis was then performed.

Results

Initial search identified 378 reference articles. Data were extracted from the 61 of these studies that met the inclusion criteria, comprising 5099 patients. Pooled analysis showed that SAEs related to FMT developed in less than 1% of patients. The pooled rate of SAEs not related to FMT was higher at 2.9%. The pooled rate of minor adverse events also showed infrequent self-limited gastrointestinal and systemic discomfort.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis supports FMT as a safe option for treating recurrent CDI. Future randomized trials are needed to improve our current understanding of FMT safety and further examine the improvements in the quality of life of patients treated with FMT compared to standard therapy of antibiotics.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114GZGgV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The clinical and economic burden of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is significant. Recurrent CDI management has emerged as a major challenge with suboptimal response to standard therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used as a treatment to reconstitute the normal microbial homeostasis and break the cycle of antibiotic agents that may further disrupt the microbiome. Given the lack of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and limitations in previous systematic reviews, we aimed to conduct a systematic review with robust methods to determine the efficacy and safety profile of FMT in CDI.

Methods

An electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (1946-March 2012), EMBASE (1974-March 2012) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012). The search strategy was not limited by language. Abstract data were excluded and only completed studies that underwent the full, rigorous peer-review process were included. Studies that used FMT via any delivery modality for laboratory or endoscopically proven CDI with clinical resolution as primary outcome were included. A sample size of 10 or more patients was a further criterion. Elements of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination checklist and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence quality assessment for case series checklist were employed to determine study quality. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Both unweighted pooled resolution rates (UPR) and weighted pooled resolution rates (WPR) were calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall studies, as well as predefined subgroups.

Results

Eleven studies with a total of 273 CDI patients treated with FMT were identified; no RCTs were found as none have been published. Two-hundred and forty-five out of 273 patients experienced clinical resolution (UPR 89.7%; WPR 89.1% (95% CI 84 to 93%)). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity between studies (Cochran Q test P = 0.13, I² = 33.7%). A priori subgroup analysis suggested that lower gastrointestinal FMT delivery (UPR 91.4%; WPR 91.2% (95% CI 86 to 95%)) led to a trend towards higher clinical resolution rates than the upper gastrointestinal route (UPR 82.3%; WPR 80.6% (95% CI 69–90%)) (proportion difference of WPR was 10.6% (95% CI -0.6 to 22%)). No difference in clinical outcomes was detected between anonymous vs. patient selected donors. There were no reported adverse events associated with FMT and follow-up was variable from weeks to years.

Conclusions

FMT holds considerable promise as a therapy for recurrent CDI but well-designed, RCTs and long-term follow-up registries are still required. These are needed to identify the right patient, efficacy and safety profile of FMT before this approach can be widely advocated.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation in relapsing Clostridium difficile infection [^116Ua9Mc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection rates are Climbing in frequency and severity, and the spectrum of susceptible patients is expanding beyond the traditional scope of hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. Fecal microbiota transplantation is becoming increasingly accepted as an effective and safe intervention in patients with recurrent disease, likely due to the restoration of a disrupted microbiome. Cure rates of > 90% are being consistently reported from multiple centers. Transplantation can be provided through a variety of methodologies, either to the lower proximal, lower distal, or upper gastrointestinal tract. This review summarizes reported results, factors in donor selection, appropriate patient criteria, and the various preparations and mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplant delivery available to clinicians and patients.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: facts and controversies [^116NAp3D]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current evidence on fecal microbiota transplantations (FMTs) for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs), metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.

Recent Findings

Recently, a randomized trial confirmed the efficacy of this treatment strategy in patients with recurrent CDI. For other disorders, evidence is still limited. To date, studies have been performed to try and influence the course of metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.

Summary

There is increasing interest in the role of altered microbiota in the development of a myriad of diseases. Together with new insights comes an interest in influencing this altered microbiota as a potential target for therapy. FMTs are effective against recurrent CDI, a disorder caused by disruption of the normal microbiota. Restoration of intestinal flora and thereby restoration of colonization resistance is thought to be the mechanism responsible for cure. With the developments in FMT and the extension of this treatment modality to both intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, a new field of targeted therapy awaits. The ultimate goal is the development of powerful probiotic regimens that can replace FMT. Currently, FMT should only be given in a strict experimental setting for other conditions than CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^116jBRGS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

FAECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION

Primary insights into the efficacy of gut microbiota restoration came from faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments, where the delivery of minimally manipulated faeces from a healthy donor to a recipient with recurrent CDI can restore colonization resistance leading to clinical cure rates of 76.1%. The mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of FMT are largely unknown but likely to be multifactorial, combining the restoration of microbial diversity and the metabolic landscape. Bile acids have been shown to affect C. difficile germination and vegetative cell growth; therefore, restoration of bile acid metabolism through the reconstitution of bile salt hydrolases has been implicated in FMT efficacy. FMT has been recommended to treat multiply recurrent CDI (second or subsequent recurrence) after treatment with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin. More recent studies have demonstrated a potential role for FMT in treating a first or second CDI episode, severe and severe-complicated CDI. Despite the efficacy of FMT against recurrent CDI, safety concerns have been raised over the potential transmission of pathogens after the transfer of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli resulted in recipient fatalities. With the gut microbiota being linked to other extra-intestinal diseases, the application of an undefined microbiota could have unknown long-term health implications, highlighting the need for standardized procedures for screening and processing and a move towards a more defined and characterized intervention. In 2022–2023, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized two first-in-class live biotherapeutics for the treatment of recurrent CDI.

### Factors associated with failure of fecal microbiota transplant for recurrentinfection [^111WsHGq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) has emerged as a common antibiotic-associated infection in the United States. With nearly 500,000 American patients diagnosed with CDI annually, implications extend beyond individual health, significantly impacting infection control and healthcare expenditures. – 5%–45% of patients with CDI experience recurrence, and in patients with recurrence, the risk of future recurrent CDIs (rCDI) increases to 60%. – The main mechanism of rCDI is thought to be through decreased microbiome diversity leading to increased susceptibility to relapse or reinfection with C. difficile. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which aims to restore the physiologic diversity of intestinal microbiota and resist colonization, has emerged as the most effective therapy for rCDI. With success rates of 80%–95%, FMT has revolutionized rCDI treatment; guidelines recommend offering FMT to patients with rCDI who have failed antibiotic treatment.– We have utilized FMT in our dedicated C. difficile clinic, which has outperformed antibiotic treatment, especially in patients who had three or more recurrent episodes.

Despite FMT's high efficacy, FMT remains ineffective in 5%–20% of cases. Prior studies have highlighted potential associations between antidepressant use, cholecystectomy, inpatient status, pseudomembranes, immunocompromised status, and FMT failure, but definitive risk factors for FMT failure remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of rCDI and identify factors that may contribute to FMT failure.

### International consensus conference on stool banking for faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice [^112QGUjP]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has a well-established role in the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).FMT working protocols have undergone considerable advancements in recent years, including the use of frozen faeces, capsulesand the release of guidelines to provide methodological guidance.

Despite these improvements, the dissemination of FMT has been limited owing to lack of dedicated centres, difficulties with donor recruitment, regulatory and safety concerns. Given the increasing burden of CDI, the provision of FMT should be widely and rapidly accessible. Moreover, as recently highlighted in a warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), FMT requires strict quality control to prevent harmful consequences.

Stool banks can provide reliable, timely and equitable access to FMT for CDI, and also facilitate a standardised, cost-effective and traceable workflow that ensures safety and quality of procedurescompared with single FMT centres. Stool banks are currently unevenly distributed and differ considerably in legislation, organisation and structure.

The aim of this consensus report is to provide guidance on the general organisation and the criteria required to establish a stool bank.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) indications, delivery, efficacy, and safety are as follows: In general, conventional antibiotic treatment should be used for at least 2 recurrences (ie, 3 CDI episodes) before offering fecal microbiota transplantation, and randomized, controlled trials have shown similar CDI cure rates after fecal transplants performed with fresh and frozen fecal samples. Although a number of methods of administration have been described, the most common transplant delivery route is via colonoscopy; however, oral capsules were found to be noninferior to colonoscopic delivery for preventing recurrent infection, and overall success rates for fecal transplantation, regardless of the delivery mode, are reported to be between 60% and 90% after a single treatment. A small, randomized, controlled trial compared primary fecal transplant (n = 9) with metronidazole therapy (n = 11) and suggested that transplant may be an alternative to antibiotics in this setting. There have been recent reports of fecal transplantation transmitting infectious agents, and prospective donors should be screened for colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms in addition to more typical infections; furthermore, in June 2019, in response to 2 fecal transplant-related deaths in immunosuppressed patients, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning detailing the importance of obtaining proper patient consent, including a discussion regarding risks related to the therapy.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation and microbial therapeutics for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection in pediatric patients [^1136vFEv]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and has high rates of recurrent disease. As a disease associated with intestinal dysbiosis, gastrointestinal microbiome manipulation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have evolved as effective, although relatively unregulated therapeutics and not without safety concerns. FMT for the treatment of CDI has been well studied in adults with increasing data reported in children. In this review, we discuss the current body of literature on the use of FMT in children including effectiveness, safety, risk factors for a failed FMT, and the role of FMT in children with comorbidities. We also review emerging microbial therapeutics for the treatment of rCDI.

### Cost-effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation for first recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^1169fosC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Both the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guidelines recommend fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for persons with multiple recurrent CDI. Emerging data suggest that FMT may have high cure rates when used for first recurrent CDI. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of FMT for first recurrent CDI.

Methods

We developed a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with initial CDI infection. The model estimated the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the 2021 IDSA guidelines, with the additional option of FMT for first recurrent CDI. The model includes stratification by the severity of initial infection, estimates of cure, recurrence, and mortality. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

Results

When FMT is available for first recurrent CDI, the optimal cost-effective treatment strategy is fidaxomicin for initial nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for initial severe CDI, and FMT for first and subsequent recurrent CDI, with an ICER of $27 135/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a $100 000 cost-effectiveness threshold, FMT for first and subsequent CDI recurrence was cost-effective 90% of the time given parameter uncertainty.

Conclusions

FMT is a cost-effective strategy for first recurrent CDI. Prospective evaluation of FMT for first recurrent CDI is warranted to determine the efficacy and risk of recurrence.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111fsiJW]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a successful therapeutic strategy for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Despite remarkable efficacy, implementation of FMT therapy is limited and the mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for the immune system in supporting FMT using a murine C. difficile infection system. Following FMT, Rag1 heterozygote mice resolve C. difficile while littermate Rag1 -/- mice fail to clear the infection. Targeted ablation of adaptive immune cell subsets reveal a necessary role for CD4 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells, but not B cells or CD8 + T cells, in FMT-mediated resolution of C. difficile infection. FMT non-responsive mice exhibit exacerbated inflammation, impaired engraftment of the FMT bacterial community and failed restoration of commensal bacteria-derived secondary bile acid metabolites in the large intestine. These data demonstrate that the host's inflammatory immune status can limit the efficacy of microbiota-based therapeutics to treat C. difficile infection.

### Gut microbiome and its clinical implications: exploring the key players in human health [^112VDbry]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The human gut harbors a diverse community of microorganisms known as the gut microbiota. Extensive research in recent years has shed light on the profound influence of the gut microbiome on human health and disease. This review aims to explore the role of the gut microbiome in various clinical conditions and highlight the emerging therapeutic potential of targeting the gut microbiota for disease management.

Recent Findings

Knowledge of the influence of gut microbiota on human physiology led to the development of various therapeutic possibilities such as fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), phage therapy, prebiotics, and probiotics. Recently, the U.S. FDA approved two FMT products for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection with ongoing research for the treatment of various disease conditions.

Summary

Advancement in the knowledge of the association between gut microbiota and various disease processes has paved the way for novel therapeutics.

Clostridioides difficile infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States, with potential life-threatening complications and a significant impact on the costs of care. Antibiotic stewardship as well as discontinuation of chronic acid suppressive therapy are key for its prevention and treatment. Effective infection management requires appropriate interpretation of diagnostic tests, as well as the use of vancomycin and fidaxomicin as first-line treatment. Novel treatments such as Bezlotoxumab, fecal microbiota transplant, and live biotherapeutic products are proven effective in recurrent C. difficile infection and address dysbiosis.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^111tksBd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – It is also being explored in the research setting for many other indications. However, there are a number of associated concerns regarding its use, including the unpleasant prospect of the procedure, the potential need for invasive administration, the small, but recognised risk of transmission of infection, and the complex regulation associated with its use. The COVID-19 pandemic and potential risk of viral transmission through donor stool samples has brought its limitations to the fore. As such, from a therapeutic perspective, understanding the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT may enable us to refine FMT from its current relatively crude state to a more refined 'microbiome therapeutic', which is no longer FMT, but could have a greater overall safety profile. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

Current indications for FMT

There has been a wealth of evidence demonstrating that FMT for CDI is effective for recurrent and refractory CDI, and the treatment has therefore been adopted in national and international guidelines. – A meta-analysis of all these studies highlights clinical resolution in 92% (95% CI 89–94%) of cases. The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders, but a report on these is beyond the scope of this review.

### An ecological framework to understand the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation [^1174FTNV]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Human gut microbiota plays critical roles in physiology and disease. Our understanding of ecological principles that govern the dynamics and resilience of this highly complex ecosystem remains rudimentary. This knowledge gap becomes more problematic as new approaches to modifying this ecosystem, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are being developed as therapeutic interventions. Here we present an ecological framework to understand the efficacy of FMT in treating conditions associated with a disrupted gut microbiota, using the recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection as a prototype disease. This framework predicts several key factors that determine the efficacy of FMT. Moreover, it offers an efficient algorithm for the rational design of personalized probiotic cocktails to decolonize pathogens. We analyze data from both preclinical mouse experiments and a clinical trial of FMT to validate our theoretical framework. The presented results significantly improve our understanding of the ecological principles of FMT and have a positive translational impact on the rational design of general microbiota-based therapeutics.

### Effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on recurrence in multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a randomized trial [^114vxJXQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To date, evidence for the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been limited to case series and open-label clinical trials.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI.

Design

Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494).

Setting

Two academic medical centers.

Patients

46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of CDI and received a full course of vancomycin for their most recent acute episode.

Intervention

Fecal microbiota transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient's own stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy.

Measurements

The primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for further anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data were compared between treatment groups via review of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for 6 months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on patients' stool before and after FMT and also on donors' stool.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients (90.9%) in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared with 15 of 24 (62.5%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042). Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6 of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients who developed recurrent CDI after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored gut bacterial community diversity and composition to resemble that of healthy donors.

Limitation

The study included only patients who had 3 or more recurrences and excluded those who were immunocompromised and aged 75 years or older.

Conclusion

Donor stool administered via colonoscopy seemed safe and was more efficacious than autologous FMT in preventing further CDI episodes.

### International consensus conference on stool banking for faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice [^111zZs1E]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Although faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has a well-established role in the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), its widespread dissemination is limited by several obstacles, including lack of dedicated centres, difficulties with donor recruitment and complexities related to regulation and safety monitoring. Given the considerable burden of CDI on global healthcare systems, FMT should be widely available to most centres. Stool banks may guarantee reliable, timely and equitable access to FMT for patients and a traceable workflow that ensures safety and quality of procedures. In this consensus project, FMT experts from Europe, North America and Australia gathered and released statements on the following issues related to the stool banking: general principles, objectives and organisation of the stool bank; selection and screening of donors; collection, preparation and storage of faeces; services and clients; registries, monitoring of outcomes and ethical issues; and the evolving role of FMT in clinical practice, Consensus on each statement was achieved through a Delphi process and then in a plenary face-to-face meeting. For each key issue, the best available evidence was assessed, with the aim of providing guidance for the development of stool banks in order to promote accessibility to FMT in clinical practice.

### Update on fecal microbiota transplantation 2015: indications, methodologies, mechanisms, and outlook [^113692P5]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The community of microorganisms within the human gut (or microbiota) is critical to health and functions with a level of complexity comparable to that of an organ system. Alterations of this ecology (or dysbiosis) have been implicated in a number of disease states, and the prototypical example is Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been demonstrated to durably alter the gut microbiota of the recipient and has shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with recurrent CDI. There is hope that FMT may eventually prove beneficial for the treatment of other diseases associated with alterations in gut microbiota, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic syndrome, to name a few. Although the basic principles that underlie the mechanisms by which FMT shows therapeutic efficacy in CDI are becoming apparent, further research is needed to understand the possible role of FMT in these other conditions. Although relatively simple to perform, questions regarding both short-term and long-term safety as well as the complex and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape has limited widespread use. Future work will focus on establishing best practices and more robust safety data than exist currently, as well as refining FMT beyond current "whole-stool" transplants to increase safety and tolerability. Encapsulated formulations, full-spectrum stool-based products, and defined microbial consortia are all in the immediate future.

### The use of faecal microbiota transplant as treatment for recurrent or refractoryinfection and other potential indications: second edition of joint British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and healthcare infection society (HIS) guidelines [^111HLJx8]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

The first British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and Healthcare Infection Society (HIS)-endorsed faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) guidelines were published in 2018. Over the past 5 years, there has been considerable growth in the evidence base (including publication of outcomes from large national FMT registries), necessitating an updated critical review of the literature and a second edition of the BSG/HIS FMT guidelines. These have been produced in accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence-accredited methodology, thus have particular relevance for UK-based clinicians, but are intended to be of pertinence internationally. This second edition of the guidelines have been divided into recommendations, good practice points and recommendations against certain practices. With respect to FMT for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), key focus areas centred around timing of administration, increasing clinical experience of encapsulated FMT preparations and optimising donor screening. The latter topic is of particular relevance given the COVID-19 pandemic, and cases of patient morbidity and mortality resulting from FMT-related pathogen transmission. The guidelines also considered emergent literature on the use of FMT in non-CDI settings (including both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal indications), reviewing relevant randomised controlled trials. Recommendations are provided regarding special areas (including compassionate FMT use), and considerations regarding the evolving landscape of FMT and microbiome therapeutics.

### Predictors of fecal microbiota transplant failure in Clostridioides difficile infection: an updated meta-analysis [^114PbBe2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Aim

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) with a 10% to 20% risk of recurrence after a single FMT. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the predictors of FMT failure.

Methods

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases through July 2021 was performed. All studies that evaluated risk factors associated with FMT failure in a multivariate model were included. We calculated pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for risk factors reported in ≥ 3 studies using a random-effects model.

Results

Twenty studies involving 4327 patients (63.6% females) with recurrent/refractory CDI who underwent FMT were included. FMT failed in 705 patients (16.3%) with 2 to 3 months of follow-up in most studies. A total of 12 different risk factors were reported in a multivariate model in ≥ 3 studies. Meta-analysis showed that advanced age, severe CDI, inflammatory bowel disease, peri-FMT use of non-CDI antibiotics, prior CDI-related hospitalizations, inpatient status, and poor quality of bowel preparation were significant predictors of FMT failure. Charlson Comorbidity Index, female gender, immunosuppressed status, patient-directed donor, and number of CDI recurrences were not associated with FMT failure.

Conclusions

Adequate bowel preparation at the time of FMT and optimizing antibiotic stewardship practices in the peri-FMT period can improve the success of FMT. Patients with nonmodifiable risk factors should be counseled about the risk of FMT failure. Our results may help develop a risk stratification model to predict FMT failure in CDI patients.

### Oral fecal microbiota transplant capsules are safe and effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yViAA]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Goals

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis to examine the efficacy and safety of oral fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI).

Background

FMT through colonoscopy is established as effective and safe in treating multiple recurrences of CDI, but consensus has not been established on delivery through oral capsules.

Study

A systematic literature search was performed with multiple databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify original studies including at least 10 patients that investigated the role of oral FMT capsules to treat rCDI. Cure rates were pooled by a random effects model and publication bias was assessed with the Egger test. Secondary analyses assessed for differences between capsule preparation (frozen vs. lyophilized stool) and delivery modality (capsule vs. colonoscopy).

Results

Fifteen studies (12 case series and 3 randomized controlled trials) encompassing 763 patients were identified for inclusion. Significant variability existed in baseline patient characteristics and protocols. Meta-analysis of proportions showed efficacy of oral FMT capsules to be 0.821 (95% confidence interval: 0.762–0.874). No evidence for publication bias was found (P = 0.51). Secondary analyses did not find significant differences in efficacy. Fourteen adverse events leading to death or hospitalization were noted, none of which were attributed to FMT.

Conclusions

Oral FMT capsules for rCDI are promising because of ease of administration and noninvasive delivery. We found an overall efficacy of 82.1% with a low rate of serious adverse events. Further studies are needed to optimize protocols and outcomes.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent, safety, and pitfalls [^115FxaX3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as an urgent public health threat by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contributing to 223,900 hospitalizations, 12,800 associated deaths in the United States, and approximately US$1 billion in attributable health care cost in 2017. A population-based surveillance study conducted by CDC emerging infection program in 10 sites within United States from 2011 to 2017 reported a 24% decrease in hospital onset C. difficile but found no decrease in community onset or first recurrence of C. difficile.

Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is defined as CDI that relapses after initial successful treatment; rCDI is associated with an annual cost of approximately US$2.8billion. Nearly, one in six patients with CDI will experience recurrent infection in the following 2 to 8 weeks. Patients with rCDI often experience additional recurrences, with reports estimating that 50–65% of patients have at least two or more incidence of rCDI. Increased incidence of rCDI was noted from 2001 to 2012; 1.07 to 3.09 cases per 100,000 person-years. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) poses a significant treatment challenge, given it is difficult to eradicate and often require escalation in treatment.

### Resolution rates in clinical trials for microbiota restoration for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jonvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States with over 50% of patients developing recurrences after two or more episodes. Microbiota replacement therapy (MRT) is used to treat recurrent CDI by restoring a healthy gut microbiome. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommend MRT after appropriate antibiotic treatment after two or more CDI recurrences in patients who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments.

The efficacy of MRT for recurrent CDI in observational studies is more than 85% but efficacy in controlled clinical trials appears to be lower. Our 2017 meta-analysis showed an overall cure rate of 76% in clinical trial settings with efficacy being lower (67%) in trials with a comparator group compared to open-label trials. Most trials included in that meta-analysis had different methodologies including recurrent CDI diagnostic and inclusion criteria, MRT preparations, and comparator group leading to a significant heterogeneity. These inconsistencies have resulted in limiting the generalizability of these results and pose a caution in positioning MRT as a therapy for CDI.

Since the earlier systematic review and meta-analysis, more evidence from trials regarding use of MRT has emerged. These have included phase III trials of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and standardized live biotherapeutics for recurrent CDI. We performed an updated meta-analysis with the latest evidence to reassess the efficacy of microbiota restoration in clinical trials.

### European consensus conference on faecal microbiota transplantation in clinical practice [^113TsaAe]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consists of the infusion of faeces from a healthy donor to the GI tract of a recipient patient, in order to treat a specific disease associated with alteration of gut microbiota. A large body of evidence, including randomised controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses, proved clear evidence that FMT is a highly effective treatment against recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI). Due to the rising prevalence, severity and mortality of this infection, the therapeutic role played by FMT is therefore important to save human lives and to decrease the economic burden on healthcare systems. Based on these data, both the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Disease and the American College of Gastroenterology recommend FMT as a treatment for rCDI.

Beyond the treatment of CDI, FMT has also been investigated in other disorders associated with the alteration of gut microbiota. In particular, studies in humans include RCTs in patients with UC and metabolic syndrome (MS).

The global interest in FMT is increasing, and both doctors and patients are increasingly aware and informed. Although the dissemination of FMT in the clinical practice is restricted by regulatory and bureaucratic issues (principally related to costs, donor programme, safety control), the FMT practice is booming, ranging from highly organised stool banking programmes to individual treatments with patient-identified directed donors, and even to individual and harmful do-it-yourself practices. Working groups (WGs) from the United States, Austria and France released recommendations on indications and methods of FMT. Authoritative published guidelines and recommendations have been released as expert opinions rather than evidence-based consensus reports. A rigorous and formal evidence-based process to drive the wide range of FMT practice has not been performed yet.

The aim of this evidence-based consensus report is to define indications and methodology for the use of FMT in the treatment of CDI, to discuss the suitability of FMT for indications other than CDI and to address the minimum requirements needed to implement a FMT centre. The final aim is to encourage and drive the dissemination of the procedure and to promote further clinical research in the area.

### Clostridioides difficile: treating sustained antibiotic responders with fecal microbiota transplantation does not improve efficacy [^1168LyNy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

In short, the trial population does not reflect most patients with rCDI. The study investigates the use of FMT in the small subset of patients with a sustained response to antibiotics — a response that clinicians have no chance of reliably predicting. We find the trial incomparable to previous randomized controlled trials and literature that included all patients regardless of antibiotic response. Clinical decisions to minimize recurrence risk should necessarily be made during and not after acute antibiotics therapy. Given the severity of rCDI, this includes considering timely FMT as an exit strategy. The present study should not change clinical guidelines as the existing literature establishes FMT as the most effective treatment of rCDI.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on fecal microbiota-based therapies for select gastrointestinal diseases [^117SC6V2]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Fecal microbiota-based therapies include conventional fecal microbiota transplant and US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies, fecal microbiota live-jslm and fecal microbiota spores live-brpk. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) developed this guideline to provide recommendations on the use of fecal microbiota-based therapies in adults with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection; severe to fulminant C difficile infection; inflammatory bowel diseases, including pouchitis; and irritable bowel syndrome.

Methods

The guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, and conduct an evidence synthesis. The guideline panel used the Evidence-to-Decision framework to develop recommendations for the use of fecal microbiota-based therapies in the specified gastrointestinal conditions and provided implementation considerations for clinical practice.

Results

The guideline panel made 7 recommendations. In immunocompetent adults with recurrent C difficile infection, the AGA suggests select use of fecal microbiota-based therapies on completion of standard of care antibiotics to prevent recurrence. In mildly or moderately immunocompromised adults with recurrent C difficile infection, the AGA suggests select use of conventional fecal microbiota transplant. In severely immunocompromised adults, the AGA suggests against the use of any fecal microbiota-based therapies to prevent recurrent C difficile. In adults hospitalized with severe or fulminant C difficile not responding to standard of care antibiotics, the AGA suggests select use of conventional fecal microbiota transplant. The AGA suggests against the use of conventional fecal microbiota transplant as treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases or irritable bowel syndrome, except in the context of clinical trials.

Conclusions

Fecal microbiota-based therapies are effective therapy to prevent recurrent C difficile in select patients. Conventional fecal microbiota transplant is an adjuvant treatment for select adults hospitalized with severe or fulminant C difficile infection not responding to standard of care antibiotics. Fecal microbiota transplant cannot yet be recommended in other gastrointestinal conditions.

### Therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota: past, present, and considerations for the future [^111a2wsm]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The growing appreciation of the potential role of indigenous microbiota in disease has resulted in a concomitant interest in manipulating the microbiome for therapeutic effect. The most successful example of microbiota manipulation for treatment of a disease is in recurrent infection with the bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficile.

Aims

This review provides historic perspectives on development of microbiota transplantation and reviews evidence for its use in recurrent C. difficile infection.

Sources

A PubMed search of the terms ([fecal transplant OR fecal transplantation] AND difficile) to 9 June 2016 yielded 415 articles.

Content

Recent work has pointed to potential mechanisms by which microbiota restoration in the form of faecal transplantation has been efficacious. This includes studies of microorganisms associated with successful faecal transplantation in human and animal studies and a focus on bacterial bile acid metabolism as a mechanism that mediates colonization resistance against the pathogen. The potential use of microbiota manipulation for other diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic disorders will be discussed. The case will be made that the lessons learned from treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection may not necessarily translate to use of faecal transplantation or other methods to alter the microbiome for the treatment of other diseases.

Implications

A key conclusion that can be drawn is that understanding of the precise role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of a specific disease is necessary prior to determining if microbiota manipulation represents a novel treatment therapy.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: a new old kid on the block for the management of gut microbiota-related disease [^116Eeeje]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Gut microbiota is deeply involved in the regulation of both health and disease within our body. The restoration of a healthy gut microbiota is, therefore, a main clinical target in the management of diseases associated with its disruption. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an old therapy that has recently been rediscovered, having proved a clear efficacy against recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. By restoring the altered gut microbiota in a substantial and durable manner, FMT is considered a cutting-edge promising option for the treatment of disease that recognize the alteration of the gut microbiota as having a pathogenic role. FMT has shown interesting (even if uncertain) results in diseases such as metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel diseases. Moreover, the definition of a standard procedural protocol for each specific disease, as well as exhaustive studies about the relationship between donor's microbiota composition and clinical results, will certainly improve the therapeutic potential of FMT. Both the application of cutting-edge technologies for the assessment of gut microbiota composition (such as metagenomics) and the development of well-designed, large randomized trials are needed to put such perspectives into practice.

### The first international Rome consensus conference on gut microbiota and faecal microbiota transplantation in inflammatory bowel disease [^114mNZn5]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is defined as the infusion of faeces from healthy donors into the gastrointestinal tract of recipients to treat disease-associated gut dysbiosis. It is an established and highly effective treatment option for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, as reported by several randomised controlled trials (RCTs)and meta-analyses, which has culminated in the establishment of international guidelines to standardise its use as a viable therapeutic modality for C. difficile infection.

Following its success for the treatment of C. difficile infection, FMT has also been investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), first in non-randomised studies, and subsequently, in RCTs, both showing promising results, although with significant differences in FMT protocols and procedures. In fact, the adoption of FMT for the treatment of IBD is compromised by several limitations, including recruitment of donors, preparation of faecal material, determining the optimal route of administration and lack of a clear and established regulatory framework. Potential strategies to deal with these problems include the identification and use of sustainable, reproducible and standardised protocols, with the ultimate goal of altering gut microbiome composition. Consequently, establishing an optimal FMT framework is important for the future management of IBD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide consensus-based statements and recommendations regarding the general organisation and criteria required to promote FMT as a recognised strategy for the treatment of IBD.

### Gut microbiome andinfection: a closer look at the microscopic interface [^113iKF49]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) was recognized with its link to the use of antimicrobials. Antimicrobials significantly alter gut microbiota structure and composition, which led to the discovery of the association of this gut perturbation with the development of CDI. A number of factors implicated in its pathogenesis, such as advancing age, proton-pump inhibitors, and gastrointestinal diseases, are linked to gut microbiota perturbations. In an effort to better understand CDI, a multitude of studies have tried to ascertain protective and predictive microbial footprints linked with CDI. It has further been realized that CDI in itself can alter the gut microbiome. Its spore-forming capability poses as an impediment in the management of the infection and contributes to its recurrence. Antibiotic therapies used for its management have also been linked to gut microbiota changes, making its treatment a little more challenging. In an effort to exploit and utilize this association, gut microbial restoration therapies, particularly in the form of fecal microbial transplant, are increasingly being put to use and are proving to be beneficial. In this review, we summarize the association of the gut microbiome and microbial perturbation with initial and recurrent CDI.

### Fecal microbial transplantation for diseases beyond recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^116hpVoQ]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

As microbiome research has moved from associative to mechanistic studies, the activities of specific microbes and their products have been investigated in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Findings from microbiome research have already been applied to the clinic, such as in fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. We review the evidence for associations between alterations in the intestinal microbiome and gastrointestinal diseases and findings from clinical trials of fecal microbiota transplantation. We discuss opportunities for treatment of other diseases with fecal microbiota transplantation, based on findings from small clinical and preclinical studies.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aSGJN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary challenge faced by our review was the determination of SAE causality. The process for determining whether or not to attribute an adverse event to FMT was based on each study's own standards. An area that highlights this difficulty is the unclear causality of inflammatory bowel disease flares and FMT. While some studies listed this as a sequela of FMT, others ruled it to be unrelated. An additional challenge was the mild inconsistency in several of the measured outcomes. This can probably be attributed to the heterogeneous patient populations and study protocols. Similarly, the average duration of follow up varied widely, as did symptom reporting. Missing data on demographics, method of stool transplantation, volume and amount of stool, and relationships of donor and recipients were also common.

This study, despite its limitations, demonstrated that FMT is a largely safe procedure. As the understanding of the effects of the fecal microbiome expands, causal relationships with new adverse events and long-term sequelae of FMT may continue to be discovered. Nevertheless, our current knowledge of both related and unrelated SAEs indicates that FMT should be a therapy strongly considered for patients with recurrent CDI.

This meta-analysis supports FMT as a safe option for treating recurrent CDI. While the short-term safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for treating recurrent CDI is promising from our meta-analysis, the potential long-term consequences of altering a patient's gut microbiota are not fully known. Future randomized trials are needed to improve our current understanding of FMT safety and further clarify the improvements in the quality of life of patients treated with FMT compared to standard antibiotic therapy.

Summary Box

What is already known:

● Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly efficacious procedure used in the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection
● A residual concern in the integration of FMT is concerns about the safety of the procedure
● Published studies have struggled with heterogeneous protocols that display various durations of follow up

What the new findings are:

● Our analysis shows a very low pooled rate of significant adverse events related to FMT, in total less than 1%, despite a significant portion of patients being immunocompromised or having underlying gastrointestinal conditions
● The pooled rate of minor adverse events was also relatively rare, and were most commonly diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting
● Further high-quality randomized control trials are necessary to evaluate the longer-term safety of FMT and its impact on quality of life

Prevention of CDI recurrence with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) — indications, delivery, and efficacy: We recommend for patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) or capsules (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) for treatment of rCDI; delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Most studies of rCDI have defined eligibility as 3 or more confirmed episodes, and the first randomized controlled trial reported cure with nasoduodenal FMT after vancomycin of 81% vs 31% with standard‑of‑care vancomycin.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^11593NNZ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

FMT mediated clearance of C. difficile infection resolves intestinal inflammation

Fecal microbiota transplantation is a proven treatment for recurrent C. difficile disease, however, whether the host's immune system contributes to FMT-mediated resolution of C. difficile is unknown. To address this question, we first established a murine model of C. difficile infection followed by FMT treatment (Fig. 1a). Similar to previous reports in both mice and humans, FMT reduced C. difficile burden and toxin levels in the large intestine of persistently infected C57BL/6 mice to below the limit of detection while sham PBS treatment did not impact C. difficile burden (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). By day 10 post-FMT, recipient mice had resolved C. difficile infection-driven intestinal inflammation characterized by immune cell infiltration, submucosa edema (Supplementary Fig. 1C), large intestine crypt elongation (Supplementary Fig. 1D), and elevated mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes in the proximal colon (Supplementary Fig. 1E). These data establish that FMT can indirectly shape intestinal immune homeostasis via resolution C. difficile infection and provoke further investigation into the role of the immune system in supporting FMT-mediated C. difficile resolution.

### Validation of clinical risk tools for recurrentinfection [^115qttcX]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is a Gram positive, spore forming, toxin producing bacterium which can colonize and infect the human intestinal track causing a robust immune response. Unlike most other infectious diseases, C. difficile infection (CDI) tends to relapse and re-infect despite antibiotic treatment and remission of symptoms. C. difficile spores are capable of surviving treatment, resulting in persistent carriage, serving as a nidus for recurrent infection. Most recurrent CDI episodes occur within 2–8 weeks of the initial infection and are due to the previous strain. Newer anti-CDI therapies (ie, fidaxomicin, bezlotoxumab, and fecal microbiota transplant) effectively prevent recurrent CDI and as of April 2023, the first orally administered fecal microbiota product was approved for the prevention of recurrent CDI by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, newer therapies to prevent recurrent CDI have historically been underutilized, despite adoption by recent CDI consensus guidelines. This is likely due to two major issues with CDI treatments: first, these treatments have a high cost and logistical challenges, limiting their use to patients believed to be most at risk of recurrence; second, determining which patients are likely to recur is difficult without a widely accepted risk prediction model for recurrent C. difficile infection.

Several published outcome models (Table 1) for risk stratifying patients with CDI for developing future recurrent infection have been developed retrospectively or by using previous clinical trial data. Few recurrent CDI models have been externally validated and limited evidence suggest that they generalize poorly between centers. In addition, recently updated clinical management guidelines for C. difficile infection mention specific risk factors for recurrence, however, the performance of these features together as a risk stratification tool has not been externally evaluated. We were also interested in comparing C. difficile PCR cycle threshold (as an inverse measure of fecal organism burden), which we recently showed may be a potentially useful biomarker for recurrent infectionalongside existing clinical models. Here, we validate and compare the relative performance of the leading recurrence risk models available for hospitalized cases of C. difficile infection.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^112L9jjm]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile is the most important infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide and a leading cause of healthcare-associated infection in the United States. The incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) in children has increased, with 20 000 cases now reported annually, also posing indirect educational and economic consequences. In contrast to infection in adults, CDI in children is more frequently community-associated, accounting for three-quarters of all cases. A wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from asymptomatic carriage to severe diarrhea can occur, varying by age. Fulminant disease, although rare in children, is associated with high morbidity and even fatality. Diagnosis of CDI can be challenging as currently available tests detect either the presence of organism or disease-causing toxin but cannot distinguish colonization from infection. Since colonization can be high in specific pediatric groups, such as infants and young children, biomarkers to aid in accurate diagnosis are urgently needed. Similar to disease in adults, recurrence of CDI in children is common, affecting 20% to 30% of incident cases. Metronidazole has long been considered the mainstay therapy for CDI in children. However, new evidence supports the safety and efficacy of oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin as additional treatment options, whereas fecal microbiota transplantation is gaining popularity for recurrent infection. Recent advancements in our understanding of emerging epidemiologic trends and management of CDI unique to children are highlighted in this review. Despite encouraging therapeutic advancements, there remains a pressing need to optimize CDI therapy in children, particularly as it pertains to severe and recurrent disease.
