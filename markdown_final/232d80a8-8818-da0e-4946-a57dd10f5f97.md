## Question

Lower right back pain that hurts more after sitting for a long time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lower right back pain that worsens with prolonged sitting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely etiologies given the pain location and sitting provocation. Then, I should verify red flags and when imaging is warranted. Next, I will outline a focused history and examination strategy to narrow the differential. After that, I will consider targeted diagnostic tests and imaging indications. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline evidence-based management pathways, including activity modification, physical therapy, and when to refer for interventional or surgical options.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical clues embedded in the presentation: lower right back pain that intensifies with prolonged sitting suggests a mechanical, load-dependent pain generator in the lumbosacral region, with sitting intolerance as a hallmark feature of several conditions, including lumbar discogenic pain and piriformis-related syndromes, and potentially facet-mediated pain or sacroiliac involvement, so I should keep these high on the list while I verify red flags and neurologic status before committing to a label [^496a900d] [^41e16a2b] [^df2d0935].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags and imaging threshold before diving into specifics. In the absence of fever, weight loss, history of cancer, progressive neurologic deficits, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or trauma, routine imaging is not indicated for acute or subacute non-specific low back pain, and I should avoid premature imaging that could drive unnecessary care. I need to ensure I screen for these at the outset and document a baseline neurologic exam [^c6996f6a] [^66efb170] [^ab447dc9].

> I will now examine the most likely diagnosis: lumbar discogenic pain. The DISCS cluster fits this case well: chronic axial midline pain, worse with flexion, sitting intolerance often under 30 minutes, reproduction with sustained hip flexion, and no motor or sensory deficits. I should confirm these elements on history and exam and note that discogenic pain can refer to the buttock or posterior thigh without true radiculopathy, which aligns with "lower right back" localization [^496a900d] [^70851a6d] [^d5f406ad].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Piriformis syndrome remains a strong alternative, especially with buttock-dominant pain and sitting provocation. I should palpate the piriformis and perform FADIR to reproduce symptoms, and I need to remember that piriformis syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and can mimic radicular pain without frank neurologic deficits, so I should double-check for competing causes before anchoring on it [^41e16a2b] [^c00174fc].

> Next, I should review facet joint–mediated pain as a contender. Facet pain is often worse with extension and rotation, can be provoked by palpation over the facet line, and may refer to the buttock or posterior thigh in pseudo-radicular patterns. However, I need to be cautious because facet syndrome lacks definitive bedside tests and is frequently a clinical inference after excluding other sources, so I should use this as a secondary hypothesis pending response to targeted interventions [^df2d0935].

> Let me consider sacroiliac joint dysfunction as well, particularly if pain is localized near the PSIS and worsens with transitional movements or single-leg stance. I should confirm with provocation tests such as FABER, Gaenslen, and compression/distraction, recognizing that no single test is pathognomonic and that a cluster improves diagnostic confidence [^notfound].

> I need to check for less common but important mimics that can present with sitting intolerance and lateralizing features. Tarlov cysts can cause severe sitting intolerance and Valsalva-provoked pain, and superior cluneal neuralgia can produce focal lower back or upper buttock pain with sitting provocation. If suspected, targeted diagnostic blocks can help confirm these entities, but I should reserve them for refractory or atypical cases after standard mechanical causes are excluded [^4fcda5fb] [^15b4602c].

> Now, I should confirm the focused history elements I must capture: exact pain location and radiation, sitting tolerance duration, flexion versus extension provocation, Valsalva or cough aggravation, morning stiffness, trauma or lifting history, weight change, fever, bowel or bladder changes, and psychosocial factors such as fear-avoidance or sleep disturbance. I also need to document occupational and recreational exposures, including prolonged sitting, driving, and ergonomic setup, because these shape both diagnosis and management [^ab447dc9] [^62e1543a].

> Next, I should review the physical examination sequence. I will inspect posture and pelvic alignment, perform a neurologic screen including strength, sensation, reflexes, and dermatomal mapping, then use mechanical loading tests such as repeated flexion or extension in standing to look for centralization or peripheralization, and incorporate nerve tension tests such as straight leg raise and slump if radicular symptoms are suspected. I will also palpate the piriformis, facet joints, PSIS, and greater trochanter to localize pain generators and consider provocation maneuvers for SIJ and facet pain [^56d7c196] [^21684e08] [^df2d0935].

> Hold on, I should verify when imaging is actually indicated. If there are red flags, progressive neurologic deficits, or failure of 6 weeks of conservative care, then MRI is appropriate to evaluate for disc herniation, stenosis, or other structural lesions. Otherwise, routine imaging in non-specific low back pain does not improve outcomes and may provoke unnecessary interventions, so I need to ensure I apply this judiciously and document the rationale if I deviate [^c6996f6a] [^66efb170] [^ab447dc9].

> Let me synthesize the differential diagnosis now. Primary: lumbar discogenic pain given axial midline pain, sitting intolerance, and flexion provocation. Secondary: piriformis syndrome given buttock pain and sitting aggravation. Tertiary: facet joint syndrome or sacroiliac joint dysfunction based on mechanical provocation patterns. I should also keep tarlov cysts and superior cluneal neuralgia in reserve if the presentation is atypical or refractory to standard care [^496a900d] [^41e16a2b] [^df2d0935] [^4fcda5fb] [^15b4602c].

> I will now outline management for discogenic pain, but wait, I should confirm that I am aligning with stepped, guideline-concordant care. Education and reassurance are foundational, with emphasis on avoiding prolonged sitting, using a sit-stand workstation, and maintaining lumbar lordosis. I should prescribe a directional preference–based exercise program emphasizing lumbar extension, progress to core stabilization, and consider manual therapy for symptom modulation. If pain persists beyond 3 months, I should reassess and consider referral for interventional options such as epidural steroid injection or intradiscal therapies in carefully selected patients [^ab447dc9] [^56d7c196] [^70851a6d].

> For suspected piriformis syndrome, I should double-check that I am prioritizing conservative care. Stretching and myofascial release of the piriformis, hip abductor strengthening, and activity modification to reduce sitting on hard surfaces are first-line. If symptoms persist, diagnostic ultrasound-guided piriformis injection can both confirm the diagnosis and provide therapeutic benefit, reserving surgery for refractory cases after exhaustive conservative management [^c00174fc] [^41e16a2b].

> For facet-mediated pain, I should confirm that a trial of extension-biased movement and manual therapy is reasonable, and if diagnostic medial branch blocks provide significant but transient relief, radiofrequency ablation can be considered in appropriately selected patients. I need to ensure that I do not over-attribute pain to facets in the absence of a positive response to targeted blocks [^df2d0935].

> But wait, what if the pain is actually referred from the hip or viscera. I should screen the hip for osteoarthritis or greater trochanteric pain syndrome when lateral hip pain coexists, and I should keep appendicitis or retroperitoneal processes in mind if the pain is right lower quadrant with systemic features. If the story deviates from a mechanical pattern or red flags emerge, I need to pivot and pursue the appropriate organ-system workup [^03b36fa4] [^f2742861].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and prognosis are addressed. Most cases of non-specific low back pain improve substantially within 6 weeks, but recurrence is common, so I should set expectations, reinforce self-management, and schedule reassessment at 2 to 6 weeks to track function, pain, and psychosocial drivers. If there is no improvement by 6 to 12 weeks or new neurologic features arise, I should escalate to imaging and specialty referral [^ab447dc9] [^62e1543a].

Lower right back pain that worsens with prolonged sitting is most often due to **mechanical strain** from poor posture, weak core muscles, or degenerative disc changes [^notfound] [^notfound]. Less commonly, it reflects **nerve compression** (radiculopathy or piriformis syndrome) [^41e16a2b] or facet joint arthritis [^df2d0935]. Red flags (fever, weight loss, bowel/bladder changes, or progressive weakness) require **urgent evaluation** [^c6996f6a]. Management is **conservative**: activity modification, ergonomic adjustments, core strengthening, and NSAIDs; imaging is reserved for persistent or severe cases with red flags [^c6996f6a] [^ab447dc9].

## Common causes of lower right back pain exacerbated by sitting

Several **mechanical and structural factors** can contribute to lower right back pain that intensifies with prolonged sitting:

- **Mechanical strain**: Poor posture, prolonged sitting, and weak core muscles can cause mechanical strain on the lumbar spine, leading to pain localized to the lower right back [^693fe608] [^a6956c21].

- **Degenerative disc disease**: Age-related degeneration of the intervertebral discs can cause pain that worsens with sitting due to increased pressure on the discs [^notfound].

- **Facet joint arthritis**: Degeneration of the facet joints can cause localized lower back pain, often exacerbated by prolonged sitting or spinal extension [^df2d0935].

- **Piriformis syndrome**: Compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle can cause buttock pain radiating to the lower back, worsened by sitting [^41e16a2b].

- **Lumbar radiculopathy**: Nerve root compression from herniated discs or spinal stenosis can cause radiating pain from the lower back to the leg, often aggravated by sitting [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to identify the underlying cause of lower right back pain:

- **History**: Detailed assessment of pain characteristics, duration, aggravating and relieving factors, occupational and lifestyle factors, and associated symptoms (e.g. radiating leg pain, numbness, weakness) [^d19de637].

- **Physical examination**: Inspection of posture, palpation of the spine and paraspinal muscles, range of motion assessment, neurological examination, and specific tests (e.g. straight leg raise, slump test) to identify nerve involvement [^21684e08].

- **Imaging**: Routine imaging is not recommended for acute non-specific low back pain without red flags. MRI or CT may be considered if symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks, worsen, or if neurological deficits are present [^c6996f6a] [^66efb170].

---

## Management strategies

Management of lower right back pain exacerbated by sitting typically involves **conservative measures**:

- **Activity modification**: Avoid prolonged sitting, use ergonomic chairs, and take frequent breaks to stand and stretch [^fe6f3d77].

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening exercises, posture training, and stretching to improve spinal stability and flexibility [^693fe608].

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen for pain relief [^ab447dc9].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, regular exercise, and smoking cessation to reduce risk factors [^62e1543a].

- **Interventional procedures**: Epidural steroid injections or facet joint injections may be considered for persistent pain refractory to conservative treatment [^8dc9ac7b].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical evaluation is recommended if any of the following **red flags** are present:

- **Persistent pain**: Lasting longer than 6 weeks despite conservative treatment [^c6996f6a].

- **Neurological deficits**: Weakness, numbness, or tingling in the legs [^7cccda0c].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, or night pain [^c6996f6a].

- **Bowel or bladder dysfunction**: Loss of control or retention [^c6996f6a].

---

Lower right back pain that worsens with prolonged sitting is commonly due to mechanical strain, degenerative disc disease, facet joint arthritis, piriformis syndrome, or lumbar radiculopathy. A thorough clinical evaluation and conservative management are typically effective, with imaging and interventional procedures reserved for persistent or severe cases.

### Low back pain [^693fe608]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — prevalence, risk factors, and physical therapy treatments are described, noting that 8 of 10 people experience it at some time in their lives and that pain is usually felt in the lower back and buttocks with possible leg pain and numbness and tingling in the toes; lifestyle risks include sitting too much, being in poor physical condition, and bending and lifting improperly, and stress and lack of sleep can make the pain worse. Evidence suggests that early treatment for low back pain is helpful in decreasing the chance that your pain will become chronic. Not all low back pain should be treated the same, and a physical therapist can help determine if you will respond better to manipulation or to exercises to improve mobility and/or strengthen your back muscles. New clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of low back pain were published in the April 2012 issue of JOSPT, describing ways to treat back pain based on best research evidence.

### The 'goldilocks principle': designing physical activity at work to be' just right' for promoting health [^820e7800]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

How much is just right?

Designing work that is physically health promoting is an issue for both blue and white-collar workers. Many workplaces have seen a development towards too much sitting. In response, many organisations now promote standing to reduce time in sitting. This is historically interesting as only a few decades ago, occupational interventions and policy were aimed at reducing and breaking up standing by introducing more sitting. This example illustrates the need for a Goldilocks approach — designing work that has the 'just right' amount of different aspects of physical activity — for example, the right amount of sitting, standing and moving — arranged in a suitable time pattern.

Cleaners, in contrast, have long continuous periods of physical activity at low metabolic intensity, causing fatigue without promoting cardiorespiratory fitness. To have a health promotion effect, cleaning work could be designed to have higher intensity bursts separated by tasks offering recovery. Like planning an exercise programme for different athletes from different sports, so too designing health-promoting work should take account of individual worker capacities, work requirements and constraints, as well as non-work activities. Thus, work should be designed with consideration to workers' whole-of-life 24/7/52 physical activity.

Our reason for focusing on physical activity at work is that it has a huge reach and potential for good. One-third of workers report high physical activity at work. However, these physically active workers have poorer health, not better health than workers without high physical activity at work. For example, male workers who often perform strenuous tasks have an 80% increased risk of ischaemic heart disease mortality compared with workers who seldom/never perform strenuous work tasks (even after adjusting for a range of potential confounders). Likewise, a high occupational physical workload is related to an increased risk of back pain. The physical activity in their work is not 'just right' and this exacerbates the socioeconomic health gap. Designing work to be physically beneficial could reach all workers — including the lower socioeconomic group (with its attendant multiple health risks and its traditional lack of response to public health leisure activity campaigns).

Low back pain — work activities and initial restrictions are outlined for acute, severe LBP with or without radicular symptoms: No lifting over 10 pounds; No prolonged or frequent bending (flexion); Alternate sitting and standing as needed. Activity guidance is iterative, as activity guidelines are generally reassessed every week in the acute phase with gradual increases in activity recommended, and the patient's activity level should be kept at maximum levels and gradually advanced. Written work activity limitations are advised to communicate status and expectations at work and at home.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^d5f406ad]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Fifth, the foregoing conditions should exist in the absence of motor/sensory/reflex changes. The patient should exhibit a normal lower extremity neurologic exam without marked motor weakness or other deficits. Dermatomal radiation and other neurologic symptoms such as motor weakness and numbness are absent with discogenic pain.

Patients demonstrating the foregoing constellation of signs and symptoms for greater than six months can be classified diagnostically as exhibiting lumbar discogenic pain (Figure 1, Box 2). We provide the following acronym, DISCS, as a helpful cue in the initial assessment of the back pain patient:

D - Duration of symptoms: Chronic pain persisting for more than six months.

I - Increased pain with flexion: Pain is aggravated with forward flexion due to annular strain.

S - Sitting intolerance: The patient shows limited sitting tolerance, typically less than 30 minutes.

C - Central back pain: Axial midline pain without radicular symptoms.

S - Sustained hip flexion test: Pain is reproduced with sustained hip flexion in the supine position, distinguishing discogenic pain.

### "Sit up straight": time to Re-evaluate [^ec8a4b38]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Posture is a frequent topic of discussion for patients, clinicians, the media, and society. A common belief is that spinal pain is caused by sitting, standing, or bending "incorrectly". Despite the absence of strong evidence to support these common beliefs, a large posture industry has flourished, with many interventions and products claiming to "correct" posture and prevent pain. Unfortunately, many health care professionals provide advice in line with this non-evidence-based perspective. In this Viewpoint, the authors reflect on common beliefs regarding posture and spinal health and why they are so widely held, and consider how clinicians can positively influence these beliefs.

### Standing in the shadows: is standing a tonic or a toxin for cardiometabolic health? [^acd8ce4b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Defining research hypotheses on standing

For future research to produce clinically relevant answers, we propose the following priority hypotheses on standing being health detrimental (toxin) or health promoting (tonic). Each of the hypotheses lends itself to feasible research questions, whose answers may have significant consequences on the long-term health of the hundreds of millions of people (including workers) who stand a lot and the interventions aimed at countering the adverse effects of excessive sitting by replacing it withstanding.

Higher daily energy expenditure than sitting (tonic — metabolic mechanism): Standing contributes to higher daily energy expenditure compared with sitting, having beneficial effects on maintaining a healthy body weight and long-term cardiometabolic health.
Venous stasis (toxin — orthostatic mechanism): The gravitational pull and the absence of dynamic contractions during prolonged standing may lead to blood pooling in leg veins (venous stasis). Over time, this could manifest as varicose veins and possibly contribute to deep vein thrombosis, posing a potential risk to cardiometabolic health.
Glucose and lipid metabolism (tonic — metabolic mechanism): The transition from sitting to a standing posture and less so the maintenance of standing posture, involves activation of large leg muscles, which can improve lipid and glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and endothelial function and thus promote cardiometabolic health.
Increased heart rate and blood pressure (toxin — orthostatic mechanism): The heightened workload of the heart during standing, pumping against gravity, may result in elevated 24-hour heart rate and cardiac output. Prolonged exposure to these conditions could explain why standing may increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease.
Enhanced oxidative stress (toxin — inflammation mechanism): Prolonged standing may induce enhanced oxidative stress due to a maintained activation of leg muscles, known to contribute to cardiometabolic disease.
Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain (toxin — musculoskeletal mechanism): Extended periods of standing may induce fatigue and pain in the lower legs and back, acting as barriers to engaging in physical activities that promote cardiometabolic health.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^21a2fd26]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Activities and activity modification — management has shifted over the past 10 years from prescribing bed rest to recognizing that prescriptions of bed rest are ineffective, with emphasis that many workers can continue working or return to work while symptoms persist rather than waiting to be 100% symptom-free. In general, activities causing a significant increase in low back symptoms should be reviewed with the patient and modifications advised when appropriate, as heavy lifting, awkward postures, prolonged duration of a single posture, work station design, and other activities may require at least temporary modification. A modest increase in pain does not represent or document damage and may actually be beneficial for some short-term pain; while the patient is recovering, activities that do not aggravate symptoms should be maintained and exercises should begin.

### Piriformis syndrome and low back pain: a new classification and review of the literature [^c00174fc]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome is a common cause of low back pain. It is often not included in the differential diagnosis of back, buttock, and leg pain. Additionally it has received minimal recognition because it is often seen as a diagnosis of exclusion. Familiarity with the common elements of the syndrome should increase its recognition and facilitate the appropriate treatment. These include buttock pain and tenderness with or without electrodiagnostic or neurologic signs. Pain is exacerbated in prolonged sitting. Specific physical findings are tenderness in the sciatic notch and buttock pain in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) of the hip. Imaging modalities are rarely helpful, but electrophysiologic studies should confirm the diagnosis, if not immediately, then certainly in a patient re-evaluation and as such should be sought persistently. Physical therapy aims at stretching the muscle and reducing the vicious cycle of pain and spasm. It is a mainstay of conservative treatment, usually enhanced by local injections. Surgery should be reserved as a last resort in case of failure of all conservative modalities. Piriformis syndrome may constitute up to 5% of cases of low back, buttock, and leg pain. Recognition and widespread appreciation of the clinical presentation improves its early detection and accurate treatment.

Figure 1
(A) Starting position of FRT, (B) Final position of RFT.

The five-time sit to stand test (5 TSST) involved a chair that was positioned against the wall to secure the test location. For the starting position, the subjects sat in the middle of the chair, back straight without support, feet flat on the floor, and both arms were folded together across the chest (Figure 2A). They were then asked to rise to full stand and return to sitting position as fast as possible five times continuously (Figure 2B). They performed three trials, the shortest time spent to complete the five times was used.

Figure 2
(A) Starting position of 5 TSST, (B) Final position of 5 TSST.

For the two-minute step test (2 MST), the researcher measured the stepping height of each subject, which was equal to the mid-thigh level, halfway between the iliac crest and patella, and marked that level on the wall (Figure 3A). The starting position was standing, the subject was then instructed to step by alternately moving the knee up to the marked level, beginning with the right knee and continuing to step for 2 minutes. The researcher counted the number of times the right knee successfully reached the marked level (Figure 3B). The subject was allowed to place one hand on a table for balance assistance if needed. They performed this test only once. However, before data collection, the researcher allowed the subject a short practice.

The rest interval was 2 minutes provided to reduce fatigue between each test. The researcher asked all subjects every time before starting the next tests to reassure that all subjects had no carry-over symptoms. After all tests, the subjects slowly walked for a few minutes to cool down.

Patient and Methods

Study Setting and Patient Selection Criteria

This study was a single case experimental design. The study period was from March 16, 2020 to May 30, 2020. The study was conducted at the Miura Internal Medicine Michiko Pediatrics Clinic. Inclusion criteria included LBP lasting more than 3 months. The LBP area was defined as the area bounded by the lowest palpable rib superiorly and the gluteal folds inferiorly. Exclusion criteria included central nervous system disease, dementia, LBP that appeared within the previous 3 months, difficulty understanding questionnaires and tasks, and difficulty performing tasks.

The study protocol conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of Kio University Health Sciences Graduate School (approval no. H30-06). We explained the study protocol to the patient and obtained written informed consent to publish the case report.

Case Description

The patient was a 67-year-old man with lumbar spinal stenosis who worked in the trash collection business and often carried heavy loads. The patient felt pain from his lower back to the posterior aspect of both lower extremities and feet. He experienced LBP several times for over 10 years and started to feel pain and numbness at the lower extremities a few months ago. Furthermore, the patient expressed that his pain was aggravated during lifting, standing, and walking, and was eased while sitting and lying.

The clinical findings were as follows. Several nerve tension tests, including the slump test, straight-leg-raising test, and Bragard test, demonstrated bilateral positive signs with more severe symptoms on the right side. During standing forward trunk flexion, neck flexion exacerbated the pain, whereas neck extension reduced the pain, indicating that the pain might be associated with decreased nerve sliding. The areas with sensory dullness were the posterior thigh surface and lower legs on both sides. Muscle weakness was observed in the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus, particularly on the right side. In the active movement test, trunk flexion and extension were slightly restricted and restricted by pain, respectively. In the joint play test, hypomobility was noted from the upper lumbar spine to the thoracic spine, especially at L3, L4, and L5, with symptoms observed in the right lower extremity. Muscle spasm was detected in the erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, tensor fascia lata, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and gluteus maximus.

### Treatment algorithms for continuous low-level heat wrap therapy for the management of musculoskeletal pain: an Italian position paper [^f52a7435]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Back Pain

Lumbosacral pain is characterized by discomfort felt in the region between the lower rib cage and buttock creases, with the potential to radiate into the legs. This type of pain is also referred to as lumbar pain. According to the World Health Organization, low back pain (LBP) is the most common type of musculoskeletal conditions, affecting nearly everyone at some point in their lives.LBP is currently the leading cause of disability. Globally, 619 million people were diagnosed with LBP in 2020; by 2050, this number is projected to rise to 843 million, primarily due to population growth and aging. There is a general upward trend in prevalence from birth to age 80, with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 50 and 55. LBP is more prevalent in women.LBP can manifest as specific or non-specific. In the former, the pain originates from a disease or structural issue in the spine or radiates from another region of the body. In the latter, the inability to identify a specific disease or structural cause for the pain characterizes the condition. In approximately 90% of cases, there is no clear cause for LBP.

Symptoms

Back pain is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of factors and is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that have been thoroughly researched and documented in an enormous amount of published research. Symptoms can range from intense, deep pain to long-lasting, throbbing discomfort. These symptoms are typically centered in the lower back or middle back. In some cases, patients report discomfort that spreads to the limbs, in addition to sensations of tingling, numbness, or paralysis, all of which are indicative of the possibility of nerve involvement. Musculoskeletal symptoms, which include rigidity, muscle spasms, and restricted movement, are regularly experienced by individuals. These symptoms frequently exacerbate functional restrictions and reduce overall well-being. Additionaly, discomfort typically becomes more severe with intense physical activity, extended periods of standing or sitting, and during the night, leading to disruptions in normal sleep rhythms. Anxiety and depression often occur concurrently, adding another layer of complication to the clinical presentation. Due to the complex interaction of various symptoms, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment is necessary. This highlights the relevance of individualized treatment strategies for managing the numerous forms of back pain. It is imperative that the treatment be multimodal and in accordance with the most recent standards established by both national and international organizations.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^496a900d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Diagnostic Characteristics

The fundamental components of the patient physical examination were derived from the foundational article by Bogdukand consolidated into a suite of clinical features characteristic of lumbar discogenic pain. These features, when considered altogether, enhance the diagnostic accuracy for this condition. During the initial patient encounter, a thorough clinical assessment should be conducted to determine the likelihood and duration of possible discogenic pain symptoms (Figure 1, Box 1).

To identify lumbar discogenic pain, the physical evaluation should consider five components. First, the prominent pain location should be axial midline back pain. Clinical manifestation of non-discogenic low back pain due to painful facet or sacroiliac joints is not commonly midline. The patient may also experience referred leg pain but it should be described as non-radicular/non-sciatic pain in a sclerotomal distribution. Patient-reported low back pain severity should be ≥ 4 at the time of physical examination (0 to 10 scale).

Second, the pain is primarily exacerbated with forward flexion. Lumbar flexion involves axial loading which increases annular strain and correlates with pain emanating from degenerated lumbar intervertebral discs. Since the fulcrum of the anterior column is located posteriorly, a small percentage of patients may have pain with extension.

Third, the patient should exhibit significant functional limitation in sitting duration and tolerance. The pain may become worse when patients sit without support, especially when sitting forward. A sitting intolerance limit of 30 minutes is considered the standard threshold for discogenic pain.

Fourth, the pain should be provoked and reproduced with sustained passive hip flexion. This maneuver is undertaken with the patient in the supine, straight-leg position. Both legs are elevated simultaneously to approximately 45 degrees and then both are allowed to come down slowly. As with forward flexion, biphasic straightening from flexion produces strain across the disc with pain provocation indicating that both or either leg activates back pain. This clinical assessment should not be confused with the straight leg raising test (Laseque's sign) which is a neurodynamic examination to evaluate nerve root irritation or compression associated with radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease — alternative diagnoses for leg pain or claudication with normal physiological testing (Not PAD-Related) are enumerated with characteristic patterns. Symptomatic Baker's cyst is "Behind knee, down calf", has "Swelling, tenderness", occurs "With exercise", is "Also present at rest", and is "Not intermittent". Venous claudication involves the "Entire leg, worse in calf", with "Tight, bursting pain" "After walking" that "Subsides slowly", relief "speeded by elevation", and a "History of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis; edema; signs of venous stasis". Chronic compartment syndrome affects the "Calf muscles" with "Tight, bursting pain" "After much exercise (jogging)", that "Subsides very slowly", with "Relief with rest", and occurs in "Typically heavy muscled athletes". Spinal stenosis presents in "Often bilateral buttocks, posterior leg" with "Pain and weakness", may "mimic claudication", has "Variable relief but can take a long time to recover", improves with "Relief by lumbar spine flexion", and is "Worse with standing and extending spine". Nerve root compression pain "Radiates down leg", is "Sharp lancinating pain", is "Induced by sitting, standing, or walking", is "Often present at rest", "Improved by change in position", with a "History of back problems; worse with sitting; relief when supine or sitting". Hip arthritis produces "Aching discomfort" in the "Lateral hip, thigh" "After variable degree of exercise", is "Not quickly relieved", and is "Improved when not weight bearing", with "history of degenerative arthritis". Foot/ankle arthritis causes "Aching pain" in the "Ankle, foot, arch" "After variable degree of exercise", is "Not quickly relieved", and "May be relieved by not weight bearing", with symptoms that "may be related to activity level or present at rest".

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^95fb0428]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Effect of tai chi quan on the pressure pain thresholds of lower back muscles in healthy women [^bcab786a]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Intergroup Differences in PPTs After Intervention

On the right side, simplified TCQ could effectively increase the PPTs of the LT, IL, M, GM and SL of the Tai Chi group compared with those of the control group (Table 4). On the left side, TCQ also remarkably increased the PPTs of LT, IL, M, QL and GM (Table 4). Overall, 40 minutes of TCQ exercise significantly increased the PPTs of LT (t = 7.391, p = 0.000), IL (z = −4.236, p = 0.000), M (z = −5.411, p = 0.000), QL (z = −2.506, p = 0.012), GM (t = 5.188, p = 0.000) and SL (z = −3.541, p = 0.000).

Table 4
Inter-Group Differences in the Right and Left Pressure Pain Thresholds After Intervention

Correlation Analysis of PPTs and Demographical Characteristics

PPT had no substantial correlation with BMI, sitting time, FPQ score, PCS score and FABQ score at the six test points. SAS score had a negative correlation with the overall PPT of the M (R = −0.256, p = 0.048) but not with the PPTs of the other test points. The improvement of the overall PPTs of the IL and M after TCQ exercise was positively correlated with sitting time (R = 0.398, p = 0.029; R = 0.365, p = 0.047), and the overall PPT of QL was positively correlated with SAS score (R = 0.383, p = 0.037). The results suggested that TCQ may be more effective in improving PPTs in sedentary people and people with anxiety.

### Patellofemoral pain [^7ec92f73]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common musculoskeletal-related condition that is characterized by insidious onset of poorly defined pain, localized to the anterior retropatellar and/or peripatellar region of the knee. The onset of symptoms can be slow or acutely develop with a worsening of pain accompanying lower-limb loading activities (eg, squatting, prolonged sitting, ascending/descending stairs, jumping, or running). Symptoms can restrict participation in physical activity, sports, and work, as well as recur and persist for years. This clinical practice guideline will allow physical therapists and other rehabilitation specialists to stay up to date with evolving PFP knowledge and practices, and help them to make evidence-based treatment decisions.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^3cc1229b]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.7 ‐4 radiculopathy mimics

Conditions in this section are among the most challenging to diagnose, even for experienced specialists in musculoskeletal conditions, and may therefore be underrecognized radiculopathy mimics.

4.7.1 internus syndrome

The superior and inferior gemelli along with obturator internus, which are external rotators of the hip, form a conjoint tendon known as triceps coxae, which inserts into the greater trochanter between piriformis superiorly and quadratus femoris inferiorly. The putative pathoanatomic explanation for gemelli–obturator syndrome is compression of the sciatic nerve as it emerges from deep to piriformis and courses superficial to the gemelli–obturator complex due to stretching of the latter muscle group. This theory is supported by a study demonstrating curvature of the sciatic nerve resulting from the stretch of the gemelli and obturator internus with hip internal rotation as demonstrated with dynamic ultrasound in cadavers and healthy volunteers. Gemelli–obturator internus syndrome is thought to result in retro‐trochanteric pain, which could be confused with lower sacral radiculopathy. The clinician suspecting the presence of this syndrome should assess for a reproduction of symptoms with passive internal rotation of the hip. The imaging modality of choice is MRI.

4.7.2 Coccydynia

Coccydynia, or coccyx/tailbone pain, more commonly affects women than men and has many potential etiologies, including idiopathic and traumatic causes like coccyx fracture. Although a rare diagnosis, estimated to account for 1% of nontraumatic axial spine pain, coccydynia warrants mention because of its potentially disabling nature and the specific investigations and management required. While usually considered non‐neurogenic in origin, pain in the region of the coccyx may arise from compression of lower spinal nerve roots. Coccydynia is characterized by pain and tenderness of the lower sacrum at the site of the coccyx or sacrococcygeal articulation. Patients may report pain that worsens with prolonged sitting, pain with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), and pain with defecation (dyschezia). Imaging should include dynamic plain films with standing and sitting views that can reveal pathologic motion. A favorable response to interventional pain treatment would support coccyx pain over lower sacral radiculopathy.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^5c1c372d]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The onset of PPGP varies significantly and has been recorded at stages between the end of the first trimester to the first month postdelivery, including the labour stage. It may be insidious or sudden. In general, postpartum pain may be milder than that during pregnancy. A general consensus exists regarding a peak of symptoms closer to the third trimester between the 24th and 36th weeks of pregnancy. In the majority of cases (up to 93%), PPGP settles and spontaneously disappears after the sixth month postpartum. In the rest of the cases, it persists, acquiring a chronic character.

Several authors have recommended that a careful recording of the pain history of the patient suspected of having PPGP contributes significantly to a successful diagnosis. Characteristics such as exacerbations related to a change of position from sitting to standing or during prolonged sitting or standing, during sexual intercourse, and increased intra-abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing, micturition, defecation) should be explored. On the basis of the medical history, changes and significant difficulties in performing activities of daily living are usually apparent. History combined with the localisation of the pain, with the addition of pain referral maps, can differentiate lower-back pain syndromes, sciatica, visceral or vascular origin syndromes from PPGP.

PPGP pain intensity is repeatedly reported to be around 50 to 60 mm of the visual analogue scale (VAS), ranging significantly, however, throughout the duration of the syndrome from bearable to very serious for the 8% of severely disabled women. Wu et al. described a higher correlation of the resultant disability to the increased "fear of movement" and less to the degree of pain itself.

Alteration of gait patterns has also been associated with the syndrome regarding the inability of these patients to cover long distances or a temporary "catching" sensation or clicking on hip flexion, located mostly anteriorly or unilaterally posteriorly. The gait coordination of these patients is distinctly characterised by slower walking velocity, an increase in the amplitude of the horizontal rotation of the pelvis to the thorax and a reduced relative phase between these rotations, which differentiate PPGP patients from those with lower-back pain and healthy pregnant women.

### Combination of gluteal trigger points dry needling and percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy for complex low back-related leg pain [^8562931d]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment Strategy and Results

The LBLP area of which the patient complained differed from the distribution where the L4 nerve root usually innervated. It was similar to the region of the S1 nerve root, which meant we could not immediately perform an L3-4 discectomy. Instead, we found intense tenderness in the superior lateral quadrant of the left buttock and referred pain in the left leg.

We performed DN (Figure 4). First, the two trigger points within the gluteus muscle that provoked the referred pain were marked. Then, we inserted a 0.25×75-mm needle at these two spots using a rapid needle entry and exit technique, and a local surface muscle response was observed. After 2 min of manipulation, the response disappeared, and the needle was pulled out. The patient reported soreness in the buttock, but the pain in her right leg was immediately and completely relieved. She could walk and sit normally and did not feel pain in the next 2 days. However, she still complained of numbness on the medial and anterior aspect of the left lower leg that was especially aggravated with long-distance walking. We believed that the remnant numbness came from L3-4 lumbar disc herniation, and we successfully performed percutaneous endoscopic lumbar disc discectomy (PELD) 2 days after DN treatment. She was discharged from the hospital 1 day after the surgery.

Figure 4
Dry needling for these two marked gluteal trigger points.

We followed up the case at postoperative 15 days, 3 months and 6 months. The numbness gradually relieved after the surgery and six months after the operation, the patient reported that the numbness had disappeared and the VAS was 1. She said mild pain occasionally occurred in the left leg after prolonged sitting or walking, but it did not affect her quality of life.

Acute low back pain, defined as less than 6 weeks in duration, does not require imaging in the absence of "red flags" that may indicate a cause, such as fracture, infection, or malignancy. When imaging is indicated, it is important to rule out a host of abnormalities that may be responsible for the pain and any associated symptoms. A common mnemonic VINDICATE can help ensure a thorough consideration of the possible causes.

Case Presentation

Relevant History

The patient is a 90-year-old female with past medical history including a left sacral insufficiency fracture, thoracic vertebral compression fracture, and degenerative left medial meniscus tear, who presented with stabbing left lateral hip pain. The pain was chronic but had been progressing in severity over the past month. There was no inciting event or fall. The pain was exacerbated by lying on her left side and was affecting her sleep. At baseline, she ambulated with a rollator walker, but the pain was starting to limit her ability to walk. She had a history of low back and posterior left buttock pain, but she denied current pain in these regions. She also denied weakness or pain radiation into her lower extremities.

Relevant Physical Examination

On examination, she had no pain with lumbar or hip range of motion. She had full, symmetric, and pain-free lower extremity strength, and deep tendon reflexes and sensation to light touch were intact and symmetric in her lower extremities. She had a positive Trendelenburg sign with single-leg stance bilaterally, and she was tender to palpation over the left greater trochanter but not the right. Ober's, seated slump, and straight leg raise tests were negative. (See Figures 2 and 4 for descriptions of Ober's and the seated slump test.)

Figure 2
Ober's test: 1) The patient is positioned side-lying, and the leg to be tested is on top; the pelvis is stabilized perpendicular to the exam table by the examiner's hand; 2) The knee of the affected leg is passively flexed to 90°, and then the hip is passively stretched through abduction and extension (to position the iliotibial band behind the greater trochanter) by the examiner; (A) shows the view from above and (B) shows the anterior perspective; 3) The knee of the affected leg is allowed to slowly drop by gravity until reaching its final resting angle. If the final angle is greater than 0° when compared to the plane of the table (i.e. the hip is still abducted), Ober's test is positive; (C) highlights a negative Ober's test.

Imaging

Focused ultrasound performed by a musculoskeletal physiatrist with ultrasound training revealed evidence of bursitis of the left greater trochanter, which correlated with the patient's point of maximal tenderness.

Neurogenic Claudication

Claudication refers to intermittent pain in the lower extremities that is exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. Neurogenic claudication must be differentiated from other mimickers, most significantly VC. NC is a pain syndrome whose etiology is LSS, which is a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the lumbar spinal canal. The symptoms of NC are thought to arise from a combination of mechanical compression and circulatory dysfunction within the cauda equina nerve roots. In addition to pain, patients with NC may complain of leg heaviness, numbness, tingling, and weakness. The pain from NC is classically worsened by lumbar extension and alleviated with lumbar flexion. The improvement in pain and facilitating of ambulation with forward flexion is sometimes called the positive shopping cart sign. The diagnosis of NC is made from the history and involves pain in the low back, buttocks, thighs, and/or legs that develops with prolonged standing and walking and is relieved when the patient sits down. The symptoms of NC are generally bilateral.

CT and MRI images of LSS have been shown to sometimes correlate poorly with lower extremity symptoms, and therefore, the history and examination remain important. A study of the reliability of differentiating NC from VC based on symptomatology has shown that the most sensitive symptom (sensitivity 0.97) to rule out NC was the absence of "triggering of pain with standing alone". This same study found that there was a strong likelihood of NC if patients showed a constellation of positive "shopping cart sign", symptoms above the knees, symptoms triggered with standing alone and symptoms relieved with sitting. Patients with symptoms in the calf relieved with standing alone had a strong likelihood of VC.

There is no gold standard diagnostic tool for NC and patients with radiographically severe LSS may be asymptomatic. In some settings, the diagnosis of NC is supported by a positive response to intralaminar lumbar epidural injection with steroid and local anesthetic or with local anesthetic alone. The published evidence has shown that such epidural injections provide both short- and long-term relief for patients with NC and can improve gait function. Thus, it is the opinion of the authors that a response to such injections can be helpful in making a diagnosis of NC.

Symptoms

The patient's symptoms started in July 2017 with no significant inducement. She reported moderate pain in the left gluteal muscle, posterolateral thigh, and posterior calf, numbness in the medial calf, and discomfort in the lower back. These symptoms were exacerbated by prolonged sitting and long-distance walking and were initially alleviated by bed rest in the first month. She was evaluated by a local general practitioner who diagnosed her with lumbar disc herniation and prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; her pain improved slightly. However, in the following 2 months, her pain progressively worsened. She could not stand or walk on her own and reported experiencing intractable pain, even in bed when she was admitted to our pain management ward in October 2017. On a visual analog scale (VAS), the pain score of the left buttock and leg was 8 on average. Oral analgesics (such as tramadol) and physical therapy were not beneficial.

### What Do older people Do when sitting and why? Implications for decreasing sedentary behavior [^54ea8dfe]. The Gerontologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Bodily Function

Almost all participants (regardless of level of SB) recognized that their physical capacity influenced their sitting and non-sitting activities. Some said they felt lucky to be able to be active, but were also aware that declining physical functioning, which they often attributed to getting older, meant they were no longer able to do as much as they used to. Some overcame this limitation by using sitting to break up non-sitting activities:

Mind you that's the way it's turning out now, because you get older. You used to be able to do [all the housework] in a oner, whereas now you have to have wee seats in between. F17, Mid-60s, High SES, Higher SB

Participants also described using sitting to help them manage (sometimes multiple) health issues:

My eyesight is awful and I'm on the blind register now and I have trouble with my back, and it means that if I do too much I get a lot of pain. So I can therefore only walk for about half an hour and I have to sit down. F39, Mid-80s, High SES, Higher SB

However, interviewees (in both SB groups) were aware of the negative impact of sitting on their bodies; many described how sitting for a long time resulted in stiffness, discomfort, or even pain. For some this was an indication that they had sat too long:

I think when you sit a long time you get stiff. I think it's much better to be active and move about because if you've got an ache or a pain and you walk about, it goes away whereas the longer you sit, the stiffer you get so, I think it is much better to be active. F14, Late-70s, Low SES, Lower SB

Low back pain — prevalence and incidence patterns indicate that the 1-year incidence of a first-ever episode ranges between 6.3% and 15.3% and the 1-year incidence of any episode ranges between 1.5% and 36.0%. Recurrent activity-limiting episodes are estimated between 24% and 33%. Chronic low back pain increased from 3.9% (95% CI: 3.4, 4.4) in 1992 to 10.2% (95% CI: 9.3, 11.0) in 2006 in a North Carolina household survey. Women tend to have higher prevalence than men, overall prevalence increases until ages 60 to 65, and lower educational status is associated with increased prevalence, longer episode duration, and worse outcome. Occupational differences are reported, with manual workers having 39% prevalence and sedentary workers 18.3%.

### High prevalence of small-fiber neuropathy in patients with tarlov cysts: toward a more comprehensive clinical understanding [^4fcda5fb]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain in PTCs typically worsens with sitting (93%) and standing (87%). The ability to sit comfortably on a wooden chair was limited to an average duration of 28.5 minutes.

When changing from the lying position to the sitting position, a caudal shift in spinal CSF volume occurs. Consequently, the spinal dural sac volume increases, reducing compliance of the spinal CSF space, increasing sacral pressure and forcing CSF into the nerve root sheaths and the TCs. Pain in PTCs also increases during Valsalva maneuvers and following physical impacts, pregnancy, or trauma. The Valsalva maneuver increases intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressure, leading to a sharp transient increase in CSFP in both the ventricles and lumbar spine. The increased CSFP during a Valsalva maneuver may apply additional transient pressure, potentially irritating the small nerve fibers in the DRG and the communicating TCs, leading to a temporary increase in pain. Moreover, in non-communicating TCs (ie, those with a valve system), during Valsalva maneuvers, CSF is forced into the TCs but cannot exit quickly. Therefore, repeated Valsalva maneuvers (coughing, lifting heavy objects) may cause longstanding increased radicular pain.

Notably, 10% of PTCs in our cohort were previously diagnosed with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) according to the diagnostic criteria for hEDS of the International Consortium on Ehlers–Danlos Syndromes and Related Disorders. Connective tissue disorders have been linked to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IICH), with complications such as dural ectasia and TCs being common. Additionally, connective tissue weakness allows the nerve root sheaths to dilate more easily in response to increased CSFP.

### Non-specific low back pain [^054f6829]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain has become a major public health problem worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is reported to be as high as 84%, and the prevalence of chronic low back pain is about 23%, with 11–12% of the population being disabled by low back pain. Mechanical factors, such as lifting and carrying, probably do not have a major pathogenic role, but genetic constitution is important. History taking and clinical examination are included in most diagnostic guidelines, but the use of clinical imaging for diagnosis should be restricted. The mechanism of action of many treatments is unclear, and effect sizes of most treatments are low. Both patient preferences and clinical evidence should be taken into account for pain management, but generally self-management, with appropriate support, is recommended and surgery and overtreatment should be avoided.

Approach to Evaluation and Management

Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS)

GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s this entity was most frequently called "greater trochanteric bursitis"; however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45%, and it commonly occurs in people with knee OA, as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias radiating down the lateral thigh along the course of the iliotibial band. Table 2 reviews additional common pain characteristics which can be elicited during the patient history to help distinguish GTPS from other conditions.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation for the treatment of superior cluneal neuralgia: a cadaver demonstration of a novel technique for lead placement [^15b4602c]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Superior Cluneal Neuralgia

The superior cluneal nerve can play a significant role in the experience of lower back pain. When it becomes irritated or compressed it is classified as superior cluneal neuralgia (SCN). SCN can lead to referred pain in the lower back, upper buttock, and posterior iliac crest region. This referred pain can be misinterpreted as lower back pain, even though the source of the problem may be the nerve itself.

Irritation or compression of the superior cluneal nerve can result from various factors, including mechanical stress, poor posture, or injury to the lower back. Prolonged sitting, repetitive activities, or occupational factors that involve bending and twisting at the waist can contribute to the development of this condition.

Identifying and addressing issues related to this nerve can be essential for diagnosing and managing certain cases of lower back pain. The clinical presentation of SCN typically manifests as chronic, burning, stabbing, or shooting pain in the lower back and upper buttock region. The pain may radiate down the back of the thigh or around the hip area. It is often described as sharp or electric shock-like and may be associated with numbness, tingling, or hypersensitivity in the affected area.

Diagnosis of superior cluneal neuralgia is primarily clinical, based on a thorough medical history and physical examination. Imaging studies such as X-rays, MRI, or CT scans may be conducted to rule out other potential causes of pain, such as lumbar disc herniation or spinal stenosis. Diagnostic nerve blocks, where a local anesthetic is injected into the superior cluneal nerves, can help confirm the diagnosis by providing temporary relief from pain.

### An analysis of factors associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain, pain management preferences, coping strategies, and health-related quality of life among older people: a cross-cultural study [^8d4a749d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

CMP is a major health concern for OAs globally, with estimates suggesting that between 50% and 80% of elderly individual's experience CMP. Research also shows that up to 75% of OAs suffer from CMP. Common causes of CMP include conditions such as arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders. In the study by Yagci et al, CMP was reported by 212 OAs (82,1%): 61,3% Spinal pain and 38,7% lower extremity pain. In some studies, OAs with CMP reported moderate pain (VAS score 5 to 6). Similarly, in our study, participants reported moderate pain. Pain triggers such as climbing stairs and prolonged sitting revealed important regional differences. Both Romanians and Turks reported climbing stairs as a significant pain-increasing factor. Interestingly, prolonged sitting was associated with increased pain among Romanians but was less likely to be reported in Turks, possibly due to differences in physical habits. Although national data indicate high rates of physical inactivity among older adults in Romania and Turkey, our findings suggest more complex behavioral patterns. For example, pain triggered by prolonged sitting was more common among Romanians, while prolonged walking was a more frequent trigger among Turks. These differences may reflect distinct physical habits and functional limitations rather than a uniformly inactive lifestyle across groups. These results show that the majority of OAs are inactive. In Turkey, prolonged walking was more likely to be a pain trigger, which might be linked to higher BMI among participants. These findings underline the need for context-specific interventions addressing behavioral factors.

### Piriformis syndrome in a patient after cesarean section under spinal anesthesia [^0655b091]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of piriformis syndrome as a cause of persistent buttock and hip pain after spinal anesthesia are presented in this case report.

Case Report

A 29-year-old woman presented 5 days after cesarean delivery with sudden onset of pain in the left buttock and left hip radiating to the posterior knee with fever. She was subsequently diagnosed with piriformis syndrome.

Conclusions

Back pain with radiation into the buttocks after spinal anesthesia is frequently attributed to the spinal procedure itself. However, prolonged sitting and weight bearing in the upright position after cesarean delivery can cause sciatic nerve compression at the sacroiliac joint with concomitant irritation, inflammation, and spasm of the piriformis muscle. Piriformis syndrome is frequently underdiagnosed in the obstetric population. Because the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome is based mainly on clinical signs and symptoms, the clinician must have a high index of suspicion.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^e3b8ae8b]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

### Non-specific low back pain [^ab447dc9]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain affects people of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Management guidelines endorse triage to identify the rare cases of low back pain that are caused by medically serious pathology, and so require diagnostic work-up or specialist referral, or both. Because non-specific low back pain does not have a known pathoanatomical cause, treatment focuses on reducing pain and its consequences. Management consists of education and reassurance, analgesic medicines, non-pharmacological therapies, and timely review. The clinical course of low back pain is often favourable, thus many patients require little if any formal medical care. Two treatment strategies are currently used, a stepped approach beginning with more simple care that is progressed if the patient does not respond, and the use of simple risk prediction methods to individualise the amount and type of care provided. The overuse of imaging, opioids, and surgery remains a widespread problem.

### Diaphragm fatigue does not impact breathing mechanics or function in people with chronic low back pain [^4c57716f]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Exercise Description

A trained research assistant provided instruction to the participants regarding specific movement patterns and closely monitored their performance throughout the session. The exercise intervention lasted approximately 30 minutes and included a combination of uni-planar and functional movements aimed at promoting movement and stability of the lumbar spine. The movements were carried out in a standing position and comprised lumbar sagittal plane flexion and extension, flexion with right and left rotation, extension with right and left rotation, transverse plane lumbar rotation to both sides, and coronal plane lateral flexion of the spine to the right and left. Additionally, participants transitioned from a seated position on a stool to a standing position without the use of their hands. A total of 6 repetitions for each exercise were selected to effectively challenge the stabilizing muscles, including the diaphragm while not exacerbating the pain. This is significant as repeated muscle activation can influence neuromuscular function and feedback, potentially leading to a decrease in mechanical sensitivity. The sagittal plane movements were performed at two distinct speeds: a self-selected pace and the maximum speed achievable while maintaining safety. The rationale for employing varying speeds in exercise execution was to challenge local dynamic stability, which has been shown to be limited in fast movements. The uni-planar movements (flexion/extension, rotation, and lateral bending to both sides) were deliberately chosen for their conceptual simplicity and feasibility, based on evidence indicating that individuals with low back pain frequently exhibit alterations in motor control. In contrast, the multiplanar movements (flexion and extension coupled with rotation) were selected to better replicate functional activities, acknowledging that the spine typically engages in multi-planar motion simultaneously. However, they are inherently more difficult to perform because they challenge the body's awareness of its position in space and motor control. The sit-to-stand motion was specifically chosen due to its reliance on lumbar stability, requiring a coordinated contraction of core muscles to transition from a flexed lumbar spine position while sitting to an extended position upon standing.

All participants were instructed to perform each movement at a comfortable pace. As described above, sagittal plane flexion and extension was also performed at the fastest speed possible while staying safe. Symptomatic participants, prone to experiencing pain, were encouraged to only perform the movements within their comfort range. If they expressed any discomfort, they were advised to stop or slow down. All participants were able to complete all movement patterns.

### The clinical features of the piriformis syndrome: a systematic review [^41e16a2b]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Piriformis syndrome, sciatica caused by compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle, has been described for over 70 years; yet, it remains controversial. The literature consists mainly of case series and narrative reviews. The objectives of the study were: first, to make the best use of existing evidence to estimate the frequencies of clinical features in patients reported to have PS; second, to identify future research questions. A systematic review was conducted of any study type that reported extractable data relevant to diagnosis. The search included all studies up to 1 March 2008 in four databases: AMED, CINAHL, Embase and Medline. Screening, data extraction and analysis were all performed independently by two reviewers. A total of 55 studies were included: 51 individual and 3 aggregated data studies, and 1 combined study. The most common features found were: buttock pain, external tenderness over the greater sciatic notch, aggravation of the pain through sitting and augmentation of the pain with manoeuvres that increase piriformis muscle tension. Future research could start with comparing the frequencies of these features in sciatica patients with and without disc herniation or spinal stenosis.

### Lumbar axial rotation kinematics in an upright sitting and with forward bending positions in men with nonspecific chronic low back pain [^a6e00320]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A controlled cross-sectional study.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the kinematics of lumbar axial rotation while sitting in an upright and forward bending position in men suffering with and without nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP).

Summary Of Background Data

Lumbar rotation while sitting is an important factor in the mechanism of low back pain. Nevertheless, its kinematics has scarcely been investigated.

Methods

Range of motion (ROM in), average velocity (AV), maximum velocity (MV), and maximal acceleration (MA) of lumbar rotation while sitting in an upright (UP-sitting) and full forward bending position (FFB-sitting) were examined using an industrial lumbar motion monitor in 50 men (25 with NSCLBP and 25 controls). Pain level and the Rolland Morris questionnaire (RMQ) were also included.

Results

All examined kinematical parameters were significantly lower in men with NSCLBP compared with the controls (↓ROM = 16%-29%; ↓AV = 35%-53%; ↓MV = 3%-46%; ↓MA = 7%-44%) and significantly decreased when moving from UP-sitting to FFB-sitting. In the UP-sitting, the ROM and AV in both groups and the right rotation-MV in the NSCLBP group were always greater during the right rotation compared to the left (NSCLBP = ROM: Δ3.92°, AV: Δ2.74°, MV:Δ3.61°; controls = ROM: Δ3.46°, AV: Δ1.72°). The left rotation-MV was significantly greater compared to the right only in FFB-sitting in the controls (Δ3.03°). In all kinematical parameters in the NSCLBP group, no correlations were found in the visual analogue scale (VAS) levels (4.43 ± 1.47) or RMQ total score (12.32 ± 5.44).

Conclusion

The kinematic parameters of lumbar rotation were reduced in men with NSCLBP compared with controls both in an UP-sitting and FFB-sitting. In both groups, NSCLBP and controls, asymmetry in lumbar rotation kinematics was indicated as well as a decrease when moving from UP-sitting to FFB-sitting.

Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) functional staging — ATTRv amyloid polyneuropathy in clinical settings may be followed with the FAP score, which defines ambulation stages and helps distinguish common mimics. FAP stage 1 is the ability to walk unassisted; FAP stage 2 is the ability to walk with assistance, with a cane or a walker; and FAP stage 3 is when patients are wheelchair- or bed-bound. Other neurologic syndromes common with amyloidosis — carpal tunnel syndrome and lumbar stenosis or lumbosacral radiculopathy — are distinct from polyneuropathy but can mimic it with similar numbness, pain, and weakness. Carpal tunnel syndrome often precedes the polyneuropathy by many years. Lumbar stenosis classically causes neurogenic claudication after walking a short distance that persists with standing but is relieved by sitting or lying down, which is the opposite of polyneuropathy symptoms that are usually worse when lying in bed and improve with walking.

Spinal stenosis — definition, prevalence, types, mechanisms, and presentation — is defined as narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in symptoms and signs from neural and vascular compression, with varying degrees shown to be present in 27.2% of the elderly population. Congenital or acquired spinal stenosis may be central, foraminal, or both, and disc bulging, protrusion, and extrusion with osteophytes, facet arthritic changes, and hypertrophy of the ligamenta flava can narrow the canal and compress dural sac contents. Foraminal stenosis is largely secondary to degenerative facet disease, potentially with a significant disc component, producing compression or distortion of the exiting nerve root. In central stenosis, symptoms are secondary to direct compression of the cauda equina, altered arterial flow, venous congestion producing increased epidural pressure, and nerve root excitation by local inflammation. Clinical presentation varies from focal radiculopathy to neurogenic claudication with buttocks or leg pain when walking that disappears with sitting or lumbar flexion; foraminal stenosis presents with radicular pain, and combined central and foraminal stenoses generally present with neurogenic claudication as well as radicular pain. In addition to congenital and acquired causes, acute trauma may also produce central and/or foraminal stenoses due to retropulsion of the vertebral body middle column into the canal, with or without a significant epidural hematoma, and distortion of the neural foramina.

### Facet joint syndrome: from diagnosis to interventional management [^df2d0935]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation and pain patterns

FJ as a source of LBP was first described by Goldthwaite in 1911, and Ghormhley who used the term "facet syndrome" to describe a symptom originating from the FJ. It was initially described as lumbosacral pain with or without sciatica in 1933. Ten years later, Badgley et al. suggested FJ as the source of up to 80% of back pain. Facet syndrome included local pain and pseudo radicular radiation with variability of the distribution of referral patterns of pain. Most authors tried to classify the distribution of FJ pain provoked by an infiltration or electrical stimulation. The majority of these studies have not found reliable referral patterns of FJ pain. As suggested by Cohen, this may be explained by the fact that stimulation does not reproduce physiological conditions. FJ pain may be referred distally into the lower limb, thereby mimicking sciatica. "Pseudo-radicular" lumbar pain typically radiates uni- or bilaterally to the buttock and the trochanteric region (from the L4 and L5 levels), the groin and the thighs (from L2 to L5), ending above the knee, without neurological deficits (Fig. 5). However, radiating pain may reach the foot, mimicking sciatic pain, especially in cases of osteophytes or synovial cysts. Claudication is possible. Pain is usually worse in the morning, during periods of inactivity, and following stress exercise, lumbar spine extension or rotary trunk motions, is provoked by standing or sitting positions, and may be elicited on FJ palpation. Pain radiation can be subdivided into primary, secondary and least commonly painful areas as previously described by Barlocher et al. Abdominal and pelvic pain have also been described. Differential diagnoses include true sciatica, hip pathology (hip osteoarthritis or greater trochanteric bursitis) or sacroiliac impairment. However, lumbar FJ syndrome seems not to be a reliable clinical diagnosis, and a specific etiology of back pain can be diagnosed in only about 15% of patients with certainty based on clinical examination alone. The results of studies investigating the FJ as the source of a patient's symptoms suggest that the currently available tests have limited or no diagnostic validity. Moreover, history and physical examination may suggest but not confirm FJ as the source of pain.

Study procedure

Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Health sciences, University of Bamenda (2019/0037H/UBa/IRB) and administrative authorizations were obtained from the North West Regional Delegation of Public Health and from the Director of the Bamenda Regional Hospital.

Data were collected by the principal investigator, a trained health professional on maternal health, who was not blinded at any time during the data collection process. Participants were approached individually at the antenatal unit upon arrival and were informed of the purpose and procedure of the study. Informed consent was signed before the participant was enrolled in the study. For participants aged below 18 years, consent was obtained from the person accompanying them. All eligible participants underwent an interview with the use of a pretested data collection form in the English language.

Data was collected on sociodemographic characteristics (age, religion, education level, marital status, occupation), obstetrical and gynaecologic characteristics (gestational age, gravidity, parity, mode of delivery for the previous pregnancies, dysmenorrhea), clinical characteristics of pain (onset, severity using the visual analogue scale, type, radiation, timing), medical history of low back pain (presence of low back pain before pregnancy, history of low back pain in previous pregnancies) and lifestyle habits such as prolonged postural habit (e.g. frequent bending, lifting things, prolonged sitting or standing), physical activity, and the firmness of the mattress (considered soft if it easily sinks when the individual lies on it).

The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a tool used to assess pain intensity, commonly employed in research and routine clinical practice. It is typically presented as a 10 cm line, with one end representing "no pain at all" and the other representing "worst pain imaginable". The pregnant woman was asked to mark the line at the point that best represents the intensity of their pain.

The description of the pain permitted the classification into either PGP or LP. For each pregnant woman, the weight in kilograms and height in meters were taken at the end of the interview using the EKS mechanical scale and a stadiometer respectively. This allowed the participants to be grouped as non-obese (18.5–29.99 kg/m²) or obese (≥ 30 kg/m²).

Background

Location

The appendix is a small tube-like structure about 3–4 inches long attached to the large intestine in the right lower abdomen.

Function

The appendix is a non-essential organ. It can become blocked by stool, a foreign body, or cancer leading to irritation and infection, or it can even rupture (burst, perforate) and form a pocket of infection or pus called an abscess.

Symptoms

The classic symptom of appendicitis is abdominal pain that begins near the belly button and then shifts to the right lower side. This pain usually worsens with movement, coughing, or activities. Other symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fever, and a swollen abdomen. Less common symptoms include right lower back pain and pain with passing urine.

Workload information included waking hours, hours of rest during work, types of field work (farming, grass cutting, branch cutting, fetching water), working positions (sitting or squatting, standing or bending forward), and hours of prolonged sitting or standing.

The registration of LBP and PGP was done using a body chart. Participants who reported musculoskeletal pain were asked to indicate the location of their pain on a body chart, which was then validated by having the women point to the site of the pain on their body. If the women pointed to their lower back and/or pelvis, they were considered to have LBP and/or PGP. A physiotherapist then performed further clinical examination on women reporting LBP and/or PGP.

The women who reported LBP and/or PGP also responded to questions regarding pain intensity (numeric rating scale, 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most severe pain)), pain frequency (on some days, most days, every day), specific pelvic pain locations (sacrum, sacroiliac joints, and symphysis pubis), whether the LBP and/or PGP limited their usual activities or changed their daily routine for more than 1 day (no/yes), whether they were concerned about the LBP and/or PGP (numeric rating scale, 0 (not concerned) to 10 (extremely concerned), and whether they believed that the LBP and/or PGP would disappear after delivery (no/yes).

### Low back pain [^7fc632be]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Low back pain affects individuals of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Despite advancements in assessment and treatment methods, the management of low back pain remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. One reason for the limited success in identifying effective treatments is the large variation in the manifestations, possible causes, precipitating and maintaining factors, course, prognosis and consequences in terms of activity interference and quality of life. However, despite these challenges, steady progress has been achieved in the understanding of back pain, and important steps in the understanding of the psychological and social risk factors, genetics and brain mechanisms of low back pain have been made. These new findings have given impetus to the development of new diagnostic procedures, evidence-based screening methods and more targeted interventions, which underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of low back pain that integrates biological, psychological and social aspects.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^70851a6d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is renewed interest in the intervertebral disc as a target for treatments aimed at ameliorating lumbar discogenic pain by restoring and preserving the natural structure and function of this component of the vertebral motion segment.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi methodology involving a panel of 11 experts, we developed a simple, understandable clinical algorithm to serve as a foundation for objective decision making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar discogenic pain throughout the entire continuum of care. A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm. Clinical activities in this algorithm were divided into examination procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Corresponding treatment options were designated based on published degenerative disc disease (DDD)-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses.

Results

This algorithm recommends a systematic rule set for discogenic pain diagnostic and treatment options. Initially, the presence of lumbar discogenic pain is confirmed via assessment of a series of clinical signs including axial midline back pain (≥ 4 of 10), pain with flexion, sitting intolerance, positive pain provocation with sustained hip flexion, and absence of motor/sensory/reflex changes. Radiographic severity of DDD is graded by modified Pfirrmann grade (1 to 8). Treatment options are stratified by DDD severity to include conservative management (grades 1 and 2), minimally-invasive intradiscal therapies (grades 3 to 7), and more invasive surgical procedures (grade 8). Recognizing that the management program for patients with lumbar discogenic pain can be highly personalized, the treatment options recommended by this algorithm should be considered general guidance.

Conclusion

The proposed algorithm offers an easy-to-use clinical tool for identifying, evaluating and treating patients with lumbar discogenic pain. The successful implementation of this algorithm involves an important interplay between advanced practice providers, interventional pain physicians and spine surgeons.

Acute back pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department that leads to a great deal of resource utilization. The differential diagnosis is long and most cases are caused by benign pathology that will resolve on its own. Imaging is over-used and rarely helps. This article presents an algorithmic approach using red flags in the history and physical examination that will help physicians better identify the small of patients with serious conditions that, if untreated, will result in significant neurological damage.

### Low back pain [^d19de637]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Low back pain is a common problem that is the leading cause of disability and is associated with high costs. Evaluation focuses on identification of risk factors indicating a serious underlying condition and increased risk for persistent disabling symptoms in order to guide selective use of diagnostic testing (including imaging) and treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies, including exercise and psychosocial management, are preferred for most patients with low back pain and may be supplemented with adjunctive drug therapies. Surgery and interventional procedures are options in a minority of patients who do not respond to standard treatments.

### Abstract… [^4b47fa2c]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Testing Radiography should be performed in patients in whom the history and physical examination are consistent with FAI. An anteroposterior view of the pelvis evaluates the hips for osteoarthritis; the acetabulum for dysplasia, overhang, or retroversion; the femoral head for osteonecrosis or remodeling; the sacroiliac joints for arthritis; and the lower lumbar spine. Because standard AP and lateral views of the hip can miss important abnormalities in patients with FAI, modified Dunn view radiography, in which the hip is flexed 90 degrees and abducted 20 degrees. 12, 13 Arthrography is usually accompanied by a diagnostic injection of local anesthetic. The patient should keep a pain diary for four days after the injection; relief of pain confirms an intra-articular origin of pain. The physician should keep in mind, however, that labral tears can be asymptomatic.

One retrospective study found that intra-articular injection of the hip with bupivacaine during magnetic resonance arthrography has 92 percent sensitivity, 97 percent specificity, and 90 percent accuracy for diagnosis of an intra-articular disorder. 14 The absence of pain relief with the injection suggests an extra-articular source of pain, which theoretically rules out FAI. 15 However, the anesthetic will not relieve pain in some patients because contrast media can irritate the joint. In these patients, a separate diagnostic injection with bupivacaine can be done. Management There are no published studies of nonsurgical treatment of FAI. Because FAI is typically symptomatic with activities of daily living, recommending rest from exercise is not likely to be beneficial. Analgesics have a limited role, and a trial of physical therapy is prudent.

Treatment goals are to improve hip muscle flexibility and strength, posture, and other muscle or joint deficits identified in the physical examination. Patients with refractory cases should be referred to an orthopedic sub-specialist for consideration of arthroscopy. The goals of arthroscopy are to alleviate impingement, to repair or remove injured tissue, and to prevent or delay osteoarthritis. To alleviate impingement, pincer and cam lesions are removed and femoral offset is corrected, restoring bony alignment.

### What low back pain is and why we need to pay attention [^62e1543a]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Low back pain is a very common symptom. It occurs in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries and all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased by 54% between 1990 and 2015, mainly because of population increase and ageing, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. For nearly all people with low back pain, it is not possible to identify a specific nociceptive cause. Only a small proportion of people have a well understood pathological cause-eg, a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection. People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain. Disabling low back pain is over-represented among people with low socioeconomic status. Most people with new episodes of low back pain recover quickly; however, recurrence is common and in a small proportion of people, low back pain becomes persistent and disabling. Initial high pain intensity, psychological distress, and accompanying pain at multiple body sites increases the risk of persistent disabling low back pain. Increasing evidence shows that central pain-modulating mechanisms and pain cognitions have important roles in the development of persistent disabling low back pain. Cost, health-care use, and disability from low back pain vary substantially between countries and are influenced by local culture and social systems, as well as by beliefs about cause and effect. Disability and costs attributed to low back pain are projected to increase in coming decades, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries, where health and other systems are often fragile and not equipped to cope with this growing burden. Intensified research efforts and global initiatives are clearly needed to address the burden of low back pain as a public health problem.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3fe2feb4]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) and anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain localized to a very limited area or radiating below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, and occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdomen discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^3c7b452f]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

### Pain during prolonged sitting is a common problem in persons with patellofemoral pain [^a4f0a0b6]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design Retrospective cohort. Background Although persons with patellofemoral pain (PFP) often report pain with prolonged sitting, little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of sitting pain. Objectives To describe the proportion of persons with PFP who experience problems with prolonged sitting and to determine patient characteristics associated with sitting pain. Methods Four hundred fifty-eight participants with a diagnosis of PFP from 4 separate studies were included. Item 8 of the Anterior Knee Pain Scale was used to define the presence of problems with prolonged sitting with knee flexion, based on 3 categories: (1) "no difficulty", (2) "pain after exercise", or (3) "problems with prolonged sitting". Differences in demographic and clinical variables between categories were evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis tests (P < .05). Results Two hundred forty-nine (54.4% of the study sample) participants reported problems with prolonged sitting, and 121 (26.4%) reported sitting pain after exercise. Compared to those with no difficulty sitting (n = 88), participants classified as having problems with prolonged sitting were significantly younger (P = 0.038), more likely to be female (P = 0.033), had a lower body mass index (P = 0.027), reported higher pain severity (P < .001) and lower Anterior Knee Pain Scale scores (P < .001), and more frequently reported problems with squatting (P < .001). Conclusion Problems with prolonged sitting are evident in more than half of persons with PFP. Findings highlight the need to identify and adequately manage PFP associated with prolonged sitting. Further research should explore mechanisms of sitting pain and evaluate targeted interventions to reduce PFP with prolonged sitting. Level of Evidence Symptom prevalence study, level 2b.

### Sex-based differences in biomechanical function for chronic low back pain and how it relates to pain experience [^6fc58bfb]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Biomechanical assessment and kinematic analysis for movement quality

Full-body markerless motion capture (Azure Kinect, Microsoft) estimated position data (sampling frequency rate = 30 Hz), including 5 landmarks on the trunk (neck, left and right shoulders, mid-spine, base of the spine) and 6 on the lower extremities (left and right hips, knees, and ankles) (Fig. 1 b) during five sit-to-stand (STS) maneuvers (Fig. 1 a). STS is a relevant functional task characterized by full-body involvement of the trunk and lower extremities. Participants performed the task using a standard 17-inch height chair with arms by their side and feet placed hip-width apart. Participants were instructed to move at a natural and comfortable pace, with timed audio cues provided between each motion.

Fig. 1
Schematic of the motion capture and metric methodology: a STS transition period, b Kinect torso (dark yellow) and lower extremity (light yellow) landmarks, and c Kinematic Profile (K-Profile) and Kinematic Composite Score (K-Score)

The Kinematic Profile (K-Profile), and Kinematic Composite Score (K-Score), a novel approach for analyzing full-body biomechanics, were used to assess movement during five STS transition repetitions, defined as the motion from a seated to standing position, excluding any pauses (Fig. 1 a). The first trial was removed from analyses, as preliminary results showed greater variability compared to the following four repetitions. Data for the subsequent four trials was temporally normalized using min–max scaling. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using Python scikit-learn library by encompassing landmark positions for every time point. Generalized Procrustes Analysis was applied to the PCA-transformed data for standardization, with the control average chosen as the reference frame to ensure that the scores remained consistent despite including patient-specific data. The use of PCA and Generalized Procrustes Analysis for quantifying 3D motion capture data was inspired by previous work in our lab.

### Sitting and standing tolerance in patients with chronic back pain: comparison between physician prediction and covert observation [^5b4a0dc7]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure covertly observed continuous sitting and standing tolerance in patients with chronic back pain and to compare observations to physician predictions.

Design

Blinded, prospective, cohort study.

Setting

Ambulatory referral centers, both public and private, at 5 major medical centers in the eastern United States.

Participants

All volunteers (N = 154; 64.0% women, mean age, 48.7y; 16.8% had active lawsuits) with diagnosis codes of the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision consistent with thoracic and/or lumbosacral back pain were selected from a cohort of 651 outpatients with chronic pain enrolled in the Multiperspective Multidimensional Pain Assessment Protocol (MMPAP).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Continuous sitting and standing tolerance was measured by (1). covert observation of subjects during the MMPAP trial and (2). blinded expert physician prediction based on complete history and physical examination.

Results

Most (124/154, 80.5%) subjects stood for 30 minutes or more and most (124/154, 80.5%) sat for 60 minutes or more. Overall, physicians underpredicted the ability to sit 60 minutes or more and to stand 30 minutes or more. Physician prediction showed poor correlation to covert observation for sitting tolerance (kappa = -.061, P = 0.221) and standing tolerance (kappa = -.021, P = 0.727).

Conclusions

The majority of this sample demonstrated the ability to sit continuously 60 minutes or more and to stand continuously 30 minutes or more while being covertly observed. Expert physician prediction showed poor correlation to covertly observed sitting and standing tolerances, raising doubt about the validity of using physician evaluation to establish work restrictions in patients with chronic back pain. These findings are preliminary, follow only a brief period of covert observation, and indicate the need for further research in this area.
