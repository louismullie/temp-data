## Question

Are there any specific signs or symptoms that can help differentiate isolated left abducens palsy from other cranial nerve palsies?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate isolated left abducens (sixth cranial nerve) palsy from other cranial nerve palsies, specifically oculomotor (third) and trochlear (fourth) palsies, using clinical signs and symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype of an isolated abducens palsy. Then, I should compare this with the hallmark features of oculomotor and trochlear palsies. Next, I will consider associated neurologic signs that help localize the lesion and refine the differential. After that, I should review etiologic patterns that can support the diagnosis in context. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach to the bedside differentiation and note exceptions that warrant imaging or further workup.

> Let me first confirm the core phenotype of isolated abducens palsy. The abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus, so a pure sixth nerve palsy produces an esotropia with impaired abduction of the affected eye, resulting in binocular horizontal diplopia that is worse at distance and worse on gaze toward the side of the palsy; there is no ptosis, no pupillary change, and no vertical or torsional diplopia when the palsy is truly isolated, which is the key clinical signature I need to anchor on [^notfound] [^98693540].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify how this contrasts with oculomotor nerve palsy. CN III innervates multiple extraocular muscles (superior/medial/inferior recti, inferior oblique, levator palpebrae), so a third nerve palsy typically shows combined vertical and horizontal gaze deficits, ptosis, and often pupillary involvement when parasympathetic fibers are affected; importantly, the diplopia is not purely horizontal and abduction is not the only impaired direction, which helps distinguish it from a sixth nerve palsy at the bedside [^notfound] [^94659fb1].

> I need to check the trochlear nerve next. CN IV innervates the superior oblique, so a fourth nerve palsy produces vertical and torsional diplopia that worsens on downgaze, with a compensatory head tilt away from the affected eye; there is no ptosis and no pupillary change, and the diplopia is not purely horizontal, which again contrasts with the straight-horizontal, distance-worse diplopia of abducens palsy [^8b25db13] [^94659fb1].

> Next, I should review associated neurologic signs that can refine localization when present. Let me consider a few pearls: ipsilateral abducens palsy with postganglionic Horner syndrome localizes to the posterior cavernous sinus (Parkinson syndrome), reflecting the abducens nerve's vulnerability there; multiple cranial neuropathies, especially with V1/V2 sensory changes or other ocular motor involvement, point to cavernous sinus disease; and in children or adolescents, Gradenigo syndrome (petrous apex disease with mastoiditis) can present with abducens palsy plus ipsilateral facial pain, which is a classic triad I should actively look for on exam and history [^6051a333] [^67604c9a] [^957ff839].

> I should double-check etiologic patterns that, while not pathognomonic, can support the diagnosis in context. In adults over 50 with vascular risk factors, isolated abducens palsy is most often microvascular and tends to recover spontaneously within about 3 months; if it does not improve by 3 months, I need to reconsider compressive or other causes and image. In younger patients, trauma, demyelination, neoplasm, and inflammatory causes are more common, so I should maintain a lower threshold for neuroimaging and broader laboratory evaluation when the story is atypical or recovery is absent [^8b25db13] [^9ddda727] [^f2d76cea].

> But wait, what if the "isolated" abducens palsy is actually the first manifestation of a broader process? I need to ensure I screen for red flags that mandate imaging or urgent workup: papilledema or other signs of raised intracranial pressure, progressive or nonresolving deficits, atypical pain, multiple cranial nerve involvement, or concerning systemic features; in such cases, MRI brain with contrast and vascular imaging when indicated are appropriate next steps rather than assuming a benign vasculopathic course [^dba2aa1d] [^8b25db13].

> Let me synthesize a practical bedside approach. First, confirm the pattern of diplopia: purely horizontal, worse at distance, and worse on gaze toward the affected side supports abducens palsy. Second, exclude ptosis and pupillary changes and assess for vertical or torsional components; their presence argues against isolated abducens palsy. Third, examine for associated signs such as Horner syndrome, facial pain in V1/V2, other cranial neuropathies, or papilledema that would redirect localization and etiology. Fourth, align the age and risk profile with expected causes and decide on observation versus imaging and laboratory testing, remembering that nonrecovery by 3 months in adults warrants re-imaging and re-evaluation of the differential [^8b25db13] [^9ddda727].

> In summary, the specific clinical signature that helps differentiate isolated left abducens palsy is a purely horizontal binocular diplopia with impaired abduction of the left eye, worse at distance and on left gaze, without ptosis, pupillary change, or vertical/torsional diplopia; associated ipsilateral Horner syndrome, facial pain suggesting petrous apex disease, or multiple cranial nerve involvement would localize the lesion and alter management, whereas persistence beyond 3 months in adults should prompt neuroimaging to exclude compressive or other serious causes [^8b25db13] [^6051a333] [^67604c9a] [^9ddda727].

Isolated left abducens palsy is best identified by **horizontal diplopia worse at distance** and **impaired left eye abduction** with no other cranial nerve deficits [^8b25db13]. Key differentiators from other cranial nerve palsies include: **no ptosis or pupillary changes** (unlike CN III) [^94659fb1] and **no vertical or torsional diplopia** (unlike CN IV) [^94659fb1]. Pain suggests compressive or inflammatory causes (e.g. cavernous sinus, Gradenigo's, Tolosa-Hunt) [^67604c9a] [^19172117], while painless cases in older adults with vascular risk factors are often microvascular [^f2d76cea]. MRI is indicated for non-resolving cases, atypical features, or patients under 50 to exclude neoplasm, aneurysm, or demyelination [^9ddda727] [^notfound].

## Clinical features of isolated left abducens palsy

- **Diplopia**: Horizontal binocular diplopia, worse at distance and on left gaze, improving with head turn [^8b25db13].
- **Gaze limitation**: Impaired abduction of the left eye, causing esotropia that increases with left gaze [^8b25db13].
- **Compensatory head posture**: Patients often turn the head left to reduce diplopia [^e08c1d26].
- **Absence of other cranial nerve signs**: No ptosis, pupillary changes, or vertical/torsional diplopia [^8b25db13].

---

## Differentiation from other cranial nerve palsies

| **Feature** | **Abducens (CN VI)** | **Oculomotor (CN III)** | **Trochlear (CN IV)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Diplopia | Horizontal, worse at distance | Vertical/oblique, ptosis, pupillary changes | Vertical/torsional, worse on downgaze |
| Pupil | Normal | Often involved (mydriasis) | Normal |
| Ptosis | Absent | Present | Absent |
| Gaze limitation | Abduction deficit | Multiple directions, including elevation | Downgaze limitation |

---

## Associated symptoms and signs

- **Pain**: Suggests compressive or inflammatory etiologies (e.g. cavernous sinus, Gradenigo's, Tolosa-Hunt) [^67604c9a] [^19172117].
- **Headache**: May indicate elevated intracranial pressure or mass effect [^dba2aa1d].
- **Other cranial nerve deficits**: Multiple nerve involvement suggests cavernous sinus or brainstem disease [^8efa619f].

---

## Etiological considerations

- **Microvascular ischemia**: Common in older adults with vascular risk factors; typically painless and self-limited [^f2d76cea].
- **Compressive lesions**: Neoplasm, aneurysm, or cavernous sinus disease [^8b25db13].
- **Inflammatory**: Tolosa-Hunt, multiple sclerosis, or post-viral [^78f61e90].
- **Trauma**: Basilar skull fracture or closed head injury [^48aff7ac].

---

## Diagnostic approach

MRI is indicated for **non-resolving cases**, atypical features, or patients under 50 to exclude neoplasm, aneurysm, or demyelination [^9ddda727] [^2cf488b4]. In older adults with vascular risk factors and a classic presentation, observation is reasonable; if there is no improvement by 3 months, obtain MRI [^9ddda727].

---

## Summary of key differentiators

- **Horizontal diplopia worse at distance**: Characteristic of abducens palsy [^8b25db13].
- **Impaired abduction without ptosis or pupillary changes**: Differentiates from CN III palsy [^94659fb1].
- **No vertical or torsional diplopia**: Differentiates from CN IV palsy [^1a37969b].
- **Pain or additional cranial nerve deficits**: Suggest compressive or inflammatory etiologies [^8efa619f].

---

Isolated left abducens palsy presents with **horizontal diplopia and impaired abduction** without other cranial nerve signs; careful attention to these features and the clinical context guides diagnosis and management.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^80578559]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Abducens nerve palsy was the most common palsy, and oculomotor nerve palsy had the shortest onset and recovery period. Complete recovery was associated with an onset of < 7 days and isolated cranial nerve palsy. Further research may identify additional factors influencing good outcomes, ultimately improving patient care and recovery prospects.

### Isolated abducens nerve palsy due to pituitary apoplexy after mild head trauma [^49dd53c9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pituitary apoplexy is a relatively rare condition. Cranial nerve palsies may develop due to compression of the surrounding structures by the rapidly expanding tumor. While the most commonly affected nerve is the oculomotor nerve, abducens nerve palsy may also occur less commonly. A 68-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and diplopia after head trauma due to falling. His magnetic resonance imaging evaluation demonstrated a large pituitary adenoma and bleeding into the tumor, which was acutely expanding and leading to compression of the abducens nerve laterally. Isolated abducens palsy due to posttraumatic pituitary apoplexy is a rare clinical condition, and as the symptoms and signs are nonspecific, it can commonly remain clinically undiagnosed. In this article, our aim was to draw attention to a clinical condition in which unfavorable complications may develop if the diagnosis is overlooked.

### Isolated abducens nerve palsy after closed head trauma: a pediatric case report [^48aff7ac]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Cranial nerve lessions often accompany head trauma. Nevertheless, isolated involvement of the sixth nerve without any cranial or cervical fracture is rare. Nerve injury could occur at the sites of the dural entry points and at the petrous apex during down- or upward movement of the brain caused by violent linear force to the head. Management is symptomatic. Most cases improve within three months and many resolve by six months, but spontaneous recovery does not always occur. We describe the case of a 13-year-old boy who developed isolated abducens nerve palsy after closed head trauma.

### Isolated abducens nerve palsy as a regional variant of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^fcc53e3f]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

The authors reviewed clinical profiles and laboratory findings for 100 cases of abducens nerve paresis without impairment of the other cranial nerves, limb weakness, and ataxia throughout the clinical course. Review of the medical records of 9300 patients referred to our neuoroimmunological laboratory for serum anti-ganglioside antibody testing. Information was obtained from each primary physician on symptoms of preceding infection; initial symptoms; neurological signs during the illness; the clinical course; treatment provided; and outcome. Isolated abducens nerve paresis was present in 100 patients and bilateral paresis in 29. Tentative diagnoses made by the primary physicians on request of anti-ganglioside antibody testing were abducens nerve palsy (n = 68), Fisher syndrome (n = 14), acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia (n = 14). Symptoms of infection anteceded in 63. Tendon reflexes were absent or decreased in 27. Distal paresthesias were experienced by seven. Serum anti-GQ1b antibody was positive in 25. These findings suggest that some cases of isolated abducens nerve palsy can be categorized as a regional variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome or mild form of Fisher syndrome.

### Etiologic distribution of isolated abducens nerve palsy: analysis of 807 patients and literature review [^f2d76cea]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The etiologies of abducens nerve palsy have shown a large variability among studies. This study aimed to establish the clinical features and underlying etiologies of isolated abducens nerve palsy by recruiting patients from all departments in a referral-based university hospital.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 807 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of isolated abducens nerve palsy at all departments of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea, from 2003 to 2020. We also compared the proportion of etiology with that of the patients pooled from the previous studies.

Results

The most common etiology was microvascular (n = 296, 36.7%), followed by idiopathic (n = 143, 17.7%), neoplastic (n = 115, 14.3%), vascular anomalies (n = 82, 10.2%), inflammatory (n = 76, 9.4%), and traumatic (n = 35, 4.3%). Patients were mostly managed by ophthalmologists (n = 576, 71.4%), followed by neurologists (n = 479, 59.4%), emergency physicians (n = 278, 34.4%), neurosurgeons (n = 191, 23.7%), and others (n = 72, 8.9%). The proportion of etiology significantly differed according to the age and sex of the patients and the specialties involved in the management (p < 0.001). Compared to the pooled data from the previous reports, the current study showed a higher prevalence of microvascular cause but a lower occurrence of traumatic and neoplastic causes.

Conclusions

The results of previous studies on etiologic distribution of isolated abducens nerve palsy should be interpreted with consideration of the demographic features of patients recruited and the specialties involved.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^92f91189]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy is one of the most common causes of ophthalmoplegia and may indicate benign to life‐threatening causes. The incidence of acquired oculomotor nerve palsy increases with age and peaks in the 70s and 90s age groups with an annual incidence at 3.71–4.0 per 100,000. Even though microvascular, traumatic and intracranial aneurysms are the most common causes of oculomotor nerve palsy, the proportion of etiology has been different amongst studies depending on the study population and the department where the recruitment of patients was performed. Previous studies were primarily undertaken in referral‐based neuro‐ophthalmological clinics run exclusively by ophthalmologists or neurologists, which would have resulted in a referral bias. Even though our hospital has neuro‐ophthalmological clinics run by ophthalmologists and neurologists independently but in close cooperation and consultation, it was previously found that only 37.9% of the patients with binocular diplopia as the primary symptom were managed by both neurologists and ophthalmologists in our institution. Furthermore, the etiological proportion of diplopia, trochlear palsy and abducens nerve palsy significantly differed between the clinics.

This study aimed to establish the clinical features and underlying etiologies of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy by recruiting patients from all departments for an 18‐year period in a referral‐based university hospital in the Republic of Korea. The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor palsy in the current study was also compared with that of pooled results from previous reports.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^280cfdab]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — imaging indications and modality: Routine imaging at the time of initial diagnosis is discouraged, but there is a distinct role for imaging when suggestive history or physical findings are present or if paralysis fails to recover or worsens; any presentation inconsistent with Bell's palsy should be further evaluated by imaging. Features atypical of Bell's palsy include a second paralysis on the same side, paralysis of isolated facial nerve branches, other cranial nerve involvement, or no sign of recovery after 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire facial nerve course, with and without contrast, is the imaging test of choice in these circumstances; imaging should include the internal auditory canal (IAC) and face, and if MRI is contraindicated, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can be used.

### Benign recurrent sixth (abducens) nerve palsies in children [^98c8fe90]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Sixth nerve palsy can occur as a result of elevated intracranial pressure, neoplasm or trauma. Reports from tertiary centres indicate that between 5% and 16% of referred cases have no ascribed aetiology and are classified as benign. Rarely, these benign palsies can recur. A retrospective chart review of a cohort of 253 paediatric patients with sixth nerve palsies was analysed and uncovered 30 cases of benign sixth nerve palsy, nine of which recurred. Our data and review of other studies on the subject imply that a new onset sixth nerve palsy presenting in children can be benign in approximately 13% of cases, so a thorough history and physical examination to evaluate for any other neurological symptoms or signs followed by MRI of the brain with and without contrast is recommended.

### Isolated contralateral abducens palsy in direct carotid-cavernous fistula [^957ff839]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Post-traumatic direct carotid-cavernous fistulas may develop in patients with a closed head injury. The classical presentation is the Dandy's triad-chemosis, pulsatile proptosis and orbital bruit. Associated findings may include orbital pain, dilated episcleral corkscrew vessels, vision deficit and cranial nerve palsies. Cranial nerves-oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), ophthalmic (V1), and maxillary (V2) divisions of trigeminal and the abducens (VI) lie in close association of the cavernous sinus. Abducens nerve (VI) lies close to the intracavernous internal carotid artery, within the substance of the sinus and is hence easily susceptible to vascular insult. The two sinuses connect across the midline and communicate freely with each other. Back pressure changes can present with the same sided or bilateral cranial nerve palsies. We report a rare association of a long-standing left-sided carotid-cavernous fistula with right eye abduction deficit and contralateral abducens palsy.

### Isolated abducens nerve palsy associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a localizing sign of ruptured posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms [^86453a25]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Compressive cranial nerve syndromes can be useful bedside clues to the diagnosis of an enlarging intracranial aneurysm and can also guide subsequent evaluation, as with an acute oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve [CN] III) palsy that is presumed to be a posterior communicating artery aneurysm and a surgical emergency until proven otherwise. The CN VI has a short cisternal segment from the pontomedullary sulcus to Dorello's canal, remote from most PICA aneurysms but in the hemodynamic pathway of a rupturing PICA aneurysm that projects toward Dorello's canal. The authors describe a cranial nerve syndrome for posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms that associates subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and an isolated abducens nerve (CN VI) palsy. METHODS Clinical and radiological data from 106 surgical patients with PICA aneurysms (66 ruptured and 40 unruptured) were retrospectively reviewed. Data from a group of 174 patients with other aneurysmal SAH (aSAH) were analyzed in a similar manner to control for nonspecific effects of SAH. Univariate statistical analysis compared incidence and risk factors associated with CN VI palsy in subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS Overall, 13 (4.6%) of 280 patients had CN VI palsy at presentation, and all of them had ruptured aneurysms (representing 13 [5.4%] of the 240 cases of ruptured aneurysms). CN VI palsies were observed in 12 patients with ruptured PICA aneurysms (12/66 [18.1%]) and 1 patient with other aSAH (1/174 [0.1%], p < 0.0001). PICA aneurysm location in ruptured aneurysms was an independent predictor for CN VI palsy on multivariate analysis (p = 0.001). PICA aneurysm size was not significantly different in patients with or without CN VI palsy (average size 4.4 mm and 5.2 mm, respectively). Within the PICA aneurysm cohort, modified Fisher grade (p = 0.011) and presence of a thick cisternal SAH (modified Fisher Grades 3 and 4) (p = 0.003) were predictors of CN VI palsy. In all patients with ruptured PICA aneurysms and CN VI palsy, dome projection and presumed direction of rupture were directed toward the ipsilateral and/or contralateral Dorello's canal, in agreement with laterality of the CN palsy. In patients with bilateral CN VI palsies, a medial projection with extensive subarachnoid blood was observed near bilateral canals. CONCLUSIONS This study establishes a localizing connection between an isolated CN VI palsy, SAH, and an underlying ruptured PICA aneurysm. CN VI palsy is an important clinical sign in aSAH and when present on initial clinical presentation may be assumed to be due to ruptured PICA aneurysms until proven otherwise. The deficit may be ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral and is determined by the direction of the aneurysm dome projection and extent of subarachnoid bleeding toward Dorello's canal, rather than by direct compression.

### Isolated abducens nerve palsy: update on evaluation and diagnosis [^78f61e90]. Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, abducens nerve palsy can be caused by diabetes mellitus type 2, intracranial mass, cavernous sinus thrombosis, orbital fracture, intracranial hypertension, Lyme disease, neurosyphilis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, tuberculous meningitis, intracranial aneurysm, cryptococcal meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, multiple sclerosis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, acute bacterial meningitis, invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, central nervous system vasculitis, meningioma, giant cell arteritis, brain metastasis, acute ischemic stroke, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, gradenigo-Lannois syndrome, pituitary apoplexy, Chiari malformation, basilar artery thrombosis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, hypertensive crisis, myasthenia gravis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and thyroid eye disease.

### Unilateral third nerve palsy caused by Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^b4a7f370]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Highly asymmetric clinical signs in a patient suggest the need for caution in making the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).

Methods

Case report and literature review. We present a case of strictly unilateral left third cranial nerve palsy in a patient with GBS, review other highly asymmetrical cranial nerve palsies previously reported in this condition, and suggest an appropriate alternative differential diagnosis.

Conclusion

Unilateral third cranial nerve palsy is an exceptionally rare manifestation of GBS, expanding the spectrum of clinical signs and neuraxis involvement that may be seen in the condition.

### Periodic abducens nerve palsy in adults caused by neurovascular compression [^6130e2ab]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Unilateral abducens nerve palsy with periodic recurrences is a well-recognised finding in children, but is rare in adults. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism is unknown. Vascular compression of the nerve is suspected but never demonstrated. We describe an adult patient with, altogether, 11 periods of unilateral right-sided abducens palsy and arterial contact at the root exit zone of the symptomatic side.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^40aa386f]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our patients with isolated oculomotor nerve palsy more frequently visited the emergency department first than those with isolated trochlear or abducens nerve palsy (42.5% vs. 17.8% vs. 30.1%, Figure 6b). This may be explained by a higher proportion of etiologies causing acute or subacute onset of diplopia such as vascular anomalies (17.4% vs. 1.3% vs. 10.2%) and inflammation (12.5% vs. 1.5% vs. 9.4%).

Limitation

In this study, the etiology in 5.8% (39/672) of the patients initially recruited could not be determined due to an incomplete evaluation. This may have affected the relative proportion of etiologies in our patients with isolated oculomotor nerve palsy. Even though the distribution of patients with incomplete evaluation was similar across the age groups, the men‐to‐women ratio was higher in these patients than in those finally included for analyses (1.8 vs. 1.3). This selection bias may have affected the overall distribution of etiology and the sex ratio. Since this is a retrospective study performed in a single referral‐based hospital, the results may have differed from those observed in the general population. Finally, the comorbidities, details of the treatments and prognosis were not analyzed, which should be the subjects of future studies.

### Myasthenia gravis presenting as a unilateral abducens nerve palsy [^d471d695]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department of a large, urban, tertiary-care hospital complaining of double vision and unsteady gait. Physical examination was remarkable for an isolated, unilateral sixth nerve palsy. After comprehensive testing, a final diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was made. The patient's unsteady gait was a manifestation of sensory distortion from the diplopia and corrected when the patient closed his eyes. The presentation of myasthenia gravis as an isolated sixth nerve palsy is unprecedented in the emergency medicine literature.

### Isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy as the presenting symptom of a rapidly expanding ACTH positive pituitary adenoma: a case report [^d315d75f]. BMC Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The cavernous sinus contains the carotid artery as well as the oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal, and abducens nerves. Extraocular palsy generally indicates compression of the cavernous sinus wall or direct extension of the pituitary adenoma into the cavernous sinus. The incidence of ocular palsy occurring with pituitary tumors has been reported to be between 4.6 and 32%. Most commonly affected is the oculomotor nerve; rarely is the abducens nerve involved. A retrospective review of 64 patients hospitalized with pituitary adenoma found that a defect in ocular movement was present in 14% of patients, with oculomotor nerve involvement in 78% of cases. The sixth cranial nerve runs lateral to the internal carotid artery, but medial to the third, fourth, and first and second divisions of the fifth cranial nerves which run superior to inferior within the lateral dural border of the cavernous sinus. It is therefore more often spared because of its more sheltered position within the sinus. Our patient is unusual in that initially the sixth cranial nerve paresis was in isolation.

### Cavernous sinus apoplexy presenting isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy: case report [^633af471]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical and radiological findings of a patient affected by apoplexy of an adenoma located within cavernous sinus and presenting isolated Cranial Nerve (CN) VI palsy are reported. The differential diagnosis with other pathologies is debated, and pathogenesis of isolated abducens nerve palsy is investigated. The pertinent literature of this uncommon case of apoplexy is reviewed. A 59-year-old female presented sudden appearance of CN VI palsy associated to violent headache. Endocrinological assessment did not show pituitary insufficiency; MRI depicted an adenoma located within the left CS. She underwent an endoscopic endonasal procedure with extensive opening of the cavernous sinus, occupied by an ischemic adenoma. Afterward, neurological symptoms promptly resolved and the patient was discharged after 5 days. At 3 months follow-up MRI radical tumor removal was assessed, and the patient resulted neurologically intact. The review of the pertinent literature shows that apoplexy of pituitary tumor exclusively located within the Cavernous Sinus is a very uncommon event. The distinctive clinical presentation is represented by the sudden abducens nerve palsy and the absence of pituitary insufficiency and it could be explained by the vulnerability of the nerve along its course within the cavernous sinus, and by the sparing of the sellar content by the adenoma.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^e9382edd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6 supply extraocular muscle movement. Their pathology affects both the motor and autonomic nervous systems. In an analysis of existing research on the long-term outcomes of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy, we found a diverse landscape of research findings.

Our data corroborates those of previous studies, indicating that abducens nerve palsy is the most frequently encountered among the three nerves, whereas trochlear nerve palsy exhibits a lower prevalence. However, recently reported incidence rates in the Korean population present a different perspective, with trochlear nerve palsy being the most common and oculomotor nerve palsy the least common. These regional disparities underscore the significance of geographic factors in the distribution of cranial nerve palsies and emphasize the need for clinical evaluations and research to consider such variations.

We conducted a literature review on the etiologies of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy, categorized according to the most extensive literature reviews of 4278 subjects from the previous study(Table 4). The etiologies varied across the studies for many reasons. First, the evolution in investigation lessens the undetermined etiology. Second, studies in different regions may reflect other disease distributions. Finally, even at the same institution, different data collection times led to various etiologies, implying an actual change.

Table 4
Compared Etiologies of Isolated Third, Fourth, and Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy (%)

Our data showed that the overall recovery rate was 38.5%, which is comparable with previous reports (range, 38–80%). The recovery rate varied across studies due to data collection methods. Moreover, the rate depended on the criteria used for recovery measurement. Some studies used follow-up letters or telephone calls to collect data, which might not accurately reflect total recovery. In our research, ophthalmologists evaluated all patients, asked for symptoms, and measured ocular deviation at every visit, which might have resulted in excellent reliability regarding accurate recovery.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^8b25db13]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Abducens palsy (6th nerve palsy) in adults — presentation, causes, and natural history: It typically presents with an acute onset of horizontal double vision, worse at distance than at near and worse laterally toward the side of the affected nerve. The majority of acute 6th nerve palsies in the adult population are vasculopathic, associated with risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, and most palsies resolve after 6 months, with about one-third resolving within 8 weeks; if no recovery is apparent by 6 months, approximately 40% of patients demonstrate a serious underlying pathology warranting further evaluation. Other common causes are trauma and neoplasm; traumatic etiology may include a basilar skull fracture or an acute rise in intracranial pressure from an intracranial bleed, and a 6th nerve palsy caused by an intracranial neoplasm may be either insidious or acute. Postviral 6th nerve palsy is typically a diagnosis of exclusion and has been described with COVID-19 infection and post COVID-19 vaccination.

Literature review

A literature search was conducted on PubMed in May 2022 using the combination of terms "cause(s) or etiology" and "oculomotor (nerve) palsy". Fourteen articles that included more than 50 patients with a clear classification of the etiology of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy were found.

Comparison with isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsy

The results of this study were compared with those of our previous reports on isolated trochlear palsy and isolated abducens nerve palsy performed in the same institution with the same methods during the same period.

Statistical analyses

The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the age between men and women and the preferential involvement of each eye. The chi‐squared test was adopted to compare the proportion of etiologies between men and women and between the current study and pooled data, the proportion of involved specialists according to age and etiology, the proportion of involved specialists amongst oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerve palsies in our institution, the proportion of patients who visited the emergency department first according to clinical features, and the proportion of patients who visited the emergency department first amongst oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerve palsies in our institution. All these tests were performed using SPSS (version 25) and p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Bonferroni correction was applied for post hoc analyses and multiple comparisons, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Recurrent contralateral abducens nerve palsy in acute unilateral sphenoiditis [^e40a3c7a]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We describe a patient who presented with recurrent, contralateral abducens nerve palsy resulting from acute sphenoiditis.

Methods

Patient medical record and imaging studies were reviewed. A literature review of complications of sphenoiditis was performed.

Results

Our patient presented with symptoms consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection, as well as severe headache, disequilibrium, and diplopia. Physical examination demonstrated left-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. Imaging studies were consistent with right sphenoid sinus inflammatory disease. Her medical history was significant for a similar episode 9 years previously, which was managed medically. The current episode was treated acutely with antibiotics and prednisone. Upon resolution of her symptoms, she underwent an endoscopic sphenoidotomy.

Conclusions

Although cranial nerve palsies associated with isolated sphenoiditis have been reported, we describe a unique case of recurrent isolated sphenoiditis causing contralateral abducens nerve palsy. Acute management can be medical, with surgical therapy reserved for refractory cases or to prevent future episodes.

### Isolated acute sphenoid sinusitis presenting with hemicranial headache and ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy [^6e0d255a]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Isolated sphenoid sinusitis is a rare disorder and may present with complications due to its anatomical location and proximity to the intracranial and orbital contents. It is frequently misdiagnosed, because the sphenoid sinus is not visualised adequately with routine sinus radiographs and is not accessible to direct clinical examination. We report a case who presented with hemicranial headache and ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy as the presenting feature of sphenoid sinusitis. The symptoms disappeared within a week of conservative treatment. Sphenoid sinusitis should be kept in the differential diagnosis of isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy, especially in the presence of headache, and all patients should be investigated with CT/MRI brain. Prompt diagnosis and management before intracranial extension can prevent devastating complications.

Comparison with isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsy

The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy also differed from those isolated trochlear and abducens nerve palsies in our study cohort (p < 0.001, Figure 6a). The proportion of microvascular etiology was higher in isolated abducens nerve palsy (oculomotor vs. trochlear vs. abducens; 26.5% vs. 20.8% vs. 36.7%) whilst those of idiopathic (9.5% vs. 25.1% vs. 17.7%), congenital (4.1% vs. 32.4% vs. 1.2%) and traumatic (8.4% vs. 14.2% vs. 4.3%) etiology were higher in isolated trochlear palsy, and vascular anomalies (17.4% vs. 1.3% vs. 10.2%) were higher in isolated oculomotor nerve palsy. Patients with oculomotor nerve palsy more frequently visited the emergency department first than those with isolated trochlear or abducens nerve palsy (42.5% vs. 17.8% vs. 30.1%, p < 0.001; Figure 6b). The proportion of involved specialties also differed amongst the groups (p < 0.001, Figure 6c).

(c) The proportion of involved specialties differed amongst the isolated ocular motor nerve palsies. For all three nerve palsies, the ophthalmologists were mostly involved in the management, especially for trochlear nerve palsy. In contrast, the neurologists were more frequently involved in the care of oculomotor and abducens nerve palsies than trochlear palsy.

### Congenital isolated unilateral third nerve palsy in children: the diagnostic contribution of high-resolution MR imaging [^7bc8fe94]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the neuroanatomical correlates of unilateral congenital isolated oculomotor palsy by means of high-resolution MRI.

Methods

Children with a clinical diagnosis of congenital isolated oculomotr palsy and with a high-resolution MRI acquisition targeted on the orbits and cranial nerves were selected and included in the study. An experienced pediatric neuroradiologist evaluated all the exams, assessing the integrity and morphology of extraocular muscles, oculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerves as well as optic nerves and globes. Clinical data and ophthalmologic evaluations were also collected.

Results

Six children (age range: 1–16 years; males: 3) were selected. All patients showed, on the affected side (left:right = 5:1), anomalies of the III nerve and extraocular muscles innervated by the pathological nerve. One patient had complete nerve agenesis, two patients showed a diffuse thinning of the nerve, from the brainstem to the orbit and 3 patients showed a distal thinning of the oculomotor nerve, starting at the level of the cavernous sinus. In all cases atrophy of corresponding muscles was noticed, but the involvement of the affected muscles varied with the nervous pattern of injury.

Conclusions

High-resolution MRI represents a valuable tool for the diagnosis of III nerve anomalies in unilateral congenital IOP, showing different patterns of nerve involvement and muscular atrophy.

### Cranial nerve VII palsy as the first sign of cephalic tetanus after an earthquake… [^074c4a62]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

A 29-year-old man sustained right-sided periorbital and frontal scalp abrasions caused by falling cement during the January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti. Twelve days later, he developed weakness of the right side of his face. He received local wound care and intravenous cefazolin sodium. On physical examination, he had a subconjunctival hemorrhage and an isolated right-sided cranial nerve VII palsy. He reported pain in his jaw; however, he had a normal range of motion. Computed tomography of the head revealed no skull or jaw fractures. One day after discharge from the hospital, he noted difficulty in opening his mouth and new numbness on the right side of his face. His symptoms worsened over 7 days. He was evaluated at another hospital, where a gastric feeding tube was placed because of his inability to open his mouth.

On readmission to the hospital, a new cranial nerve V palsy, a new subtle cranial nerve VI palsy, and a persistent cranial nerve VII palsy were noted in addition to trismus and neck rigidity. His voice was soft; he experienced frequent left-sided facial spasms. Tetanus toxoid, tetanus immune globulin, and intravenous metronidazole phosphate were given. A second computed tomograph of the head showed no abnormalities. Results of cerebrospinal fluid testing were normal. The patient underwent surgical exploration and debridement of his wounds that revealed no persistent infection. He never required intubation. Over 16 days, his trismus, neck rigidity, and left-sided facial spasms resolved, and he was able to drink a liquid diet through a straw. A residual cranial nerve VII palsy persisted 21 days after hospital discharge. Gleeson T, Etienne M. Cranial Nerve VII Palsy as the First Sign of Cephalic Tetanus After an Earthquake.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^78d8553b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although various studies have explored the causes and clinical aspects of cranial nerve palsies, there remains a significant gap in understanding the prognostic factors that influence outcomes. In this study, we sought to address this gap by investigating the incidence, etiologies, clinical courses, and factors associated with long-term recovery, with the aim of enhancing the knowledge base in this field and providing valuable insights for improved patient care.

Patients and Methods

This retrospective study evaluated the data gathered from subjects who had third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy at the ophthalmology outpatient clinic of Phramongkutklao Hospital between April 1, 2012, and April 30, 2022.

Results

Among the three nerves, abducens nerve palsy was the most prevalent finding by most commonly involved. Our study revealed that ischemic and compressive lesions were the most common etiology of oculomotor nerve palsy, comprising 24.6% each. In addition, the most common etiology of trochlear and abducens nerve palsy was trauma, at 31.6% and 27.1%, respectively. Compared with the other nerves, oculomotor nerve palsy was associated with a shorter duration onset of symptoms and recovery period. The best recovery outcomes among the various etiologies were inflammation, ischemic events, and trauma in oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy, respectively. Logistic regression revealed that an onset of < 7 days and isolated nerve involvement were significantly associated with good long-term outcomes, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89) and 2.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39) adjusted for the type of cranial nerve palsy, aged at 50 years, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, onset at 7 days, and number of cranial nerves involved, respectively.

Conclusion

The onset of symptoms in less than 1 week and isolated nerve involvement were associated with better prognosis in subjects with third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^c49a3351]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy observed in this study was significantly different from that of the data pooled from the previous reports with a higher prevalence of neoplastic etiology and lower prevalence of microvascular, idiopathic and traumatic etiologies. Our previous study also showed etiologies of isolated abducens nerve palsy that were different from those of the previous studies. These findings seem to be related to a referral bias since our hospital is less frequently involved in the management of traumatic patients.

The etiological distribution differed amongst the groups of isolated ocular motor nerve palsy recruited from our institution over the same period. These differences may be due to the anatomical and physiological characteristics of each ocular motor nerve. The oculomotor nerve passes between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries, and runs inferolateral to the posterior communicating artery to enter the roof of the cavernous sinus. These characteristics may lead to a higher proportion of vascular anomalies amongst the etiologies. Each ocular motor nerve may have different vulnerabilities to microvascular ischaemia due to different blood supplies. Since the trochlear nerve has the longest intracranial course and smallest diameter, and passes the free edge of the tentorium, it would be more susceptible to injuries associated with head trauma than other ocular motor nerves.

The specialties involved in the management of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy differed markedly depending on the etiology. This finding is similar to that observed in our previous studies on isolated trochlear and abducens palsies. However, the proportion of involved specialists differed markedly amongst the isolated ocular motor nerve palsies (Figure 6c). Even though the ophthalmologists were mostly involved in the management of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy (75.0%), the proportion of involvement was lower than that in isolated trochlear palsy (82.5%) and higher than that in isolated abducens nerve palsy (71.4%, p < 0.001). This discrepancy seems also related to differences in the proportion of etiologies amongst the groups, especially the lower proportion of congenital etiology in isolated oculomotor and abducens nerve palsies.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^86bdc3a2]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy and Guillain-Barré syndrome with immune checkpoint inhibitors — presentation, timing, and associations: Peripheral neuropathies may present as painful small fiber sensory type, cranial neuropathies, or sensorimotor forms typical of immune-mediated phenomena such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is more common in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 or combination anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 ICIs than with anti-PD-(L)1 ICIs alone. Guillain-Barré syndrome can develop soon after ICI therapy begins, usually within the first 3 cycles, with early lower back or thigh pain followed by ascending weakness, sensory loss, and areflexia; facial weakness and extraocular movement impairment may occur, and nerve root enhancement and thickening may be seen on imaging. Other acute neuropathies include painful sensory neuropathy and isolated cranial mononeuropathies (especially facial and abducens nerves), and patients with painful neuropathies may require pain management.

### Parkinson syndrome: a precise localization for abducens palsy [^6051a333]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Unilateral isolated abducens palsy can occur due to any lesion from pons to orbit. The precise localization is made through the associated neurological signs. Parkinson syndrome is a symptom complex of unilateral abducens palsy with ipsilateral postganglionic Horner syndrome localizing the lesion to posterior cavernous sinus.

Results

We describe here a 55 year old lady who presented with headache and diplopia for 3 months. On examination she had right lateral rectus palsy and postganglionic Horner syndrome. No other neurological deficit was present. MRI brain and MRA of intracranial vessels showed aneurysm of the right cavernous internal carotid artery which was confirmed on cerebral angiography. Endovascular coiling was advised but refused by the patient and she was treated symptomatically

Conclusions

Parkinson syndrome gives precise localization to unilateral abducens palsy and hence is a valuable clinical pearl.

Etiologies Correlation with Recovery Rate

Among the various etiologies of nerve palsy, our study showed that inflammation had the best recovery rate in oculomotor nerve palsy as shown in Table 2, patients experiencing ischemic events had the best recovery in trochlear nerve palsy and trauma in abducens nerve palsy. Among the groups, the two proportions revealed traumatic causes in trochlear nerve palsy, which had a statistically significant difference compared with abducens nerve (p = 0.00). Comparatively, there was a considerable difference in idiopathic etiology between trochlear nerve palsy and oculomotor and abducens nerve, with p values of 0.001 and 0.026, respectively.

Table 2
Recovery Rates by Etiology

As shown in Table 3, we combined the three nerve palsy groups for logistic regression analysis. Our study revealed that an early onset of < 7 days and isolated cranial nerve palsy were significantly associated with complete recovery at an adjusted odds ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89) and 2.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39), respectively.

### Acquired infantile abducens palsy associated with anti-GM2 antibodies [^8c6ac15a]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-ganglioside antibodies have been associated with acquired neuropathies, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. We describe a case of acute abducens nerve palsy acquired 2 weeks after symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and rash in a 6-month-old. Elevated anti-GM2 ganglioside immunoglobulin M antibodies were detected in the serum. The palsy slowly improved over time, although eventually surgical intervention was required. Elevated anti-GM2 immunoglobulin M antibodies have previously been reported in Guillain-Barré syndrome variants involving sensory and cranial neuropathies, but never in isolated unilateral cranial nerve VI mononeuropathy. Anti-ganglioside antibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of postinfectious isolated abducens palsy in young children.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^19ee95f1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cranial Nerve Palsy

Due to COVID-19, paralysis of the third, fourth, sixth and seventh cranial nerves has been observed. They may occur as primary, isolated paralysis, but also in the context of broader conditions such as Miller Fisher syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome or myasthenia gravis.

Cases of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy have been reported, both with and without pupillary involvement. Similarly, isolated abducens nerve palsy has been reported associated with COVID-19. There are also known cases of unilateral trochlear nerve palsy with contralateral tonic pupil, as well as bilateral palsy of this nerve in the course of cerebral vasculitis associated with COVID-19.

Cases of isolated facial nerve palsy associated with COVID-19 have also been reported. Lima et al also described palsy of the VII nerve coexisting with ipsilateral VI nerve palsy.

Drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulins have been used in treatment of COVID-19-related cranial neuropathies. However, there is no clear data on the benefits of the treatment. These neuropathies also appear in the context of Miller Fisher and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Dinkin et al described a patient with COVID-19 in whom the use of intravenous immunoglobulins led to partial improvement of deficits associated with presumed Miller Fisher syndrome. Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al reported a similar case with Miller Fisher syndrome in which most of the deficits resolved after intravenous infusion of immunoglobulins. Sansone et al showed that among patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2, the first neurological symptoms appeared approximately 10 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms.

Additionally, it has been reported that COVID-19 may be responsible for the emergence of new cases of myasthenia gravis. Restivo et al described in detail three patients whose myasthenic symptoms appeared 4–7 days after the initial symptoms of COVID-19.

### Neuroimaging and acute ocular motor mononeuropathies: a prospective study… [^608910d4]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Therefore, we performed a prospective study to determine the utility of neuroimaging in detecting causative lesions in patients with acute isolated cranial nerve III, IV, and VI palsies referred to a single neuro-ophthalmology practice over 15 months. Four of the 93 patients had identifiable abnormalities on neuroimaging. These were considered to be incidental findings in 3 patients, including 2 whose MRI findings were on the side opposite their CN VI palsies and a third patient with an inverted papilloma in the maxillary sinus ipsilateral to his CN VI palsy without evidence of extrasinus extension on MRI and at the time of sinus surgery. Another report describes 2 patients, 1 with intracranial plasmacytoma and 1 with multiple myeloma who initially had isolated CN VI palsy before progressing to involvement of other CNs.

13 Although these patients may not have been imaged initially according to the traditional teaching, involvement of other CNs would have mandated imaging in these patients as well. A third case report describes an isolated CN IV palsy as a result of midbrain hemorrhage.
12. Furthermore, although only neurologically isolated mononeuropathies were said to be included, no specifics were provided. Five of the patients were found to have metastatic lesions. It is unclear whether the CN VI palsy was a manifesting sign of the underlying cancer or whether these patients had previously diagnosed cancers. Four of 66 patients with potentially treatable causes is considerably higher than in our study. One explanation may be that their patients had highly unusual clinical manifestations.

One patient in the study by Chou and colleagues was found to have pituitary apoplexy that manifested as an isolated CN VI palsy, which is uncommon enough to warrant a case report in the literature. Likewise in this situation, the CN VI palsy does not remain isolated. 17 Additionally, 2 patients, 1 with an isolated CN III palsy and 1 with a CN VI palsy, were found to have brainstem infarctions. Although these manifestations of brainstem infarction have been described, they are also very uncommon. 10, 18 The 66 patients included in the study by Chou and colleagues were gathered over a 5-year period as opposed to the 93 patients gathered over 15 months in our study.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^3462ea6f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When ocular motor nerve palsies (OMNP) cause patients to present in a neurological clinic, a broad differential diagnostic procedure is necessary to distinguish between the various heterogeneous etiologies. They include a wide range of causes such as inflammations, space-occupying lesions such as neoplasms and aneurysms, ischemia or trauma. According to the literature, the abducens nerve (CNP VI) is the second most affected cranial nerve (CNP) after the facial nerve with an annual incidence of about 11.3/100000. In most previous studies the mere presence of risk factors — such as diabetes, hypertension, old age or obesity — was considered to be sufficient to assign the palsies to a cause, in particular of vascular origin. Large retrospective studies with 4278 patients date back to the 1990s and could not take advantage of currently broadly available diagnostic tools. Diagnostic procedures such as MRI-based neuroimaging and, if possible, CSF analysis offer a more straightforward opportunity to define the etiology of OMNP. In the literature, there is large variation in the reported etiologies of OMNP, e.g. the frequency of neoplasms causing oculomotor nerve palsies varies between 1 and 13% in previous reports. In addition, according to the available literature, between 16 and 31% of all OMNP could not be assigned to a specific etiology and were, therefore, defined as idiopathic. In this study of 502 OMNP patients, we analyzed data in the setting of a Neurological University Clinic where state of the art MRI techniques and, if necessary, detailed CSF studies were prospectively used for differential diagnosis.

Neuroanatomic localization

The brainstem findings localize to a lesion in the left dorsolateral pontine tegmentum that disrupts the left abducens nucleus producing the left gaze palsy, the ascending fibers of the left medial longitudinal fasciculus resulting in a left INO, and the fascicles of the left facial nerve, whose dorsal trajectory wraps circumferentially around the homolateral abducens nucleus at the floor of the fourth ventricle, thereby producing the ipsilateral facial palsy (figure 2). The combination of an ipsilesional gaze palsy and ipsilesional INO is termed the 1½ syndrome. A 1½ syndrome in conjunction with a lower motor neuron facial palsy constitutes the "8½ syndrome".

Figure 2
Mid-sagittal FLAIR (A) and axial T2 (B and C) brain MRI demonstrated a new T2 hyperintense intraparenchymal lesion in the left dorsolateral pontine tegmentum, just ventral to the fourth ventricle (yellow arrow in A, white arrow in B, and the lesion outlined in red in C)

The white arrow in A is the caudal medullary lesion seen in figure 1, above. There were also T2 hyperintense lesions in the upper and lower thoracic spinal cord (not shown). In C, we characterize the localization of the left dorsolateral pontine tegmentum lesion and the neuroanatomic details responsible for the patient's complex constellation of clinical findings. The anatomic distribution of the lesion included the left CN 6 nucleus, responsible for the left gaze palsy, the left MLF producing the left INO (taken together constituting the 1½ syndrome), and the left fascicle of CN 7 as it loops around the CN 6 nucleus resulted in the left facial palsy (which when combined with the 1½ syndrome, we arrive at the so-called 8½ syndrome; in essence; 1½ + 7 = 8½).

### Bilateral abducens nerve palsy in an infant case of fulminant acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: a case report [^a0dea561]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The annual incidence of ADEM is presumed to be 0.8/100,000 persons. ADEM may begin abruptly, acutely, or over a period of a few days, typically within 1 to 2 weeks following an antigenic challenge. Neurological symptoms typically evolve over several days in ADEM, and alterations in consciousness may range from mild irritability or somnolence to prominent behavioral change or coma. There are no specific biomarkers currently available to diagnose ADEM, hence, diagnosis is made after excluding clinical and laboratory findings, and relies on suggestive neuroradiological features of ADEM.

To exclude hereditary metabolic diseases, blood ceruloplasmin and lactic acid levels were tested and were normal. CSF is usually normal, and a mild elevation of protein with lymphocytic pleocytosis may sometimes be found. Our case had mild elevation of CSF protein without abnormal cells. Some studies have suggested that bilateral thalamic lesions on MRI images may be diagnostic for ADEM. In our case, the brain MRI showed lesions in the pons, midbrain, medulla, bilateral thalamus, right frontal cortex, and left cerebellar hemisphere. The lesions in the bilateral thalamus were larger than 2 cm and tumefactive, which were the most important features for the diagnosis in our case. The diagnosis of our patient was based on his clinical presentation with fever, altered level of consciousness, motor deficits, and brain imaging findings, according to the revised ADEM definitions in 2013.

Signs of cranial nerve involvement are present in 20–37% of patient with ADEM, but ANP has not been reported. In our case, the child's eyeballs were able to move up and down, but not left and right following a light after he regained consciousness. After about 2 months, esotropia was observed and his eyeballs could not abduce horizontally. The lesions in the bilateral thalamus and pons still existed at the 6-month follow-up. The leisions in the dorsal part of pons are compatible with the locations of abducens nucleus. The lesions in the abducens nucleus were considered, acquired central BANP could be confirmed.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^58b4bdee]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes that a minority of facial paresis/paralysis cases have identifiable causes and should not be treated as Bell's palsy; approximately 70% of facial nerve palsies are Bell's palsy and 30% have other causes, so clinicians should take a comprehensive history, confirm the acute onset of symptoms, document other cranial nerve function, inquire about viral prodrome or hyperacusis and underlying conditions (e.g., prior stroke, brain or parotid tumors, skin cancers of the head/face, trauma, recent infections), and perform a comprehensive physical examination including inspection of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, parotid gland, and head/face/cheek skin, ruling out ear infection, cholesteatoma, and vesicular rashes; atypical presentations (including bilateral facial nerve paresis/paralysis) may warrant additional specialized and more extensive laboratory testing, and clinicians should consider infrequent causes such as Lyme disease in endemic areas, sarcoidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, and leprosy; Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion and Table 7 outlines categories and distinguishing features of other causes, with disproportionate presentation among pregnant women and people with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or other upper respiratory illness.

Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

The most frequent cranial nerve involved was facial nerve involvement (38%, n = 51), followed by the optic nerve (35%, n = 48), cochleovestibular (12%, n = 16), and abducens nerve (10%, n = 14) (Fig. 3). Multiple cranial nerve involvement was rare occurring in 12% of patients. 52% had bilateral involvement. There was no association between cranial nerve, as most patients had isolated neuropathy (supplementary Fig. 1). Looking at cranial nerves palsy according to ICI class, we observed that most patients with facial nerve involvement were under anti-CTLA-4, 57% (n = 12). In addition, only patients on anti-PD-1/PDL-1 had oculomotor involvement (n = 13) (supplementary Table 3). No association was found between specific ICI and CNP-ICI (supplementary Table 4).

In 18% (n = 23) of patients, cranial nerve involvement was not isolated, manifesting itself secondarily as a symptom of neurological immune-mediated disorders: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (54%), Miller Fisher (8.3%) or others type (37%) (supplementary Table 5).

Among the other non-neurological irAEs presented by CNP-ICI patients (20%, n = 27) representing 44 events, 21% (n = 9) were uveitis, 18% (n = 8), hypophysitis, unspecified diarrhea or colitis in 13% of cases (n = 6) (supplementary Table 6).

### Cranial nerve palsies after shunting of an isolated fourth ventricle [^855fcfc4]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

An isolated fourth ventricle is characterised by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) trapping in the fourth ventricle. Although there is no consensus regarding treatment, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting of the fourth ventricle is an option. Complications include infection, mechanical irritation of the brainstem, malfunction and overdrainage. Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication and has been mostly described in children. We present two adult cases of abducens and facial nerve palsies occurring secondary to this procedure. Placement of a higher resistance valve brought about complete recovery in one patient while withdrawal of the catheter by a few millimetres led to complete recovery in the second patient.

Materials and Methods

Study Participants

We analyzed the data/hospital records of patients who underwent treatment for cranial palsy in an inpatient/outpatient clinic at Phramongkutklao Hospital between April 1, 2012 and April 30, 2022. We included subjects who visited the ophthalmology clinic at least four times in a year with all recorded data available, and we excluded subjects who visited the clinic fewer than four times in a year and who had incompletely recorded data.

We recruited 297 subjects with oculomotor nerve palsy, 152 cases of trochlear nerve palsy, and 338 cases of abducens nerve palsy. After excluding patients with incomplete data, the overall numbers of subjects included in the analysis were 65 cases of oculomotor nerve palsy, 57 cases of trochlear nerve palsy, and 176 cases of abducens nerve palsy, respectively.

This study was retrospective in nature and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Royal Thai Army (approval No. S027h/66_Exp).

Disease Definition

Oculomotor nerve palsy is defined as any presentation resulting from weakness of the oculomotor nerve, including exotropia, vertical misalignment, and ptosis with or without pupillary involvement. Trochlear nerve palsy is defined as any presentation that results from a weakness of the trochlear nerve, including vertical or torsional diplopia. Abducens nerve palsy is defined as any presentation resulting from weakness of the abducens nerve, including incomitant esotropia. The onset of symptoms refers to the duration between the onset of symptoms and the initial visit to the hospital. Oral corticosteroids are prescribed for treating inflammatory causes at our institution at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day for at least 2 weeks and a slower taper, depending on the case. There is no given treatment for ischemic etiology. Complete recovery is defined as the resolution of presenting signs and symptoms of the affected subjects. The entire ocular duction with orthotropia in the primary position is reserved for complete recovery of an ocular sign. An absence of clinical double vision was the favorable endpoint of symptoms. Partial recovery is defined as residual signs and symptoms at the endpoint.

### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus with acute retrobulbar optic neuritis and abducens nerve palsy: a case report [^2bb10c77]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO) refers to the viral infection affecting the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve, although this virus can also involve other branches of the nerve (V2-V3). Although the diagnosis of HZO does not always indicate eye involvement, ocular complications occur in approximately 50% of cases.

Ocular signs can be acute, chronic, or relapsing, and include conjunctivitis, keratitis (commonly epithelial), episcleritis, scleritis, uveitis, secondary glaucoma, cataract, and retinal necrosis. HZO may cause cranial nerve palsies, with the third nerve being the most commonly affected and the fourth nerve the least.

Involvement of the central nervous system is uncommon in VZV infections, and optic nerve involvement occurs rarely, typically in individuals with immune system deficiencies.

The combined involvement of the optic nerve and isolated paralysis of the eye muscle is very rare, with only limited case reports documenting this complication of ocular herpes zoster.

Here in, we present a case of right eye zoster followed by sixth nerve palsy and acute retrobulbar optic neuritis.

Results

Patient Demographics

Our study included 65 patients with oculomotor nerve palsy, 58 subjects with trochlear nerve palsy, and 177 with abducens nerve palsy. Table 1 presents the demographic data.

Table 1
Demographic Data of Cranial Nerve Palsy

Oculomotor Nerve Palsy

Subjects with oculomotor nerve palsy had a mean age of 50.34 years. The onset of palsy was approximately 14 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated nerve palsy. The most common etiologies were ischemic and compressive. The complete recovery rate of oculomotor nerve palsy was 35.4% and for those receiving strabismus surgery was 10.8%. In cases with full recovery, the average duration was 4.74 months.

Trochlear Nerve Palsy

The average age of patients with trochlear nerve palsy was 54.75 years, with a median onset of 90 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated involvement. The rate of acquired trochlear nerve palsy was 73.7%. Trauma was the most common etiology in this set of patients. Idiopathic etiology was ranked second. In this group, 26.3% had complete recovery and 21.1% received strabismus surgery due to inferior oblique muscle weakening. Among these groups, the average duration of recovery was 5.39 months.

Abducens Nerve Palsy

Abducens nerve palsy was the most common palsy among the three groups. The average age of the subjects was 48.71 years, with a mean onset of 84.25 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated involvement. Traumatic causes were the most common etiology in this population. The second and third most common etiologies were inflammation and ischemic, respectively. In our population, 44.1% had complete recovery and 14.3% received strabismus surgery. The average recovery time was 4.76 months.

### Temporary bilateral oculomotor nerve palsy as the sole presenting sign of a pituitary mass [^88ee22e2]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old patient presented with isolated bilateral third nerve palsy. Neuroimaging demonstrated a 2 cm pituitary mass with extension into the cavernous sinus on the right. The patient went on to experience spontaneous complete resolution of symptoms with associated radiological shrinkage of the mass. Bilateral third nerve palsy is a very rare presenting sign, with only one previous case reported in the literature secondary to a pituitary adenoma. Spontaneous resolution of non-functioning pituitary tumours is reported to occur in approximately 10% of cases. However, there are only a small number of reports to date involving spontaneous regression of tumours with corresponding resolution of cranial nerve palsies.

### Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: a unique presentation of Haemophilus influenzae type A meningitis [^bf78a58a]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

In this case report, we describe a unique case of Haemophilus influenzae type A meningitis in a 7-month-old previously healthy girl that presented with an isolated cranial nerve (oculomotor) palsy without other signs and symptoms classically associated with this entity such as fever, meningismus, or a generally ill appearance. Oculomotor nerve abnormalities are rare in pediatrics. Congenital oculomotor palsy is the most common cause followed by trauma, infection, inflammatory conditions, neoplasm, aneurysm or other vascular events, and ophthalmoplegic migraines, respectively. Therefore, had it not been for the unusual magnetic resonance imaging findings identified in this patient prompting an extensive infectious workup with lumbar puncture, the diagnosis and treatment of meningitis may have been delayed further or missed all together. This fact emphasizes the importance of maintaining a broad differential when children present with neurologic abnormalities such as cranial nerve palsies.

A 10-month-old boy was admitted with ptosis on the left eyelid, which rapidly occurred following a disease with rash about 20 days before admission to our hospital. By history, none of the vaccinations had been performed. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable, and he had marasmus. Isolated left oculomotor nerve palsy was diagnosed. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Serum IgM antibody to measles virus was positive. Oculomotor nerve palsy markedly improved on the 15th day of follow-up, and complete improvement was noted on the second month of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first case of oculomotor nerve palsy following measles.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) clinical assessment — Diagnosis is based on both the clinical presentation and a detailed history and physical examination. Typical symptoms include neck stiffness; pain in the cervical, thoracic or lumbar vertebral area; subjective hearing symptoms; visual disturbances; and vertigo. Headaches are frequently reported after childbirth, but only a minority may be attributed to PDPH. Headache may be worse with coughing or a Valsalva maneuver, and visual disturbances may be associated with cranial nerve palsy, with the abducens and facial nerve most affected, typically accompanied with diplopia and facial weakness.

### Noninvasive neuroimaging of basilar artery dolichoectasia in a patient with an isolated abducens nerve paresis [^e17ad7d3]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the neuroimaging findings in a patient with an isolated abducens nerve palsy caused by a dolichoectatic basilar artery.

Design

Retrospective case report.

Methods

A 65-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of gradually worsening horizontal double vision. He subsequently underwent magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomographic angiography.

Results

Neuroimaging revealed dolichoectasia of the basilar artery. The enlarged, tortuous vessel appeared to be compressing the subarachnoid portion of the nerve at its exit from the brainstem.

Conclusion

Noninvasive neuroimaging studies are sufficient to establish a diagnosis of basilar artery dolichoectasia in patients with isolated cranial neuropathies.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^18f1d3c3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cranial nerve palsy is a complex neurologic disorder that is characterized by the dysfunction of one or more cranial nerves, and it can vary in clinical presentation and course. Three cranial nerves, namely, oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, are vital in controlling eye movements. Their dysfunction can result in an imbalance in ocular control, resulting in binocular diplopia. As evidenced by various reports in the literature, the incidence of cranial nerve palsy varies among different regions. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence rates of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy among the Korean population are 3.71, 5.73, and 4.66 per 100,000 per year, respectively. These rates exhibit an age-dependent increase, accelerating notably after individuals reach 60 years of age. It is also noteworthy that these incidence rates are comparatively lower than those reported in the United States. The causes of these nerve palsies are diverse, encompassing ischemic events, trauma, aneurysms, and compressive lesions. Intriguingly, the distribution of etiological factors can vary, even within the same institution across different time frames. Moreover, the underlying etiology of these palsies is notably influenced by their clinical course, leading to a spectrum of outcomes that range from complete recovery to a lack of improvement.

Recent population-based studies have provided valuable insights into the etiologies of cranial nerve palsies. Oculomotor nerve palsy is predominantly attributed to microvascular causes, particularly in older adults. Pupillary involvement, although not specific to compressive lesions, is relatively rare. In the case of trochlear nerve palsy, evidence has revealed a bimodal distribution, with congenital factors prevalent in early childhood and vascular etiology more common in adults. In younger and adolescent patients, cranial nerve palsy typically has nonvascular origins. A retrospective series highlighted the prevalence of tumor-related causes in this demographic. However, the population-based literature often highlights a primarily congenital basis. High-resolution neuroimaging is pivotal in pathology demonstration and diagnostic support. Treatment modalities are tailored to the specific etiologies and are aimed at alleviating sequelae through interventions such as prism glasses, botulinum toxin, or strabismus surgery.

### A child with gradenigo syndrome presenting with meningism: a case report [^67604c9a]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms of meningitis which include fever, headache, photophobia and irritability along with abducens nerve palsy pose a diagnostic dilemma requiring urgent attention. Here we report how such a dilemma was methodically and sequentially resolved using anatomical knowledge supported by neuroimaging and the eventual diagnosis of Gradenigo syndrome was made.

Case presentation

A 6-year-old previously healthy boy from Sri Lanka presented with high grade fever, headache, photophobia and left eye pain for 10 days and diplopia for 2 days duration. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for left sided abducens nerve palsy. He had high inflammatory markers and white blood cell count. A tentative differential diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis complicated by cerebral oedema, acute hydrocephalus or cerebral abscess was made. However, non-contrast CT brain, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroencephalogram were normal leading to a diagnostic dilemma. MRI brain with contrast performed 3 days later due to limited resources revealed left mastoiditis extending to petrous temporal bone confirming Gradenigo syndrome.

Conclusion

This case report highlights the importance of a thorough physical examination in children presenting with unrelated neurological symptoms and signs. Unilateral abducens nerve palsy raises the suspicion of increased intracranial pressure and neuroimaging is vital in diagnostic uncertainties. Gradenigo syndrome emphasises the importance of incorporating anatomical knowledge into clinical practice.

Background

Sixth (abducens) nerve palsy (ANP) is far less frequent in children and has not been reported as a sign of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). We present an infant case of ADEM with bilateral abducens nerve palsy (BANP).

Case Presentation

We report one case of BANP in a 15-month-old boy of fulminant ADEM. The patient underwent physical examinations and brain MRI scan three times during about six months follow-up. The patient had BANP and developmental regression when he regained consciousness from a coma, and the signs had persisted for 6-months.

Conclusions

BANP can be a symptom of ADEM.

### Causes of isolated recurrent ipsilateral sixth nerve palsies in older adults: a case series and review of the literature [^9ddda727]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The differential diagnoses and workup of an isolated sixth nerve palsy usually depends on the age and the clinical circumstances of the patient. Patients younger than 50 years of age presenting with impaired abduction should undergo neuroimaging. If the results are normal, then 1) neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia; 2) eye muscle restrictive disorders, such as thyroid eye disease; 3) meningeal infiltrative and metastatic processes, such as leukemia and brainstem glioma; and 4) demyelinative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, need to be considered. In a study of 54 non-recurrent and 41 recurrent cases of pediatric idiopathic sixth nerve palsies, the risk factors for recurrence include: 1) female sex, 2) younger age, 3) left eye involvement, and 4) recent vaccination. Recurrence was less likely if it did not occur within 1 year of the initial presentation.

Unlike palsies in younger persons, isolated sixth nerve palsies in adults > 50 years of age are usually ischemic, and they typically resolve within 3 months. Neuroimaging is not required in these cases of isolated sixth nerve palsies in the clinical setting of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, but it is required if the sixth nerve palsy does not improve after 3 months. Other infectious and inflammatory causes, such as syphilis, collagen vascular disease, and sarcoidosis need to be ruled out with a lumbar puncture, blood testing, etc. Furthermore, neuroimaging is required especially when the isolated sixth nerve palsy is chronic and recurrent. In adults > 50 years of age, the differential diagnosis of an isolated chronic recurrent sixth nerve palsy most commonly includes the following: 1) vasculopathy,2) dolichoectasia/aneurysm,3) recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (previously termed ophthalmoplegic migraine),4) sphenoiditis,5) familial recurrent sixth nerve palsy, and 6) tumor. In the current retrospective case series over a 10-year period, we present further evidence that non-microvascular causes, such as neoplasms and aneurysms, may be more common in the isolated chronic recurrent ipsilateral sixth nerve palsies in patients > 50 years of age.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^6bb35809]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This study, having recruited the largest number of patients from all departments in a referral‐based university hospital, showed that the proportion of etiologies of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy depended on the age of the patients and specialties involved in the management. Overall, microvascular was the most common cause of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in men and the leading cause in the sixth decade and thereafter. In contrast, vascular anomalies were the most common cause in women and the leading cause in the fifth decade. Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy was more commonly managed by ophthalmologists than neurologists (75.0% vs. 61.9%) and was cared for by both ophthalmologists and neurologists only in 40.5% of patients.

### Isolated abducent nerve palsy after microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia: case report [^3039c4e2]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Microvascular decompression (MVD) is a safe and effective treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Isolated postoperative ipsilateral abducent nerve palsy is an extremely rare complication of this procedure and has not been reported before. The author wishes to report this rare complication, discuss its aetio-pathogenesis and the natural course.

Clinical Presentation

A 57-year-old man underwent MVD for right sided medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia based on the MRI finding of ectatic basilar artery compression at its root entry zone. The procedure was uneventful with complete relief of pain. However, he developed isolated ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy following surgery that lasted for six weeks.

Intervention

Anterior displacement of tortuous and dilated basilar artery to create space between the artery and the nerve during MVD operation probably resulted in inadvertent neuropraxia to the abducent nerve that was located immediately anterior to the artery but was not in the surgical field. Immediate sixth nerve palsy resulted post-operatively. A conservative route was adopted with spontaneous improvement of the extraocular eye movements after six weeks.

Conclusion

Isolated abducent nerve damage is a rare complication of the MVD procedure. Surgical manipulation of the dilated and tortuous vessels located anterior to the trigeminal nerve may cause indirect stretching of the delicate abducent nerve with resultant neuropraxia. This complication is difficult to recognize and prevent intra-operatively as the nerve lies on the far side of the artery. Fortunately, spontaneous recovery of the neural function seems to be the most likely outcome.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^0461b37c]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 504 patients admitted to the emergency unit of a Neurological University Clinic we analysed the assignment of oculomotor palsies to specific etiologies with the help of modern diagnostic tools, such a MRI and — if possible — CSF analysis. Abducens nerve palsies represented with 40% the most frequent single OMNP in our patient cohort which is largely consistent with the literature. As in a previous study we less frequently observed multiple OMNPs (9.1%). A direct comparison with older studies was difficult, because often, different etiological categories were used. Inflammations for example, which played an important role in our study, were rarely mentioned as a separate etiological group in previous studies. In Fig. 4, the distribution of the etiological categories within the individual OMNPs is shown.

Fig. 4
Proportion of the etiological categories in patients with CNP III, CNP IV, CNP VI, and multiple OMNPs

The most common cause of CNP III in our study were inflammations (27.2%), followed by space-occupying lesions (20.4%) and brainstem infarctions (19.7%). Only 15.7% of CNP III could not be attributed to any cause; therefore, significantly less palsies were described as idiopathic than in CNP IV (p = 0.0001) and CNP VI (p = 0.0104). The number of idiopathic palsies was lower than in most older studies, but there were also studies that classified only 10–11% of the CNP III as idiopathic, whereas we found significantly more inflammations and brainstem infarctions than in these studies.

Bell's palsy — clinical overview from the abstract describes that Bell's palsy is the most common acute mono-neuropathy and the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis; it is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause that leads to partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side; although typically self-limited, it may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and inability to close the eye with potential eye injury; many available diagnostic tests are of questionable benefit, and misdiagnosis or unnecessary delay in diagnosis are concerns.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^1c86f94c]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Classification of the etiologies

The etiologies of the oculomotor nerve palsy were classified into microvascular, vascular anomalies, neoplastic, inflammatory, traumatic, congenital, vascular, infectious, recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy, iatrogenic, central demyelination, Fisher syndrome and idiopathic. Microvascular oculomotor nerve palsy was diagnosed when the ophthalmoplegia was of an acute onset with a spontaneous recovery within 1 year in adults (≥ 20 years) with at least one vascular risk factor (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or smoking), and when there were no lesions that may explain the oculomotor nerve palsy on MRIs and no other disorders that may explain the oculomotor nerve palsy better. Vascular anomalies were diagnosed when the oculomotor nucleus, fascicle or nerve was affected by vascular malformation (e.g. intracranial aneurysm, dural arteriovenous fistula, cavernous malformation or arteriovenous malformation). Inflammatory etiology was presumed when MRIs demonstrated T2 hyperintense and gadolinium‐enhanced lesions affecting the oculomotor nucleus, fascicle or nerve (e.g. Tolosa–Hunt syndrome) and the symptoms responded to steroid treatments. A traumatic cause was defined when there was a documented onset of oculomotor nerve palsy following head trauma and no other disorders to explain the oculomotor nerve palsy better. Congenital oculomotor nerve palsy was diagnosed when the patients had an infantile onset of ophthalmoplegia after excluding congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders, such as Duane syndrome and congenital Horner syndrome. Vascular etiology included ischaemic and hemorrhagic strokes not related to vascular anomalies. Infectious etiology was diagnosed when the clinical features and results of serology and cerebrospinal fluid analyses were consistent with a specific pathogen affecting the oculomotor nerve. Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy was diagnosed according to the criteria proposed in the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Central demyelination was defined as inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Fisher syndrome was diagnosed when the patients had a positive serum ganglioside antibody without a lesion on MRIs that may explain the ophthalmoplegia, and the ophthalmoplegia was not better accounted for by other etiologies. Finally, the oculomotor nerve palsy was classified as idiopathic when the etiology could not be determined even with appropriate evaluation for the etiology of oculomotor nerve palsy. Myasthenic or neuromuscular causes of ophthalmoplegia were excluded. The etiology assigned to each patient by the primary physician was reviewed by the authors (HJK and JSK) and was finally accepted when considered appropriate.

### MRI in isolated sixth nerve palsies [^2cf488b4]. Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

In previous studies the origin of the majority of isolated sixth nerve palsies was not clear or was ascribed to vascular disease. Our purpose was determine how frequently a causative lesion was demonstrated on MRI in patients with an acute unilateral sixth nerve palsy. We performed a prospective study of 43 patients using a standardised protocol. In 27 patients (63%) a lesion was identified on the initial MRI relevant to the sixth nerve palsy; 21 (49%) were found to have a tumour or tumour-like lesion; the frequency of presumed vasculopathy in this group was 15%. There were 16 patients (37%) with an initially normal MRI, of whom 10 (62%) had a history of vasculopathy, a significantly different proportion from the group of patients with a visible causative lesion. MRI after 3–6 months was normal in all patients with a normal initial MRI. We suggest that MRI should routinely be performed in patients presenting with an acute sixth nerve palsy, even those with evidence of a vasculopathy. If the symptoms regress spontaneously and there is a history of vasculopathy, follow-up MRI is not necessary.

### Extramedullary plasmacytoma masquerading as tolosa-hunt syndrome: a case report [^19172117]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Painful ophthalmoplegia due to extramedullary plasmacytoma is a rare initial manifestation of multiple myeloma. The present report describes a 48-year-old man who suffered an acute onset of retro-orbital pain, left abducens palsy and left facial hypoesthesia. In addition, he exhibited an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and partial responsiveness to corticosteroid treatment, all of which resemble the features of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Imaging studies revealed a multilobulated tumour invading the left sphenoid bone and sphenoid sinus, later confirmed as a plasmacytoma at pathology. Multiple myeloma was also diagnosed by bone marrow examination. After completion of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the patient has been free of symptoms for 10 months. Although cranial neuropathies with any combination of oculomotor, abducens, trochlear, ophthalmic and maxillary nerves may indicate a cavernous sinus lesion, neuropathies exclusive to the abducens and maxillary nerves may raise the possibility of extracavernous sinus origin. Cranial imaging is crucial in diagnosing painful ophthalmoplegia with additional minimal cranial nerve signs.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Bell's palsy, more specifically with respect to indications for specialist referral, AAO-HNS 2013 guidelines recommend to reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist patients with Bell's palsy who meet any of the following criteria:

- new or worsening neurologic findings at any point

- ocular symptoms developing at any point

- incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset.

### Extraocular cranial nerve palsies in children [^9c2a582d]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Visual disturbances resulting from acute nerve paralysis of the muscles controlling eye movements can be challenging to evaluate in the pediatric population. Children may not be capable of describing symptoms or providing an adequate history. Therefore, it is important to have an understanding of the anatomical course of the extraocular cranial nerves and clinical manifestations of their dysfunction. We report 2 cases of extraocular cranial nerve palsies and, in addition to an anatomical review, discuss the common etiologies of paralysis and the importance of ophthalmological and neurological follow-up to ensure optimal long-term visual function.

### Causes of isolated recurrent ipsilateral sixth nerve palsies in older adults: a case series and review of the literature [^bc32cae9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Sixth nerve palsies presenting in a chronic recurrent course are relatively uncommon. Although spontaneous resolution of a sixth nerve palsy is generally considered adequate evidence of a vasculopathic etiology and a clinical feature that indicates MRI is not necessary, spontaneous recovery of non-recurrent sixth nerve palsies has been reported in patients with skull base tumors. The clinical presentation of a chronic isolated recurrent diplopia from a sixth nerve palsy should prompt the neurologist or ophthalmologist to order an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium as part of the initial workup to rule out non-microvascular causes, such as neoplasms and aneurysms, that can increase morbidity and mortality in adults > 50 years of age. We suggest that if there is no recovery of the sixth nerve palsy 3 months after onset, or if it is fluctuating chronically over 6 months, then a petrous apex cavernous sinus of a parasellar lesion should be considered.

### Diplopia in a patient with carcinomatous meningitis: a case report and review of the literature [^7be3d3cc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

In a patient with a history of malignancy, an isolated neurologic sign or symptom may indicate metastasis to the central nervous system. To exclude this possibility, a lumbar puncture should still be performed after a nondiagnostic cranial computed tomography (CT) scan even in the absence of signs of infection. A case is presented of a 59 year-old man recently diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with the sole complaint of diplopia. Examination was unremarkable except for a left abducens nerve palsy. Cranial CT scan was normal but initial cerebrospinal fluid results were suggestive of carcinomatous meningitis, and cytology results later confirmed this diagnosis. A review of diplopia and carcinomatous meningitis is presented, along with a suggested conservative diagnostic algorithm for cancer patients presenting with neurologic signs or symptoms.

### Consensus disease definitions for ophthalmic immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^94659fb1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune-related mononeuritis of cranial nerves III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), VI (abducens)

Common: Mononeuritis of any one of the three nerves innervating the extraocular muscles typically presents with diplopia. This is horizontal for CN VI, mostly vertical for CN IV and can be a combination of both or be vertical-oblique in the case of CN III. The latter also innervates the pupil and levator palpebrae superioris muscle and, therefore, CN III palsy typically presents with ptosis and ipsilateral mydriasis. Eye pain or headache may also accompany inflammation or infarction of any of these CNs (online supplemental tables 9,10,11).

It should be noted that extraocular muscle abnormalities and binocular diplopia in the setting of ICI use are more typically related to immune-related MG or immune-related myositis than to mononeuritis of CNs. These are defined in the previously published irAE-N guidelines and should be carefully excluded.

In addition to an irAE, alternative causes of cranial neuropathy should be considered, including nerve compression and microvascular disease. Particularly in the case of a CN III palsy, urgent vascular imaging with CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography of the head should be performed to rule out an enlarging aneurysm. Once this is ruled out, an MRI of the skull base, cavernous sinus, and orbit with contrast and fat-suppressed sequences should be obtained to assess for inflammation anywhere along the course of these nerves. If an inflammatory cranial neuropathy is suspected, additional serologies may provide clues, as outlined. This may include testing for GQ1b antibodies particularly in the presence of multiple cranial neuropathies and other features of the Miller Fisher syndrome such as ataxia or areflexia.

A definitive diagnosis of an Eye-irAE affecting one of these CNs is made based on the presence of classic symptoms of nerve palsy, negative imaging for metastasis or aneurysm, and rapid improvement of symptoms with steroids. Treatment is typically with high-dose oral steroids with slow taper to prevent rebound.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^28a61e73]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study determined the demographic features, etiologies and subspecialties involved in the management of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in a large number of patients who had been recruited from all departments in a referral‐based university hospital from 2003 to 2020 when MRIs had been available for most of the patients. The main findings of this study may be summarized as follows. (i) Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy was more common in men than in women. (ii) Microvascular was overall the most common cause of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy, and was the leading cause in the sixth decades and thereafter. (iii) Vascular anomalies were the most common cause of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in women. (iv) The proportions of microvascular and inflammatory etiologies were higher in men than in women whilst those of vascular anomalies, neoplasm and trauma were higher in women. (v) Ophthalmologists were involved in the management of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in 75.0% and neurologists in 61.9% of the patients. (vi) Patients with oculomotor nerve palsy in association with peri‐orbital pain or headache more frequently visited the emergency department first. (vii) The etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy observed in the current study was different from that pooled from the previous reports.

### Pontine hemorrhage presenting as an isolated facial nerve palsy [^97f0cbc0]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case of an isolated facial nerve palsy in a young, otherwise healthy man who was found to have a pontine hemorrhage on computed tomography. Pontine hemorrhage is a rare cause of facial nerve palsy and has been reported in the literature as an isolated neurologic finding in only 1 other instance. This case reminds the emergency physician to remain vigilant for alternative causes of facial nerve palsy other than "idiopathic" Bell's palsy.

### Möbius syndrome redefined: a syndrome of rhombencephalic maldevelopment [^e525eb72]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the variable clinical picture of Möbius syndrome (MIM no. 157900) and to further understand the pathogenesis of the disorder.

Methods

A standardized questionnaire was submitted to 37 Dutch patients with Möbius syndrome. All underwent standardized neurologic examination with special attention to cranial nerve functions, motor skills, and facial and limb anomalies.

Results

Of 37 patients with facial paresis, 97% had bilateral and 3% had unilateral ocular abduction weakness. Further analysis showed isolated abducens nerve palsy in 9%, a conjugated horizontal gaze paresis in 48%, features of Duane retraction syndrome in 34%, and congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles in 9%. Other signs included lingual involvement (77%), dysfunction of palate and pharynx (56%), general motor disability (88%), poor coordination (83%), and respiratory abnormalities (19%).

Conclusion

Möbius syndrome is more than a cranial nerve or nuclear developmental disorder. It is a syndrome of rhombencephalic maldevelopment involving predominantly motor nuclei and axons, as well as traversing long tracts. The authors also noted gaze palsies, Duane retraction syndrome, feeding and respiratory problems, and poor motor development, suggesting a regional developmental disorder.

### Cranial nerve palsy in wegener's granulomatosis – lessons from clinical cases [^93426d05]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The problem of diagnosing vasculitic neuropathy is discussed based on case reports of two patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. One patient developed de novo 6(th) nerve palsy as an isolated relapse manifestation and the second patient a sequence of multiple cranial nerve palsies. Brain imaging with CT and MRI and the laboratory provided no clues suggesting active vasculitis. However, in both patients the neuropathies fully recovered in response to standard induction protocols of vasculitis. In the absence of organ-specific proof of vasculitis, these treatment decisions were guided by the overall clinical presentations. Cranial neuropathy may be the first obvious vasculitic manifestation preceding other organ disease, and since single reliable tests for its diagnosis are lacking, a multidisciplinary approach is advocated here to detect vasculitic manifestations in other organs.

### Clinical reasoning: woman with acute bilateral ophthalmoplegia [^fb9ca3a6]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

This is a case of a 75-year-old woman who presented with severe headache, left eye ptosis, and binocular diplopia and was found to have multiple cranial neuropathies on examination. This case reviews the localization and workup of multiple cranial neuropathies and emphasizes the importance of not prematurely narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Isolated trochlear nerve palsy with perimesencephalic subarachnoid haemorrhage [^5f581ff6]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Perimesencephalic subarachnoid haemorrhage is usually asymptomatic other than meningeal irritation sign. The authors report a case of subarachnoid haemorrhage at the quadrigeminal cistern showing ipsilateral trochlear nerve palsy and discuss the pathogenesis. A 71-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and acute myocardial infarction presented with diplopia. He underwent CT, which revealed subarachnoid haemorrhage at the left quadrigeminal cistern. Neurological examination revealed left isolated trochlear nerve palsy, with results otherwise normal. The diagnosis of perimesencephalic subarachnoid haemorrhage was established on neuroimaging. The amount of haemorrhage is related to symptoms. A dense clot in the quadrigeminal cistern might have been the cause of trochlear nerve palsy.

### Outcomes and factors associated with successful strabismus surgery for abducens nerve palsies: a retrospective study and literature review [^98693540]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The abducens nerve exclusively innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Abducens nerve impairment causes incomitant esotropia, which worsens its effect on ocular movement. Consistently, studies revealed that abducens nerve palsy is the most prevalent among cranial nerve palsies, surpassing oculomotor and trochlear nerve impairments. A recent study conducted in Korea revealed an estimated overall incidence rate of CN6 palsy of 4.66 per 100,000 person-years, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.26–5.08, within the general population. This incidence demonstrates an age-related pattern, escalating notably after 60 years of age and reaching its peak within 70–74 years of age, possibly associated with the age-dependent increase of vasculopathy diseases. Various factors, such as inflammation, infection, vasculopathy, and compressive lesions, were determined as potential etiological contributors to abducens nerve palsy.

Affected patients in acquired conditions suffer from binocular diplopia. Unresolved problems subsequently affect daily activities. Various modalities have alleviated double vision, including patching, prism glasses, botulinum toxin injection, and surgical treatment.

The recovery rate of abducens nerve palsy is approximately 44.1%–80%, and its overall recovery rate is reasonable compared with other ocular motor nerve palsy. Strabismus surgery recovers binocular diplopia in partial or nonrecovery cases. Surgical treatment depends on residual lateral rectus muscle function and ocular deviation degree. The surgical technique for maintaining lateral rectus function includes medial rectus recession with or without lateral rectus resection. Vertical rectus muscle transposition, either partial or full transposition, is the procedure of choice in the absence of lateral rectus muscle function or a more significant deviation. The success rate of surgical treatment is 25%–91%. Several studies have reported promising results, but more evidence is required to determine reliable prognostic factors that predict favorable surgical outcomes in these cases. These factors are crucial when developing treatment plans and conducting preoperative counseling.

Therefore, this study aimed to report the types of surgical procedures, long-term success rates, and factors that influenced successful outcomes of abducens nerve palsy in a tertiary hospital, considering relevant literature reviews.

### Lifetime risk, sex and age differences in annual incidence of ocular motor cranial nerve palsy in Japan for 2019 [^39579a46]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This nationwide population-based cohort study captures a comprehensive demographic profile of ocular motor cranial nerve palsy, including oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies, which induce paralytic strabismus with subsequent binocular vision disorders. The annual incidence rates of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies are 6.62, 2.61, and 8.14 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence rate is observed to increase with age and to be higher in men than in women (19.91 vs. 14.96). The lifetime risks of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens palsies are 0.50%, 0.19%, and 0.61%, respectively. Our results provide important information for addressing healthcare, particularly for older people, from social and public health perspectives.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^8efa619f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ocular motor nerve palsies (OMNP) frequently cause patients to present in an emergency room. In the following study, we report the differential diagnosis of OMNP by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF examination as a standard.

Method

We performed a data analysis of N = 502 patients who presented with oculomotor, trochlear, and/or abducens nerve palsy in the emergency room of the Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, between January 2006 and December 2019. We report clinical and MRI scan findings in all patients; furthermore, the CSF of 398 patients has been analysed.

Results

Abducens nerve palsies were most common (45%), followed by palsies of the oculomotor (31%) (CNP III) and trochlear nerve (15%). Multiple OMNPs were seen in 9% of our cohort. The most common causes included inflammations (32.7%), space-occupying lesions, such as aneurysms or neoplasms (17.3%), diabetes mellitus (13.3%), and brainstem infarctions (11%). Still 23.4% of the patients could not be assigned to any specific cause after differential diagnostic procedures and were described as idiopathic. One of three patients with an inflammation and 39% of the patients with space-occupying lesions showed additional cranial nerve deficits.

Conclusion

Inflammation and space-occupying processes were the most frequent causes of OMNP, although brainstem infarctions also play a significant role, in particular in CNP III. The presence of additional CNPs increases the probability of an inflammatory or space-occupying cause.

### Facial nerve palsy: etiology and approach to diagnosis and treatment [^5861ebbe]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Facial nerve palsy has a broad differential diagnosis and possible psychological and anatomical consequences. A thorough investigation must be performed to determine the cause of the palsy and to direct treatment. If no cause can be found, therapy with prednisone with or without an antiviral medication can be considered and begun as early as possible after onset of symptoms. Resolution and time to recovery vary with etiology, but overall prognosis is good.

### A child with gradenigo syndrome presenting with meningism: a case report [^f17422c9]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Gradenigo syndrome describes the triad of petrositis, unilateral abducens nerve palsy and pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. It serves as a classic example where the clinical features can be vividly described based on anatomy. However, as in this case, it can lead to a diagnostic dilemma. Unawareness of the condition and failure of proper clinical evaluation could result in delayed diagnosis and life-threatening consequences.

When a child presents with fever, headache and photophobia, central nervous system infections should be excluded. Nevertheless, when these symptoms are associated with unilateral abducens nerve palsy it is clinically alarming especially in a setting of limited availability of neuroimaging. In our patient normal non-contrast CT brain was reassuring however, could not identify the cause for abducens nerve palsy. Ultimate diagnosis was made by contrast enhanced MRI. Headache in our child was most likely due to mastoiditis and facial pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Mastoiditis with absent clinical findings such as tenderness over the mastoid process has been described in literature. The complaint of photophobia could be due to difficulties perceived due to diplopia and paralytic squint in abducens nerve palsy. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis was difficult to establish.

### Bell palsy: rapid evidence review… [^6d4ac8b2]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis Bell palsy should be suspected in patients with acute onset of unilateral facial weakness or paralysis involving the forehead in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities. 4 Alternative diagnoses should be considered in patients with bilateral involvement, sparing of the forehead, abnormal extraocular movements, hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo. These findings indicate an upper motor neuron lesion or a lesion involving more than just cranial nerve VII. 12 The differential diagnosis of Bell palsy includes structural lesions, infection, autoimmune conditions, stroke, and multiple sclerosis.
7. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Bell palsy presents as mouth droop, flattening of the nasolabial fold, inability to close the eye, and smoothing of the brow on one side of the face. 13 Symptoms of Bell palsy are rarely bilateral. 14 Symptoms typically develop acutely, peak within the first week, and gradually resolve over weeks to months.

Patients with Bell palsy experience a spectrum of symptom severity. The Sunnybrook scale and House-Brackmann scale are commonly used to classify symptom severity. House-Brackmann scale 15: ○ Grade I, normal: normal facial function in all areas. ○ Grade II, slight symptoms: slight weakness on close inspection, slight synkinesis, complete eyelid closure with minimal effort. ○ Grade III, moderate symptoms: Obvious but not disfiguring facial asymmetry, synkinesis is noticeable but not severe, may have hemifacial spasm or contracture, complete eyelid closure with effort, mouth is slightly weak with maximal effort. ○ Grade IV, moderately severe symptoms: Disfiguring facial asymmetry or obvious facial weakness, forehead cannot move, incomplete eyelid closure, mouth is asymmetrical with maximal effort.

○ Grade V, severe symptoms: only slight, barely noticeable facial movement, asymmetric facial appearance, forehead cannot move, incomplete eyelid closure, mouth has only slight movement. ○ Grade VI, total paralysis: no facial movement. Physical examination maneuvers to demonstrate the degree and extent of facial weakness include having patients raise their eyebrows, close their eyes, frown, show their teeth, and pucker their lips. Patients who can close their eyes tightly and wrinkle their forehead on the affected side should be evaluated for a central lesion. Treatment Figure 3presents a suggested app roach to the treatment of Bell palsy.
