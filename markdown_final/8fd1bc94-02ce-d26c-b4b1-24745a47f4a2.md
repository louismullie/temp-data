## Question

What are the typical symptoms of CHF in patients with right-sided heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients with right-sided heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining right-sided heart failure and its pathophysiology. Then, I should categorize symptoms by mechanism and organ system. Next, I will distinguish acute from chronic presentations and highlight key bedside findings. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list of typical symptoms and note important exceptions and mimics, anchoring each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Right-sided heart failure (RHF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of heart failure resulting from right ventricular dysfunction, typically due to pressure or volume overload, impaired contractility, or ventricular interdependence that restricts left ventricular filling and reduces forward flow, leading to systemic venous congestion and low cardiac output states [^5c6631e1] [^b3216a20] [^a87cd696].

> I will now examine the core symptom clusters, starting with systemic venous congestion. Peripheral edema is often the most prominent feature in chronic RHF, typically dependent and pitting, and can progress to anasarca in advanced disease. Abdominal fullness, bloating, and early satiety reflect hepatic and splanchnic congestion, while ascites and visible jugular venous distension with a prominent V wave indicate markedly elevated right atrial pressure and tricuspid regurgitation, and a positive abdominojugular reflex can unmask subtle venous hypertension at the bedside [^7a4cada7] [^101f776f] [^6682d11b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dyspnea. I initially thought dyspnea would be less prominent in isolated RHF, but wait, let me verify. Exertional dyspnea is common in RHF, often from reduced forward flow, hypoxemia, or ventricular interdependence limiting LV filling; orthopnea can occur from redistribution of venous return and pleural effusions, and trepopnea with right-sided pleural effusion has been described, so dyspnea remains a meaningful symptom even when pulmonary edema is absent in isolated RHF [^0a75dbd2] [^5b9ef57c] [^c60f7098].

> Next, I should review low cardiac output and end-organ underperfusion symptoms. Fatigue, weakness, and reduced exercise tolerance reflect decreased cardiac output and impaired oxygen delivery; cognitive complaints, cool extremities, and dizziness or presyncope signal hypoperfusion; in advanced RHF, cachexia and protein-energy malnutrition can develop from impaired absorption and a proinflammatory state, and patients may report abdominal discomfort from hepatic congestion and distension [^7a4cada7] [^0a75dbd2] [^aac45845].

> I need to check for arrhythmia-related symptoms because they are common in RHF. Palpitations are frequent due to atrial enlargement and atrial fibrillation, which are prevalent in chronic RHF and can precipitate hemodynamic deterioration; patients may also report irregular heartbeat or symptomatic episodes of rapid atrial arrhythmias that worsen congestion and low output [^7a4cada7] [^5f89c060].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations carefully. Right upper quadrant discomfort or pain from hepatic congestion is common, and in more severe or chronic cases, patients may develop congestive hepatopathy with cholestatic labs and even cardiac cirrhosis; nausea, early satiety, and abdominal distension reflect both hepatic and intestinal venous congestion and can contribute to malnutrition and cachexia over time [^50e6d0b8] [^7a4cada7] [^aac45845].

> I should double-check renal and cardiorenal features. Elevated central venous pressure impairs renal perfusion and can drive diuretic resistance; patients may report oliguria or worsening edema despite escalating diuretics, and worsening renal function is a marker of adverse prognosis in decompensated RHF, reinforcing the need to balance decongestion with perfusion [^77119d32] [^7a4cada7].

> Now, I will distinguish acute from chronic presentations so I don't overgeneralize. In acute RHF, edema may be initially absent, and patients more often present with abrupt dyspnea, hypoperfusion, cyanosis, cool extremities, tachycardia, and shock physiology; jugular venous distension with a prominent V wave, a right-sided S3, and a holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation are key exam findings, and pulmonary edema is not expected in isolated acute RHF, which should prompt consideration of combined disease if present [^6ea69793] [^c4d26763] [^b3216a20].

> But wait, what if the RHF is secondary to left-sided disease or pulmonary hypertension. I should confirm that many patients with RHF have concomitant left heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, in which case symptoms may blend, and dyspnea may be multifactorial; nonetheless, the predominance of peripheral edema, JVD, hepatic congestion, and abdominal symptoms still points toward a right-sided congestion phenotype even when biventricular failure is present [^e673e58f] [^c60f7098].

> Let me synthesize the typical symptom profile succinctly. The most characteristic symptoms of RHF include progressive peripheral edema, abdominal bloating or fullness with early satiety, fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, exertional dyspnea with or without orthopnea, right upper quadrant discomfort, palpitations or irregular heartbeat, and in advanced disease, cachexia and signs of end-organ dysfunction; these align with the pathophysiology of systemic venous congestion, ventricular interdependence, and low forward flow described in contemporary statements and reviews [^7a4cada7] [^101f776f] [^c60f7098].

> I should confirm the bedside correlates that help distinguish RHF at the point of care. Elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent V wave, a right-sided S3, a holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation at the left lower sternal border that intensifies with inspiration, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, ascites, and a positive abdominojugular reflex are classic signs that support a right-sided congestion syndrome and should be actively sought on examination [^101f776f] [^6682d11b].

> Hold on, I should verify important exceptions and mimics so we don't misattribute symptoms. Isolated RHF can occur with primary right ventricular cardiomyopathies, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary hypertension, and in such cases dyspnea may be prominent despite minimal edema early on; conversely, peripheral edema has a broad differential including venous insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome, and liver disease, so integrating JVP, exam, and imaging is essential to confirm a cardiac source of congestion [^e673e58f] [^c4d26763] [^6187c49a].

> In summary, after reviewing the pathophysiology and clinical descriptions, the typical symptoms of CHF in right-sided heart failure cluster around systemic venous congestion with peripheral edema, abdominal fullness and early satiety, hepatic congestion with right upper quadrant discomfort, low output fatigue and exercise intolerance, exertional dyspnea with positional variants, and arrhythmia-related palpitations, with the severity and mix of symptoms differing between acute and chronic presentations and between isolated RHF and RHF secondary to left-sided disease [^7a4cada7] [^101f776f] [^c60f7098].

Right-sided heart failure causes **systemic venous congestion** [^5c6631e1], producing **peripheral edema** (legs, ankles, abdomen) [^7a4cada7], **jugular venous distension** [^6682d11b], and **hepatomegaly with right upper quadrant discomfort** [^101f776f]. Patients often report **fatigue**, reduced exercise tolerance, and **early satiety or bloating** from abdominal congestion [^7a4cada7] [^aac45845]. Dyspnea can occur from impaired left ventricular filling due to ventricular interdependence [^b3216a20], and ascites or pleural effusions may develop in advanced disease [^7a4cada7] [^101f776f]. These symptoms reflect elevated right atrial pressure and reduced right ventricular output [^a87cd696].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations

Right-sided heart failure arises when the right ventricle cannot maintain adequate forward flow, leading to **systemic venous congestion** and reduced cardiac output [^5c6631e1]. The key mechanisms include:

- **Elevated right atrial pressure**: Transmits backward into the venous system, causing peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, and organ congestion [^7a4cada7].
- **Reduced right ventricular output**: Lowers systemic perfusion, causing fatigue and exercise intolerance [^7a4cada7].
- **Ventricular interdependence**: RV dilation can impair LV filling, contributing to dyspnea and reduced forward flow [^b3216a20].

## Clinical signs on physical examination

Physical examination commonly reveals:

- **Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)**: A hallmark of right-sided congestion [^6682d11b].
- **Peripheral edema**: Pitting edema in dependent areas [^101f776f].
- **Hepatomegaly**: Enlarged, tender liver from congestion [^101f776f].
- **Ascites and pleural effusions**: Advanced right-sided failure [^101f776f].
- **Right-sided S3 gallop**: Suggests RV dysfunction [^101f776f].
- **Holosystolic murmur**: Tricuspid regurgitation at the left lower sternal border [^101f776f].

---

## Differentiation from left-sided heart failure

Right-sided heart failure is distinguished from left-sided failure by its **predominance of systemic venous congestion** over pulmonary congestion. Left-sided failure typically presents with **pulmonary edema**, **orthopnea**, and **paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**, whereas right-sided failure features peripheral edema, JVD, and hepatic congestion [^7a4cada7] [^4fb4e8df].

---

## Progression and complications

Untreated right-sided heart failure can lead to **chronic venous congestion**, causing:

- **Congestive hepatopathy**: Hepatic fibrosis and impaired liver function [^50e6d0b8].
- **Cardiorenal syndrome**: Renal dysfunction from venous congestion and hypoperfusion [^77119d32].
- **Cachexia**: Protein-energy malnutrition from chronic congestion and inflammation [^0a75dbd2].
- **Arrhythmias**: Atrial fibrillation and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias [^7a4cada7] [^92e1a3c1].

---

## Conclusion

Right-sided heart failure presents with **systemic venous congestion** — peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, and hepatic enlargement — plus fatigue, exercise intolerance, and gastrointestinal symptoms from reduced perfusion and organ congestion [^7a4cada7] [^101f776f]. Recognizing these features and distinguishing them from left-sided failure is essential for targeted management and prevention of complications [^e673e58f].

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) — definitions and clinical scope are delineated as follows: RVD, defined as evidence of abnormal right ventricle (RV) structure or function, is associated with poor clinical outcomes independently of the underlying mechanism of disease across the spectrum of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF), after cardiac surgery, acute myocardial infarction (MI), congenital heart disease (CHD), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). To distinguish RHF from structural RVD, RHF is defined as a clinical syndrome with signs and symptoms of HF resulting from RVD, and RHF is caused by the inability of the RV to support optimal circulation in the presence of adequate preload. The statement provides evidence-based guidance on pathophysiology of RVD, assessment and evaluation of RV function, epidemiology and prognosis of RHF, and medical and surgical management of acute and chronic RHF, and proposes areas for future investigation.

American Heart Association scientific statement on right-sided heart failure (RHF) describes diverse causes including primary cardiomyopathies with right ventricular (RV) involvement, RV ischemia and infarction, volume loading from congenital heart disease and valvular pathologies, and pressure loading from pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension, with progressive RV dysfunction associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output, progressive end-organ damage from venous congestion and underperfusion, cachexia from poor absorption of nutrients, and a systemic proinflammatory state, and it is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by complex geometry, and multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

Background and Purpose

The diverse causes of right-sided heart failure (RHF) include, among others, primary cardiomyopathies with right ventricular (RV) involvement, RV ischemia and infarction, volume loading caused by cardiac lesions associated with congenital heart disease and valvular pathologies, and pressure loading resulting from pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension from a variety of causes, including left-sided heart disease. Progressive RV dysfunction in these disease states is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of RHF.

Methods

The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through September 2017. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or reference to contemporary clinical practice recommendations.

Results

Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output and progressive end-organ damage (caused by a combination of end-organ venous congestion and underperfusion), and cachexia resulting from poor absorption of nutrients, as well as a systemic proinflammatory state. It is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similarly, acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients presenting with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by its complex geometry. Multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. Pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated. Specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking.

Conclusions

RHF is a complex syndrome including diverse causes, pathways, and pathological processes. In this scientific statement, we review the causes and epidemiology of RV dysfunction and the pathophysiology of acute and chronic RHF and provide guidance for the management of the associated conditions leading to and caused by RHF.

Figure 11 — Management of acute right-sided heart failure (RHF) emphasizes hemodynamic assessment and sets specific targets and actions: Preload Optimization (RAP/CVP ≤ 12 mmHg) and Maintenance of perfusion (MAP ≥ 65). In volume depletion, careful fluid resuscitation is advised with NS 500–1000 mL IV bolus, and if volume overload persists with diuretic resistance, CVVH or UF for removing volume overload with diuretic resistance can be used. All management must be undertaken with an awareness of the patient's hemodynamic status, and if this status is not clear clinically, then invasive assessment/monitoring should be undertaken, with hemodynamic targets providing rough guidelines for tailored therapy.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) decompensation and chronic remodeling — Declining pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in the setting of high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is an ominous clinical finding; with an intact pericardium, right ventricular (RV) dilation compresses the left ventricular (LV) cavity, impeding LV filling and equalizing biventricular diastolic pressures, and although patients with chronic right heart failure (CRHF) may require higher RV end-diastolic pressure, reduced LV filling is more likely caused by RV dilation and ventricular interdependence than reduced RV forward output; increased transmural pressure from RV dilation with pericardial constraint impairs LV filling, and the combination of RV systolic and biventricular diastolic dysfunction reduces cardiac output, impairs coronary blood flow, and exacerbates peripheral and abdominal congestion; venous congestion also negatively affects hepatic and renal function; CRHF most commonly results from gradual increases in RV afterload caused by pulmonary hypertension (PH) most frequently from left HF, although chronic volume overload from right-sided lesions such as tricuspid regurgitation can also lead to its development; if the load persists, the RV transitions to a decompensated phenotype characterized by myocyte loss and replacement/fibrosis.

Right-sided heart failure — hepatic involvement and prognosis are described: patients with end-stage liver disease are at risk for the developing portopulmonary hypertension, which is associated with worse outcomes after liver transplantation; isolated and markedly elevated transaminases are more commonly caused by severely reduced cardiac output/cardiogenic shock and respond better to inotropes than diuretic therapy; increased serum ammonia is also associated with adverse prognosis in decompensated heart failure.

### The worst symptom as defined by patients during heart failure hospitalization: implications for response to therapy [^d17b3a00]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients perceive different symptoms of heart failure decompensation. It is not known whether the nature of the worst symptom relates to hemodynamic profile, response to therapy, or improvement in clinical trials.

Methods and Results

Patients in the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness trial were hospitalized with advanced heart failure, ejection fraction ≤ 30%, and at least 1 sign and 1 symptom of elevated filling pressures. Visual analog scales (VAS) for symptoms were completed by 371 patients, who selected their worst symptom as difficulty breathing, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, or body swelling and also scored breathing and global condition at baseline and discharge. The dominant symptom identified was difficulty breathing by 193 (52%) patients, fatigue by 118 (32%), and abdominal discomfort and swelling each by 30 (8%) patients, combined as right-sided congestion for analysis. Clinical and hemodynamic assessments were not different between groups except that right-sided congestion was associated with more hepatomegaly, ascites, third heart sounds, and jugular venous distention. This group also had greater reduction in jugular venous distention and trend toward higher blood urea nitrogen after therapy. By discharge, average improvements in worst symptom and global score were 28 points and 24 points. For those with ≥ 10 points in improvement in worst symptom, 84% also improved global assessment ≥ 10 points. Initial fatigue was associated with less improvement (P = 0.002) during and after hospitalization, but improvements in symptom scores were sustained when re-measured during 6 months after discharge.

Conclusion

In most patients hospitalized with clinical congestion, therapy will improve symptoms regardless of the worst symptom perceived, with more evidence of baseline fluid retention and reduction during therapy for worst symptoms of abdominal discomfort or edema. Improvement in trials should be similar when tracking worst symptom, dyspnea, or global assessment.

Acute right heart failure (ARHF) — clinical presentation includes that edema may initially be less prominent or absent, symptoms include shortness of breath resulting from diminished peripheral oxygen delivery and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and examination signs include increased jugular venous pressure with a prominent v wave, prominent midprecordial cardiac impulse, right-sided third heart sound, and holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation; hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema may occur when ARHF is superimposed on chronic RHF, right upper quadrant discomfort may result from hepatic congestion, and if a patent foramen ovale is present (≈15% of adults) right-to-left shunting at the atrial level can lead to systemic hypoxemia and cyanosis.

Biomarkers in right-sided heart failure (RHF) are described as follows: NT-proBNP may also be useful in patients with predominantly RHF but is relatively nonspecific; elevated BNP is observed in both LH and right-sided heart dysfunction and is not a reliable marker to distinguish the level of dysfunction within each ventricle; BNP, however, has emerged as a useful marker of prognosis in RHF accompanying PAH. The reliability of other biomarkers such as creatine phosphokinase-MB and troponins is less well established in the setting of RHF, elevated BNP and troponin have adverse prognostic implications in the setting of acute PE, and identifying novel RV-specific biomarkers may lead to targeted therapies for RHF.

### Acute right ventricular failure: pathophysiology, aetiology, assessment, and management [^7a527f71]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute right ventricular failure is a complex and rapidly progressive clinical syndrome, whereby the right ventricle fails to provide adequate left ventricular preload, dilates, and causes systemic venous congestion. Previous research in acute heart failure has primarily focused on the left ventricle. Yet, the need for a better understanding of right ventricular anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, as well as of the diagnosis and management of its acute failure is crucial. Diagnosis mandates a high degree of clinical suspicion, as the majority of signs and symptoms are nonspecific. An accurate and prompt identification of the underlying causes, including pulmonary embolism, right ventricular myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, post-cardiac surgery, and decompensated chronic pulmonary hypertension, is therefore essential. This review provides insights into right ventricular anatomy and functioning and discusses the pathophysiology of acute right ventricular failure, its differential aetiologies, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Right side of the heart pulmonary circulation unit involvement in left-sided heart failure: diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications [^f3928478]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Although long neglected, the right side of the heart (RH) is now widely accepted as a pivotal player in heart failure (HF) either with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. The chronic overload of the pulmonary microcirculation results in an initial phase characterized by right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, right atrial dilation, and diastolic dysfunction. This progresses to overt RH failure when RV dilation and systolic dysfunction lead to RV-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) uncoupling with low RV output. In the context of its established relevance to progression of HF, clinicians should consider assessment of the RH with information from clinical assessment, biomarkers, and imaging. Notably, no single parameter can predict prognosis alone in HF. Assessments simultaneously should encompass RV systolic function, pulmonary pressures, an estimation of RV-PA coupling, and RH morphologic features. Despite a large volume of evidence indicating the relevance of RH function to the clinical syndrome of HF, evidence-based management strategies are lacking. Targeting RH dysfunction in HF should be an objective of future investigations, being an unmet need in the current management of HF.

Cardiohepatic syndrome in right heart failure — congestive hepatopathy is described as a misnomer because it generally results from combined hepatic congestion and reduced hepatic perfusion, and over time it can lead to cardiac cirrhosis; the most prominent laboratory abnormalities include markers of cholestasis (elevated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase) and altered synthetic function (prolonged prothrombin time), which are more common than elevations in transaminases; severity of tricuspid regurgitation is closely associated with liver function abnormalities, markers of cholestasis are independently associated with mortality among patients with heart failure, and hyperbilirubinemia is a risk factor for poor outcomes; in this setting, patients being considered for advanced heart failure therapies such as cardiac transplantation may require a liver biopsy to exclude cirrhosis.

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5is) — oral agents including sildenafil and tadalafil are established, effective, and well-tolerated therapy in group 1 pulmonary hypertension (PH), improving exercise capacity and clinical events, though trials did not specifically select patients with RHF; smaller studies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and secondary PH (group 2) showed improvements awaiting large-trial validation, a multicenter heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) trial failed to improve exercise capacity or clinical status, coadministration with nitrates is specifically contraindicated due to blood pressure effects, and their role in isolated RHF or RHF caused by left heart disease remains uncertain.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^3e5b6fad]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — prevalence, inheritance, and diagnostic approach — is described with estimates that the prevalence is 1 in 2000 to 5000 and that ARVC affects men more frequently than women, with a familial component identified in > 50% of patients and transmission that is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Diagnosis is challenging; the sensitivity of electrocardiographic criteria alone is low, and diagnosis requires a specific combination of major and minor criteria from the ECG, right ventricle (RV) imaging, and family history. Genetic screening, although not required, may be helpful when screening family members of a recently diagnosed patient, and recommendations for the role of genetic testing of probands and first-degree relatives have been published.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — In a study of 97 patients with HFrEF, right ventricular (RV) exercise contractile reserve and RV-PA coupling were assessed using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) versus PASP and the slope of mean PAP versus CO, and patients were grouped according to whether their resting TAPSE was ≥ 16 mm; those with TAPSE < 16 mm were further subdivided, and RVD is also associated with decreased exercise capacity measured by peak oxygen consumption and worse New York Heart Association functional class.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Right heart failure (HF) — classification and categorization: The most common cause of right HF is left HF, and classification of types of ventricular failure in HF commonly includes 3 categories; left ventricular failure, right ventricular failure, and combined left and right ventricular failure usually termed as biventricular failure. Isolated right HF owing to primary pulmonary hypertension etiologies (World Health Organization Groups 1, 3, and 4) would not be categorized under HF because signs and/or symptoms are not caused primarily by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, whereas right HF due to primary right ventricular cardiomyopathies such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy would be categorized under HF.

Medical management of ARHF focuses on management of volume and preload, myocardial contractility, and RV afterload with pharmacotherapy and, if needed, MCS, and abnormalities in the pulmonary circulation and LV filling should be identified as targets for reducing RV afterload and augmenting RV function. Volume management is a critical consideration in ARHF, and the volume status of the patient should be determined on initial examination; a primary goal should be a reduction in left atrial pressure with an aim of reducing congestion and pulsatile RV loading. Hemodynamic monitoring with a central venous catheter or PA catheter can be informative when volume status is uncertain or when hemodynamic instability or worsening renal function occurs, and the teaching that ARHF is a preload-dependent condition requiring volume loading is overly simplistic.

### Therapeutic left-to-right shunting in heart failure [^ae4fac62]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction is associated with elevated left atrial pressure at rest due to fluid overload or during exercise, leading to pulmonary venous congestion. Even with available treatments, heart failure hospitalizations remain high, and improvements in quality-of-life scores and functional capacity are modest. Thus, there is growing interest in non-pharmacological methods to decompress the left atrium and improve heart failure symptoms and outcomes. Left-to-right shunts have emerged as a potential therapeutic option to reduce left atrial hypertension, improve quality of life, and impact long-term outcomes. This nascent field carries both potential therapeutic promise and many unanswered questions. Recent data have questioned whether the effects of this therapy vary based on the left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary vascular resistance, and/or right ventricular structure and function. This review discusses the basis for left-to-right shunt therapies, synthesizes past and ongoing clinical trials, and offers future directions.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b3216a20]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of right heart failure (RHF) — acute RHF mechanisms and ventricular interdependence are detailed as follows: ARHF can occur because of abruptly increased right ventricular (RV) afterload (pulmonary embolus, hypoxia, acidemia) or decreased RV contractility (RV ischemia, myocarditis, postcardiotomy shock); in a healthy individual, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is < 1/10th of the systemic vascular resistance, and an acute increase in RV afterload such as from a large pulmonary embolism (PE) may abruptly decrease RV stroke volume (SV) with minimal increase in RV systolic pressure; acute reductions in RV contractility may be caused by direct myocardial injury such as myocardial inflammation (myocarditis) and ischemia; reduced RV SV results in RV dilatation that promotes tricuspid regurgitation (TR), exacerbates RV dilation, and drives a ventricular‑interdependent effect on left ventricular (LV) filling; ventricular interdependence is defined as forces transmitted through the myocardium and pericardium, and mechanical flattening with leftward septal shift increases LV end‑diastolic pressure, reduces LV transmural filling pressure, and impedes LV diastolic filling, contributing to systemic hypoperfusion; diastolic interaction is described as ventricular competition for diastolic distension/filling within an acutely confined pericardial space, whereas systolic interactions exist because it is estimated that 20% to 40% of RV systolic pressure results from LV contraction; elevated right‑sided filling pressures cause coronary sinus congestion, reducing coronary blood flow and provoking RV ischemia.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) serum markers — in chronic RHF (CRHF), the transaminases may be normal or minimally elevated, whereas in acute RHF (ARHF) they are commonly high. In advanced CRHF, liver synthetic function may be impaired with reduced albumin and elevated international normalized ratio. Increased bilirubin can reflect passive congestion or cholestasis or suggest fibrosis and cirrhosis, and more severe cases with venous congestion and systemic hypoperfusion can lead to renal insufficiency with elevation in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.

Definition and Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of symptoms and signs of congestion and poor organ perfusion due to HF requiring urgent, usually intravenous, therapy has been variously called AHF, ADHF, AHF syndrome, and hospitalized HF, as well as other terms. For the purposes of this review, ADHF will be used, recognizing that most patients have a subacute evolution of their symptoms and signs resulting from cardiac and vascular dysfunction due to a variety of etiologies and triggers resulting in decompensated hemodynamics. There are a number of classifications for HF including by ejection fraction (EF; HF with reduced [HFrEF] or preserved EF [HFpEF]) and predominant left versus right ventricular dysfunction.

The subacute or acute dysfunction in ADHF overwhelms compensatory mechanisms resulting in signs and symptoms of left or right (and often both) ventricular increased filling pressures leading to symptoms including dyspnea, exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, peripheral edema, abdominal bloating, early satiety, and fatigue. Pulmonary vascular congestion from left ventricular failure increases right ventricular pressures and results in a cascading effect on multiorgan function. While the most common cause of right HF is left HF, isolated right HF is becoming increasingly recognized and can also result in increased peripheral signs of congestion and end-organ dysfunction. Since many of these patients with right HF have a severe pulmonary disease as the cause of their HF, they can present with significant dyspnea independent of pulmonary congestion.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) physical examination — patients with severe RHF may appear emaciated, tachypneic, and cyanotic, and typically have elevated jugular venous pressure with a prominent V wave from tricuspid regurgitation (TR); atrial fibrillation is common. Increased jugular venous pressure with inspiration (Kussmaul sign) may also be seen with a noncompliant right ventricle (RV). The abdominojugular reflex test, defined as a sustained rise of > 3 cm in the jugular venous pressure for at least 15 seconds with calm spontaneous respiration, may unmask subtle venous hypertension. For RHF secondary to pulmonary hypertension (PH), a prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) may be heard, whereas in congenital heart disease (CHD) P2 may be soft or even absent when there is a structural or postsurgical abnormality of the pulmonic valve (PV). A low-amplitude holosystolic murmur of TR may be present, the Carvallo sign may distinguish TR from mitral regurgitation, and in repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) a to-and-fro murmur of combined pulmonic stenosis (PS) and insufficiency may occur at the upper left sternal border with radiation to the lungs.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) — acute and late right heart failure (RHF): Twenty percent or more of patients undergoing isolated LVAD implantation experience ARHF, and late RHF after discharge occurs in ≈10% of patients. Patients with a history of chemotherapy-associated cardiomyopathy appear to be at higher risk than those with other forms of nonischemic or ischemic disease. LV unloading with mechanical support may improve RV contractility via a reduction in PAP after the acute decline in PCWP associated with LVAD activation, but the converse is also noted that reductions in afterload may lead to reduced contractility. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a risk factor for the development of ARHF in LVAD recipients, and residual, fixed PH likely contributes to RV-PA uncoupling when intraoperative complications occur.

Renal replacement therapies in diuretic-refractory right-sided heart failure — Among patients who fail to respond to escalating diuretics therapy, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or ultrafiltration may be needed to mechanically remove intravascular volume; care should be taken not to remove fluid at a rate that exceeds the ability of the body to shift extravascular fluid into the intravascular space (the plasma refill rate) because such an excess is likely to result in new or worsening acute kidney dysfunction or injury; ultrafiltration, which refers to the removal of isotonic fluid from the venous compartment via filtration of plasma across a semipermeable membrane, has been evaluated for the treatment of acute HF in multiple trials, although not specifically targeting subjects with RHF.

Maintain perfusion in hypotension — In cases of hypotension, a drug with combined inotropic and vasopressor properties may be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion, and dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are useful adjuncts to augment contractility in the setting of significant hypotension (systolic BP < 80–90 mm Hg), with norepinephrine being a potent α1-receptor agonist that leads to vasoconstriction with less prominent inotropic and chronotropic effects. For refractory hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilation not responding to initial interventions, more pure vasopressors such as arginine vasopressin or phenylephrine may be required, arginine vasopressin causes peripheral vasoconstriction with less impact on PVR and supports glomerular filtration via selective efferent arteriole constriction, and attempts should be made to wean off these treatments as rapidly as possible. Although short-term inotropic agents improve hemodynamics, long-term administration is associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption and possibly increased mortality, clinical guidelines recommend against the routine use of these agents in hospitalized patients with acute HF, and in rare cases, dobutamine can cause eosinophilic myocarditis with further deterioration of cardiac function.

Congestive heart failure

By definition, congestive HF ensues, when the heart is not able to fulfill adequate organ perfusion by blood at rest or during exercise, or is able to do so only at the cost of increased filling pressure. Inadequate organ perfusion is sometimes called forward HF and is clinically manifested by dizziness, confusion, cool extremities, systemic hypotension or even cardiogenic shock. "Increased filling pressures" represent the backward HF, implying that a higher blood pressure is needed for the filling of the left or right ventricle due to their lower compliance or prolonged relaxation time. This higher pressure is transferred to the left and right atrium. Increased left atrial pressure is freely transmitted to the pulmonary veins and capillaries and pulmonary congestions develops. Increased right atrial pressure is freely transmitted to the central veins and also to the renal veins, which is one mechanism of glomerular filtration decrease in non-ESRD patients. Moreover, increased central venous pressure leads to blood stagnation in the liver and in the portal system. Liver congestion leads to inadequate synthesis of proteins or even to the so-called cardiac cirrhosis. Portal hypertension is associated with impaired absorption of nutrients, vitamins etc. from the gut content.

Another classification differentiates left-sided, right-sided and biventricular HF. Left-sided HF is the most common as the result of the left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, LVH, aortic and mitral valvular diseases. The left-sided HF usually progresses into the right-sided and becomes biventricular. Many mechanisms are involved in the development of HF 2 – see Table 2.

Table 2.
Heart failure mechanisms and associated structural heart changes in ESRD patients.

Congestive HF is much more common than high-output HF and is associated with a significantly increased morbidity (shortness of breath, tiredness, edemas, cachexia, accelerated cognitive impairment) and mortality, namely sudden cardiac death.

Since the heart is affected by many complications (see Table 2) and is unable to increase CO adequately – congestive HF develops. Asymptomatic HF occurs frequently before AV access creation.

### Trepopnea may explain right-sided pleural effusion in patients with decompensated heart failure [^5b9ef57c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians often overlook trepopnea as a symptom, and its prevalence and clinical repercussions are not usually described. We propose that trepopnea is a common symptom in heart failure (HF) and, because of patient avoidance of left lateral decubitus position, contributes to the greater prevalence of right-sided pleural effusion in patients with HF. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine trepopnea prevalence and to evaluate the association of trepopnea and the laterality of pleural effusion in decompensated HF.

Methods

Consecutive patients (n = 37) with decompensated HF and evidence of pleural effusion by chest x-ray were included. Data were collected at the emergency department by a standard clinical examination in which patients were specifically asked about the presence of trepopnea and preferred decubitus position while recumbent. Chest x-ray and echocardiographic parameters were recorded.

Results

Of the 37 patients, 19 (51%) reported trepopnea. Most patients presented with right-sided pleural effusion; only 2 patients (5.4%) presented with left-sided pleural effusion. Patients who reported trepopnea had predominant right-sided pleural effusion more frequently than patients without this symptom (73.7% vs 26.3%; P = 0.049). The participants that reported trepopnea or avoidance of left lateral decubitus position while recumbent or both had a greater probability of having predominant right-sided pleural effusion (likelihood ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–3.35).

Conclusions

Trepopnea is a common symptom in patients with decompensated HF and is associated with predominant right-sided pleural effusion in this population. Our results indicate that trepopnea may be a contributory factor for pleural effusion laterality in patients with decompensated HF.

### Right heart failure: a narrative review for emergency clinicians [^dcc03345]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Right heart failure (RHF) is a clinical syndrome with impaired right ventricular cardiac output due to a variety of etiologies including ischemia, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, or volume overload. Emergency department (ED) patients with an acute RHF exacerbation can be diagnostically and therapeutically challenging to manage.

Objective

This narrative review describes the pathophysiology of right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, the methods to diagnose RHF in the ED, and management strategies.

Discussion

Right ventricular contraction normally occurs against a low pressure, highly compliant pulmonary vascular system. This physiology makes the right ventricle susceptible to acute changes in afterload, which can lead to RHF. Patients with acute RHF may present with an acute illness and have underlying chronic pulmonary hypertension due to left ventricular failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic lung conditions, thromboemboli, or idiopathic conditions. Patients can present with a variety of symptoms resulting from systemic edema and hemodynamic compromise. Evaluation with electrocardiogram, laboratory analysis, and imaging is necessary to evaluate cardiac function and end organ injury. Management focuses on treating the underlying condition, optimizing oxygenation and ventilation, treating arrhythmias, and understanding the patient's hemodynamics with bedside ultrasound. As RHF patients are preload dependent they may require fluid resuscitation or diuresis. Hypotension should be rapidly addressed with vasopressors. Cardiac contractility can be augmented with inotropes. Efforts should be made to support oxygenation while trying to avoid intubation if possible.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician understanding of this condition is important to diagnose and treat this life-threatening cardiopulmonary disorder.

### Reversible pulmonary hypertension and isolated right-sided heart failure associated with hyperthyroidism [^ff1dfd7c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism may present with signs and symptoms related to dysfunction of a variety of organs. Cardiovascular pathology in hyperthyroidism is common. A few case reports describe isolated right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension as the prominent cardiovascular manifestations of hyperthyroidism. Although most textbooks do not mention hyperthyroidism as a cause of pulmonary hypertension and isolated right heart failure, the literature suggests that some hyperthyroid patients may develop reversible pulmonary hypertension and isolated right heart failure. We report a case of hyperthyroidism presenting with signs and symptoms of isolated right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension, which resolved with treatment of hyperthyroidism.

### Pathophysiology of right ventricular failure [^f2cf774a]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Right ventricular failure may be defined as the inability of the right ventricle of the heart to provide adequate blood flow through the pulmonary circulation at a normal central venous pressure. Critical care specialists encounter right ventricular failure routinely in their practice, but until recently right ventricular failure as a primary clinical entity received scant consideration. Indeed, there is still not a single published practice guideline focused on right ventricular failure. Right ventricular failure is usually due to a combination of right ventricular pressure overload and contractile abnormalities of the right ventricular free wall. Decompensation may occur abruptly and catastrophically because of unique aspects of right ventricular physiology. This review will focus on the pathophysiology of acute right ventricular failure in the critical care setting and summarize the limited management options available.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Assessment of volume status in heart failure (HF) is described as critically important at the initial and each follow-up visit; at each visit clinicians should record body weight and sitting and standing blood pressures and determine jugular venous distension, organ congestion, and peripheral edema. The most reliable sign of volume overload is jugular venous distension, and right-sided filling pressures are elevated in the basal state or with abdominal compression in many patients with chronically elevated left-sided filling pressures. Most patients with peripheral edema should be considered to have volume overload, whereas most patients with chronic HF do not have rales; studies using 131I-tagged albumin showed plasma volume expansion in more than 50% of patients in whom clinical volume overload was not recognized. Short-term changes in fluid status are best assessed by measuring changes in body weight. The majority with clinical evidence of volume overload do not exhibit hypoperfusion, but when cardiac output declines markedly or abruptly, clues include narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, resting tachycardia, and disproportionate elevation of blood urea nitrogen relative to serum creatinine.

High-output heart failure presents with similar symptoms and signs of systemic or pulmonary congestion, often with rapid heart rate and peripheral vasodilation; cardiac dysfunction may be represented by pathologically elevated cardiac output, echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dilation or dysfunction, and elevated natriuretic peptide concentrations; it is a response to extracardiac causes including liver disease, arteriovenous shunt, lung disease, thiamine deficiency, anemia, thyroid disease, or myeloproliferative disorders, with treatment generally directed to the underlying causes, and given its unique nature, it is appropriate that it have a separate classification.

Heart failure management after tricuspid intervention: Continuation of a multipronged heart failure (HF) treatment regimen is required postintervention, with attention to determining effective decongestion and maintaining euvolemia with diuretics following hospital discharge. Determining euvolemia may be challenging; both relief of dyspnea and attaining preadmission body weight are poor markers, and patients with severe TR and right-sided HF may not display typical left-sided congestion findings on examination. Although noninvasive parameters have been used as surrogates for increased filling pressures, including RA pressure > 7 mm Hg or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 18 mm Hg, their value in detecting the optimal euvolemic point without residual hemodynamic congestion is unclear. Overemphasis on serial biomarker levels as volume surrogates might prompt inappropriate loop diuretic dose escalation without significant residual congestion and increase risks such as hypotension and renal dysfunction. With these limitations, a combination of clinical, bedside appraisal, and biomarker/imaging assessment is reasonable when assessing adequate diuresis, and postintervention considerations include maintenance or addition of spironolactone as a K+ (potassium ion)–sparing diuretic and to counter secondary hyperaldosteronism related to residual hepatic congestion.

### Ascites in animals with right heart failure: correlation with lymphatic dysfunction [^de88d3ca]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

There are an estimated 26 million patients with heart failure (HF) globally, with about 670 000 new cases a year in the United States alone. More than 50% of patients with HF caused by left ventricular dysfunctions are asymptomatic. However, tissue congestion resulting from HF is one of the leading causes of morbidity in this patient population and a large burden on our health care system. Between 2006 and 2010, there were about 960 000 annual emergency department visits because of acute decompensated congestive heart failure in the United States. A great majority of these patients (84%) were admitted. Hospitalization because of acute decompensated congestive heart failure is mainly caused by symptoms rather than low cardiac output.

The reason for the prevalence of right heart failure (RHF) is not as clear. This is partially because of a lack of a consistent definition of RHF.RHF is common in HF with reduced ejection fraction (48%). It is less prevalent in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (≈30%), such as in patients with right ventricular dysfunction caused by pulmonary hypertension. In patients with HF and right ventricle dysfunction, even without left ventricular dysfunction, a high mortality is predicted. Furthermore, in patients with RHF, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) was found to be a predictor of mortality independent of left ventricular ejection fraction.

### Contemporary management of acute right ventricular failure: a statement from the heart failure association and the working group on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function of the European Society of Cardiology [^f7919c0f]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Acute right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from many causes. Research efforts have disproportionately focused on the failing left ventricle, but recently the need has been recognized to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of RV anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, and of management approaches. Right ventricular mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either pressure overload or volume overload. Failure may also result from a primary reduction of myocardial contractility owing to ischaemia, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmia. Dysfunction leads to impaired RV filling and increased right atrial pressures. As dysfunction progresses to overt RV failure, the RV chamber becomes more spherical and tricuspid regurgitation is aggravated, a cascade leading to increasing venous congestion. Ventricular interdependence results in impaired left ventricular filling, a decrease in left ventricular stroke volume, and ultimately low cardiac output and cardiogenic shock. Identification and treatment of the underlying cause of RV failure, such as acute pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute decompensation of chronic pulmonary hypertension, RV infarction, or arrhythmia, is the primary management strategy. Judicious fluid management, use of inotropes and vasopressors, assist devices, and a strategy focusing on RV protection for mechanical ventilation if required all play a role in the clinical care of these patients. Future research should aim to address the remaining areas of uncertainty which result from the complexity of RV haemodynamics and lack of conclusive evidence regarding RV-specific treatment approaches.

### Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure in emergency medicine [^46033bd1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a hemodynamic condition, defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure by right-sided heart catheterization of at least 25 mm Hg at rest. It is classified into 5 general groups based on the underlying cause, with left ventricular failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being 2 of the most common causes in the United States. Although the specifics of the pathophysiology will vary with the cause, appreciating the risks of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure is critical to appropriately evaluating and resuscitating pulmonary hypertension patients in the emergency department (ED). Patients may present to the ED with complaints related to pulmonary hypertension or unrelated ones, but this condition will affect all aspects of care. Exertional dyspnea is the most common symptom attributable to pulmonary hypertension, but the latter should be considered in any ED patient with unexplained dyspnea on exertion, syncope, or signs of right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with right ventricular failure are often volume overloaded, and careful volume management is imperative, especially in the setting of hypotension. Vasopressors and inotropes, rather than fluid boluses, are often required in shock to augment cardiac output and reduce the risk of exacerbating right ventricular ischemia. Intubation should be avoided if possible, although hypoxemia and hypercapnia may also worsen right-sided heart function. Emergency physicians should appreciate the role of pulmonary vasodilators in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and recognize that patients receiving these medications may rapidly develop right ventricular failure and even death without these therapies. Patients may require interventions not readily available in the ED, such as a pulmonary artery catheter, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, and mechanical support with a right ventricular assist device or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Therefore, early consultation with a pulmonary hypertension specialist and transfer to a tertiary care center with invasive monitoring and mechanical support capabilities is advised.

Ebstein's anomaly — initial adult presentation and complications: Patients with mild Ebstein's anomaly may be asymptomatic with no functional limitation, and survival to the ninth decade has been reported. Electrophysiological rather than hemodynamic symptoms are more common in patients over the age of 10 years at presentation, and patients who reach late adolescence and adulthood often have an excellent outcome. Adult presentations commonly include exercise intolerance with dyspnea, fatigue, symptomatic arrhythmias, and right-sided heart failure; when an ASD or PFO is present, patients may be cyanotic to a varying degree and are at risk for a paradoxical embolism that results in transient ischemic attack, stroke, or cerebral abscess. Exercise tolerance declines with age and lower oxygen saturation at rest, and sudden cardiac death may occur related to arrhythmias.

### Diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in adults… [^0c5894c9]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by specific symptoms and signs. The development of heart failure has been divided into four stages.: A — high risk of heart failure but no structural disease or symptoms; B — structural heart disease but no signs or symptoms; C — structural heart disease with current or past symptoms; and D — refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions. Possible structural or functional reasons for the development of heart failure include cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with LV dysfunction or heart failure typically present with decreased exercise tolerance caused by dyspnea or fatigue, fluid retention in the legs or abdomen, or evidence of cardiac enlargement or dysfunction found during evaluation for another disorder. Diagnosis is largely clinical, based on a careful history and physical examination.

Clinical Assessment In the initial evaluation of patients with heart failure, physicians should locate structural and functional cardiac abnormalities and identify disorders and behaviors that could cause the disease or accelerate its progression. Physicians then should focus on clinical assessment to identify symptoms and determine their effects on function. An ongoing review of symptoms and function is critical to treatment selection. IDENTIFICATION OF ABNORMALITIES The history and physical examination may provide clues as to the nature of the underlying abnormality, but a specific diagnosis generally requires cardiac imaging. The most useful diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with heart failure is two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler to assess left ventricular ejection fraction, LV size, ventricular compliance, wall thickness, and valve function. This should be performed during the initial evaluation.

Comprehensive evaluation is important because there often is more than one contributing cardiac abnormality, and the test also can be useful as a baseline for comparison. Heart Failure with Normal LVEF Heart failure with normal EF is most prevalent in older women, most of whom also have hypertension, diabetes, or both. CAD and atrial fibrillation also are common in these patients. Diagnosis generally is made with findings of typical signs and symptoms of heart failure in patients with a normal LVEF and no valvular abnormalities on echocardiography. Similarly presenting disorders should be ruled out. A definitive diagnosis can be made when the rate of ventricular relaxation is slowed.

### Should less-than-severe functional tricuspid regurgitation in patients undergoing left-sided surgery Be treated more aggressively? [^2024e640]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) dilation and/or dysfunction ensuing from valvular or myopathic derangements of the left heart can lead to asymmetric dilation or distortion of the nonplanar tricuspid valve (TV) annulus, leaflet tethering, malcoaptation, and functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR). The accompanying volume overload in turn, causes further RV dilation and worsening TR, initiating a vicious spiral that may lead to intractable right heart failure and death, left unchecked.

The incidence of FTR in patients undergoing left heart surgery ranges between 7.5% to 14.0% for severe FTR and 15% to 30% for moderate FTR. Of note, FTR present at the time of left-sided valve surgery has been estimated to progress in 7.7% to 67% of patients. Residual or uncorrected FTR, following left-sided surgery, can lead to decreased functional capacity, peripheral edema, congestive hepatopathy, ascites, right heart failure and is predictive of poor survival. In this context, it is important to note that reoperations for isolated or recurrent FTR are associated with very high perioperative mortality.

The North American and European guidelines, both recommend concomitant TV surgery in patients with severe TR undergoing left-sided valve surgery, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, (Class 1). In contrast, surgery is deemed reasonable and should be considered in patients with mild or moderate (progressive) TR with a dilated annulus (≥ 40 mm or > 21 mm/m²) or those with prior heart failure (Class 2a). Because the latter recommendations are based on observational data, the most effective strategy remains somewhat controversial, and consequently, concomitant TV repair practice patterns for less-than-severe FTR vary widely. To some extent, previous guideline discrepancies, the concerns of increased cardiopulmonary bypass time, the need for permanent pacemaker implantation, and the historical incremental mortality associated with TV repairs have influenced a more conservative approach to TV repair, especially in patients with less-than-severe grades of TR, undergoing left heart surgery.

### Impact of interatrial shunts on invasive hemodynamics and exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure [^c9b4d8c7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 50% of patients with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction. Although a wide variety of conditions cause or contribute to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, elevated left ventricular filling pressures, particularly during exercise, are common to all causes. Acute elevation in left-sided filling pressures promotes lung congestion and symptoms of dyspnea, while chronic elevations often lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling, right heart failure, and increased risk of mortality. Pharmacologic therapies, including neurohormonal modulation and drugs that modify the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP-protein kinase G pathway have thus far been limited in reducing symptoms or improving outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Hence, alternative means of reducing the detrimental rise in left-sided heart pressures are being explored. One proposed method of achieving this is to create an interatrial shunt, thus unloading the left heart at rest and during exercise. Currently available studies have shown 3- to 5-mm Hg decreases of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise despite increased workload. The mechanisms underlying the hemodynamic changes are just starting to be understood. In this review we summarize results of recent studies aimed at elucidating the potential mechanisms of improved hemodynamics during exercise tolerance following interatrial shunt implantation and the current interatrial shunt devices under investigation.

### Pulmonary hypertension [^20801421]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension includes a diverse set of conditions defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg found during right heart catheterization that can lead to right-sided heart failure and death if untreated. The most common cause of pulmonary hypertension is left-sided heart failure, followed by chronic obstructive lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension presents as unexplained dyspnea on exertion and possible findings of right-sided heart failure. The diagnosis is commonly delayed because the symptoms are often attributed to underlying heart or lung disease. Echocardiography is the initial study of choice, and findings can suggest a low, intermediate, or high risk of pulmonary hypertension. Right heart catheterization is the standard of care for diagnosing and classifying pulmonary hypertension, and the results may inform treatment. Patients with pulmonary hypertension should be referred to a center specializing in treatment. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have a high risk of perioperative complications, and detailed specialty preoperative evaluation is recommended. Physicians should counsel patients of childbearing age with pulmonary hypertension to prevent pregnancy to avoid worsening the severity of pulmonary hypertension and fetal loss. Pulmonary hypertension is severe, chronic, progressive, and challenging to treat; therefore, family physicians should update the patient's immunization status, screen for and address mental health conditions, and discuss goals of care and advance directives with patients.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^8fceb30c]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure continuum — proposed revised stages define At risk for heart failure (HF) (Stage A) as "Patients at risk for HF, but without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF and without structural cardiac changes or elevated biomarkers of heart disease", including those with "hypertension, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, known exposure to cardiotoxins, a positive family history of cardiomyopathy, or genetic cardiomyopathy", noting that "risk factor intervention may be warranted". Pre-HF (Stage B) includes "Patients without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF with evidence of one of the following:" structural heart disease (e.g., "left ventricular hypertrophy", "cardiac chamber enlargement", "ventricular wall motion abnormality", and myocardial tissue abnormalities by cardiac magnetic resonance), abnormal cardiac function ("reduced left or right ventricular systolic function, evidence of increased filling pressures… abnormal diastolic dysfunction", which "can be characterized by reduced EF, abnormal ventricular strain, or other noninvasive or invasive modalities"), or biomarkers ("Elevated natriuretic peptide levels (for levels, refer to Table 8) or elevated cardiac troponin levels (> 99th percentile in a normal reference population)"). Heart failure (Stage C) is "Patients with current or prior symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality". The document adds that "we did not specifically include genetic markers in the definition of pre-HF or Stage B HF", and that natriuretic peptide "cutoffs… represent thresholds lower than inclusion criteria used in some clinical trials", with thresholds that "may have lower specificity especially in older patients, or patients with atrial fibrillation or CKD", and "Usually, higher cutoff values are recommended for the diagnosis of HF in these patients".

### Patient-reported goals in tricuspid regurgitation: a qualitative analysis of patient and care partner perspectives [^342f6116]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common valvular heart condition that is often a result of concurrent heart disease such as left-sided heart failure or atrial fibrillation leading to atrial enlargement. When symptomatic, the natural history of TR includes earlier mortality and significant detriments in quality of life. Optimization of a patient's health status (ie, symptoms, functional status, and quality of life) is a central goal in the treatment of heart disease and plays a pivotal role in the determination of efficacy of therapeutic approaches in multiple heart failure trials. More recently, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been incorporated into the assessment of transcatheter devices to treat valvular heart disease, particularly those to treat TR.

Until recently, treatment options for severe symptomatic TR were limited to diuretic therapy to manage the common physical signs of right-sided congestion, most commonly lower leg swelling. The more insidious symptoms of fatigue and overall debility due to low energy are often attributed to aging or inactivity rather than severe TR, complicating diagnosis. In the context of previously limited treatment options, patients were less likely to be appropriately diagnosed or educated about the disease or its natural history by their clinicians as there was little research supporting new developments.

Surgical therapy for severe TR is offered rarely and typically only in the context of concomitant procedures (ie, mitral valve repair), albeit with some risk. Isolated tricuspid valve (TV) surgery is associated with high in-hospital mortality among older patients presenting with heart failure symptoms, in part, because of the late presentation and multiple comorbidities of this population.

With the development of novel transcatheter repair and replacement devices, the literature on diagnosis and treatment of TR has skyrocketed. No longer forgotten, research on the TV is flourishing, including topics such as disease prevalence and natural history, intersections with heart failure, role of atrial fibrillation, concomitant valvular heart disease, mortality risk scores for surgery and transcatheter device therapies, and PROs. However, data on the patient experience are lacking.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) clinical syndrome and etiologies — The cardinal manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and fluid retention leading to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, and the term heart failure is preferred over congestive heart failure because not all patients have volume overload at evaluation. The syndrome may result from pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or great vessel disorders, with most symptoms due to impairment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial function, and HF may range from normal LV size with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease are substantial causes, and as many as 30% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a genetic cause. HF is not equivalent to cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; it is defined as a clinical syndrome with specific symptoms and signs, and there is no single diagnostic test because diagnosis is based on careful history and physical examination.

Key points
- Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in your body.
- Certain medical conditions can increase your risk for heart failure. Overview Heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in your body. Heart failure is a serious condition, but it does not mean that the heart has stopped beating. Deaths from heart failure vary by geography Heart failure is more common in some areas of the United States than in others. Below is a map showing the rate of death from heart failure by county. Symptoms Common symptoms of heart failure include:

- Shortness of breath during daily activities.
- Trouble breathing when lying down.
- Weight gain with swelling in the feet, legs, ankles, or stomach.
- Generally feeling tired or weak.

Risk factors Certain medical conditions can increase your risk for heart failure, including:

- Coronary artery disease and heart attacks.
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- Obesity
- Other conditions related to heart disease
- Heart valve disease Unhealthy behaviors can also increase your risk for heart failure, especially for people who have one of the conditions listed above. Unhealthy behaviors include:

- Smoking tobacco.
- Eating foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
- Not getting enough physical activity.
- Excessive alcohol intake. Treatment and recovery Early diagnosis and treatment can improve quality and length of life for people who have heart failure. Treatment usually involves the following:

- Taking medicines.
- Reducing sodium in the diet.
- Drinking less liquids.
- Using devices that remove excess salt and water from the blood.
- Having heart transplant and other surgeries.
- Getting daily physical activity.

People with heart failure also track their symptoms each day so that they can discuss these symptoms with their health care team.

### Postural hypotension as the initial presentation of fulminant right ventricular myocarditis [^4b036550]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Myocarditis can be totally asymptomatic or can manifest with chest pain syndromes, ranging from mild persistent chest pain of acute myopericarditis to severe symptoms that mimic acute myocardial infarction. About 60% of patients may have antecedent arthralgias, malaise, fevers, sweats, or chills consistent with viral infections 1 to 2 weeks before onset. Here, we report a postpartum young woman who developed postural hypotension as the first manifestation of fulminant myocarditis with initially acute "cold and dry" right-sided heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Common causes of postural hypotension include volume depletion, medications, diabetes, alcohol, infection, and varicose veins as well as dysautonomic syndromes. Fulminant myocarditis can cause cardiogenic shock. Myocardial inflammation more frequently affects localized areas of the left ventricle free wall, rarely right ventricle (RV). However, predominant RV involvement with acute right-sided heart failure and low cardiac output syndrome can be easily overlooked due to lack of typical heart failure signs. On reviewing medical literatures, we had found no report regarding the RV involvement with acute right-sided heart failure as the initial presentation of fulminant myocarditis.

Clinical diagnosis

TR is most often diagnosed at the time of echocardiographic evaluation of left-side heart disease or evaluation of right heart failure. As indicated above, TR is relatively well tolerated and patients may remain asymptomatic even with TR of moderate or severe degree. When symptoms appear, patients may complain of asthenia, fatigue or decreased exercise tolerance as a result of lower cardiac output. They may also present with signs of elevated right atrial pressure, such as peripheral oedema and abdominal fullness, congestive hepatomegaly and ascites. Physical examination findings include jugular venous distension with a prominent v-wave, hepatomegaly and, rarely, a soft systolic regurgitant murmur can be heard that increases during inspiration owing to the increased venous return. Atrial fibrillation as a result of right atrial enlargement is common.

METHODS

Patient Population

The study data are not available to other researchers for reproducing the study results because of the legal restrictions imposed by multinational jurisdictions. A total of 2039 patients were enrolled from the SHOP (Singapore Heart Failure Outcomes and Phenotypes; 54%) and the PEOPLE (Prospective Evaluation of Outcome in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction; 46%) studies. The 2 studies were parallel, prospective cohort studies that enrolled patients with HF across 6 centers in Singapore and 4 centers in New Zealand. Although recruiting at ethnically and geographically disparate and distant locations, the SHOP and PEOPLE studies were prospectively codesigned with the same recruitment criteria and follow‐up schedule. Patients with HF, aged > 18 years, were prospectively identified from consecutive inpatient and outpatient settings for both studies. All patients presented to hospitals with a primary diagnosis of HF or were attending hospital clinics for the management of HF within 6 months of an episode of decompensated HF. Patients with severe valve disease, acute coronary syndrome causing transient pulmonary edema, end‐stage renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m²), constrictive pericarditis, complex adult congenital heart disease, specific subgroups of cardiomyopathy, isolated right‐sided HF, and the life expectancy of < 1 year, and those unable or unwilling to give informed consent, were excluded. Medical history, HF signs and symptoms, physical examination, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram were captured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months. Both studies adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. Approvals were obtained at all participating sites, and all patients signed written informed consent.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^0c958057]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction:

- **Definition**: HFpEF is HF in which the LVEF is ≥ 50% at the time of diagnosis and there is objective evidence of elevated left heart filling pressures either at rest or with exertion.
- **Pathophysiology**: Multiple organ systems contribute. Cardiac abnormalities include impaired LV relaxation, increased LV stiffness, subtle reductions in systolic reserve, myocardial fibrosis, coronary microvascular dysfunction, LA enlargement, and changes in pericardial constraint. Pulmonary and right heart changes include postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, small vessel remodeling, and RV dysfunction in many patients. The arterial system commonly shows increased arterial stiffness and impaired microvascular function. Systemic contributors include obesity, insulin resistance, chronic low grade inflammation, reduced skeletal muscle mass and function, kidney dysfunction with impaired sodium handling, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Several proposed biological pathways link comorbid conditions to myocardial and vascular changes, and greater heterogeneity among patients implies that distinct mechanistic subgroups exist.
- **Epidemiology**: About 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide have this condition. It represents roughly half of all people diagnosed with HF. Incidence estimates vary by cohort and time period but are generally about 1–4 new cases per 1,000 person-years. Major risk factors include older age, high BP, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Women are overrepresented among patients diagnosed in many observational series, although adjusted incidence differences by sex are small in some cohort studies.
- **Disease course**: Presentation is heterogeneous. About two thirds of patients present with overt congestion and volume overload, with signs such as peripheral edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary congestion on chest imaging, and resting echocardiographic indicators of high filling pressure. About one third present with exertional dyspnea without clear resting evidence of congestion; many of these patients demonstrate elevated left heart filling pressures only during exercise testing. Common comorbidities that affect presentation and trajectory include AF, chronic lung disease, anemia, obesity, and frailty. Episodes of acute decompensation are common and may be precipitated by uncontrolled BP, rapid AF, infection, anemia, medication nonadherence, or other physiologic stressors.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Clinical outcomes are substantial. Patients with this syndrome are hospitalized about 1.4 times per year on average. Annual mortality in observational cohorts is approximately 15%, with higher mortality in older patients. After a hospitalization for HF, 5-year rehospitalization rates approach 80 percent and five-year mortality ranges from about 50% to 75% in many series. Patients who have abnormal filling pressures only with exercise nonetheless have higher risks of hospitalization or death than people without elevated exercise pressures.

### Does the physical examination still have a role in patients with suspected heart failure? [^204b6a7b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

The prognostic value of signs of congestion in patients suspected of having chronic heart failure (CHF) is unknown. Our objectives were to define their prevalence and specificity in diagnosing CHF and to determine their prognostic value in patients in a community heart failure clinic.

Methods and Results

Analysis of referrals to a community clinic for patients with CHF symptoms. Systolic CHF (S-HF) was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45%, heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HeFNEF) as LVEF > 45%, and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide > 50 pmol L⁻¹; other subjects were defined as not having CHF. Signs of congestion were as follows: no signs; right heart congestion (RHC: oedema, jugular venous distension); left heart congestion (LHC: lung crackles); or both (R + LHC). Of 1881 patients referred, 707 did not have CHF, 853 had S-HF, and 321 had HeFNEF. The median inter-quartile range (IQR) age was 72 years (64–78), 40% were women, and LVEF was 47% (35–59). Overall, 417 patients had RHC of whom 49% had S-HF and 21% HeFNEF. Eighty-five patients had LHC of whom 43% had S-HF and 20% had HeFNEF. One hundred and seventy-two patients had R + LHC of whom 71% had S-HF and 16% had HeFNEF. During a median (IQR) follow-up of 64(44–76) months, 40% of the entire patient cohort died. The combination of R + LHC signs was an independent marker of an adverse prognosis (χ²-log-rank test = 186.1, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Clinical signs of congestion are independent predictors of prognosis in ambulatory patients with suspected CHF.

### Right ventricular dysplasia in an asymptomatic young man: an uncommon case with biventricular involvement and no known family history [^703d06a3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2001). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old man had cardiomegaly on a routine x-ray examination. He was asymptomatic with no history of infarction, syncope, or palpitations. There was no family history of congenital heart disease or sudden death. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated marked enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle with severely depressed right and left ventricular function that was consistent with right ventricular dysplasia. The patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and did well for 6 months, but then developed symptomatic left-sided congestive heart failure. Short-term improvement was obtained with intravenous inotropic therapy, but he continued to have progressive symptoms of heart failure. Approximately 7 months after his initial presentation, the patient underwent orthotopic heart transplantation for intractable congestive heart failure. Pathologic examination of the explanted heart established the diagnosis of right ventricular dysplasia with left ventricular involvement. This is an uncommon presentation of right ventricular dysplasia with biventricular involvement and no known family history.

MANAGEMENT OF WORSENING RENAL FUNCTION IN ADHF

Clinical assessment

A careful assessment to determine volume status and degree of fluid overload is essential, with special attention paid to ruling out other complicating features such as sepsis, drug toxicities which independently affect kidney function, as well as identifying underlying comorbid conditions including CKD. Deterioration of kidney function on background of pre-existing CKD is associated with poorer prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity as shown by Zhou et al. Careful bedside evaluation to look for signs of pulmonary and peripheral oedema and elevated right heart pressures is important. Raised jugular venous pressure, a third heart sound and positive abdomino-jugular test along with lung signs when positive indicate elevated right heart pressures and compromised cardiac performance. An jugular venous distention was highly sensitive (81%) and specific (80%), with a predictive accuracy of 81% for raised pulmonary wedge pressure (≥ 18 mmHg). Lower limb oedema is another sensitive indicator but is less specific as can be due to other comorbidities associated with leg oedema.

Pertinent blood tests including biomarkers of decompensated heart failure — pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin — may be useful. Along with monitoring urine output and daily fasting weights, imaging techniques like ECHO and point-of-care ultrasound assessment of fluid status are useful tools for assessment and towards developing a personalized treatment approach for each patient. There are several radiological methods of volume assessment including chest X-ray, inferior vena cava ultrasound, renal venous Dopplers, lung ultrasound, carotid artery ultrasound, heart echocardiogram, heart magnetic resonance imaging and bioimpedance analysis. Some radiological markers are shown to be beneficial in assessing volume status, e.g. bioimpedance analysis, but randomized trial evidence of their utility in guiding decongestion is limited. The ESCAPE (Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness) trial failed to show any mortality benefit or reduction in hospitalizations with use of invasive monitoring, however in certain complex clinical situations right-sided catheterization may be considered, particularly in intensive care setting — for example difficult to diurese patients where a more nuanced approach to address subclinical congestion while avoiding intravascular depletion are required. It can help identify complicating factors such as pulmonary hypertension.

### Use of a cardiac scale to predict heart failure events: design of SCALE-HF 1 [^19ac7d4a]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point of this study will be the identification of worsening HF. Symptoms of worsening HF include dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, fatigue, and other symptoms of worsened end-organ perfusion or volume overload. Objective evidence of new or worsening HF includes physical examination findings such as peripheral edema, pulmonary rales, crackles, increased jugular venous distention, abdominal distention or ascites, S3 gallop, or significant weight gain thought to be secondary to fluid accumulation. Laboratory criteria include an elevated NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) or BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide), radiological evidence of pulmonary congestion, and invasive or noninvasive evidence of elevated right- or left-sided filling pressures. Initiation or intensification of HF treatment includes augmentation of oral diuretic therapy, administration of intravenous diuretic or vasoactive agents, mechanical/surgical circulatory support, or mechanical fluid removal. At each study visit, participants will be followed for possible clinical events and deaths. Medical record information regarding these clinical events and deaths will then be submitted to an independent Clinical Events Committee, composed of physicians not taking part in the clinical study and trained to the standards and definitions of worsening HF criteria as defined in the Clinical Events Committee charter. The Clinical Events Committee is responsible for reviewing and adjudicating all reported events and will be blinded to all cardiac scale biomarker data.

### Heart failure in beta thalassemia: a 5-year follow-up study [^bd052bc9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the survival of patients with beta thalassemia and heart failure who were treated with iron chelation therapy.

Subjects and Methods

Fifty-two consecutive patients with beta thalassemia and heart failure were followed in a prospective 5-year study. All patients underwent a full clinical examination with chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiographic investigation performed at 6-month intervals or when a new symptom developed.

Results

Of the 52 patients (mean [± SD] age, 24 ± 5 years), 25 (48%) survived 5 years after the onset of heart failure. Forty-three patients had left-sided heart failure, and 9 had right-sided heart failure. Those with left-sided heart failure were younger at presentation with heart failure (22 ± 4 years vs. 31 ± 6 years; P < 0.001), had lower ejection fractions (36% ± 9% vs. 64% ± 10%; P < 0.001), and had a lower mean serum ferritin level (3355 ± 1241 ng/mL vs. 6,397 ± 1,613 ng/mL; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The 5-year survival rate in patients with beta thalassemia with heart failure was greater than previously reported. There are clinical characteristics that may make patients more likely to develop left- or right-sided heart failure.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^083b5ef7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

FLUID REMOVAL TARGETS AND MONITORING OF UF THERAPY

One important general recommendation is that, once an initial UF rate has been chosen, it should be either maintained or reduced because capillary refill from the interstitium decreases as fluid is removed. Although the optimal rate and duration of UF must be individualized, UF rates of > 250 ml/h are not typically recommended. Patients with predominantly right-sided heart failure or patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are exquisitely susceptible to intravascular volume depletion and may only tolerate low UF rates (50 to 100 ml/h). In addition, clinical experience teaches that extracorporeal fluid removal is better tolerated when conducted with low UF rates over prolonged periods of time.

A frequently used approach is to compare patients' current weight with that preceding the signs and symptoms of congestion and to use this "dry weight" as the target for fluid removal. No consensus exists on whether removal of only 60% to 80% of excess fluid by UF and continuation of loop diuretic agents during therapy results in less hemodynamic instability and greater urinary sodium excretion. Considering the harmful renal effects of an increased central venous pressure, controlled clinical trials should determine if fluid removal by UF should be adjusted to achieve specific central venous pressure targets. In lieu of invasive measurements, ultrasonography can help estimate central venous pressure with the assessment of the respiratory excursions of the diameter of the inferior vena cava. Although ultrasonography is noninvasive and inexpensive, its reliability depends strictly depends on the operator's skill and the patient's respiratory effort.

Studies of implantable hemodynamic monitors have consistently shown that baseline pulmonary artery diastolic pressure predicts heart failure events. Interventions aimed at reducing pulmonary artery pressures to pre-specified target ranges have effectively reduced heart failure events without significant renal function changes. The CardioMEMS sensor (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota) permits measurement of pulmonary artery pressures as frequently as clinically indicated. Therefore, it is conceivable that, in patients in whom the CardioMEMS device has been implanted, fluid can be removed by UF until the target range of pulmonary artery pressures that effectively reduced heart failure events has been achieved.

### Role of volume redistribution in the congestion of heart failure [^47b34e4a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In Heart Failure: Congestion Does Not Equal Volume Overload

Most of the current heart failure (HF) prevention or management programs assume that cardiovascular decompensations are primarily driven by volume overload that result in cardiopulmonary congestion. Subsequently, a centerpiece of HF therapies is decongestion of the cardiovascular system. Diuretic drug therapies are known to improve HF symptoms, but more aggressive volume removal strategies such as ultrafiltration have not been proven effective in HF. 1, 2 Current strategies for longitudinal HF management often focus on some form of postdischarge surveillance that targets outpatient weight and volume status trends.

Home or remote monitoring efforts commonly rely on daily weight measurements where an acute change in weight would result in a change in medical therapy. The sensitivity of such weight changes prior to hospitalizations were found to be very low (9%), whereas the specificity of such changes is high (97%). 3 Notably, many patients do not experience a change in weight before a hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). In fact, ≈50% of patients gain an insignificant amount of weight (< 2 pounds or < 2 kg based on the study) in the days preceding a hospitalization. 3, 4 Similarly, in the post‐hoc analysis of the ADHF patients in the ASCEND‐HF trial (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure), 26% of patients showed no weight loss (−1 kg ≤ change < 1 kg) and 8% actually experienced weight gain (≥ 1 kg) during the hospitalization. 5 Importantly, in the evaluation of intracardiac filling pressures in an ambulatory setting, recent studies found that in ADHF, right‐ and left‐sided pressures generally start to increase before any notable weight changes take place preceding an admission (Figure 1). 6, 7 Thus, an increase in right and left heart filling pressures occurs in many cases in the absence of weight gain or total body volume increase. 8, 9 Supportive evidence is provided by body volume analysis using the iodohippurate sodium I 131‐labeled human serum albumin indicator–dilution technique. Using this technology, studies found that patients admitted for HF in many cases (34%) were either normovolemic or hypovolemic 10 with often normal plasma volume. 11 The heterogeneity of clinical presentation suggests the presence of a complementary mechanism to explain increased filling pressures and subsequent ADHF despite a lack of fluid retention. A potential contributing mechanism could be blood volume redistribution between different vascular compartments in the human body. We explore the physiology and rationale for this concept below.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) — diuretics and fluid management states that once patients develop signs of right-sided heart failure (HF) and oedema, restricting fluid intake and using diuretics is recommended, with loop diuretics, thiazides, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists used as monotherapy or in combination according to clinical need and kidney function. Patients on diuretics should regularly monitor body weight and seek medical advice in case of weight gain; kidney function and serum electrolytes should be regularly monitored, and intravascular volume depletion must be avoided due to risks of reduced cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. Clinicians should also recognize that fluid retention and oedema may be a side effect of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy.

### Fluid volume overload and congestion in heart failure: time to reconsider pathophysiology and how volume is assessed [^2bc16368]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Volume regulation, assessment, and management remain basic issues in patients with heart failure. The discussion presented here is directed at opening a reassessment of the pathophysiology of congestion in congestive heart failure and the methods by which we determine volume overload status. Peer-reviewed historical and contemporary literatures are reviewed. Volume overload and fluid congestion remain primary issues for patients with chronic heart failure. The pathophysiology is complex, and the simple concept of intravascular fluid accumulation is not adequate. The dynamics of interstitial and intravascular fluid compartment interactions and fluid redistribution from venous splanchnic beds to central pulmonary circulation need to be taken into account in strategies of volume management. Clinical bedside evaluations and right heart hemodynamic assessments can alert clinicians of changes in volume status, but only the quantitative measurement of total blood volume can help identify the heterogeneity in plasma volume and red blood cell mass that are features of volume overload in patients with chronic heart failure and help guide individualized, appropriate therapy-not all volume overload is the same.

Regarding surgical interventions for tricuspid regurgitation, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, symptomatic patients, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider performing isolated tricuspid valve surgery to reduce symptoms and recurrent hospitalizations in patients with signs and symptoms of right-sided HF and severe primary TR (stage D), as well as in patients with severe isolated secondary TR attributable to annular dilation (in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or left-sided disease) poorly responding to medical therapy (Stage D).

Heart failure — Initial evaluation, identification of patients notes that in general, patients with LV dysfunction or HF present to the healthcare provider in 1 of 3 ways: (1) with a syndrome of decreased exercise tolerance, with most patients seeking medical attention due to reduced effort tolerance from dyspnea and/or fatigue; (2) with a syndrome of fluid retention, often leg or abdominal swelling as the primary symptom; or (3) with no symptoms or symptoms of another cardiac or noncardiac disorder, where evaluation for another problem reveals evidence of cardiac enlargement or dysfunction.

### Thinking outside the box: a middle-aged man with new-onset dyspnoea on exertion and pedal oedema [^68fae398]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We describe a diagnostic dilemma in a middle-aged man presenting with dyspnoea and bilateral pedal oedema who had been diagnosed with right heart failure based on clinical evidence. The evaluation for aetiology eventually led to discovery of an unusual extrathoracic cause, a left-to-right communication in the renal vasculature. Renal arteriovenous fistulae are rare and can be congenital, acquired or idiopathic. A left-to-right shunt typically presents with high-output cardiac failure involving the left and right sides of the heart. An atypical feature of this case was the finding of overt right heart failure in the setting of a normal left heart. Such a presentation has only been described in a few isolated case reports. Diagnostic approaches include CT angiography and cardiac catheterisation for haemodynamic measurements. The primary treatment options for arteriovenous fistulae are medical management, arterial embolisation and surgical repair.

Early detection of heart failure (HF) — patient and provider actions: The symptoms and signs of HF are often difficult to identify because they are frequently confused with other disorders or are attributed to aging, obesity, or lack of conditioning. Patients at risk should be advised to inform their healthcare providers about limitations of exercise tolerance or unexplained fatigue, and healthcare providers should intensify their vigilance for the signs and symptoms of HF in such individuals.

### Impact of cardiac power output on exercise capacity and clinical outcome in patients with chronic heart failure [^bcbaa1c8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Less data are available regarding the impact of cardiac power output on exercise capacity or clinical outcome in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The study enrolled 280 consecutive patients with CHF referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing and right-sided heart catheterization between 2013 and 2018. The primary outcome was composite of heart failure hospitalization or death. Cardiac power output was calculated as (mean arterial pressure × CO) ÷ 451. Patients with low cardiac power output (< 0.53 W, n = 99) were older and had a higher brain natriuretic peptide level than patients with high cardiac power output (≥ 0.53W, n = 181). Cardiac power output was correlated with peak oxygen consumption (peak V̇O₂), peak workload achievement, and ventilatory efficiency (V̇E/V̇CO₂ slope) in cardiopulmonary exercise testing, whereas each of cardiac output or mean arterial pressure was not. There were 48 patients with events over a median follow-up period of 3.5 (interquartile range 1.0 to 6.0) years. Patients with low cardiac power output had about a 2-fold higher risk of events than those with a high cardiac power output (hazard ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 3.48). In the multivariable Cox regression, a 0.1-W decrease in cardiac power output was associated with 19% increased adverse events (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.99). In conclusion, cardiac power output was associated with reduced exercise capacity and poor clinical outcome, suggesting that cardiac power output is useful for risk stratification in patients with CHF. Further study is required to identify therapies targeting cardiac power output to improve the exercise capacity or clinical outcome in patients with CHF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^336d6d4f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half of all heart failure cases and has a prevalence that is expected to rise with the growing ageing population. HFpEF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Specific HFpEF risk factors include age, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and atrial fibrillation. Haemodynamic contributions to HFpEF include changes in left ventricular structure, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, left atrial myopathy, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, chronotropic incompetence, and vascular dysfunction. Inflammation, fibrosis, impaired nitric oxide signalling, sarcomere dysfunction, and mitochondrial and metabolic defects contribute to the cellular and molecular changes observed in HFpEF. HFpEF impacts multiple organ systems beyond the heart, including the skeletal muscle, peripheral vasculature, lungs, kidneys and brain. The diagnosis of HFpEF can be made in individuals with signs and symptoms of heart failure with abnormality in natriuretic peptide levels or evidence of cardiopulmonary congestion, facilitated by the use of HFpEF risk scores and additional imaging and testing with the exclusion of HFpEF mimics. Management includes initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy and management of comorbidities. Given the significant impact of HFpEF on quality of life, future research efforts should include a particular focus on how patients can live better with this disease.

### Developing drugs for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what have we learned from clinical trials? [^ba5e868e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Pathophysiologically, HF is defined as the inability of the heart to provide adequate perfusion to the body and its tissues. Clinically, HF is defined as a syndrome with typical signs (pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure) and symptoms (dyspnea, ankle swelling, and fatigue), which result from abnormal cardiac structure or function. 1, 2 HF is a highly prevalent disease, affecting 5.8 million people in the USA and nearly 15 million in Europe. 3, 4 The symptoms and the need for frequent hospitalizations in HF cause a significant burden on individual patients. At the same time, HF is a major public health concern due to the need for frequent and intense healthcare resource utilization. 1, 2, 4, 5 Further, despite the use of currently available therapies, the prognosis of patients with HF is considerably poor, with 5‐year survival rates of 50%, a prognosis even worse than that of patients with advanced cancer or stroke. 6

### Isolated tricuspid regurgitation: outcomes and therapeutic interventions [^6eb3c860]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Presentation and evaluation

The presentation of isolated TR is characterised by the physical finding of an elevated venous pressure with systolic pulsatility indicating a high right atrial (RA) pressure and large C-V wave. This is followed by development of right heart failure (neck fullness, hepatomegaly, oedema and ascites) and low cardiac output (fatigue). Exertional dyspnoea results from enhanced ventricular interaction with the dilated RV causing poor effective operative compliance of the left ventricle (LV). Hepatic and renal failure results from venous congestion and low perfusion pressure. Patients with isolated severe TR will present with right heart failure despite normal LV systolic function, left-sided valves and pulmonary pressures. Similar findings occur in constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy, which must be considered in the differential diagnosis. A history of long-standing AF or a prior intracardiac device should raise the suspicion of severe isolated TR.

Assessment of volume status

The physiological basis of providing 'optimal' filling in cardiogenic shock is that a critical decrease in intravascular-stressed volume reduces the difference between mean systemic venous and right atrial pressure, thereby limiting stroke volume. Although frequently used, invasive static pressure monitoring is not helpful for determining whether an individual patient is volume-responsive. Static echocardiographic parameters are widely used to predict volume responsiveness in critically ill patients (FIG. 4); however, their use requires that a number of strict criteria (relating to the patient, their underlying pathology, and medical interventions) are met, otherwise the investigation becomes invalid (see Supplementary information S3 (table)). Similarly, although thought to be superior, dynamic echocardiographic parameters to predict volume responsiveness are valid only in fully mechanically ventilated patients in sinus rhythm and without chronic heart disease. In the presence of cardiac disease (either left-sided and/or right-sided), these measurements can be misleading and should not be used. Conversely, tolerance to volume loading among different patients is variable. The conventional teaching to increase volume in RV failure has not been upheld by findings published in the past 3 years. Physiological models suggest that in some patients, progressive fluid loading leads to a plateauing of cardiac output, with a progressive increase in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. In addition, higher volume is associated with worse outcome in critically ill patients –.
