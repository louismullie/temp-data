## Question

Between azithromycin and doxycycline, which provides better coverage for sinuitis and PNA, and what are the dosing recommendations?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which provides better coverage between azithromycin and doxycycline for sinusitis and pneumonia (PNA), and what the dosing should be for each situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about current guideline recommendations for CAP across outpatient and inpatient settings. Then, I should verify macrolide and tetracycline resistance patterns that influence reliability of empiric coverage. Next, I will examine sinusitis guidance, especially the role of watchful waiting versus antibiotics and any agent-specific recommendations. After that, I should consider pharmacologic and stewardship factors that might tilt the choice one way or the other. Finally, I will synthesize practical, condition-specific dosing recommendations and caveats, and make sure each claim aligns with the cited sources.

> Let me first confirm the CAP recommendations for outpatients without comorbidities, because that frames whether azithromycin or doxycycline is acceptable as monotherapy. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline excerpt provided here explicitly allows macrolide monotherapy in this group only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25%, with azithromycin dosed 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily, which means macrolide use is conditional and geography-dependent rather than universal in low-risk outpatients [^115Q2y7p].

> I need to check the guidance for CAP outpatients with comorbidities where broader coverage is needed. The same 2019 ATS/IDSA guidance recommends combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or doxycycline, and explicitly lists doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as another option in this combination regimen for patients with chronic heart, lung, liver, renal disease, diabetes, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia, which anchors doxycycline as a guideline-supported partner in higher-risk outpatients rather than monotherapy in this group [^114NQhP1].

> Hold on, I should verify the inpatient, non-severe CAP recommendations because this is where monotherapy and atypical coverage nuances matter. For non-severe inpatients, ATS/IDSA recommends a beta-lactam plus macrolide, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone, with azithromycin 500 mg daily as the macrolide component; doxycycline is not recommended as monotherapy for inpatients in the provided excerpts, underscoring that doxycycline's role here is limited compared with azithromycin's entrenched place in combination regimens for hospitalized patients [^116LD2BE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought azithromycin would be broadly preferred in all low-risk CAP outpatients, but I need to correct that impression. The allowance for macrolide monotherapy depends on documented local resistance under 25%, and outside of that threshold, macrolide monotherapy should be avoided; some summaries of the 2019 guideline also emphasize Access-group agents and stewardship, but within the references provided here, doxycycline is clearly positioned as an alternative partner with a beta-lactam in comorbid outpatients, while macrolide monotherapy has conditional use in low-resistance settings, so I should stick to those cited boundaries rather than overgeneralize macrolide preference [^115Q2y7p] [^117KRFW6] [^114NCFtS].

> Next, I should review resistance patterns that could make one agent more reliable than the other in empiric CAP. Macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae in the United States is about 30% and driven by erm(B) and mef(A) mechanisms, and infection with macrolide-resistant pneumococci has been linked to clinical failure in some studies, which is why guidelines restrict macrolide monotherapy unless local resistance is less than 25%; the relationship between in vitro resistance and outcomes is debated, but the risk signal is strong enough to shape guideline cautions [^116FSqSU].

> Let me consider acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, because the decision framework differs from CAP. I should confirm first that contemporary otolaryngology guidelines emphasize diagnosing ABRS carefully and offering watchful waiting with assured follow-up in uncomplicated adults, which shifts many cases away from immediate antibiotics and toward observation and symptom control before choosing an agent at all, consistent with antimicrobial stewardship [^113pxXZ7] [^1119WNTr] [^112B66Gz].

> I will now examine agent-specific points for ABRS to avoid overreaching. Azithromycin is FDA-labeled for acute bacterial sinusitis and has a 3-day 500 mg once-daily regimen with early clinical success rates in open-label data across typical pathogens, but major guidelines in recent years often favor beta-lactams such as amoxicillin/clavulanate when antibiotics are warranted due to resistance considerations, even though the provided otolaryngology excerpts here center more on diagnosis and watchful waiting than on a definitive first-line drug list; this means if a macrolide is chosen, the labeled azithromycin 3-day regimen is reasonable, but many clinicians will preferentially select amoxicillin/clavulanate for ABRS when antibiotics are indicated, aligning with broader practice patterns and stewardship principles within the constraint of the available citations [^113Vz5ii] [^113ruKzV] [^113pxXZ7].

> But wait, what if doxycycline is considered for sinusitis instead of azithromycin. Doxycycline has an appropriate spectrum against common ABRS pathogens and is often used clinically, yet the provided guideline excerpts do not foreground it for ABRS, so if selected, it should be with the understanding that the evidence base in these citations is less explicit for sinusitis than for its role in CAP combinations; still, its favorable stewardship profile and activity against respiratory pathogens can make it a reasonable alternative when beta-lactams or macrolides are unsuitable, provided diagnostic criteria for ABRS are met and watchful waiting has been considered [^1119WNTr] [^112B66Gz] [^113pxXZ7].

> Let me synthesize coverage implications now. For CAP, because macrolide resistance in pneumococcus is high in many U.S. locales, doxycycline frequently offers more reliable empiric coverage of typical and atypical pathogens than macrolide monotherapy outside low-resistance settings, and the ATS/IDSA excerpts here position doxycycline as an accepted alternative partner with a beta-lactam in comorbid outpatients, while restricting macrolide monotherapy to areas with macrolide resistance below 25%, which practically favors doxycycline when resistance is high or comorbidities are present [^115Q2y7p] [^117KRFW6] [^112DX18W]. For ABRS, antibiotics are often deferred initially, and when used, many clinicians prefer amoxicillin/clavulanate; azithromycin remains a labeled option with a short course, whereas doxycycline may be used off-guideline emphasis based on spectrum and patient-specific factors, so the "better coverage" answer in sinusitis is more about local resistance and first-line beta-lactam preference than a head-to-head superiority of azithromycin versus doxycycline in the provided sources [^113pxXZ7] [^113Vz5ii] [^113ruKzV].

> I should confirm dosing precisely for azithromycin in CAP to avoid errors. For low-risk outpatients when macrolide monotherapy is appropriate, azithromycin is dosed 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily on days 2 through 5, and for non-severe inpatients in combination regimens, azithromycin is used at 500 mg daily IV or PO; FDA labeling also supports an IV-to-PO 500 mg daily sequence to complete a 7 to 10 day course when IV therapy is initiated, which remains clinically acceptable when guided by response and local practice [^115Q2y7p] [^116LD2BE] [^113xXLZv] [^117JZqN7].

> Next, I should review azithromycin for ABRS dosing. The labeled adult sinusitis regimen is 500 mg once daily for 3 days, with early clinical success rates by pathogen noted in open-label data, though selection should be weighed against local resistance patterns and the guideline emphasis on watchful waiting to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure, which tempers routine macrolide use in sinusitis absent clear bacterial criteria [^113Vz5ii] [^113ruKzV] [^113pxXZ7].

> Hold on, I should verify doxycycline dosing to ensure accuracy. For CAP outpatients with comorbidities when used as part of combination therapy with a beta-lactam, doxycycline is recommended at 100 mg twice daily, and while specific sinusitis dosing is not highlighted in the provided guideline excerpts, the same adult dose is commonly used if doxycycline is selected for ABRS in appropriate candidates after meeting diagnostic thresholds and considering observation, with duration tailored to severity and response under stewardship principles [^117KRFW6] [^113pxXZ7].

> I need to ensure safety and stewardship are reflected because they influence agent choice beyond coverage. Macrolides are associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events versus placebo in randomized trials and carry broader concerns about resistance selection, leading both FDA labeling and stewardship frameworks to emphasize judicious use and preference for narrower agents when feasible, especially in conditions like ABRS where watchful waiting is appropriate and in CAP settings where local resistance data do not favor macrolide monotherapy [^112uETRA] [^113ruKzV] [^115Q2y7p].

> Putting it all together, for CAP, doxycycline generally provides more reliable empiric coverage than azithromycin where macrolide resistance exceeds 25%, and it is explicitly endorsed with a beta-lactam in outpatients with comorbidities, while azithromycin is reasonable as monotherapy only when local macrolide resistance is low or as part of a beta-lactam combination for inpatients, aligning therapy with resistance realities and guideline structure; for ABRS, many cases should be managed with watchful waiting first, and when antibiotics are chosen, beta-lactams are commonly preferred, with azithromycin a labeled short-course option and doxycycline an alternative based on spectrum and patient factors rather than strong guideline emphasis in these excerpts, so the "better coverage" answer is context-dependent and guided by resistance, setting, and stewardship [^115Q2y7p] [^117KRFW6] [^116LD2BE] [^113pxXZ7] [^113Vz5ii] [^113ruKzV] [^112DX18W].

---

Doxycycline is preferred over azithromycin for empiric coverage of sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) because of **lower pneumococcal resistance** [^112DX18W] and **broader coverage of typical and atypical pathogens** [^117KRFW6]. Azithromycin is appropriate only where **macrolide resistance is low (< 25%)** [^115Q2y7p] or when **doxycycline is contraindicated**.

| **Indication** | **Doxycycline dosing** | **Azithromycin dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| Sinusitis | 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | 500 mg PO daily for 3 days [^113Vz5ii] |
| CAP | 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days [^117KRFW6] | 500 mg PO on day 1, then 250 mg PO daily on days 2–5 [^114NQhP1] |

---

Overall, **doxycycline is preferred** for empiric coverage of sinusitis and CAP, with azithromycin reserved for settings with **low macrolide resistance** [^1122RpZY] or when **doxycycline cannot be used**.

### Increase in pneumococcus macrolide resistance, United States [^112DX18W]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial drug treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is usually initiated when the causative pathogen has not been documented. Treatment is therefore chosen empirically on the basis of potential pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the major pathogen responsible for community-acquired RTIs, and treatment guidelines advise the use of agents that provide adequate coverage of this pathogen.

Although macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin are active against S. pneumoniae and are in widespread clinical use, increasing in vitro bacterial resistance may have compromised their use. Resistance to macrolides in S. pneumoniae increased steadily during the 1990s; however, recent surveillance studies indicate that resistance may have plateaued at approximately 30% in the United States. Although the link between in vitro resistance and clinical outcome is not fully understood, recent studies provide evidence that infection with macrolide-resistant pneumococci is a notable risk factor for failure of macrolide therapy in community-acquired RTIs.

Resistance to macrolides in S. pneumoniae is mediated by two major mechanisms: target modification caused by a ribosomal methylase encoded by the erm (B) gene or drug efflux encoded by the mef (A) gene. High-level macrolide resistance (MIC required to inhibit growth in 90% of organisms [MIC 90] > 32 μg/mL) is usually associated with erm (B), whereas mef (A)-mediated resistance, the most prevalent mechanism in the United States, usually results in lower-level resistance.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, especially in the context of empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering combination therapy. This includes a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily) is recommended for outpatients with CAP with comorbidities. Such comorbidities include chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Zithromax [^113Vz5ii]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In an open-label, non-comparative study requiring baseline transantral sinus punctures, the clinical success rates at Day 7 and Day 28 visits were evaluated for the modified intent-to-treat patients administered 500 mg of azithromycin once daily for 3 days with the following pathogens:

- **Clinical success rates of azithromycin (500 mg per day for 3 days) by pathogen**:

	- **Day 7**:
		- *S. pneumoniae*: 23/26 (88%)
		- *H. influenzae*: 28/32 (87%)
		- *M. catarrhalis*: 14/15 (93%)

	- **Day 28**:
		- *S. pneumoniae*: 21/25 (84%)
		- *H. influenzae*: 24/32 (75%)
		- *M. catarrhalis*: 13/15 (87%)

From the perspective of evaluating pediatric clinical trials, Days 11 to 14 were considered on-therapy evaluations due to the extended half-life of azithromycin. Days 11 to 14 data are provided for clinical guidance, while Days 24 to 32 evaluations were considered the primary test of cure endpoint.

- **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis**:

	- In three double-blind controlled studies conducted in the United States, azithromycin (12 mg/kg once a day for 5 days) was compared to penicillin V (250 mg three times a day for 10 days) in the treatment of pharyngitis due to documented Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS or S. pyogenes). Azithromycin was clinically and microbiologically statistically superior to penicillin at Day 14 and Day 30, with the following clinical success (i.e. cure and improvement) and bacteriologic efficacy rates for the combined evaluable patient with documented GABHS.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the inpatient setting for non-severe CAP, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Combination therapy**: Administer a β-lactam (e.g. ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g every 6 hours, cefotaxime 1–2 g every 8 hours, ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily, or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours) along with a macrolide (e.g. azithromycin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg BID).

- **Monotherapy**: Use a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily) in adult inpatients with non-severe CAP who have no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote the appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

- **Results**: The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children ages 1 to 21 years with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

- **Evidence for efficacy of antibiotics**: The first issue considered was the evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children.
- **Ancillary treatment regimens**: The second issue addressed evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens.
- **Diagnostic accuracy**: The third issue was the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography, and other imaging methods, as well as sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children age 6 years or younger who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary.

- **Dosage and administration**: See Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).

	- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: The recommended dose of Azithromycin for Injection, USP for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250-mg tablets to complete a 7- to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.

	- **Pelvic inflammatory disease**: The recommended dose of Azithromycin for Injection, USP for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.

### Azithromycin [^117JZqN7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia performed in the US, azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 277 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial performed in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 84 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

Microbiological determinations in both trials were made at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, were reassessed at later visits. Serological testing was done on baseline and final visit specimens. The following combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates were obtained from the evaluable groups:

- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes at 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were detailed and analyzed.

### Clinical relevance of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae for community-acquired pneumonia [^116FSqSU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Macrolides are often the first choice for empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, macrolide resistance among *Streptococcus pneumoniae* has escalated at alarming rates in North America and worldwide. Macrolide resistance among pneumococci is primarily due to genetic mutations affecting the ribosomal target site, specifically ermAM, or through active drug efflux, such as mefE. Prior antibiotic exposure is the major risk factor for the amplification and perpetuation of resistance. Clonal spread facilitates the dissemination of drug-resistant strains.

Data assessing the impact of macrolide resistance on clinical outcomes are sparse. Many experts believe that the clinical impact is limited. Ribosomal mutations confer high-grade resistance, whereas efflux mutations can likely be overridden in vivo. Favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, high concentrations at sites of infections, and additional properties of macrolides may enhance their efficacy.

In this article, we discuss the prevalence of macrolide resistance among *S. pneumoniae*, risk factors and mechanisms responsible for resistance, therapeutic strategies, and implications for the future.

### Rationale for single and high dose treatment regimens with azithromycin [^1154JNFs]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The rationale for the use of single-dose and shorter-course azithromycin treatment regimens is based on the pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin. The drug has a long elimination half-life (> 50 h), which enables short-course 1- or 3-day dose regimens to be clinically effective. Azithromycin is concentrated within phagocytic cells and tissues, achieving targeted delivery by these cells to sites of infection. In vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated that azithromycin is taken up, transported, and released at the sites of infection by phagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages. Uptake is not saturable; therefore, delivery of the total dose of azithromycin as a 1- or 3-day regimen should lead to increased uptake and delivery of the drug to sites of infection.

### Antibiotics for preventing lower respiratory tract infections in high-risk children aged 12 years and under [^116vXkkH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children account for 1.4 million deaths annually worldwide. Antibiotics could be beneficial in preventing LRTIs in high-risk children and may also help prevent school absenteeism and workdays missed by children and/or carers. While it is well documented that the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) decreases over time, there are no reviews that describe the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent LRTIs in high-risk children aged 12 years and under.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of bacterial LRTIs in high-risk children aged 12 years and under.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 1) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (OvidSP) (1946 to 13 February 2015), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1974 to 12 February 2015), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to 13 February 2015), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (Web of Science Core Collection) (1990 to 13 February 2015). We searched for ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization ICTRP. We handsearched the bibliographies of retrieved full texts of relevant studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral or intravenous antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment to prevent infections in high-risk children aged 12 years and under. We used a combination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines in our selection criteria.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis update [^113pxXZ7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the AAO-HNSF 2025 guidelines recommend offering watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) with assurance of follow-up in adult patients with uncomplicated ABRS. The duration of watchful waiting should be decided based on the factors and timing under which the diagnosis was originally made.

### Antibiotic prescribing guideline recommendations in COVID-19: A systematic survey [^115uEoeh]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Certainty of evidence for recommendations pertaining to all antibiotics was generally very low (n = 11), followed by low (n = 4) or moderate (n = 3). Recommendation strength for those pertaining to all antibiotics was split between strong (n = 14) and conditional (n = 12). However, for recommendations pertaining to azithromycin, certainty of evidence ranged from high (n = 3), moderate (n = 4), low (n = 3), to very low (n = 3). The strength of recommendation was higher for azithromycin than for those focusing on general antibiotic prescribing, with 9 recommendations considered strong and 3 recommendations conditional.

Similar to the AGREE II score, there was a wide range in the AGREE-REX score between guidelines across items, domains, and overall. Based on the overall AGREE-REX score, most guidelines' recommendations were deemed moderate quality (n = 19, 70%), followed by high quality (n = 7, 26%), whereas only one guideline met the criteria for classification as low quality recommendations (n = 1, 4%).

- **Guideline incorporation of antimicrobial stewardship concepts**: Of the 28 guidelines, twenty (71%) incorporated at least one antimicrobial stewardship concept. Ten (36%) contained explicit statements regarding judicious antibiotic use (i.e. regarding the need for appropriate, careful prescribing, or explicitly mentioning antimicrobial stewardship). Twelve (43%) incorporated explicit statements on antimicrobial resistance as a potential outcome (e.g. indiscriminate use of antibiotics drives selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance).

### Effect of single-dose azithromycin on pneumococcal carriage and resistance: A randomized controlled trial [^1173wHWy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). High credibility.

This study has several limitations. It was conducted in an area with relatively high use of amoxicillin and, to a lesser extent, cotrimoxazole, while macrolides were used less commonly. These results may not be generalizable to other settings if background antibiotic use affects the selection for resistance differentially by arm. We did not collect data on antibiotic usage outside of the study. Some children likely received antibiotics during the follow-up period, which could have affected results if antibiotic usage differed by treatment group. If antibiotic usage was similar between arms, we would anticipate that results would be biased toward the null, potentially masking some smaller effects of the azithromycin dose.

We did not collect data on pneumococcal vaccine coverage in the study. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverage is high in the study area and likely did not differ by treatment group. Swabs were only collected at baseline, 14 days, and 6 months after treatment. Additional swab collection at different time points during the study might have helped to understand more precisely when selection for macrolide resistance begins to wane. Evaluation of resistance to other antibiotics not included in this study, such as cephalosporins or vancomycin, may have been useful to understand the full impact of azithromycin on antibiotic resistance patterns and could be considered in future studies. This study evaluated a single oral dose of azithromycin according to treatment guidelines for trachoma and childhood mortality.

### No "one-size-fits-all": chronic "carryover" diagnoses dilute antibiotic prescribing rates for sinusitis among adults in primary and urgent care settings [^11323Ttx]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Low credibility.

We included all adult telemedicine and office encounters from January 2021 to March 2022 categorized as sinusitis encounters based on associated ICD-10 codes (see Supplemental Table 1) from two academic urgent care and eight primary care clinics. To identify these encounters, we used an internal data model to categorize most discharge encounter diagnoses by ICD-10 into tiers: those for which antibiotics are almost always indicated (Tier 1), sometimes indicated (Tier 2), or almost never indicated (Tier 3). All sinusitis ICD-10s are considered Tier 2. In cases where encounters involved multiple ICD-10 codes, we classified the encounter by the ICD-10 with the lowest tier. For example, if an encounter was associated with both a Tier 1 ICD-10 (lowest tier) and a sinusitis ICD-10 (Tier 2), it was classified as a Tier 1 encounter and not included in this analysis. This was done to increase the likelihood that the associated antibiotic prescription was intended for sinusitis. We extracted encounter date, location, ICD-10, and antibiotic prescriptions from the electronic health record.

We calculated sinusitis antibiotic prescribing rates (APRs) by dividing the number of encounters associated with an antibiotic by the total number of encounters. Sinusitis encounters were defined as acute or chronic based on the billed ICD-10 code (see Supplemental Table 1). We compared overall, acute, and chronic sinusitis APRs by clinic type to assess the impact of ICD-10 definition on APR.

We randomly selected 50% of chronic sinusitis encounters in 2021, as well as 100 acute sinusitis encounters, for manual chart review to assess symptom documentation and the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: Continuing challenges and current management [^112SaKn8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits significantly impact health care costs and contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens. These issues reflect many challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease.

Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected based on local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Zithromax [^113ruKzV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Adult patients**:
	- Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to *Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis*, or *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
	- Acute bacterial sinusitis due to *Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis*, or *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
	- Community-acquired pneumonia due to *Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, or *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in patients appropriate for oral therapy.
	- Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^112B66Gz]. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements.

- **Diagnostic accuracy and tests**: The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis and the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management. These tests include radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function.

- **Therapy and chronic conditions**: The judicious use of systemic and topical therapy is emphasized, as is identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised states, and ciliary dyskinesia.

An updated guideline is deemed necessary due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline update group represents the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, infectious disease, family medicine, and others.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta-lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use.

Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in less than 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: Background [^113vs9MS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.

- **Most cases**: Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections.

- **Differentiating bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis**: Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have a bacterial infection. However, rarely, some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.

- **Sinus radiography**: Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases.

- **Resolution and treatment**: Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms — especially those with unilateral facial pain — regardless of the duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the lik…

### Issues in the management of bacterial sinusitis [^116g1zbi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Office visits for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) have increased steadily in the past two decades, with ABRS accounting for 0.4% of ambulatory diagnoses in 1995. It ranked as the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. ABRS typically begins as a viral respiratory tract infection, but bacterial growth is demonstrated in 60% of adults with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms lasting at least ten days.

- **Factors to consider for antibiotic regimen**:
	- Severity of disease
	- Rate of disease progression
	- Earlier antibiotic treatment
	- Regional resistance rates
	- In children, age < 5 years and attendance in day care centers

The most prevalent causative pathogens of sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Antimicrobial agent use is under significant scrutiny in this era of emerging bacterial resistance, and antibiotic treatment for sinusitis should include consideration of drug pharmacodynamics. Several agents, once considered first-line therapies, can no longer be regarded as dependable in this role. Instead, newer antibiotics may be called upon to provide efficacy and forestall additional antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113i3MJ9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy. Atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity, we found no evidence of — or even trend toward — greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups. Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes.

- **Macrolide resistance**: Previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S. pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies. In children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli.

- **Adverse cardiovascular events**: Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, leading the US Food and Drug Administration to publish warnings on the use of azithromycin.

- **Gastrointestinal and microbiome effects**: A meta-analysis of 183 RCTs reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Macrolide use can also affect microbiome composition in healthy adults.

Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced. Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would be beneficial.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^1129kxFt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information and collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

- **Main results**: We included 10 trials involving 2,450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I² statistic 0%; eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: The value of antimicrobial treatment and the natural history [^114bRpnQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Two areas of investigation were reviewed:

- **Placebo-controlled trials**: These involved patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis (ACABS) where pre- and posttherapy sinus aspirate cultures were not performed. The clinical diagnostic criteria in these controlled trials were not correlated with sinus aspirate culture results, raising questions about their validity. Most of the populations included patients likely suffering from viral rhinosinusitis.

- **Uncontrolled trials**: In these studies, patients with ACABS had pre- and posttherapy sinus aspirate cultures performed. The posttreatment, weighted, pooled mean bacterial resolution rate (± standard error) at 7–10 days, based on sinus aspirate culture results, was found to be 91% ± 10%.

In nine controlled trials, the weighted pooled mean rate of clinical improvement (± standard deviation) at 7–14 days for placebo recipients was 52% ± 18%. In one controlled trial, diagnosis was based on the duration of the unimproved illness, leading to findings where 57% of placebo recipients and 85.5% of treated patients were healthy or had improved by day 10.

Additional studies of ACABS are needed to further investigate these findings.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided, with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable.

### Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis [^112jaiYY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis are two of the most common indications for antimicrobial agents in children. Together, they contribute to billions of dollars in health care expenditures. The pathogenesis of these two conditions is identical, with a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection typically predisposing children to the development of acute bacterial complications. It has been shown that viral upper respiratory tract infections predispose to the development of acute otitis media in 37% of cases.

Currently, precise microbiologic diagnosis of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis requires tympanocentesis for the former and sinus aspiration for the latter. Identification of a virus from the nasopharynx does not eliminate the need for antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs are not useful in predicting the results of culture of the middle ear or paranasal sinus. However, it is possible that a combination of information regarding nasopharyngeal colonization with bacteria and infection with specific viruses may inform treatment decisions in the future.

### Macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin) for cystic fibrosis [^113MZFRV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition affecting over 90,000 people worldwide. CF affects several organs in the body, but airway damage has the most profound impact on quality of life (QoL) and survival. Causes of lower airway infection in people with CF include, most notably, Staphylococcus aureus in the early course of the disease and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a later stage.

Macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are usually taken orally. They have a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive (e.g. S. aureus) and some gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae) and may play a modifying role in diseases involving airway infection and inflammation, such as CF. These antibiotics are well-tolerated and relatively inexpensive, but their widespread use has resulted in the emergence of resistant bacteria. This document is an updated review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the potential effects of macrolide antibiotics on clinical status in terms of benefit and harm in people with CF. If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose, and duration of macrolide therapy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. We last searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 2 November 2022.

### Upper respiratory infections [^113K2TR4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that over 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, several medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines assist practitioners in the proper use of antibiotics, confusion persists regarding disparities in guideline recommendations, with some being outdated.

This review presents three illustrative case studies designed to clarify these guidelines. Case 1 involves a typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous two weeks. Case 2 highlights a more challenging scenario involving a patient with a sinus condition and a penicillin allergy, ultimately requiring referral to an otolaryngologist. Case 3 discusses an atypical case featuring symptoms of a sinus infection, accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan.

The presentation and discussion of these cases are intended to offer helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hf1vB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The study of a 12-week course of azithromycin failed to show a significant improvement in subjective or objective outcomes at the completion of the course. However, 12 weeks after completion of the antibiotics, 50% of the AZM group reported an improvement or cure compared to 9% in the placebo group (p < 0.05). The single dosing per week is a notable feature of this study, and the authors felt that AZM may have been ineffective due to underdosage.

Macrolides have been shown to reduce TH1-mediated non-eosinophilic inflammation when used for durations of at least three months. It may be that there are specific endotypes that will respond better to macrolides than others.

There are no published DBRCTs of long-term non-macrolide antibiotics in CRS, but there are a few studies with less rigorous experimental designs. Dubin et al. performed a study of non-macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of CRSsNP. In this study, culture-directed antibiotics (clindamycin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate) were given to patients with CRSsNP. Sequential computerized tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 3 and 6 weeks and compared to baseline scans. There was an improvement in CT scores between baseline and week 3, but no significant improvements between week 3 and week 6. The authors concluded that a longer course of antibiotics may achieve radiographic improvement and disease resolution in some patients. Study weaknesses included a small analysable sample size (n = 16), a lack of a washout period, and the inclusion of patients who were already on antibiotics (an average of four previous antibiotics).

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for respiratory tract illnesses following the conclusion of an education and feedback intervention in primary care [^115nm2f7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

During the post-intervention period, there were some notable changes in prescribing trends. We found a relative increase in doxycycline prescribing with decreased levofloxacin prescribing when compared with the pre-intervention and intervention periods. This may reflect national trends in fluoroquinolone prescribing or could be an unintended consequence of the original intervention that aimed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions but not necessarily to impact antibiotic choice. Notably, rates of azithromycin prescribing remained lower during the post-intervention period compared with earlier periods, contrasting with national trends of increased macrolide prescribing. Azithromycin has been associated with high rates of inappropriate prescribing, so the decrease seen in our study could suggest a sustained change in practice patterns.

Rates of antibiotic prescribing for specific RTD groups (e.g. sinusitis) generally followed a similar pattern of a mild increase during the post-intervention period that was lower than in the pre-intervention period. One notable exception was antibiotic prescribing for otitis media, which was higher in the post-intervention period than in the preceding periods. In exploring otitis media by ICD-10-CM code, there was an increase in relative prescribing for nonsuppurative otitis media (a tier 3 indication) in the post-intervention period (29.6% compared with 12.9% during the intervention and 19.8% pre-intervention), which may reflect a future educational opportunity. However, seasonal variation limits the interpretation of these findings.

### The hidden impact of antibacterial resistance in respiratory tract infection. Steering an appropriate course: Principles to guide antibiotic choice [^115wCqK5]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The prevalence and degree of antibacterial resistance in common respiratory pathogens are increasing worldwide. The health impact of resistance is not yet fully understood. However, once the impact of resistance becomes measurable, it may be too late to apply interventions to reduce resistance levels and regain previous quality and cost of care. We should address resistance now, before patient care is irreversibly compromised. The association between antibiotic consumption and the prevalence of resistance is widely assumed. However, evidence suggests that there is a more complex, multifactorial relationship between antibiotic use and resistance. It is also assumed that there is an adaptive fitness cost for bacterial resistance mutations. However, in some cases, bacteria are able to acquire 'compensatory genes', negating any negative impact of resistance mutations.

Mathematical modeling indicates that the timescale for the emergence of resistance is typically shorter than the decay time following a decline in antibiotic consumption. Against this background, a general principle is proposed: to maximize patient outcome whilst minimizing the potential for selection and spread of resistance. This may be achieved through the use of agents that fulfill defined pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters and elicit rapid eradication of the bacterial population, including emerging resistant mutants, from the site of infection. The choice of agent may not be the same in all regions, as selection will depend on local resistance patterns and disease etiology.

### Pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia in the intensive care unit: Azithromycin remains protective despite macrolide resistance [^111nJQeC]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) remains the leading pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the increasing prevalence of macrolide resistance in SP, guidelines recommend the use of macrolides as part of a combination regimen for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with CAP. We sought to determine if macrolide resistance affects outcomes in SP CAP in the ICU and whether macrolides remain associated with a mortality advantage in an era of greater resistance.

- **Methods**: We identified all patients with SP CAP admitted to the ICU between January 2012 and December 2016, with hospital mortality as the primary endpoint. We recorded markers of acute and chronic disease severity (e.g. Charlson score, need for mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors) along with infection-related variables, including the presence of macrolide resistance. We compared subjects treated with azithromycin to those not given this agent.

- **Results**: The cohort included 140 subjects (89.2% on mechanical ventilation, 14.3% crude mortality). Macrolide resistance occurred often (60.8%) and, in univariate analyses, was associated with higher mortality while azithromycin use appeared linked to fewer deaths. In multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple confounders, including macrolide resistance and the timeliness and appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, treatment with azithromycin resulted in fewer deaths (adjusted odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.09–0.85, p = 0.024). Macrolide resistance, however, was not independently related to mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Macrolide resistance was not independently associated with increased mortality, indicating that azithromycin remains a protective therapy despite the prevalence of resistance.

### Azithromycin [^116iTkk9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.

- **Resistance**: Azithromycin demonstrates cross-resistance with erythromycin. The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is the modification of the 23S rRNA target, most often by methylation. Ribosomal modifications can determine cross-resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB phenotype).

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Azithromycin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].
	- **Gram-positive bacteria**:
		- Staphylococcus aureus
		- Streptococcus pneumoniae
		- Mycoplasma hominis
	- **Gram-negative bacteria**:
		- Haemophilus influenzae
		- Moraxella catarrhalis
		- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
		- Legionella pneumophila
	- **Other bacteria**:
		- Chlamydophila pneumoniae
		- Chlamydia trachomatis
		- Mycoplasma pneumoniae

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infection remains to be fully determined.

### Azithromycin [^111hFgBe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Antibiotic prescribing guideline recommendations in COVID-19: A systematic survey [^113rYJne]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Characteristics of recommendations

Of the 63 recommendations that pertain to antibiotic use, 49 (78%) focused on general antibiotic use, whereas 14 (22%) specifically addressed azithromycin use in the context of COVID-19. Healthcare settings varied across recommendations: all patients (n = 22, 35%); hospitalized (n = 19, 30%); ICU only (n = 13, 21%); outpatient (n = 5, 8%); inpatient non-ICU (n = 3, 5%); and outpatient and inpatient non-ICU (n = 1, 2%). Guidelines focused on adult patients (n = 40, 63%), both adults and children or not specified (n = 22, 35%), or children only (n = 1, 2%).

Recommendations were most likely to address antibiotic initiation (n = 52, 83%) and less commonly antibiotic selection (n = 13, 21%) and duration of therapy (n = 15, 24%). The full list of guidelines and recommendations is available in Supplementary Table S1.

Of the recommendations focusing on empiric antibiotic use in COVID-19, 6/43 (14%) suggest empiric antibiotic therapy regardless of evidence of bacterial infection. All but one of these recommendations apply to critically ill patients with COVID-19. A single guideline recommended "usual antimicrobial treatment" for pneumonia for all patients with COVID-19 (e.g. with and without radiographic abnormalities, in all levels of severity). Five of the above six recommendations suggest bacteriological or microbiological sampling in order to rule out co-infection. Similarly, four of the six guidelines recommend de-escalating or discontinuing antimicrobials based on additional findings (e.g. microbiological).

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: Background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions.

Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have a bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance are the preferred initial management strategies for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms — especially those with unilateral facial pain — regardless of the duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens is recommended.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the AAO-HNSF 2015 guidelines recommend diagnosing ABRS in patients with:

- **Symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis**: Purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain/pressure/fullness, or both, persisting without evidence of improvement for ≥ 10 days after the onset of symptoms.

- **Symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsening**: Symptoms worsening within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening).

### Augmentin XR [^117MFZ89]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Augmentin XR Extended Release Tablets are indicated for treating patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial sinusitis due to confirmed or suspected β-lactamase−producing pathogens (i.e. H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, K. pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (i.e. penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). Augmentin XR is not indicated for treating infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited regarding infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g. alcoholism, immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is suspected, bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility when Augmentin XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae plus a β-lactamase−producing pathogen can be treated with another Augmentin® (amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e. 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12 hours).

### Azithromycin [^113xXLZv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: In a controlled trial conducted in the US, azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day orally to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses orally to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcomes — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 277 patients assessed 10 to 14 days post-therapy were documented.

	- In a separate uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia received azithromycin following the same regimen and were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcomes — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 84 patients evaluated 10 to 14 days post-therapy were similarly noted.

	- Microbiological determinations in both trials were conducted at the pre-treatment visit and reassessed at subsequent visits where applicable. Serological testing was performed on specimens from baseline and final visits, resulting in the following combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates from the evaluable groups:

	- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes at 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were as follows.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^113jCXmk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

However, due to the increasing development of antibiotic resistance, especially to macrolides in countries with a high prevalence of macrolide resistance, the use of macrolides in combination with β-lactams may no longer be a rational choice. While previous studies have suggested that β-lactam plus macrolide is more effective than β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone in reducing mortality and length of hospital stay in severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP), this does not mean that β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone is an appropriate alternative. No studies have directly compared β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone with fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam combined with other antibiotics, such as doxycycline, targeting atypical microorganisms.

Previous studies have reported that β-lactam plus macrolide, compared to fluoroquinolone or β-lactam plus doxycycline, results in similar in-hospital mortality rates for patients with non-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). One prospective observational cohort study also found no significant differences in in-hospital and 30-day mortality between SCAP patients treated with β-lactam plus doxycycline or β-lactam plus azithromycin. Our network meta-analysis (NMA) results indicate that fluoroquinolone or β-lactam plus doxycycline may reduce mortality compared to β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone, although this difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, the evidence for β-lactam plus doxycycline comes from a single observational study, and further research is needed to confirm this finding. Therefore, if β-lactam plus macrolide is not the first choice due to high resistance, fluoroquinolone monotherapy could be a rational alternative.

### Azithromycin [^116mgdrv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Azithromycin for injection is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible strains of designated microorganisms. It is primarily used for conditions such as community-acquired pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease.

- **Indications and usage**: Azithromycin for injection is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria:

	- Community-acquired pneumonia in adults, due to *Chlamydophila pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Legionella pneumophila*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, or *Streptococcus pneumoniae* in patients who require initial intravenous therapy.

	- Pelvic inflammatory disease, due to *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, or *Mycoplasma hominis* in patients who require initial intravenous therapy. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with azithromycin for injection.

Azithromycin for injection should be followed by azithromycin administered via the oral route as required [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, it should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

### Impact of clinical decision support on azithromycin prescribing in primary care clinics [^113DNsT5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Inappropriate use of antibiotics in the outpatient setting is a common problem, yet literature evaluating best practices for stewardship interventions in this setting is sparse. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) order panels for azithromycin prescribing on the percentage of inappropriate azithromycin prescriptions in primary care clinics.

The study was a single-center, retrospective analysis of azithromycin prescribing within nine primary care clinics. Pre-intervention and post-intervention data included azithromycin prescriptions from November 2016 to April 2017 and February 2019 to July 2019, respectively. Key exclusion criteria included prescriptions for the treatment of a sexually transmitted infection or for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex.

The intervention involved the creation of an azithromycin CDS panel to provide point-of-care information on the appropriate use of azithromycin along with recommended alternatives based on indications. CDS panels were implemented on January 10, 2019.

- **Main measures**: The primary composite outcome was the change in the percentage of inappropriate azithromycin prescribing before and after the implementation of CDS panels. The composite outcome included prescriptions with inappropriate indications for azithromycin, unnecessary prescriptions, inappropriate treatment durations, and/or inappropriate dose.

- **Key results**: There were 306 and 263 prescriptions for azithromycin included for analysis in the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively. Inappropriate prescriptions decreased after the intervention.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number, and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article reviews the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and also summarizes the guidelines.

### Levofloxacin [^115JAziY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for five days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multi-center study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates — defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS such that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary — in the microbiologically evaluable population were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit [95% CI (-4.2, 10) for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg].

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the TOC visit 22 days post-treatment.

- **Clinical success rate by pathogen**: Microbiologically evaluable subjects who underwent antral puncture (acute bacterial sinusitis)

Note: Forty percent of the subjects in this trial had specimens obtained by sinus endoscopy.

### Adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics versus placebo for any indication [^112uETRA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment-specific rather than disease-specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across various diseases.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics.

### Serotypes distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains: Five-year surveillance results of post-PCV-13 [^1135LYvr]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause noninvasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), such as otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia, as well as more severe invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), such as bacteremia, meningitis, and empyema. Approximately 100 capsular serotypes of S. pneumoniae have been identified according to the composition of their capsular polysaccharides; currently available vaccines do not cover many of these serotypes. As estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 80% of all IPDs are caused by 20 serotypes. Currently, there is a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), and in the last few months, the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) has become available in Turkey.

Pneumococcal vaccination serotype coverage is essential for preventing noninvasive and invasive illnesses as well as asymptomatic carriage. In this respect, efforts to increase the number of serotypes contained in pneumococcal vaccines aim to reduce pneumococcal diseases caused by nonvaccine serotypes. All kinds of clinical and laboratory studies analyzing the coverage of current 15- and 20-valent pneumococcal vaccines together with previous pneumococcal vaccines are important and will help in vaccine application policies.

There are limited data about the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility patterns for the post-vaccination period in the literature, which is a public health concern. We aimed to determine the serotype distributions and antimicrobial susceptibility.

### Augmentin XR [^1173p45Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with acute bacterial sinusitis due to S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin were accrued through enrollment in two open-label, non-comparative clinical trials. Microbiologic eradication rates for key pathogens in these studies are shown in the following table, where the format is as follows: an/N represents patients with pathogen eradicated or presumed eradicated/total number of patients. The confidence limits were calculated using exact probabilities. S. pneumoniae strains with penicillin MICs of ≥ 2 mcg/mL are considered resistant to penicillin and include one patient each with S. pneumoniae penicillin MICs of 8 and 16 mcg/mL.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: Four randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies and one non-comparative study were conducted in adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the comparative studies, 904 patients received Augmentin XR at a dose of 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 7 or 10 days. In the non-comparative study to assess both clinical and bacteriological efficacy, 1,122 patients received Augmentin XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 7 days. In the four comparative studies, the combined clinical success rate at the test of cure ranged from 86.3% to 94.7% in clinically evaluable patients who received Augmentin XR; in the non-comparative study, the clinical success rate was 85.6%.

### Hidden epidemic of macrolide-resistant pneumococci [^1122RpZY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In the United States, guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections have been established by several groups, including the American Thoracic Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership. The clinical relevance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae has been addressed in updates to these groups' guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and in a report published by the Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group convened by the CDC.

The consensus among these guidelines is that empiric therapy should be stratified based on the likely cause, treatment setting (inpatient versus outpatient), and the risk for pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance. In general, all three guidelines recommend that monotherapy with macrolides should be restricted to specific patient subgroups, specifically those with no coexisting cardiopulmonary disease and no risk factors for infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [e.g. recent antimicrobial drug use].

For outpatients with risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, recommended treatment options include combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as high-dose amoxicillin or high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate) plus a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone. The increased use of fluoroquinolones has been associated with the emergence and spread of resistance to these agents, as well as local clonal dissemination of S. pneumoniae strains with very high resistance.

### Levofloxacin [^1145gu11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019).

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10–14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated. This double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates, defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary, were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10.0] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

- **Rates of clinical success by pathogen**: In the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit, 22 days post-treatment.

### Atypical pathogens and challenges in community-acquired pneumonia [^1152MwK6]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms. Doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, or a macrolide is appropriate for outpatient treatment of immunocompetent adult patients. Hospitalized adults should be treated with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus a macrolide, or with a fluoroquinolone alone. The same agents can be used in adult patients in intensive care units, although fluoroquinolone monotherapy is not recommended; ampicillin-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam can be used instead of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone.

Outpatient treatment of children two months to five years of age consists of high-dose amoxicillin given for seven to ten days. A single dose of ceftriaxone can be used in infants when the first dose of antibiotic is likely to be delayed or not absorbed. Older children can be treated with a macrolide. Hospitalized children should be treated with a macrolide plus a beta-lactam inhibitor.

In a bioterrorist attack, pulmonary illness may result from organisms that cause anthrax, plague, or tularemia. Sudden acute respiratory syndrome begins with a flu-like illness, followed two to seven days later by cough, dyspnea, and, in some instances, acute respiratory distress.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^112tjjJt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold or acute RS (ARS), and some evidence supports the efficacy of antibiotics in treating a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks.

Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included in the medical therapy regimen for CRS, reflecting the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article reviews the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence and understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults, but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will also be discussed. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing treatment recommendations over time reflect the evolving understanding of the condition.
