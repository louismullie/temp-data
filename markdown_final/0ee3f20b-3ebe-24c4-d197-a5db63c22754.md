## Question

Treatment of choice for superficial venous thrombosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of choice for superficial venous thrombosis (SVT). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define SVT and stratify risk based on thrombus location, length, and patient factors. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially the CALISTO randomized trial and contemporary guidelines. Next, I will compare anticoagulant options and durations, consider special populations, and finally synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and risk stratification, because management hinges on these. SVT is thrombosis of superficial veins, most often the great saphenous vein, and carries a nontrivial risk of progression to DVT and PE, with reported DVT progression ranging from about 6% to 44% and PE from 2% to 13%, particularly when the thrombus is extensive or near the saphenofemoral junction, so I need to ensure I account for thrombus length, proximity to the SFJ, and patient-specific risks like cancer or thrombophilia [^112hvGHH] [^1133rxNL].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence before jumping to conclusions. The pivotal CALISTO randomized trial in 3,002 patients with lower-extremity SVT at least 5 cm long and more than 3 cm from the SFJ showed that fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily for 45 days reduced symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and SVT recurrence without increasing major bleeding compared with placebo, which establishes fondaparinux as the reference therapy for this phenotype [^1148jkXy] [^112SC69f] [^112hvGHH].

> Hold on, I should confirm how guidelines translate this into practice. Contemporary multisociety guidelines recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days for SVT of the main saphenous trunks or tributaries above the knee that are more than 3 cm from the SFJ and at least 5 cm in length, and they advise against relying on NSAIDs or LMWH for this indication because, while they may reduce local symptoms or extension, they have not reliably prevented VTE in trials, so I need to be careful not to overstate their role [^112Ma4mC] [^1136Z1j6].

> I will now examine alternatives for patients who cannot use fondaparinux. Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 45 days is a reasonable alternative supported by the SURPRISE-2 randomized study and guideline endorsements, though I should note the trial was not powered for noninferiority and had more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with rivaroxaban, so shared decision-making is important, especially in patients with higher bleeding risk or strong injection aversion [^112Ma4mC] [^1174x9Hp].

> But wait, what if the thrombus is near the SFJ or in nonvaricose veins where the risk is higher. I should double-check the recommendation for proximal SVT. For SVT within 3 cm of the SFJ, guidelines recommend full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 weeks given the equivalence to proximal DVT risk, and this is a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence backing the risk stratification, so I need to ensure I escalate appropriately in this scenario [^1174x9Hp].

> Let me consider special populations, because one size does not fit all. In pregnancy, LMWH is preferred for SVT given safety, with a conditional recommendation and a typical duration around 45 days, acknowledging indirect evidence and the need to individualize based on extension risk and patient preference, whereas in pediatrics, most upper-extremity cannula-related SVT does not require anticoagulation, but lower-extremity or cancer-associated SVT warrants consideration of anticoagulation, again with very low certainty evidence and case-by-case judgment [^1179GsPW] [^117D5UHP] [^116AmsUK] [^112dLSuK].

> I should confirm the role of compression and local measures, because patients often ask about stockings. Compression can help symptoms but does not replace anticoagulation for preventing VTE, and evidence quality for compression alone in SVT is limited; thus, if used, it should be adjunctive to anticoagulation in appropriate patients, and I need to counsel that stockings are not sufficient for extensive SVT or when the SFJ is threatened [^115VS9Ht] [^115dPbsU].

> Next, I should review duration and whether extending beyond 45 days helps. The standard for most extensive SVT not at the SFJ is 45 days based on CALISTO, but observational syntheses suggest that in high-risk patients, extending anticoagulation beyond 45 days may reduce VTE events, though this remains hypothesis-generating and should be individualized rather than routine, so I need to avoid overgeneralizing here [^114CwB3W] [^113BYEHZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For extensive SVT of the great saphenous or proximal tributaries more than 3 cm from the SFJ and at least 5 cm long, fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days is first-line. Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 45 days is an acceptable alternative if injections are not feasible. For SVT within 3 cm of the SFJ, use full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 6 weeks. For short-segment, distal SVT without high-risk features, observation with NSAIDs and close follow-up may be reasonable, but I should arrange duplex surveillance because concomitant DVT is not rare and extension can occur [^112Ma4mC] [^1174x9Hp] [^1136Z1j6].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and secondary prevention. After acute treatment, if duplex shows pathologic reflux in the affected saphenous vein, ablation can be considered once inflammation resolves to reduce recurrence risk, and patients should be counseled on recurrence and modifiable risks. I need to ensure duplex documentation of thrombus extent at baseline and consider repeat imaging if symptoms progress or new symptoms arise [^117Xb5hP] [^1174x9Hp].

> In summary, I need to ensure my bottom line is precise. For most adults with extensive lower-extremity SVT more than 3 cm from the SFJ and at least 5 cm long, the treatment of choice is fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily for 45 days, with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 45 days as an alternative. For SVT within 3 cm of the SFJ, treat with full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 weeks. Tailor decisions in pregnancy, pediatrics, and those with bleeding risk, and use compression only as adjunctive symptom control rather than as VTE prevention [^112Ma4mC] [^1174x9Hp] [^1148jkXy].

The treatment of choice for superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) is **fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily for 45 days** [^1148jkXy] for patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks or tributaries above the knee, > 3 cm from the saphenofemoral junction, and ≥ 5 cm in length [^112Ma4mC]. This regimen reduces symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and recurrence without increasing major bleeding [^112SC69f]. Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 45 days is a **reasonable alternative** [^112Ma4mC] for patients who cannot use injections [^114Kg6Rt]. For SVT within 3 cm of the saphenofemoral junction, use **full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 weeks** [^11297Czh]. NSAIDs and compression are not sufficient for extensive SVT [^1136Z1j6] because they do not prevent VTE [^112SC69f].

---

## Evidence supporting fondaparinux as the treatment of choice

- **CALISTO trial**: A large RCT (n = 3,002) showed fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days reduced symptomatic VTE (0.9% vs 5.9% with placebo), SVT extension, and recurrence, without increasing major bleeding [^1148jkXy] [^112SC69f].

- **Cochrane review**: Confirmed fondaparinux reduces symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and recurrence, with low major bleeding risk [^112SC69f].

- **Guidelines**: Strong recommendation (Grade 1A) from SVS/AVF/AVLS for fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days in appropriate SVT [^112Ma4mC] [^1174x9Hp].

---

## Alternative anticoagulant therapy

Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 45 days is a **reasonable alternative** [^112Ma4mC] for patients who cannot use injections, supported by the SURPRISE-2 study and guideline endorsement [^114Kg6Rt]. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is **not preferred** [^1136Z1j6] because it has not consistently reduced VTE and is less convenient than oral or once-daily options [^112SC69f].

---

## Special considerations

- **SVT near the saphenofemoral junction**: Treat with full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 weeks due to high VTE risk [^11297Czh].

- **Pregnancy**: Use LMWH rather than fondaparinux or rivaroxaban because of safety considerations [^1179GsPW].

- **Short-segment distal SVT**: NSAIDs may be considered, but monitor closely for extension and consider anticoagulation if risk factors are present [^1136Z1j6].

---

## Role of compression therapy and NSAIDs

Compression therapy can relieve symptoms but **does not prevent VTE** [^115VS9Ht]; thus, it should not replace anticoagulation in extensive SVT [^1136Z1j6]. NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation but **do not reliably prevent VTE** [^112SC69f]; they may be used for short-segment distal SVT with close monitoring [^1136Z1j6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Extensive SVT (> 5 cm, > 3 cm from SFJ) | Fondaparinux 2.5 mg SC daily for 45 days |
| Alternative to fondaparinux | Rivaroxaban 10 mg daily for 45 days |
| SVT within 3 cm of SFJ | Full-dose anticoagulation for ≥ 6 weeks |
| Short-segment distal SVT | NSAIDs with close monitoring |
| Pregnancy | LMWH |

---

Fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days is the **preferred treatment** for extensive SVT, with rivaroxaban 10 mg daily as an alternative [^112Ma4mC]; tailor therapy to thrombus location, length, and patient factors, and reserve NSAIDs for select short-segment cases with surveillance [^1136Z1j6].

### Appropriateness of care in superficial venous disease [^113Lxd19]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic superficial venous disease, including superficial venous insufficiency, superficial venous thrombosis, and aneurysms, are prevalent conditions that affect millions of individuals worldwide. With chronic venous insufficiency specifically, the advent of office-based minimally invasive procedures in recent decades has significantly expanded access to outpatient treatment. However, as venous insufficiency is rarely life- or limb-threatening, the clinical diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment indications should be considered carefully when recommending elective intervention. Appropriateness of care guidelines intend to aid providers and patients in the decision-making process, based on the available evidence in the scientific literature, to select the best care for the patient when treating their superficial venous disease.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework — these recommendations have been determined by the method suggested by the GRADE working group. For each guideline, the letter A, B or C marks the quality of current evidence as high, medium or low quality. The grade of recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak (2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs. the expected benefit. The words 'we recommend' are used for GRADE 1 — strong recommendations — if the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words 'we suggest' are used for GRADE 2 — weak recommendations — when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burdens. Where current evidence is weak or lacking, the degree of consensus of the committee reflects the grade with the quality of the recommendation adjusted accordingly.

### Benefit of anticoagulation for the treatment of lower extremity superficial venous thrombosis [^112pSsoR]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the lower extremity is an acute disorder characterized by thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins. This most commonly affects varicose veins but can also occur in patients with nonvaricose veins, who may have an underlying condition such as a malignant disease or thrombophilia. It is important to be aware that SVT confers a significant risk for the development of the more serious and debilitating condition of deep venous thrombosis and the potentially life-threatening condition of pulmonary embolism. Recognition of SVT, determination of appropriateness of therapy, and institution of timely therapy are paramount to prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in properly selected patients. The objective of this evidence-based summary was to provide clinically applicable information from the current literature and guidelines regarding the best treatment options for SVT. There are no randomized trials that compare the efficacy and outcomes of newer therapies, such as the novel oral anticoagulants and endovenous ablation, with traditional therapies, such as traditional anticoagulant and surgery exclusion, in the treatment of SVT.

### Spontaneous acute superficial vein thrombosis of the legs: do we really need to treat? [^112Sd9gX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Spontaneous acute superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) of the leg is now generally recognized as an integral component of venous thromboembolic disease with potentially severe consequences. However, the relatively low grades of some current international recommendations and uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of available therapies may prompt questioning of the real need to treat patients with SVT and explain the persisting heterogeneity of their management in practise. Yet several studies have consistently shown high rates of thromboembolic complications associated with SVT, whether at first presentation or during follow-up. The CALISTO trial established for the first time the clinical benefit of a well-defined anticoagulant regimen for the prevention of serious thromboembolic complications in SVT patients, and we believe that patients such as those included in this trial should receive this regimen as tested. However, several areas of uncertainty remain for categories of SVT patients not evaluated in CALISTO.

### Treatment of lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis [^1148jkXy]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What treatments for lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis are associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), major bleeding, and superficial venous thrombosis extension?

Bottom Line

Fondaparinux (2.5 mg) subcutaneously once daily for 45 days is associated with fewer symptomatic VTEs and lower rates of superficial venous thrombosis extension and recurrence with no increases in major bleeding compared with placebo. Low-molecular-weight heparin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with lower rates of superficial thrombophlebitis extension or recurrence, but data regarding symptomatic VTEs are inconclusive.

### Treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis of the leg [^112SC69f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of superficial thrombophlebitis (ST) of the legs remains poorly defined. While improving or relieving the local painful symptoms, treatment should aim at preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which might complicate the natural history of ST. This is the third update of a review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical, medical, and surgical treatments for ST of the leg in improving local symptoms and decreasing thromboembolic complications.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (March 2017), CENTRAL (2017, Issue 2), and trials registries (March 2017). We handsearched the reference lists of relevant papers and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating topical, medical, and surgical treatments for ST of the legs that included people with a clinical diagnosis of ST of the legs or objective diagnosis of a thrombus in a superficial vein.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the studies. Data were independently extracted from the included studies and any disagreements resolved by consensus. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified three additional trials (613 participants), therefore this update considered 33 studies involving 7296 people with ST of the legs. Treatment included fondaparinux; rivaroxaban; low molecular weight heparin (LMWH); unfractionated heparin (UFH); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); compression stockings; and topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment to surgical interventions such as thrombectomy or ligation. Only a minority of trials compared treatment with placebo rather than an alternative treatment and many studies were small and of poor quality. Pooling of the data was possible for few outcomes, and none were part of a placebo-controlled trial. In one large, placebo-controlled RCT of 3002 participants, subcutaneous fondaparinux was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.50; moderate-quality evidence), ST extension (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.22; moderate-quality evidence), and ST recurrence (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.54; moderate-quality evidence) relative to placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups with very wide CIs around risk estimate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.86; moderate-quality evidence). In one RCT on 472 high-risk participants with ST, fondaparinux was associated with a non-significant reduction of symptomatic VTE compared to rivaroxaban 10 mg (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.18; low-quality evidence). There were no major bleeding events in either group (low-quality evidence). In another placebo-controlled trial, both prophylactic and therapeutic doses of LMWH (prophylactic: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.74; therapeutic: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77) and NSAIDs (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.78) reduced the extension (low-quality evidence) and recurrence of ST (low-quality evidence) in comparison to placebo, with no significant effects on symptomatic VTE (low-quality evidence) or major bleeding (low-quality evidence). Overall, topical treatments improved local symptoms compared with placebo, but no data were provided on the effects on VTE and ST extension. Surgical treatment combined with elastic stockings was associated with a lower VTE rate and ST progression compared with elastic stockings alone. However, the majority of studies that compared different oral treatments, topical treatments, or surgery did not report VTE, ST progression, adverse events, or treatment adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic dose fondaparinux given for 45 days appears to be a valid therapeutic option for ST of the legs for most people. The evidence on topical treatment or surgery is too limited and does not inform clinical practice about the effects of these treatments in terms of VTE. Further research is needed to assess the role of rivaroxaban and other direct oral factor-X or thrombin inhibitors, LMWH, and NSAIDs; the optimal doses and duration of treatment in people at various risk of recurrence; and whether a combination therapy may be more effective than single treatment. Adequately designed and conducted studies are required to clarify the role of topical and surgical treatments.

### Superficial thrombophlebitis: ligation vs. anticoagulation… [^115fPt3N]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis is usually treated conservatively with compression support, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and lower extremity elevation. Above-knee superficial thrombophlebitis can result in pulmonary embolism, either directly or by extension into the deep venous system. Although anticoagulation is the most effective approach to reduce pulmonary embolism in patients with AK-STP and deep venous involvement, the optimal approach to AK-STP without extension is unclear. Operative interventions, including ligation of the saphenofemoral venous junction, and ligation and stripping of the phlebitis vein, are effective in reducing the incidence of pulmonary embolism. Another intervention is the use of anticoagulants as the only treatment. Sullivan and associates reviewed the literature to compare surgical with medical treatment of AK-STP without deep venous involvement.

Six studies were found that matched all of the exclusion and inclusion criteria. The two types of surgical interventions used were ligation of the greater saphenous vein at the saphenofemoral junction and ligation in combination with stripping of phlebitic veins, with or without perforator interruption. The medical intervention consisted of initial intravenous heparin followed by warfarin therapy for six weeks to six months, depending on extension into the deep venous system. Surgical treatment of AK-STP appears to significantly reduce pain as well as superficial thrombus extension more rapidly than conventional medical therapy. Surgery has a fast recovery period and minimal bleeding risk. Medical treatment with anticoagulant therapy more effectively prevents pulmonary embolism, minimizes morbidity, and preserves the greater saphenous vein for future use in bypass procedures.

The authors conclude that, based on the current literature, a conclusion cannot be drawn as to the superiority of surgical versus anticoagulant therapy for AK-STP without deep venous extension. The utility of low-molecular-weight heparin versus intravenous unfractionated heparin remains unclear. So does the appropriate duration of medical anticoagulation therapy; six weeks of anticoagulation appears appropriate followed by additional anticoagulation if concomitant deep venous thrombosis or extension into the deep venous system is noted on follow-up duplex ultrasound scanning.

### How I treat superficial venous thrombosis [^114Eofzb]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombosis of superficial veins has long been regarded as a benign disorder. If patients with a clinical diagnosis of superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) are thoroughly evaluated, the degree and extent of thrombosis in patients with SVT are characteristically underestimated (∼ 75% of the time) and such patients have coexistence (∼ 25% of the time) of, and/or rapid progression (∼ 10% of the time) to, systemic venous thromboembolism (VTE). Pulmonary embolism (PE; ∼ 25% of the time) and death (∼ 1% of the time) occur. Contributory risk factors for SVT are the same for VTE. Treatment of patients' SVT with parenteral anticoagulants appears to be both efficacious and certainly safe. I regard most patients with a clinical diagnosis of SVT the same as those with VTEs. Systemic anticoagulant therapy of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SVT obviates extensive imaging and laboratory workup and may be cost effective while encompassing treatment of any unknown concomitant thromboses with only low risk for hemorrhage. This decision is especially clear in those patients with known hypercoagulability. Patients without clinical risk factors are at lower risk to develop VTE complications and might be those who can be simply observed.

### Controversies in venous thromboembolism: to treat or not to treat superficial vein thrombosis [^114xk1M1]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

The management of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is poorly defined and remains controversial overall. SVT has long been considered a benign, self-limited disease, but recent studies show that SVT carries a nonnegligible risk for recurrence, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Current guidelines recommend the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux, but results of several surveys indicate that the majority of patients with SVT receive nonanticoagulant therapy only, which includes compression stockings or bandages, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical application of heparin gel, or surgical interventions. However, several recent observational and interventional studies provide better insight into the optimal treatment of patients with SVT who are at different risks for thromboembolic complications. This educational review summarizes the available evidence and aims to provide practical guidance based on a clinical decision pathway.

### Ultrasound imaging of superficial venous thrombosis in the upper and lower extremities: closing the gap between clinical management guidelines and ultrasound practice parameters [^1139DS8Y]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the upper and lower extremities has long been considered a relatively benign condition. But in recent years, the literature has suggested a benefit to anticoagulation in patients with certain thrombus characteristics (size, location, and distance to deep venous system) resulting in updates to clinical guidelines for the treatment of lower extremity SVT. Despite these now well-established guidelines, there remains a paucity of guidance from national and international societies regarding the imaging of superficial veins when evaluating for venous thrombosis. We recommend potential strategies to close this gap.

### Superficial vein thrombosis: a current approach to management [^1165WiEG]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was considered to be a benign and self-limiting condition. However, it is now appreciated that a significant proportion of those presenting with SVT will have concomitant deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or are at significant risk of developing deep venous thromboembolism. Potential therapeutic options include topical preparations, compression therapy (stockings, bandages), medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anticoagulants (therapeutic or prophylactic doses) and surgery, ligation or stripping, of superficial veins. The treatment of choice is therapeutic/intermediate dose low molecular weight heparin or prophylactic dose fondaparinux administered for 4–6 weeks. The cost-effectiveness of treatment is a concern and more targeted therapy is required.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: venous thromboembolism in the context of pregnancy [^1179GsPW]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) in pregnancy — recommendation and evidence: For pregnant women with proven acute superficial vein thrombosis, the ASH guideline panel suggests that LMWH be used over not using any anticoagulant (conditional recommendation, low certainty in evidence about effects). Evidence comes primarily from nonpregnant populations; we found 1 systematic review in a general population, identified 2 additional observational studies and 2 randomized trials addressing related outcomes, and altogether 10 randomized trials, all in nonpregnant patients. There were no data from randomized or observational studies examining treatment effects specifically in pregnant patients, and no studies reported neonatal bleeding or congenital malformation risks in pregnant women with superficial vein thrombosis. In nonpregnant patients, 1 large randomized controlled trial examined fondaparinux and others studied LMWH; one described regimen was fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once per day for 45 days for acute, symptomatic superficial limb superficial vein thrombosis at least 5 cm in length.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: venous thromboembolism in the context of pregnancy [^112nAs7E]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

American Society of Hematology guidelines — pregnancy-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) key points: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) complicates ∼1.2 of every 1000 deliveries, and the panel agreed on 31 recommendations spanning treatment of VTE and superficial vein thrombosis, diagnosis of VTE, and thrombosis prophylaxis. The guideline states a strong recommendation for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) over unfractionated heparin for acute VTE. Most recommendations were conditional, including those for either twice-per-day or once-per-day LMWH dosing for the treatment of acute VTE and initial outpatient therapy over hospital admission with low-risk acute VTE, as well as against routine anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring to guide dosing with LMWH for VTE treatment. The panel also made a strong recommendation (low certainty in evidence) for antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with a history of unprovoked or hormonally associated VTE and a conditional recommendation against antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with prior VTE associated with a resolved nonhormonal provoking risk factor.

### Compression therapy after invasive treatment of superficial veins of the lower extremities: clinical practice guidelines of the American Venous Forum, Society for Vascular Surgery, American college of phlebology, Society for Vascular Medicine, and International Union of Phlebology [^113MUeAg]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). High credibility.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) — recommendation categories and implications are defined as follows: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A) states that "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", is supported by "RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies", and implies "Strong recommendation, can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation". Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence (1B) uses "RCTs with important limitations… or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies" and implies "Strong recommendation, can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation". Strong recommendation, low-quality or very low-quality evidence (1C) relies on "Observational studies or case series" and implies "Strong recommendation but may change when higher quality evidence becomes available". Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A) indicates "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burdens", is supported by "RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies", and implies "Weak recommendation, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values". Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B) uses "RCTs with important limitations… or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies" and implies "Weak recommendation, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values". Weak recommendation, low-quality or very low-quality evidence (2C) notes "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits and risk, and burden; risk, benefit, and burdens may be closely balanced", is based on "Observational studies or case series", and implies "Very weak recommendations; other alternatives may be reasonable".

### How to evaluate and choose the proper treatments for patients with lower extremity venous disease [^112ZKxGp]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

With an increasing number of interventional and noninterventional treatment options available for venous disorders, it is important that patients undergo a thorough and systematic evaluation. Clinical evaluation should include a personal and family history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), varicose veins, and thrombophilia as these factors affect response and recurrence of disease. Patient should undergo diagnostic and quality of life assessment using validated tools to monitor response to treatment. Duplex ultrasound, both deep and superficial veins, documenting both obstruction and reflux is initial imaging with CT and MRI indicated to document pelvic, iliac vein, and IVC patency and pathology. Conservative therapy including compression, healthy lifestyle with diet, and exercise. New and novel interventional therapies are available for patients with venous disease with recent randomized controlled trials and multisocietal guidelines providing evidence-based recommendations for patients with superficial and deep venous disease. Since the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies post venous intervention is not well studied nor standardized, patients should routinely undergo evaluation for ongoing risk of recurrent thrombosis and stent occlusion. Finally, patients should be counseled that superficial and deep venous disease is a chronic and often progressive disease, and follow-up at least annually is recommended.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: venous thromboembolism in the context of pregnancy [^1142hCcS]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) complicates ∼1.2 of every 1000 deliveries. Despite these low absolute risks, pregnancy-associated VTE is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and others in decisions about the prevention and management of pregnancy-associated VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 31 recommendations related to the treatment of VTE and superficial vein thrombosis, diagnosis of VTE, and thrombosis prophylaxis.

Conclusions

There was a strong recommendation for low-molecular-weight heparin (LWMH) over unfractionated heparin for acute VTE. Most recommendations were conditional, including those for either twice-per-day or once-per-day LMWH dosing for the treatment of acute VTE and initial outpatient therapy over hospital admission with low-risk acute VTE, as well as against routine anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring to guide dosing with LMWH for VTE treatment. There was a strong recommendation (low certainty in evidence) for antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with a history of unprovoked or hormonally associated VTE and a conditional recommendation against antepartum anticoagulant prophylaxis with prior VTE associated with a resolved nonhormonal provoking risk factor.

### Treatment of superficial vein thrombosis to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: a systematic review [^113z6D3n]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) concerning the efficacy and safety of medical or surgical treatments of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Design and Methods

A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane (CENTRAL) database to identify all randomized trials that evaluated the effect of surgical or medical treatment in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with SVT of the legs.

Results

Five studies were included. Pooling of the data was not possible due to the heterogeneity among the studies. Moreover, three studies had major methodological drawbacks limiting the clinical applicability of the results. One of the remaining (pilot) studies showed a non-significant trend in favor of high- compared to low-dose unfractionated heparin for the prevention of VTE. The last remaining study showed a non-significant trend in favor of short-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) as compared to placebo shortly after treatment with respect to VTE, but the apparent benefit disappeared after three months of follow-up. Active treatment of SVT reduced the incidences of SVT extension or recurrence.

Interpretation and Conclusions

Treatment with a therapeutic or prophylactic dose of LMWH or a NSAID reduces the incidence of SVT extension or recurrence, but not VTE. More RCT are needed before any evidence-based recommendations on the treatment of SVT for the prevention of VTE can be given. With the present lack of solid evidence we would suggest treating patients with at least intermediate doses of LMWH.

### Management of superficial vein thrombosis [^1138P3zp]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is less well studied than deep vein thrombosis (DVT), because it has been considered to be a minor, self-limiting disease that is easily diagnosed on clinical grounds and that requires only symptomatic relief. The most frequently involved sites of the superficial vein system are the lower limbs, especially the saphenous veins, mostly in relation to varicosities. Lower-limb SVT shares the same risk factors as DVT; it can propagate into the deep veins, and have a complicated course with pulmonary embolism. Clinical diagnosis may not be accurate, and ultrasonography is currently indicated for both confirmation and evaluation of SVT extension. Treatment aims are symptom relief and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in relation to the thrombotic burden. SVT of the long saphenous vein within 3 cm of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is considered to be equivalent to a DVT, and thus deserving of therapeutic anticoagulation. Less severe forms of lower-limb SVT not involving the SFJ have been included in randomized clinical trials of surgery, compression hosiery, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, unfractionated heparin, and low molecular weight heparins, with inconclusive results. The largest randomized clinical trial available, on 3004 patients with lower-limb SVT not involving the SFJ, showed that fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily for 6 weeks is more effective than placebo in reducing the risk of the composite of death from any cause and symptomatic VTE (0.9% versus 5.9%). Further studies are needed to define the optimal management strategies for SVT of the lower limbs and other sites, such as the upper limbs.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The primary objective of this systematic review was to estimate the rate of VTE development during mid-term follow-up in patients with lower limb SVT without DVT and PE who received any systemic anticoagulation according to the treatment duration. Following the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) rule, the main question was: "How does the duration of anticoagulation therapy impact the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with superficial vein thrombosis of lower limbs within mid-term follow-up?" The systematic review protocol, including all planned analyses, was registered a priori through PROSPERO, an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care (CRD42021271486).

Search strategy

An electronic Medline and Cochrane Library search was done on September 1, 2023. It was performed according to the pre-specified strategy and keywords. Search terms for PubMed: ((("thrombophlebitis"[MeSH Terms]) OR (superficial vein thrombosis)) OR (superficial thrombophlebitis)) AND ("anticoagulants"[MeSH Terms]); search terms for Cochrane Library: ("superficial venous thrombosis"):ti, ab, kw OR ("thrombophlebitis"):ti, ab, kw AND ("anticoagulant therapy"):ti, ab, kw OR ("anticoagulation"):ti, ab, kw OR ("anticoagulant"):ti, ab, kw). Additionally, lists of references of the relevant publications and personal archives of the authors were screened for any complementary information. The search was restricted by language (English) but not publication date. No additional search was done for unpublished or preprint data, conference abstracts, and other papers not indexed.

Central venous access device (CVAD)-related superficial vein thrombosis in pediatric patients — anticoagulation choice: The ASH guideline panel suggests using either anticoagulation or no anticoagulation in pediatric patients with CVAD-related superficial vein thrombosis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), with very little direct or indirect data. Panel remarks indicated that, in most patients, no anticoagulation will be appropriate; however, anticoagulation seems appropriate for patients who have a CVAD line that is still functioning and who continue to need venous access, as well as in those whose symptoms progress. Evidence summaries note no pediatric studies, no pediatric data to assess major outcomes or adverse events with significant imprecision in indirect data, a panel survey suggesting no difference in major outcomes with treatment compared with no treatment, and that there was no major bleeding if no anticoagulation was given. The panel judged that no anticoagulation was appropriate but specified exceptions for patients with progressive symptoms, particularly difficult vascular access, or strong preferences, and concluded there is very low certainty in evidence for a net health benefit or harm so individual patient factors will alter the decision.

### Acute venous disease: venous thrombosis and venous trauma [^114BHbK6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Acute venous disorders include deep venous thrombosis, superficial venous thrombophlebitis, and venous trauma. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) most often arises from the convergence of multiple genetic and acquired risk factors, with a variable estimated incidence of 56 to 160 cases per 100,000 population per year. Acute thrombosis is followed by an inflammatory response in the thrombus and vein wall leading to thrombus amplification, organization, and recanalization. Clinically, there is an exponential decrease in thrombus load over the first 6 months, with most recanalization occurring over the first 6 weeks after thrombosis. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) are the most important acute and chronic complications of DVT. Despite the effectiveness of thromboembolism prophylaxis, appropriate measures are utilized in as few as one-third of at-risk patients. Once established, the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been defined by randomized clinical trials, with appropriate anticoagulation constituting the mainstay of management. Despite its effectiveness in preventing recurrent VTE, anticoagulation alone imperfectly protects against PTS. Although randomized trials are currently lacking, at least some data suggests that catheter-directed thrombolysis or combined pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy can reduce post-thrombotic symptoms and improve quality of life after acute ileofemoral DVT. Inferior vena caval filters continue to have a role among patients with contra-indications to, complications of, or failure of anticoagulation. However, an expanded role for retrievable filters for relative indications has yet to be clearly established. The incidence of superficial venous thrombophlebitis is likely under-reported, but it occurs in approximately 125,000 patients per year in the United States. Although the appropriate treatment remains controversial, recent investigations suggest that anticoagulation may be more effective than ligation in preventing DVT and PE. Venous injuries are similarly under-reported and the true incidence is unknown. Current recommendations include repair of injuries to the major proximal veins. If repair not safe or possible, ligation should be performed.

Treatment of acute VTE and superficial venous thrombosis

For pregnant women with proven acute superficial vein thrombosis of the lower extremity, should we use anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)?

Recommendation 11

For pregnant women with proven acute superficial venous thrombosis of the lower extremity, the ASH Latin American panel suggests anticoagulation with LMWH over no anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁○○).

Remarks:

- Women with risk factors for progression to DVT (like extensive thrombosis or localized close to the saphenofemoral junction) may obtain a greater benefit from anticoagulation than women without these risk factors.
- There is no consensus regarding the optimal duration for the treatment of superficial thrombosis in pregnant women. A frequent approach is to use anticoagulants for 45 days.

Summary of the evidence

No additional evidence on the intervention's efficacy or safety was identified. Regional data about epidemiology, resource use, and impact on health equity were added to the EtD framework.

Justification

This recommendation did not change its direction or strength. The panel considered that the recommendation was feasible to implement in the region, given the general availability of LMWH.

Conclusion

Superficial venous thrombosis is a relatively infrequent complication of pregnancy in Latin America, although it is associated with significant discomfort. The main concern with superficial venous thrombosis relates to its eventual progression to DVT, which is associated with significant morbidity.

Because pregnant women are at an increased risk of VTE given the effects of hormones, their risk of progression is likely higher than that of nonpregnant women, especially if other risk factors are present or the thrombosis extends close to the saphenofemoral junction.

For pregnant women with acute VTE, should we use once-daily or twice-daily LMWH?

Recommendation 12

For pregnant women with acute VTE, the ASH Latin American panel suggests either once-daily or twice-daily LMWH according to clinical circumstances and patients' values and preferences (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁⨁○○).

Remark:

- Theoretically, once-a-day LMWH might lead to a greater peak concentration and a lower trough level. The impact of these pharmacokinetics on patients' important outcomes is uncertain. Women who place a higher value on avoiding injections may prefer LMWH once daily. In contrast, women who place a higher value on the potential complications inferred from LMWH pharmacokinetics may prefer LMWH twice a day.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Superficial venous thrombophlebitis (SVT) rationale and evidence — Studies show that SVT may progress to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 6% to 44% of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE); and 2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE, and superficial venous thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the greatest association with VTE. Although the majority of SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins confers greater morbidity. These recommendations are supported by two recent systematic reviews; the 2018 Cochrane review included 35 studies involving 7296 patients with SVT of the legs, and most studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^1126xgss]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Values statement — The committee recognized the poor quality of evidence supporting several of the recommendations, particularly arising from the common use of surrogate end points and the sparse data demonstrating the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies on patient-important outcomes. The committee placed a relatively high value on preventing DVT and the postthrombotic syndrome, and in recommending the thrombolytic techniques over surgical thrombectomy, we placed a relatively high value on avoiding the potential complications of an infrequently performed surgical procedure. In recommending treatments for lesions uncovered by thrombus removal, we highly valued the avoidance of complications related to untreated iliac stenosis, and in recommending compression stockings, we considered this intervention to be relatively inexpensive, to not require expertise, and able to be applied on a large scale. Indirect evidence was occasionally used due to lack of more direct evidence. The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum should be interpreted as a guide to be applied in the context of clinical judgment rather than as a rigid mandate, and clinical judgment is of the utmost importance in such situations.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Different approaches have been suggested to treat lower limb SVT. Topical agents, NSAIDs, anticoagulants, heparinoids, elastic compression, and surgical intervention aim to reduce the symptoms of inflammation and prevent further VTE due to SVT extension into deep veins and to prevent the occurrence of new DVT and PE. Systemic anticoagulation appeared to be the most protective for VTE in thrombosis length of > 5 cm. In the case of smaller thrombus, local cold, topical agents, NSAIDs, and elastic compression are indicated without systemic anticoagulation. VTE threat increases if thrombus length is more than 5 cm, predominantly if it is localized above the knee or near the connection with deep veins. Studies on systemic anticoagulation included primarily patients with extensive SVT not reaching the junction. However, those with thrombus located within a 3 to 5 cm near junction were generally excluded, so the best treatment approach for them is not established (Supplementary Table I, online only). The current guidelines empirically equate such SVT with proximal DVT and suggest full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation for 6 to 12 weeks. However, a recent analysis of the RIETE registry by Prandoni et al did not find any differences between full therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation that was administrated predominantly for 12 weeks in patients with SVT within 3 cm near a junction (the study was considered ineligible due to the absence of separate outcomes for different treatment durations).

Thereby, systemic anticoagulation, as evaluated in the current systematic review, corresponds to extensive SVT with a length of > 5 cm, not reaching the junction by 3 to 5 cm (Supplementary Table I, online only). The previous meta-analyses focused on the type and doses of anticoagulation but not on duration. The authors did not find any significant differences between low (prophylactic) and high (intermediate or therapeutic) doses of LMWH while judging subcutaneous fondaparinux at 2.5 mg for 45 days as the best treatment associated with the lowest rate of VTE. This conclusion was based on the results of the largest randomized controlled trial CALISTO and insights from a few cohort trials. However, the comparison of fondaparinux with LMWH or other anticoagulants does not consider treatment duration. In most trials, LMWH was used for a short period of ≤ 14 or 15 to 30 days.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

Evidence

These recommendations are supported by two recent systematic reviews, (Table XXIV). The 2018 Cochrane review included 33 studies involving 7296 patients with SVT of the legs. Treatments evaluated included fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, LMWH, unfractionated heparin, NSAIDS, compression stockings, and topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment as well as surgical thrombectomy or ligation. A minority of studies compared treatment to placebo and most studies were small and of poor quality. Further, most studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups. A second systematic review and meta-analysis included seventeen studies and 6862 patients with SVT and confirmed that fondaparinux achieved the lowest rate of progression to DVT and PE without conclusions about other treatment due to low quality evidence. In the Surprise study, patients with SVT and one or more risk factors for VTE were randomized to 45 days of fondaparinux or rivaroxaban 10 mg. The results suggested that rivaroxaban was as effective as fondaparinux, however, the study was not powered to prove noninferiority. A call for further studies was prompted by the nonsignificant increase in the primary composite outcome as well as by an increase in clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the rivaroxaban group. These recommendations are similar to those, published recently on management of SVT in the CHEST guidelines.

Table XXIV
Treatment of superficial venous thrombosis

Low-quality evidence in one study found that prophylactic LMWH reduced extension of SVT (statistically significant), but did not reduce incidence of VTE, while therapeutic LMWH evaluated in one study reduced both SVT extension (statistically significant) and progression to VTE, but improvement was less significant at 3 month follow-up due to a catch-up phenomenon.NSAIDS were also found in one study to reduce SVT extension (statistically significant). However, there were no differences in the resolution of local symptoms and signs of SVT and in the incidence of VTE. While there were no major bleeding episodes recorded in either the NSAID or placebo groups, indomethacin increased the rate of adverse effects.NSAIDs have also been found to increase the risk of gastric pain three-fold compared with placebo.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^111itd32]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of lower limbs, also known as superficial thrombophlebitis, has been considered a self-limited benign disorder for a long time, with an incidence rate of 0.6 to 1.3 SVT events per 1000 patient-years. However, emerging evidence suggests a high prevalence of concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 18% and 7% of all patients with SVT, respectively. The cohort studies with a mid-term follow-up of 3 months showed an occurrence of further venous thromboembolism (VTE), including SVT progression or recurrence, new DVT, and/or PE in 3% to 10% of all patients. In the long-term follow-up, a history of SVT has shown an association with a VTE risk increase of 5.4 to 8.6 times, and the risk of VTE recurrence after SVT is similar to proximal DVT. All such findings suggest SVT should be combined with DVT and PE into the group of VTE and be treated with anticoagulation, as stated in the recent guidelines. The previous meta-analysis included different SVT treatment approaches (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], unfractionated heparin [UFH], low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, warfarin, surgery, and no therapy) and showed that anticoagulation is associated with minimal events rate of further VTE. However, no standard anticoagulation type, dose, and duration were described. Although emerging evidence suggests a further increase of VTE rate by 50% to 70% after 45 days of anticoagulation in high-risk patients, a knowledge gap has been found on the association of prolonged anticoagulation with VTE risk in individuals with SVT. This study aims to address this gap.

Regarding specific circumstances for venous thromboembolism in children, more specifically with respect to patients with superficial vein thrombosis, ASH/ISTH 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating anticoagulation in pediatric patients with superficial vein thrombosis in the upper limb not related to cannulation, or in the lower limbs associated with cancer or varicose veins.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^114CwB3W]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Individual VTE risk factors may play a pivotal role in the development of new thrombosis after cessation of anticoagulation and may be used for treatment adjustment. Unfortunately, not all studies correctly reported the most common risk factors, which may lead to inadequate treatment and an increase in new thrombotic events. Male sex, cancer, personal history of DVT, PE, and/or SVT, and thrombosis of non-varicose veins were identified as the most common risk factors that could be considered for individual treatment adjustment. Thus, treatment for more than 45 days may be beneficial in selected patients at high risk of VTE. However, such suggestions must be tested in randomized controlled trials to estimate the risk/benefit ratio.

Our review has limitations. The primary outcome was designed as any new VTE, combined SVT progression or recurrence, DVT, and PE. It was chosen due to strong evidence of SVT association with the development of clinically significant DVT and PE, and its progression or recurrence may indicate treatment failure. However, not all analyzed papers reported individual outcomes, and VTE could be defined as DVT and PE only according to the design of original trials. This fact introduced additional heterogeneity in the primary outcome analysis. The data from RCTs and cohort trials of varying quality and consistency were combined, and the statistical analysis of the difference between groups was unavailable. The reported pooled proportions are based on study-level data rather than individual patient data. Most studies did not present the follow-up as patient-years, so patient-months and patient-years were calculated based on the intended or median follow-up rather than on actual individual observation periods. The proportions estimated for relatively short observation periods may be valid for the assumption of an event rate that is consistent over time. Events that occurred within the follow-up period included both on- and off-anticoagulation. Mortality rates were not analyzed due to a low number of events in the previous reviews. Information on the further treatment after cessation of anticoagulation, particularly the surgical removal of varicose veins that may affect the risk of SVT recurrence and DVT or PE occurrence, was not available for analysis. Finally, most calculations were associated with high heterogeneity.

The systematic review and meta-analysis results suggest prolonged systemic anticoagulation is associated with decreased VTE rates in patients with lower limb SVT. The optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment needs to be established in future trials.

Regarding specific circumstances for varicose veins, more specifically with respect to patients with superficial vein thrombosis, AVF/AVLS/SVS 2024 guidelines recommend to administer fondaparinux 2.5 mg SC daily for 45 days in patients with superficial vein thrombosis of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee > 3 cm from the saphenofemoral junction and > 5 cm in length, whether associated with varicose veins or not. Consider administering rivaroxaban 10 mg/day for 45 days as an alternative in patients unwilling or unable to administer subcutaneous injections.

### Endovenous laser ablation in acute thrombophlebitis of the varicose great saphenous vein… [^111BGX6k]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Superficial venous thrombosis is a common complication in patients with varicose veins of low extremities. The most dangerous consequence of such thrombosis is its propagation to deep veins and subsequent pulmonary embolism. Recommended mode of treatment for superficial vein thrombosis is a prolonged usage of anticoagulants. However, it may be not suitable for some patients, for example with a high risk of bleeding. Another possible mode of treatment is endovenous laser ablation of the saphenous vein very close to the saphenofemoral junction. This a minimally invasive procedure that may be performed ambulatory is able to decrease the risk of deep veins thrombosis and possibly allow to shorten or even eliminate the necessity of anticoagulant use. Such a suggestion was not appropriately studied in randomized clinical trials.

The aim of this prospective single-centre randomized open-label study is to compare three modes of treatment for thrombosis of varicose great saphena vein
- standard medical with fondaparinux sodium, endovenous laser ablation close to the saphenofemoral junction with shortening the course of anticoagulation and endovenous laser ablation close to the saphenofemoral junction without the use of anticoagulants. Procedure: Endovenous laser ablation Drug: Fondaparinux Sodium
- 05–06/21.
- Thrombosis of small saphenous vein
- Superficial vein thrombosis associated with sclerotherapy
- History of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism
- Superficial vein thrombosis within 3 months before inclusion
- Anemia.
- Using anticoagulants for treating the current episode of venous thrombosis
- Using anticoagulants for other medical conditions
- Double antiplatelet therapy
- Regular use of NSAIDs
- High risk of bleeding according to an investigator.
- Active clinically relevant bleeding
- Clinically relevant bleeding within last 30 days before inclusion
- Major surgery of severe head trauma within last 30 days before inclusion

### The care of patients with varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^111BsEDV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Venous Forum (AVF) have developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with varicose veins of the lower limbs and pelvis. The document also includes recommendations on the management of superficial and perforating vein incompetence in patients with associated, more advanced chronic venous diseases (CVDs), including edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers. Recommendations of the Venous Guideline Committee are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system as strong (GRADE 1) if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, burden, and costs. The suggestions are weak (GRADE 2) if the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burden. The level of available evidence to support the evaluation or treatment can be of high (A), medium (B), or low or very low (C) quality. The key recommendations of these guidelines are: We recommend that in patients with varicose veins or more severe CVD, a complete history and detailed physical examination are complemented by duplex ultrasound scanning of the deep and superficial veins (GRADE 1A). We recommend that the CEAP classification is used for patients with CVD (GRADE 1A) and that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is used to assess treatment outcome (GRADE 1B). We suggest compression therapy for patients with symptomatic varicose veins (GRADE 2C) but recommend against compression therapy as the primary treatment if the patient is a candidate for saphenous vein ablation (GRADE 1B). We recommend compression therapy as the primary treatment to aid healing of venous ulceration (GRADE 1B). To decrease the recurrence of venous ulcers, we recommend ablation of the incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression therapy (GRADE 1A). For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein (GSV), we recommend endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) rather than high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the level of the knee (GRADE 1B). We recommend phlebectomy or sclerotherapy to treat varicose tributaries (GRADE 1B) and suggest foam sclerotherapy as an option for the treatment of the incompetent saphenous vein (GRADE 2C). We recommend against selective treatment of perforating vein incompetence in patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C(2); GRADE 1B), but we suggest treatment of pathologic perforating veins (outward flow duration ≥ 500 ms, vein diameter ≥ 3.5 mm) located underneath healed or active ulcers (CEAP class C(5)-C(6); GRADE 2B). We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or together (GRADE 2B).

Rationale

Despite recognition that superficial thrombophlebitis, also known as SVT, is more common than DVT, there is less awareness of its associated morbidity and little consensus on its management. While traditionally thought of as benign, recent studies have highlighted its association with DVT and PE if left untreated. Studies show that SVT may progress to DVT in 6% to 44% of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic PE; and 2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE. Superficial venous thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the greatest association with VTE. Although the majority of SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins confers greater morbidity and few studies have stratified treatment based on this distinction. Several therapies including surgery, compression stockings, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aim to reduce pain and inflammation, however, given the associated progression to VTE, anticoagulation is recommended. Of note, the application of warm compresses to the site of SVT has never been evaluated in any study.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) of the main saphenous trunks — treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is characterized as follows: NSAIDS reduce SVT pain and extension, anticipated undesirable effects are a low risk of increased bleeding and gastrointestinal intolerance with NSAIDs with a risk of VTE, the desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects especially for distal DVT, and the overall certainty is moderate certainty.

### Treatment of superficial venous disease of the lower leg [^111uSB1d]. AVLS (2013). Medium credibility.

Summary of guidelines for treatment of venous disease — compression therapy: We recommend against compression therapy as a prerequisite therapy for symptomatic venous reflux disease when other definitive treatments such as endovenous ablation are appropriate, and after interventional treatment, we recommend the use of a compression garment in the postoperative period; there is extra benefit to the patient in the form of reduced pain after use of compression, and the compression dosage and duration is at the discretion and clinical judgment of the treating physician. Compression therapy is an effective method for the management of symptoms related to superficial disease but it does not correct the source of reflux, and when patients have a correctable source of reflux definitive treatment should also be offered unless it is contraindicated or unwanted. Superficial venous insufficiency is a chronic disease and we recommend that patients with this disease be counseled to wear a compression garment even after definite treatment has been provided, and we suggest the treatment of some CEAP C2 patients with isolated varices by medical compression hose alone, with a short 1–2 week trial of compression hose appropriate where an alternative etiology of symptoms is considered.

### Appropriateness of care: deep venous procedures [^114pNNvA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In the past decade, technologies to treat venous pathologies have increased dramatically, to the benefit of an often underserved and overlooked population of patients with venous disease. However, given the rapid release of various technologies, including venous-dedicated stents and thrombectomy devices across varied venous pathologies, evidence-based guidelines have been slow to develop. When discussing appropriateness of care, one needs to consider optimal patient selection, technical approach, medical management, and surveillance protocols, to name a few. All of which, in the venous space, are currently widely varied in practice. The future of deep venous work is limitless, but multicenter, randomized controlled trials are needed to optimally treat patients with venous disease.

Moreover, the results imply a potential protective effect against VTE events when applied after 3 months from the index SVT event. Our finding is in line with the German DVT guidelines, where interventions are recommended not earlier than 3 months after SVT symptoms have decreased.

These outcomes align with previous studies, including a Cochrane systematic review by Di Nisio et al, which concluded that anticoagulation alone typically suffices for SVT treatment, and the evidence for surgical interventions is not compelling. The ESVS 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of Venous Thrombosis also advocate for anticoagulation as the primary approach for SVT treatment, specifically recommending surgical or endovascular interventions only after the inflammatory and prothrombotic phase has concluded, which is typically no sooner than 3 months after SVT onset.³ This guideline reflects a common clinical practice, although it is not primarily based on robust evidence.

However, it is important to note that these guidelines acknowledge certain circumstances in which surgical interventions may be warranted, such as when the thrombus extends into the deep venous system, when complications like ulceration or bleeding arise, or when anticoagulation is not possible. Additionally, the 2023 guideline on the Diagnosis and Therapy of Deep Vein Thrombosis by the German Society of Angiology emphasizes the potential advantages of surgical interventions in specific situations, such as reducing the risk of recurrent thrombosis and alleviating symptoms. These guidelines collectively underscore the importance of a tailored and nuanced approach to SVT management, considering both individual patient characteristics and the clinical context.

The strengths and limitations of the study are duly acknowledged and provide valuable context for the interpretation of the results: Strengths include the availability of a large cohort from clinical practice with relatively long follow-up, documentation of patients in experienced clinical centers, consecutive enrollment of eligible patients, and the very broad inclusion criteria. Thus, this prospective real-life registry provides a major advantage in that it reflects the full spectrum of everyday practice and current treatment pathways, which would not be possible in a randomized controlled trial.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^111qqZP2]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11b

For neonates with nonocclusive PVT, and for children who have already developed portal hypertension (PHTN) secondary to PVT, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests no anticoagulation rather than using anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯).

Remarks: For recommendations 11a and 11b: neonates and pediatric patients who did not receive anticoagulation warrant follow-up monitoring, because extension of thrombus or organ dysfunction may require reconsideration of treatment options. Evidence from the available observational studies describes (complete or partial) PVT resolution in patients who did receive anticoagulation, as well as those who did not receive anticoagulation, and therefore, does not allow for assessment of the degree of benefit from anticoagulation. However, the panel placed value on avoiding the potential increased risk of long-term complications associated with persistent occlusive thrombus, and therefore, favored treatment in this setting. The panel also recognized the potential increased risk of bleeding in pediatric patients with PHTN and development of esophageal varices, and therefore, did not recommend anticoagulation in that setting.

Recommendation 12a

For pediatric patients with superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) secondary to IV cannulation in the upper limb, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests no anticoagulation rather than using anticoagulation. (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Recommendation 12b

For pediatric patients with SVT in the upper limb, which is not cannula related, or in the lower limbs associated with cancer or varicose veins, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests anticoagulation rather than no anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: There were no direct and only limited indirect data upon which to base this recommendation. The panel members experience suggested that, in most instances (eg, peripheral IV [PIV]– or CVAD-related events in the upper extremity), no anticoagulation may be required. However, anticoagulation could be considered in select patients with symptomatic SVT (eg, non–PIV-/PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter)-related, cancer, varicose vein, and lower limb events) or scenarios (eg, PIV/long-term PICC and/or symptom progression). The panel notes that when anticoagulation is prescribed, there is uncertainty about the optimal intensity (eg, prophylactic vs full dose) and duration of therapy.

### Standard-versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients [^1148Jfis]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes two interrelated conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Risk factors include dehydration, prolonged immobilization, acute medical illness, trauma, clotting disorders, previous thrombosis, varicose veins with superficial vein thrombosis, exogenous hormones, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection, inflammation, pregnancy, obesity, smoking, and advancing age. It is estimated that hospitalized patients are 100 times more likely to develop VTE and, compared with surgical patients, medical patients often have more severe forms of VTE. VTE carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic strategies, including mechanical and pharmacological methods, are recommended for patients at risk of VTE. Pharmacological prophylaxis is considered the standard practice for acutely ill medical patients at risk of developing VTE in the absence of contraindications. For hospitalized patients, the risk of VTE extends beyond hospital stay and up to 90 days, with most events occurring within 45 days of discharge. Despite that, it remains unclear whether extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis would provide benefits without added risks or harm.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of standard- versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 27 March 2023. We also searched reference lists of all included studies for additional references and searched the last five years of the American Society of Hematology conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing standard-duration versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients (adults being treated in a medical inpatient setting).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures set by Cochrane. At least two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion and performed data extraction. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We analyzed outcomes data using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (during the treatment period and within 45 days of hospitalization) and long term (assessed beyond 45 days of hospitalization). Primary outcomes were symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were total VTE, a composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (including myocardial infarction, non-fatal PE, cardiopulmonary death, stroke), fatal bleeding, and VTE-related mortality.

Main Results

A total of seven RCTs fulfilled our inclusion criteria, comprising 40,846 participants. All studies contributing data to our outcomes were at low risk of bias in all domains. Most studies reported the outcomes in the short term. Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration anticoagulation, for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of short-term symptomatic VTE (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78; standard-duration 12 per 1000, extended-duration 7 per 1000, 95% CI 6 to 10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 204, 95% CI 136 to 409; 4 studies, 24,773 participants; high-certainty evidence). This benefit, however, was offset by an increased risk of short-term major bleeding (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.79; standard-duration 3 per 1000, extended duration 6 per 1000, 95% CI 5 to 8; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome [NNTH] 314, 95% CI 538 to 222; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration, results in little to no difference in short-term all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08; standard-duration 34 per 1000, extended-duration 33 per 1000, 95% CI 30 to 37; 5 studies, 38,080 participants; high-certainty evidence), reduced short-term total VTE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85; standard-duration 37 per 1000, extended duration 28 per 1000, 95% CI 25 to 32; NNTB 107, 95% CI 76 to 178; 5 studies, 33,819 participants; high-certainty evidence), and short-term composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91; standard-duration 41 per 1000, extended-duration 29 per 1000, 95% CI 23 to 37; NNTB 85, 95% CI 50 to 288; 1 study, 7513 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation may result in little to no difference in short-term fatal bleeding (RR 2.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 6.22; standard-duration 0 per 1000, extended-duration 0 per 1000, 95% CI 0 to 1; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; low-certainty evidence), and likely results in little to no difference in short-term VTE-related mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.05; standard-duration 5 per 1000, extended-duration 4 per 1000 95% CI 3 to 6; 6 studies, 36,170 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In the short term, extended- versus standard-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of symptomatic VTE at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Extended-duration anticoagulation resulted in little to no difference in all-cause mortality. Extended-duration anticoagulation reduced the risk of total VTE and the composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events, but may show little to no difference in fatal bleeding and VTE-related mortality. Further data, with longer follow-up, are needed to determine the optimal agent and duration for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

### Updated American College of Chest Physicians guideline… [^1167MBZy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the latest recommendations for anti-thrombotic therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism. Bottom Line The guideline covers a lot of ground. Key updates include a clear preference for direct oral anti-coagulants, including in patients with cancer, and low-dose apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended-phase anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked VTE. There is greater leeway for observation only of selected patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism or isolated distal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and outpatient treatment of selected patients with PE. Synopsis The latest update to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline regarding antithrombotic therapy for VTE adds four new recommendations and updates eight others.

The authors identified an initiation phase when anticoagulants are first given, a treatment phase of three months, and an extended phase for selected patients beyond three months. For patients with acute isolated distal DVT, the guidelines recommend two weeks of serial imaging, with anticoagulation only if the DVT extends or the patient has severe symptoms or risk factors for extension. A direct oral anticoagulant is recommended as first-line therapy. An exception should be made for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, for whom warfarin is recommended during the treatment phase. For patients with cancer, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are recommended over low-molecular-weight heparin for treatment of VTE. The authors make a weak recommendation for 45 days of fondaparinux, 2. 5 mg daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg daily, for patients with superficial venous thrombosis of the lower leg.

Extended-phase low-dose anticoagulation with apixaban, 2. 5 mg twice daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, is recommended for all patients with unprovoked VTE. This has only been studied for two to four years, so extending anticoagulation beyond that is of uncertain benefit. Aspirin is recommended when patients discontinue extended-phase anticoagulation.

### Initial management and outcomes after superficial thrombophlebitis: the cardiovascular research network venous thromboembolism study [^115uwqba]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although superficial thrombophlebitis (SVTE) is generally considered a benign, self-limited disease, accumulating evidence suggests that it often leads to more serious forms of venous thromboembolism. We reviewed the medical charts of 329 subjects with SVTE from the Cardiovascular Research Network Venous Thromboembolism cohort study to collect information on the acute treatment of SVTE and subsequent diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis within 1 year. All participants received care within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large, integrated healthcare delivery system. Fourteen (4.3%) subjects with SVTE received anticoagulants, 148 (45.0%) were recommended antiplatelet agents or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and in 167 (50.8%) there was no documented antithrombotic therapy. In the year after SVTE diagnosis, 19 (5.8%) patients had a subsequent diagnosis of a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. In conclusion, clinically significant venous thrombosis within a year after SVTE was uncommon in our study despite infrequent use of antithrombotic therapy.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) medical therapy cautions — For SVT of the main saphenous trunks, we recommend against using prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although both have been found to reduce SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE). If NSAIDs are used for short segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.

### Thrombolytic strategies versus standard anticoagulation for acute deep vein thrombosis of the lower limb [^117Wfe2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) aims to reduce immediate complications. Use of thrombolytic clot removal strategies (i.e. thrombolysis (clot dissolving drugs), with or without additional endovascular techniques), could reduce the long-term complications of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) including pain, swelling, skin discolouration, or venous ulceration in the affected leg. This is the fourth update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To assess the effects of thrombolytic clot removal strategies and anticoagulation compared to anticoagulation alone for the management of people with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 21 April 2020. We also checked the references of relevant articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining thrombolysis (with or without adjunctive clot removal strategies) and anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone for acute DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, unless we identified heterogeneity, in which case we used a random-effects model. The primary outcomes of interest were clot lysis, bleeding and post thrombotic syndrome.

Main Results

Two new studies were added for this update. Therefore, the review now includes a total of 19 RCTs, with 1943 participants. These studies differed with respect to the thrombolytic agent, the doses of the agent and the techniques used to deliver the agent. Systemic, loco-regional and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) strategies were all included. For this update, CDT interventions also included those involving pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Three of the 19 included studies reported one or more domain at high risk of bias. We combined the results as any (all) thrombolysis interventions compared to standard anticoagulation. Complete clot lysis occurred more frequently in the thrombolysis group at early follow-up (RR 4.75; 95% CI 1.83 to 12.33; 592 participants; eight studies) and at intermediate follow-up (RR 2.42; 95% CI 1.42 to 4.12; 654 participants; seven studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Two studies reported on clot lysis at late follow-up with no clear benefit from thrombolysis seen at this time point (RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 62.63; two studies). No differences between strategies (e.g. systemic, loco-regional and CDT) were detected by subgroup analysis at any of these time points (tests for subgroup differences: P = 0.41, P = 0.37 and P = 0.06 respectively). Those receiving thrombolysis had increased bleeding complications (6.7% versus 2.2%) (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.78; 1943 participants, 19 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). No differences between strategies were detected by subgroup analysis (P = 0.25). Up to five years after treatment, slightly fewer cases of PTS occurred in those receiving thrombolysis; 50% compared with 53% in the standard anticoagulation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93; 1393 participants, six studies; moderate-certainty evidence). This was still observed at late follow-up (beyond five years) in two studies (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.73; 211 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We used subgroup analysis to investigate if the level of DVT (iliofemoral, femoropopliteal or non-specified) had an effect on the incidence of PTS. No benefit of thrombolysis was seen for either iliofemoral or femoropopliteal DVT (six studies; test for subgroup differences: P = 0.29). Systemic thrombolysis and CDT had similar levels of effectiveness. Studies of CDT included four trials in femoral and iliofemoral DVT, and results from these are consistent with those from trials of systemic thrombolysis in DVT at other levels of occlusion.

Authors' Conclusions

Complete clot lysis occurred more frequently after thrombolysis (with or without additional clot removal strategies) and PTS incidence was slightly reduced. Bleeding complications also increased with thrombolysis, but this risk has decreased over time with the use of stricter exclusion criteria of studies. Evidence suggests that systemic administration of thrombolytics and CDT have similar effectiveness. Using GRADE, we judged the evidence to be of moderate-certainty, due to many trials having small numbers of participants or events, or both. Future studies are needed to investigate treatment regimes in terms of agent, dose and adjunctive clot removal methods; prioritising patient-important outcomes, including PTS and quality of life, to aid clinical decision making.

### Treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis [^1143bX3g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The treatment of distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not clearly established. Distal DVT can either be treated with anticoagulation, or monitored with close follow-up to detect progression to the proximal veins (above the knee), which requires anticoagulation. Proponents of this monitoring strategy base their decision to withhold anticoagulation on the fact that progression is rare and most people can be spared from potential bleeding and other adverse effects of anticoagulation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatment interventions for people with distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 February 2019. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of distal DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), DVT and major bleeding and follow up ranged from three months to two years. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs reporting on 1239 participants. Five trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months versus no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods. Anticoagulant compared to no intervention or placebo for distal DVT treatment Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reduced the risk of recurrent VTE during follow-up compared with participants receiving no anticoagulation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.77; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 3%; high-certainty evidence), and reduced the risk of recurrence of DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.67; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect on risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.59; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in major bleeding with anticoagulation compared to placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.62; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 26%; low-certainty evidence). There was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in the group treated with anticoagulants (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.07 to 10.46; 2 studies, 322 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was one death, not related to PE or major bleeding, in the anticoagulation group. Anticoagulation for three months or more compared to anticoagulation for six weeks for distal DVT treatment Three RCTs of 736 participants compared three or more months of anticoagulation with six weeks of anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with a VKA for three months or more reduced the incidence of recurrent VTE to 5.8% compared with 13.9% in participants treated for six weeks (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.68; 3 studies, 736 participants; I² = 50%; high-certainty evidence). The risk for recurrence of DVT was also reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 48%; high-certainty evidence), but there was probably little or no difference in PE (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.19 to 5.88; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in major bleeding events (RR 3.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 32.35; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.42; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 1%; low-certainty evidence) between three months or more of treatment and six weeks of treatment. There were no reports for overall mortality or PE and major bleeding-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found a benefit for people with distal DVT treated with anticoagulation therapy using VKA with little or no difference in major bleeding events although there was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding when compared to no intervention or placebo. The small number of participants in this meta-analysis and strength of evidence prompts a call for more research regarding the treatment of distal DVT. RCTs comparing different treatments and different treatment periods with placebo or compression therapy, are required.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^116V1zff]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The anticoagulant treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been historically directed toward the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, such treatment imperfectly protects against late manifestations of the postthrombotic syndrome. By restoring venous patency and preserving valvular function, early thrombus removal strategies can potentially decrease postthrombotic morbidity.

Objective

A committee of experts in venous disease was charged by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for early thrombus removal strategies, including catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy.

Methods

Evidence-based recommendations are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature, supplemented when necessary by less rigorous data. Recommendations are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; weak: 2) and an evaluation of the level of the evidence (A to C).

Results

On the basis of the best evidence currently available, we recommend against routine use of the term "proximal venous thrombosis" in favor of more precise characterization of thrombi as involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous segments (Grade 1A). We further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of < 14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade 1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Most data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patient-important benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity. We anticipate revision of these guidelines as additional evidence becomes available.

### Black holes in compression therapy: a quest for data [^115dPbsU]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although compression therapy (CT) is considered a crucial conservative treatment in chronic venous disease, strong evidence is missing for many clinical indications. This literature review aims to point out what strong evidence we have for CT and all the clinical scenarios where strong evidence still needs to be included.

Methods

The research was conducted on MEDLINE with PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The time range was set between January 1980 and October 2022. Only articles in English were included.

Results

The main problem with CT is the low scientific quality of many studies on compression. Consequently, we have robust data on the effectiveness of CT only for advanced venous insufficiency (C3-C6), deep vein thrombosis and lymphedema. We have data on the efficacy of compression for venous symptoms control and in sports recovery, but the low quality of studies cannot result in a strong recommendation. For compression in postvenous procedures, superficial venous thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis, post-thrombotic syndrome prevention and treatment, and sports performance, we have either no data or very debated data not allowing any recommendation.

Conclusions

We need high-level scientific studies to assess if CT can be effective or definitely ineffective in the clinical indications where we still have a paucity of or contrasting data.

### Obesity, thrombosis, venous disease, lymphatic disease, and lipedema: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2023 [^114oVLvN]. Obesity Pillars (2023). High credibility.

Superficial thrombophlebitis in obesity — Superficial thrombophlebitis is the inflammation of a superficial vein of an extremity, accompanied by thrombus formation, with symptoms including localized pain, redness, warmth, and swelling at the site of the affected vein. Beyond obesity, other risk factors include older age, exogenous estrogens, autoimmune or infectious disease, recent trauma or surgery, active malignancy, history of venous thromboembolic disease, and respiratory or cardiac failure, and especially a history of varicose veins. For management, among individuals at low risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), treatment includes local heat and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and for more severe cases, anticoagulants may also be recommended (See Table 2).

### Medical management of acute superficial vein thrombosis of the saphenous vein [^1147gDzg]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) of the axial veins, such as the great saphenous vein (GSV), is a common clinical condition that carries with it significant risk of propagation of thrombus, recurrence, and, most concerning, subsequent venous thromboembolism (VTE). Conservative therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication and heat does not prevent extension of thrombus or protect against recurrent or future VTE in patients with extensive SVT (thrombotic segment of at least 5 cm in length). To prevent future thromboembolic events, anticoagulation has become the treatment of choice for extensive acute SVT in the GSV. In spite of this, the dose and duration of anticoagulation in the treatment of SVT vary widely. This review summarizes the evidence from large prospective, randomized clinical trials on the treatment of SVT with anticoagulation (vs placebo or different doses and durations of anticoagulation) with respect to the outcome measures of thrombus extension, SVT recurrence, and future VTE.

Methods

A systematic search was performed using the MEDLINE database to identify all prospective, randomized controlled trials of treatment with anticoagulation in patients with SVT in the GSV. Six prospective, randomized trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in detail.

Results

Treatment of acute SVT was most commonly managed in an outpatient setting using either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in four studies or, alternatively, a factor Xa inhibitor in one large multicenter trial. LMWH was associated with a lower rate of thrombus extension and subsequent recurrence, especially when an intermediate dose (defined as a dose between prophylactic and therapeutic doses) was used for a period of 30 days. The full effect of treatment with LMWH on the risk of subsequent VTE remains unclear, as do the optimal dose and duration of this drug. Prophylactic doses of fondaparinux, a factor Xa inhibitor, were found to be beneficial in reducing the rate of thrombus extension and recurrence as well as in reducing the risk of subsequent VTE both during treatment and after cessation of anticoagulation in the short term.

Conclusions

These data suggest that treatment of acute SVT of the GSV with anticoagulation, at doses below therapeutic levels, does offer the benefit of decreased risk of thrombus propagation, recurrence, and, at least in one large randomized clinical trial, subsequent VTE. Future studies to refine optimal dose and duration of anticoagulation to lower the rate of subsequent thromboembolic events and SVT recurrence are needed.

### Venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and treatment [^1131tRSp]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, initial management, provoked thrombosis, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to administer a direct-acting OAC as the preferred therapy for VTE for initial management and primary treatment, rather than a VKA or LMWH, in the absence of disease or patient-related contraindications.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis for the association between duration of anticoagulation therapy and the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with lower limb superficial venous thrombosis [^113BYEHZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

In the current meta-analysis, the treatment duration of ≤ 14 days was associated with the highest rate of VTE, which was even higher than that with no anticoagulation. These findings may be biased by large cohort trials, where patients without estimated risk did not develop VTE despite the absence of systemic anticoagulation. It can be assumed that most of them had a limited SVT without additional VTE risk factors in contrast with other trials where individuals with higher VTE risk were treated with short-term anticoagulation. Like in DVT treatment, limited anticoagulation for SVT may be insufficient to control hypercoagulation and prevent VTE recurrence.

Combining the results of the previous analyses based on type or dose indicates that the actual efficacy of the treatment with LMWH may be underestimated. Notably, in cohort trials by Rabe et al and Blin et al, fondaparinux showed superiority over LMWH. However, the mean duration of therapy with fondaparinux was 35 ± 16 and 34 ± 8 days, respectively, compared with 26 ± 23 and 19 ± 27 days for LMWH, respectively.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was designed as any new VTE event that combined symptomatic or asymptomatic SVT progression or recurrence and development of new DVT or PE within a mid-term follow-up ≥ 45 days. The number of VTE events was calculated manually when individual outcomes were reported or used according to the definition of the original trial. The duration of follow-up was calculated from the diagnosis of SVT and the initiation of treatment, which usually does not match the time of symptom onset. Any of the appropriate imaging should have confirmed outcomes: (1) DUS for the symptomatic and asymptomatic SVT; (2) DUS or phlebography for symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT; and (3) pulmonary angiography or computed tomography pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy for symptomatic PE. The diagnosis, codes, and/or prescription of anticoagulants were also suggested as a form of VTE confirmation in the individual retrospective cohort studies. Secondary outcomes included the components of the primary that were assessed separately: (1) SVT progression or recurrence; (2) new DVT; and (3) PE. The definition of every outcome was used according to the individual study. Also, (4) major bleeding and (5) clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) or minor bleeding, according to the criteria of original studies, were assessed as secondary outcomes.

As pre-specified, outcomes were measured in the different subgroups of patients according to the duration of anticoagulation: (1) ≤ 14 days; (2) 15 to 30 days; (3) 31 to 45 days; or (4) > 45 days. These time intervals were suggested according to the most commonly used period of anticoagulation in the relevant papers. The duration was considered as an intention to treat in the randomized controlled trial and as treated in the cohort trials. If different courses of anticoagulation were reported separately, they were analyzed within the matched subgroups. Otherwise, the whole cohort was analyzed according to the mean or median duration. The use of a placebo in an RCT or absence of anticoagulation in most of the cohort (> 90%) was considered as no treatment and was analyzed within a separate subgroup (0 days).

### Treatment options for deep venous thrombosis [^117VvPoU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Once the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been established the focus shifts to management of the disease. The goals of acute treatment of DVT are several: arrest growth of the thrombus, dissolve or remove the thrombus, and prevent embolizations of the thrombus. Although these goals have remained constant, the initial management of DVT has undergone a series of evolutions during the past decade, affecting both acute treatment and disposition decisions. As this article discusses, emergency medicine is at the cutting edge of these changes.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^11372n68]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal strategies — We recommend that patients managed with early thrombus removal be treated with a standard course of conventional anticoagulation after the procedure (Grade 1A). Strategies of early thrombus removal should be considered an adjunct rather than an alternative to conventional anticoagulation for acute iliofemoral DVT. Successful thrombus removal should be followed by a standard course of anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by oral anticoagulants administered for a duration guided by the patient's underlying risk factors. Although the duration of anticoagulation is generally determined by underlying thrombotic risk factors, the optimal duration of anticoagulation after the placement of venous stents in the setting of early thrombus removal has not been adequately studied, and no evidence-based recommendations can be provided. Factors associated with stent thrombosis have included thrombophilia and evidence of extrinsic compression.

### Thrombosis in multiple myeloma: risk stratification, antithrombotic prophylaxis, and management of acute events. A consensus-based position paper from anexpert panel [^111m1fRy]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the light of new therapies for MM, key clinically relevant questions regarding MM-associated thrombosis were identified, and recommendations were formulated by a panel of experts in the field. Although several scientific bodies have provided guidance on how to optimize thromboprophylaxis in MM patients, the panel highlighted the high degree of uncertainty regarding risk stratification and thromboprophylaxis in MM patients. Since the existing scientific literature about thromboprophylaxis in MM does not allow evidence-based recommendations, consensus was a critical part of the production of the present re-commendations.

Box 3. Recommendations regarding early treatment of acute thrombotic events, secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis, and re-exposure to anti-myeloma drug in patients with multiple myeloma.

Patients with multiple myeloma on secondary prophylaxis with long-term oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants, should continue with their anticoagulation treatment during anti-myeloma therapy.
Patients on anti-platelet therapy (single or double agents) because of previous arterial ischemic events should continue their ongoing anti-platelet prophylaxis. They should add a low molecular weight heparin after a careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio during anti-myeloma treatment. The use of low molecular weight heparin should be considered as long as the myeloma disease burden remains high.
Patients with a history of provoked venous thromboembolism or of thrombosis of superficial veins not receiving oral anticoagulation should receive a short-term course of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (4–6 months) followed by aspirin 100 mg/day during anti-myeloma treatment.
Patients with a history of unprovoked venous thromboembolism not receiving oral anticoagulation who have normal renal function may be treated with a low molecular weight heparin, vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban). The choice should be based on pharmacological interactions and risk of bleeding.
In patients with a history of unprovoked venous thromboembolism who have started low molecular weight heparin or oral anticoagulation as thromboprophylaxis after a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, the decision to change to aspirin after 6 months or to continue with oral anticoagulation during long-term treatment with immunomodulatory drugs should be evaluated case by case.
In general, the treatment of acute thrombosis during active treatment for multiple myeloma should not be diferent from that usually recommended.
Patients with multiple myeloma and non-life-threatening venous thromboembolism during therapy with immunomodulatory drugs should continue the therapy and receive long-term anticoagulation.
In the case of life-threatening venous thromboembolism or arterial thrombosis during treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, a careful case-by-case evaluation should be made, considering the response of the multiple myeloma disease to immunomodulatory drugs, the severity of the thrombosis, and the patient's risk profile for future events.
In multiple myeloma patients with acute venous thromboembolism, the duration of anticoagulant treatment should be at least 6 months or indefinite in the case of ongoing treatment with immunomodulatory drugs.
In active multiple myeloma with a high burden of disease, patients should continue the anticoagulant treatment even after 6 months until response of the myeloma disease.
As regards the platelet count during secondary thromboprophylaxis, the same recommendations as for primary thromboprophylaxis should be followed.
In the case of acute venous thromboembolism and severe thrombocytopenia, the placement of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter is suggested until safe anticoagulation is possible, and the filter can be removed.
In patients with renal insufciency (with or without ongoing dialysis) the most appropriate secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis after venous thromboembolism is adjusted-dose low molecular weight heparin or a vitamin K antagonist.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^117Jk3Tp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Operative/endovascular management for venous leg ulcers — The quality of evidence to support recommendations for operative and endovascular management is limited to level C evidence, attributed to the absence of comparative prospective RCTs, with the exception of a few studies that address treatment of superficial venous disease. Even the data in the treatment of superficial insufficiency, as suggested by the commissioned meta-analysis, are limited in scope, and the data derived from open procedures (ligation and stripping RCTs) have been extrapolated to results that might be achieved with thermal ablation. Many recommendations regarding healed patients or patients with potential VLU are based on extrapolations from the data obtained from patients with active VLUs, and each specific patient condition needs focused investigation to determine what "best care" is. Several methods of great and small saphenous ablation are under investigation and may provide even less risk for the benefits provided. Deep venous reconstruction has often been reserved for cases in which nothing else has been successful; this treatment option has been a forgotten therapeutic alternative for patients with deep venous insufficiency in whom nonsurgical and superficial venous intervention has been unsuccessful, and there is room to reinvestigate this assumption by comparing repair of deep venous insufficiency vs outflow obstruction interventions in patients who have both conditions.

### Varicose vein surgery after acute isolated superficial vein thrombosis in daily practice: INSIGHTS-SVT study [^114Sat9p]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Multicenter, prospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: In 197 invasively and 675 conservatively treated patients with acute superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred in 6.3% vs 5.8%, recurrent or extended SVT in 5.3% vs 4.7%, and bleeding events in 2.1% vs 1.4% over 12 months.
- **Take Home Message**: Almost all patients in the study received anticoagulation alone (conservative treatment) or in combination with surgery. Surgery after SVT was rare. Patients treated invasively appeared to be "low-risk" compared with those treated conservatively, as they were younger and had fewer previous venous thromboembolism events, but had a higher rate of varicose veins in their medical history. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in outcomes at 12 months.

Acute superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is a prevalent vascular condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in the superficial veins, mostly in the lower extremities. Although generally considered a benign condition, SVT is frequently associated with substantial pain, swelling, and discomfort in affected patients. Furthermore, if left untreated, SVT can progress to potentially life-threatening conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Therefore, prompt diagnosis and effective management of SVT are essential in averting these serious complications.

Recently, the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) issued its 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of Venous Thrombosis, providing evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing SVT. These guidelines advocate an SVT management approach largely contingent on symptom severity and the likelihood of progression to DVT or PE. Patients experiencing mild to moderate SVT may derive benefit from noninvasive interventions such as compression stockings and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, individuals with more extensive SVT or those facing a high risk of progression (eg, SVT close to saphenofemoral junction [SFJ], malignancy, extension of SVT clot) may necessitate more aggressive treatments, including anticoagulation or surgical intervention.

### Rationale, design, and methodology of the observational INSIGHTS-SVT study on the current state of care and outcomes of patients with superficial vein thrombosis [^113nvM3m]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is a common disease in clinical practice. In terms of pathophysiology and outcomes, the condition is related to venous thromboembolism, bearing a potential for severe thromboembolic complications if it is not treated adequately. A wide range of treatment approaches (including oral and injectable anticoagulants, pain medication, nondrug therapy including compression therapy, and no treatment at all) are applied in clinical practice, but there is sparse information about selection of patients for therapies, current treatment pathways, and drug use as well as outcomes. The INvestigating SIGnificant Health TrendS in the management of Superficial Vein Thrombosis (INSIGHTS-SVT) study aims to close this gap by collecting representative data on the current treatment of SVT.

Methods

The observational prospective study of about 1200 patients is carried out by up to 120 clinical and office-based physicians who regularly treat patients with SVT and are capable of conducting appropriate compression ultrasound diagnostics, such as vascular physicians, phlebologists, internists, vascular surgeons, and general practitioners. Patients are eligible for inclusion if they have ultrasound-confirmed acute, isolated SVT of the lower extremities. Documentation about the characteristics of the patients, diagnostics, comorbidities, and medical and nonmedical treatment is collected at baseline, at 10 ± 3 days or at approximately 45 days (depending on treatment), at approximately 3 months, and at approximately 12 months. Patients are requested to fill in quality of life questionnaires (on pain, Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study on Quality of Life/Symptoms [VEINES-QOL/Sym], EuroQol-5 Dimension 5-Level [EQ-5D-5L]) at baseline and at approximately 3 months. Interventions are not stipulated by the trial protocol.

Results

The primary efficacy outcome is the incidence of venous thromboembolism at 3 months; the primary safety outcome is the combined incidence of major and clinically relevant bleeding events at 3 months. As quality measures, plausibility checks at data entry, queries based on statistical analyses that focus on outliers and distribution of values, monitoring visits, and adjudication procedures will be applied.

Conclusions

This large study is expected to provide a comprehensive picture of patients with SVT under clinical practice conditions in Germany.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^117BbyhV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The recurrence rate of SVT is between 10 and 20%. One large case series of SVT patients described a recurrence rate of 15% among 221 patients. In modern times with widespread application of anticoagulant therapies, the risk of recurrence or VTE is ∼6%, with the highest risk occurring among patients with previous episodes of SVT and long segment thrombosis. Although not addressed by a randomized control trial, best practice would include informing patient of the risk of recurrent SVT and offering surgical or endovascular therapy for the treatment of symptomatic recanalized varices and axial reflux (if present in the recanalized saphenous vein after completion of evidence based antithrombotic therapy).

13.3. For patients who presented with bleeding from varicose veins, and bleeding has been controlled, evaluation for superficial venous incompetence and appropriate intervention should be done to control venous hypertension and reduce the risk of recurrent hemorrhage.

Consensus statement

13.4. Patients with varicose veins or venous ulcerations should be counseled on the possibility of venous bleeding and their families, caregivers, or friends educated regarding leg elevation and simple compression techniques to control severe bleeding.

Recommendation strength interpretation notes that the strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and is interpreted so that for strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the intervention or test; for conditional recommendations, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action but many would not, and different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^115YsqY4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis — indications for early thrombus removal (section 2.1): We suggest a strategy of early thrombus removal in selected patients meeting the following criteria: (a) a first episode of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis, (b) symptoms < 14 days in duration, (c) a low risk of bleeding, and (d) ambulatory with good functional capacity and an acceptable life expectancy (Grade 2C). Overall, the quality of evidence supporting early thrombus removal strategies is very low (Grade C). Among patients enrolled in the National Venous Registry, those with chronic symptoms, femoropopliteal DVT, and symptoms > 10 days in duration had significantly worse outcomes than those with a first episode of acute iliofemoral DVT of < 10 days in duration. Other guidelines have suggested that DVT associated with symptoms present for ≤ 14 days be considered acute, and a recently published randomized trial included patients with symptoms of < 21 days. On balance, recommendations for consideration of early thrombus removal strategies in patients with symptoms of < 14 days of duration would seem fairly secure, although a benefit in patients with a duration of symptoms of > 14 days cannot be excluded and the relative benefits vs risks in such patients should be considered on an individualized basis. A decision analysis evaluating systemic streptokinase in the treatment of DVT suggests that patients would be unlikely to accept more than a 1.7-fold increase in major bleeding compared with heparin therapy, and on this basis of individual variation in values and preferences, strategies of early thrombus removal should be considered a Grade 2 recommendation; recommendation of a strategy of early thrombus removal requires a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits for the individual patient and a careful discussion with the patient.

### Anticoagulants for the treatment of isolated lower limb superficial vein thrombosis a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114LEJTX]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Assess the safety and efficacy of anticoagulants in treating isolated superficial vein thrombosis (iSVT).

Materials and Methods

A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating anticoagulants in the treatment of iSVT. The primary endpoint of thrombotic complications encompassed any incident of iSVT progression/recurrence and the development of new-onset (deep vein thrombosis) DVT or (pulmonary embolism) PE.

Results

Eight RCT's and 4721 patients treated once daily with either fondaparinux 2.5 mg, rivaroxaban 10 mg, therapeutic, intermediate, and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMW) were included. While all anticoagulants displayed a statistically significant risk reduction compared to placebo in terms of thrombotic complications and iSVT progression/recurrence, only fondaparinux reduced the risk for DVT/PE. Additionally, fondaparinux exhibited enhanced efficacy in decreasing DVT/PE events relative to prophylactic and therapeutic LMWH. Furthermore, rivaroxaban and fondaparinux demonstrated superior outcomes in terms of preventing thrombotic complications compared to all three dosing regimens of LMWH without significant differences between the two, risk ratio RR 1.00(95%CI:0.51–1.92). SUCRA identified fondaparinux as the most effective treatment regarding thrombotic complications, (SUCRA,91.6) and DVT/PE, (SUCRA,96) and rivaroxaban in terms of iSVT progression/recurrence (SUCRA,94.68). Ultimately and despite certain model limitations, meta-regression analysis suggested a possible trend towards improved outcomes with longer treatment durations for thrombotic complications β = -0.34(95%CI:-16.39to12.23).

Conclusions

Despite inherent limitations such as variations in treatment durations and follow-up periods, this review displayed the efficacy of fondaparinux, rivaroxaban and LMWH in treating iSVT. The improved efficacy of fondaparinux over therapeutic LMWH in terms of DVT/PE outcomes necessitates cautious interpretation underscoring the need for further investigation through adequately powered RCTs.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study, with real-world data, contributes to our understanding of SVT management by highlighting the importance of individualized treatment strategies, appropriate timing of interventions, and the need for continued research to refine our approach to this condition. It reinforces the notion that the management of SVT should be guided by a careful assessment of each patient's individual circumstances and risk factors.

### Compression therapy after invasive treatment of superficial veins of the lower extremities: clinical practice guidelines of the American Venous Forum, Society for Vascular Surgery, American college of phlebology, Society for Vascular Medicine, and International Union of Phlebology [^113PfVqo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). High credibility.

General considerations for compression therapy after varicose vein interventions — Five categories are available (compression bandages, compression stockings, self-adjustable Velcro devices, compression pumps, and hybrid devices), and compression bandages and compression stockings are most commonly used for short-term application; training for proper application is essential; multicomponent bandages should be applied with a pressure of approximately 50 mm Hg on the lower leg and > 30 mm Hg on the thigh; elastic textiles increase sub-bandage pressure when patients stand up or walk; compression stockings produce less pressure increases than compression bandages when standing up and when walking, yet have been shown to be effective in reducing edema and pain vs no stockings and seem to have anti-inflammatory properties.

12. Management of SVT in patients with varicose and nonvaricose veins

Guideline 12. Address the management of SVT in patients who have not recently undergone superficial venous interventions. The management of EHIT and other thrombotic complications of superficial venous interventions were presented in Guidelines 11.

12.1.1. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee > 3 cm from the SFJ and ≥ 5 cm in length, whether or not associated with varicose veins, we recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days; alternatively, rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may be appropriate for patients unwilling or unable to perform subcutaneous injections.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: A (high)

12.1.2. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks ≤ 3 cm from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 weeks should be continued.

Consensus statement

12.1.3 For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks we suggest against using prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While both have been found to reduce SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent VTE. If NSAIDs are used for treatment of short segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: A (high)

12.1.4. For selected patients with isolated thrombosis of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the GSV, we suggest phlebectomy as a safe alternative.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)

12.1.5. In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis, ablation should be performed once the inflammation has resolved if there is evidence of pathologic reflux on DUS.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^116Nyf8a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal strategies — We recommend that all patients be treated with knee-high compression stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg) for at least 2 years after the procedure (Grade 1C). Compression stockings improve calf muscle pump function, reduce edema, and likely improve cutaneous microcirculation. The use of graded elastic compression stockings decreases by 50% the incidence of objectively defined postthrombotic syndrome after a first episode of "proximal" DVT treated with conventional anticoagulation. In a randomized trial of 194 patients, the incidence of mild-to-moderate and severe postthrombotic syndrome was 20% and 11%, respectively, among patients receiving compression stockings compared with 47% and 23% among those in the control group. Prandoni et al similarly found the use of compression stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg at the ankle) reduced the 2-year incidence of any post-thrombotic syndrome from 49.1% to 24.5%. Among those treated with optimal anticoagulation, 4.3 patients need to wear compression stockings to prevent one case of post-thrombotic syndrome. On the basis of these data, current guidelines recommend the prescription of graded elastic compression stockings (40 mm Hg at the ankle) for at least 2 years after a proximal thrombotic event treated with conventional anticoagulation (Grade 1A). Although early thrombus removal strategies likely also reduce the incidence of the postthrombotic syndrome, no reports have evaluated the adjunctive effect of compression stockings in this patient population. The evidence supporting the use of compression stockings among patients treated with early thrombus removal strategies is indirect, but the potential benefits likely exceed the risks, and their use can be strongly recommended (Grade 1C).

### Optimal treatment duration of venous thrombosis [^113Hb6RK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials have shown that patients with venous thromboembolism benefit from a minimum of three months of anticoagulant therapy. After this period, it was suggested that patients with an expected annual recurrence rate of < 5% could safely discontinue treatment. Using a population-based approach for stratification, these patients are those with major transient risk factors, and represent the minority. For all other patients, including those with previous episodes of venous thromboembolism, cancer, or unprovoked events, this treatment duration may not be sufficiently protective. Because extending anticoagulation for additional three to nine months does not result in further, long-term reduction of recurrences, indefinite treatment duration should be considered. However, case-fatality rate for major bleeding in patients taking warfarin for more than three months is higher than case-fatality rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Thus, an individual patient approach to improve and increase the identification of those who can safely discontinue treatment at three months becomes necessary. Clinical prediction rules or management strategies based on D-dimer levels or residual vein thrombosis have been proposed and need further refinement and validation. Specific bleeding scores are lacking. Meanwhile, the oral direct inhibitors have been proposed as potential alternatives to the vitamin K antagonists, and aspirin may provide some benefit in selected patients who discontinue anticoagulation. Deep vein thrombosis in unusual sites is associated with less, but potentially more severe recurrences, in particular in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis who also face an increased risk of bleeding complications while on treatment.

### Black holes in compression therapy: a quest for data [^115VS9Ht]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

CT in superficial vein thrombosis

Studies on CT as the sole treatment of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) do not exist because CT is always associated with antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy. One consensus document recommends CT as an effective treatment in addition to antithrombotic therapy. Another studyreports that compression does not add any advantage to the antithrombotic treatment concerning the reduction of pain, consumption of analgesics, thrombus length, skin erythema,-dimer, or QoL. However, MCS stimulated significantly faster thrombus regression after 7 days of wear. In the most recent guidelines on the management of venous thrombosis, CT is not even mentioned in the treatment of SVT. In conclusion, we need to learn more about the effectiveness of CT in SVT treatment. When CT is prescribed, we do not have data on how long it must be used, although also this is a piece of vital information to get.

CT in thromboprophylaxis

The rationale of CT in bedridden patients to prevent DVT is compressing the veins, increasing the venous blood velocity, and so minimizing venous stasis. Whatever the involved mechanism, MCSs were very effective in DVT prevention in surgical patients as a unique treatment and combined with other therapeutical interventions. Several papers confirmed the MCS effectiveness in this field, and these positive reports were reflected in a Cochrane review.MSCs were reported to be effective also in decreasing the incidence of asymptomatic DVT in addition to reducing leg edema and SVT in airline passengers. Recent studies comparing MCS alone with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis plus MCS in surgical patients and in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy did not report any advantage of the additional MCS compared with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis alone. As one of these studieshighlights, "further studies are required to evaluate whether or not adjuvant graduated compression stockings have a role in patients receiving extended thromboprophylaxis, beyond the period of hospital admission, following elective surgery or in patients undergoing emergency surgical procedures".

Furthermore, thigh-length MCSs are ineffective in preventing DVT in stroke patients, even if this result is unclear. The same authors in the following paper conclude that thigh-length MCSs are more effective than knee-length MCS in DVTprevention, making their first conclusion difficult to understand. In no study concerning surgical and medical patients was the duration of immobility reported; however, this information should be known as well.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). High credibility.

Postoperative compression after saphenous vein surgery or endovenous laser ablation — effects of higher pressure and eccentric pads — was associated with reduced early pain in small studies. In one single-center randomized study, 88 patients were assigned to low (18–21 mm Hg) vs moderate (23–32 mm Hg) compression applied daily (8 hours/d) for 6 weeks with follow-up at 1 and 6 weeks, and at 1 week there was less pain, tightness, discomfort, and edema in the moderate group. In a three-center case-control study, 36 patients received two stockings with a thigh pad and 17 received two stockings alone, with significantly reduced pain by postoperative day 3 (visual analogue scale [VAS] 31 vs 19; P = 0.05) and overall pain reduced by 49% with stockings and pad. In another randomized study after saphenous stripping, 54 patients were allocated to compression stockings only (23–32 mm Hg at ankle), adhesive bandages, or stockings plus an eccentric pad for 7 days; no superficial venous thrombosis or DVT occurred. After endovenous laser ablation, 200 subjects randomized to stockings alone (35 mm Hg) or stockings plus eccentric compression had lower pain at 7 days with additional bulk (pain score of 1.4 vs 4.9). A fifth study in 48 patients comparing three stocking types found no significant differences in pain at 1 week, and the authors state that postoperative pain in the first 7 days can be reduced with higher compression modalities and eccentric compression.
