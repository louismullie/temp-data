## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which molecule is the source of the oxygen atoms in the O2 gas produced during oxygenic photosynthesis, with options including O2, CH4, CO2, H2O, N2, C6H12O6, H2O2, O3, CO, and C. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core photosynthetic reaction and whether O2 comes from water or carbon dioxide. Then, I should verify the historical evidence that settled this question, especially isotope-labeling experiments. Next, I will examine the provided documents to see if they directly support the water-origin conclusion. Finally, I will consider why the distractors are incorrect and confirm the best answer choice.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental process. Oxygenic photosynthesis, as carried out by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, uses light energy to split water, liberating electrons and protons and releasing molecular oxygen as a byproduct, while carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules. This is precisely why Earth's atmosphere became oxygenated over billions of years as oxygenic photosynthesis evolved [^68b3a069].

> Wait, let me verify the specific source of the O2 atoms. The oxygen gas evolved during photosynthesis comes from the photolysis of water, not from carbon dioxide. This has been demonstrated by isotope-labeling experiments showing that when plants are provided with H2O enriched in 18O, the released O2 contains 18O, whereas when CO2 is enriched in 18O, the O2 does not carry the heavy isotope, establishing water as the oxygen source [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check the provided references for direct support. The G3 paper explicitly states that during oxygenic photosynthesis, electrons are extracted from water and oxygen is generated as a side product of this reaction, which aligns with the water-origin conclusion and directly supports choosing H2O as the source of the O2 atoms [^68b3a069].

> I need to ensure I address the distractors. Carbon dioxide is the carbon source for glucose synthesis, not the oxygen source for O2, so CO2 is incorrect. Molecular oxygen (O2) is the product, not the source. Methane, nitrogen, glucose, hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide are not the primary oxygen donors in photosynthesis, and none of the provided documents implicate them as the source of photosynthetic O2, reinforcing that H2O is the correct choice [^68b3a069].

> Let me reconsider the mechanistic implication to be sure I'm precise. The oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II oxidizes water to O2, while CO2 is reduced in the Calvin cycle; thus, the O–O bond in O2 originates from water molecules, confirming that the correct answer is H2O [^68b3a069].

> Final answer: D. H2O.

---

The oxygen produced during photosynthesis comes from **water (H2O)** [^68b3a069], not carbon dioxide (CO2). This is supported by isotope-labeling experiments showing that when plants use H2O labeled with 18O, the released O2 contains 18O, whereas labeled CO2 does not produce labeled O2 [^notfound]. The oxygen in CO2 is incorporated into glucose and other organic molecules, while the oxygen in H2O is split during the light reactions to form O2 [^68b3a069].

---

## Photosynthesis: the overall process

Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the **light-dependent reactions** and the **Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions)**. The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes and require sunlight, whereas the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma and uses ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent reactions.

---

## The light-dependent reactions: splitting of water molecules

During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, energizing electrons that drive the **splitting of water molecules** (photolysis) into hydrogen ions (H+), electrons (e-), and oxygen (O2). This process occurs at the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II [^68b3a069]. The overall reaction for this step is:

6 H₂O + light energy → 12 H⁺ + 12 e⁻ + 6 O₂

Thus, the oxygen gas (O2) released during photosynthesis is derived from **water molecules** [^68b3a069].

---

## The Calvin cycle: incorporation of carbon dioxide

During the Calvin cycle, CO2 is fixed into organic molecules (such as glucose) through a series of enzymatic reactions. The oxygen atoms from CO2 are incorporated into these organic molecules, not released as O2. The overall reaction for the Calvin cycle is:

6 CO₂ + 12 NADPH + 18 ATP → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 12 NADP⁺ + 18 ADP + 18 Pi

Therefore, the oxygen atoms from CO2 are used to form glucose and other organic compounds, not released as **oxygen gas** [^68b3a069].

---

## Experimental evidence: isotope labeling studies

Isotope-labeling experiments have provided direct evidence that the oxygen released during photosynthesis originates from water. In these experiments, plants were supplied with water containing the **heavy isotope of oxygen (18O)** [^notfound]. The oxygen gas released during photosynthesis contained 18O, indicating that the oxygen atoms came from water. Conversely, when plants were supplied with CO2 containing 18O, the released oxygen gas did not contain 18O, confirming that CO2 is not the source of oxygen gas [^notfound].

---

## Common misconceptions

A common misconception is that the oxygen released during photosynthesis comes from **carbon dioxide**. However, as demonstrated by isotope-labeling studies and the biochemical pathways involved, the oxygen gas released during photosynthesis is derived from water molecules, not carbon dioxide [^68b3a069].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Evidence** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Biochemical pathways | The light-dependent reactions split water molecules, releasing oxygen gas [^68b3a069] |
| Isotope labeling studies | Oxygen gas released during photosynthesis contains 18O when water is labeled with 18O, but not when CO2 is labeled with 18O [^notfound] |
| Common misconception | Oxygen gas does not come from carbon dioxide |

---

The oxygen produced during photosynthesis comes from **water (H2O)** [^68b3a069], not carbon dioxide (CO2). This is supported by both the biochemical pathways involved in photosynthesis and isotope-labeling experiments [^notfound].

### Efficient photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide using dispersible and photoactive porous polymers [^a7a4ad0e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Developing efficient artificial photocatalysts for the biomimetic photocatalytic production of molecular materials, including medicines and clean energy carriers, remains a fundamentally and technologically essential challenge. Hydrogen peroxide is widely used in chemical synthesis, medical disinfection, and clean energy. However, the current industrial production, predominantly by anthraquinone oxidation, suffers from hefty energy penalties and toxic byproducts. Herein, we report the efficient photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide by protonation-induced dispersible porous polymers with good charge-carrier transport properties. Significant photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide generation occurs under ambient conditions at an unprecedented rate of 23.7 mmol g –1 h –1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 11.3% at 450 nm. Combined simulations and spectroscopies indicate that sub-picosecond ultrafast electron "localization" from both free carriers and exciton states at the catalytic reaction centers underlie the remarkable photocatalytic performance of the dispersible porous polymers.

We report the dose rate dependence of radiation chemical yields (G value) of water radiolysis products under clinical energy protons (230 MeV) to understand mechanisms of the FLASH radiotherapy performed at ultra-high dose rate (> 40 Gy/s). The G value of 7-hydoroxy-coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (7OH-C3CA) produced by reactions of coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (C3CA) with OH radicals and oxygen is evaluated by fluorescence method. Also, those of hydrated electrons and hydrogen peroxide are derived by absorption method using Saltzman and Ghomley techniques, respectively. Both G values of 7OH-C3CA and hydrated electrons decrease with increasing dose rate. The relative evolution of 7OH-C3CA is -39 ± 2% between 0.1 and 50 Gy/s. This value is higher than that of hydrated electrons, measured at -21 ± 4%. The G value of hydrogen peroxide in ultra-pure water also decreases with increasing dose rate. In comparison to these findings, we represent the increase of the G value of hydrogen peroxide with increasing dose rate in the mixture solution of MeOH and NaNO3, which act as scavengers of OH radicals and hydrated electrons, respectively, that decompose hydrogen peroxide. This finding indicates that a complex track structure can be expected with increasing dose rate and the reduction of OH radicals by forming hydrogen peroxide would be related to the sparing effect of healthy tissues.

### Harnessing air-water interface to generate interfacial ROS for ultrafast environmental remediation [^c8830516]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The air–water interface, arising from the interplay between air and water molecules, is widely encountered in the fields of atmospheric, biological, prebiotic, and synthetic organic chemistry. Recently, our understanding of this microenvironment has evolved dramatically that the chemical reaction rates can be accelerated by many orders of magnitude when occurring at or near the air–water interfaces –. In particular, the air–water interface can significantly enhance the reactive oxidative species (ROS) reactions compared to that in the bulk phase. This remarkable phenomenon particularly gains attention in atmospheric chemistry, where the oxidation kinetics of atmospheric trace gases (e.g. nitric oxide (NO x) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) by ROS are enhanced significantly at the surface of cloud-water droplets –. These findings from the natural world provide a guide for constructing artificial air–water interfaces to accelerate ROS-induced reactions for practical application, given the pivotal role of ROS in fundamental chemical processes across atmospheric, biological, aquatic, and synthetic organic chemistry domains.

Highly reactive radical species, such as hydroxyl radicals (HO
-) and sulfate radicals (SO 4
- −), exhibit remarkable reactivity and possess the capacity to completely oxidize a wide range of organic pollutants into CO 2 and H 2 O, rendering them promising for environmental remediation –. The Fenton and Fenton-like reactions are commonly employed as effective methods to generate ROS. These reactions involve the catalytic activation of diverse peroxides, including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS), to produce HO
- and SO 4
- −. Despite considerable efforts to further accelerate Fenton or Fenton-like reactions, such as optimizing the catalytic activity with single metal atoms or applying external energy inputs (e.g. UV light, heat), the overall ROS generation rates achieved by these approaches remain limited –. This is largely due to the inherent kinetic and thermodynamic constraints of the bulk-phase reactions, which restrict the maximum achievable concentrations of the highly ROS. In addition, the ROS are quickly consumed by competing side reactions or scavenged by various species present in the solution, limiting their overall effectiveness for environmental remediation.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^1d140494]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Executive summary — Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 presents evidence-based recommendations on preferred methods for cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of patient-care medical devices and the healthcare environment, noting that maximum effectiveness results from first cleaning and removal of organic and inorganic materials. Chemical disinfectants for patient-care equipment include alcohols, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds, and chlorine, and sterilization methods discussed include steam sterilization, ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid. The choice of disinfectant, concentration, and exposure time is based on the risk for infection associated with use of the equipment and other factors, and when properly used these processes can reduce the risk for infection associated with invasive and noninvasive medical and surgical devices; however, health-care workers should adhere strictly to the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization recommendations in this document and to instructions on product labels. New topics addressed include inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, bioterrorist agents, emerging pathogens, and bloodborne pathogens; toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns; disinfection in ambulatory settings and home care; new sterilization processes such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and disinfection of complex instruments (e.g., endoscopes).

### Kinetically restrained oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide with nearly 100% selectivity [^8d8ac645]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide has been synthesized mainly through the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction in recent years. Herein, we synthesize a single-atom rhodium catalyst (Rh 1 /NC) to mimic the properties of flavoenzymes for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions. Rh 1 /NC dehydrogenates various substrates and catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The maximum hydrogen peroxide production rate is 0.48 mol g catalyst −1 h −1 in the phosphorous acid aerobic oxidation reaction. We find that the selectivity of oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide can reach 100%. This is because a single catalytic site of Rh 1 /NC can only catalyze the removal of two electrons per substrate molecule; thus, the subsequent oxygen can only obtain two electrons to reduce to hydrogen peroxide through the typical two-electron pathway. Similarly, due to the restriction of substrate dehydrogenation, the hydrogen peroxide selectivity in commercial Pt/C-catalyzed enzymatic reactions can be found to reach 75%, which is 30 times higher than that in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions.

### A novel bridge between oxidative stress and immunity: the interaction between hydrogen peroxide and human leukocyte antigen G in placental trophoblasts during preeclampsia [^d5f7fc4f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between hydrogen peroxide and human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) in preeclampsia.

Study Design

We explored the correlation between HLA-G and hydrogen peroxide in preeclamptic (n = 30) and normotensive (n = 30) placentas, which was confirmed by in vitro experiments. Furthermore, RNA interference was used to explore the influence of HLA-G on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells when exposed to hydrogen peroxide.

Results

We found an inverse correlation between hydrogen peroxide and HLA-G expression in preeclamptic placentas. High levels of hydrogen peroxide could down-regulate HLA-G expression in HTR-8/SVneo. Compared with HLA-G knockdown HTR-8/SVneo, increased proliferation inhibition, higher apoptosis, and decreased cell invasion were found in the cell expressing HLA-G when exposed to hydrogen peroxide.

Conclusion

Our findings highlight that high levels of hydrogen peroxide can down-regulate HLA-G expression in trophoblasts during preeclampsia and trophoblasts expressing HLA-G are vulnerable to oxidative stress.

Hydrogen peroxide — uses on devices and materials include that commercially available 3% hydrogen peroxide is a stable and effective disinfectant for inanimate surfaces and has been used in concentrations from 3% to 6% for disinfecting soft contact lenses (e.g., 3% for 2–3 hrs), tonometer biprisms, ventilators, fabrics, and endoscopes; it was effective in spot-disinfecting fabrics in patients' rooms, but corneal damage has been reported from a hydrogen peroxide-soaked tonometer tip that was not properly rinsed; in urinary drainage bags, instillation reduced microbial contamination of the bag but did not reduce the incidence of catheter-associated bacteriuria.

### Clinical review: oxygen as a signaling molecule [^be6ebf8a]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Molecular oxygen is obviously essential for conserving energy in a form useable for aerobic life; however, its utilization comes at a cost — the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can be highly damaging to a range of biological macromolecules, and in the past the overproduction of these short-lived molecules in a variety of disease states was thought to be exclusively toxic to cells and tissues such as the lung. Recent basic research, however, has indicated that ROS production — in particular, the production of hydrogen peroxide — plays an important role in both intracellular and extracellular signal transduction that involves diverse functions from vascular health to host defense. The present review summarizes oxygen's capacity, acting through its reactive intermediates, to recruit the enzymatic antioxidant defenses, to stimulate cell repair processes, and to mitigate cellular damage.

### Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide splitting on metal-free powders assisted by phosphoric acid as a stabilizer [^1f91a5f0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) has received increasing attention as an energy carrier. To achieve a sustainable energy society, photocatalytic H 2 O 2 splitting (H₂O₂ (l) → H₂ (g) + O₂ (g); ΔG° = +131 kJ mol⁻¹) is a desirable reaction for on-site H 2 generation. However, this reaction has not been reported because conventional photocatalysis decomposes H 2 O 2 by disproportionation (H₂O₂ (l) → H₂O (l) + [1/2] O₂ (g); ΔG° = −117 kJ mol⁻¹) and by promoting H 2 O 2 reduction instead of H + reduction. Here we report the successful example of H 2 O 2 splitting. Visible light irradiation of a graphitic carbon nitride loaded with graphene quantum dots as co-catalysts (GQDs/g-C 3 N 4) in a H 2 O 2 solution containing phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) produces H 2. H 3 PO 4 associates with H 2 O 2 via hydrogen bonding, and this stabilization of H 2 O 2 suppresses its reduction, thus promoting H + reduction. The all-organic photosystem with H 3 PO 4 as a stabilizer may provide a basis of photocatalytic H 2 O 2 splitting.

### Brown adipose tissue regulates small artery function through NADPH oxidase 4-derived hydrogen peroxide and redox-sensitive protein kinase G-1 α [^ea40b17b]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Biomedical interest in brown adipose tissue (BAT) has increased since the discovery of functionally active BAT in adult humans. Although white adipose tissue (WAT) influences vascular function, vascular effects of BAT are elusive. Thus, we investigated the regulatory role and putative vasoprotective effects of BAT, focusing on hydrogen peroxide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (Nox4), and redox-sensitive signaling.

Approach and Results

Vascular reactivity was assessed in wild-type and Nox4-knockout mice (Nox4 -/-) by wire myography in the absence and presence of perivascular adipose tissue of different phenotypes from various adipose depots: (1) mixed WAT/BAT (inguinal adipose tissue) and (2) WAT (epididymal visceral fat) and BAT (intrascapular fat). In wild-type mice, epididymal visceral fat and perivascular adipose tissue increased EC 50 to noradrenaline without affecting maximum contraction. BAT increased EC 50 and significantly decreased maximum contraction, which were prevented by a hydrogen peroxide scavenger (polyethylene glycated catalase) and a specific cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase G type-1α inhibitor (DT-3), but not by inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase or guanylate cyclase. BAT induced dimerization of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase G type-1α and reduced phosphorylation of myosin light chain phosphatase subunit 1 and myosin light chain 20. BAT from Nox4-knockout mice displayed reduced hydrogen peroxide levels and no anticontractile effects. Perivascular adipose tissue from β 3 agonist-treated mice displayed browned perivascular adipose tissue and an increased anticontractile effect.

Conclusions

We identify a novel vasoprotective action of BAT through an anticontractile effect that is mechanistically different to WAT. Specifically, BAT, via Nox4-derived hydrogen peroxide, induces cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase G type-1α activation, resulting in reduced vascular contractility. BAT may constitute an interesting therapeutic target to restore vascular function and prevent vascular complications in cardiovascular diseases.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^966aa35b]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Disinfectant fogging — routine use is discouraged and a 2009 clarification limits scope: Do not perform disinfectant fogging for routine patient-care areas (Category II). CDC and HICPAC state that the CDC does not support disinfectant fogging, referring to spraying or fogging of chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde, phenol-based agents, or quaternary ammonium compounds) to decontaminate surfaces or disinfect air; the recommendation against fogging was based on 1970's reports of lack of microbicidal efficacy and adverse effects, and some chemicals are not EPA-registered for fogging applications. These recommendations do not apply to newer room-decontamination technologies (e.g., ozone mists, vaporized hydrogen peroxide); for these, the 2011 norovirus guideline states, "More research is required to clarify the effectiveness and reliability of fogging, UV irradiation, and ozone mists to reduce norovirus environmental contamination. (No recommendation/ unresolved issue)". The 2008 recommendations still apply, and CDC does not yet make a recommendation regarding these newer technologies.

### A head-to-head comparison of hydrogen peroxide vapor and aerosol room decontamination systems [^05baab5d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

New technologies have emerged in recent years for the disinfection of hospital rooms and equipment that may not be disinfected adequately using conventional methods. There are several hydrogen peroxide-based area decontamination technologies on the market, but no head-to-head studies have been performed.

Design

We conducted a head-to-head in vitro comparison of a hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) system (Bioquell) and an aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP) system (Sterinis).

Setting

The tests were conducted in a purpose-built 136-m(3) test room.

Methods

One HPV generator and 2 aHP machines were used, following recommendations of the manufacturers. Three repeated tests were performed for each system. The microbiological efficacy of the 2 systems was tested using 6-log Tyvek-pouched Geobacillus stearothermophilus biological indicators (BIs). The indicators were placed at 20 locations in the first test and 14 locations in the subsequent 2 tests for each system.

Results

All BIs were inactivated for the 3 HPV tests, compared with only 10% in the first aHP test and 79% in the other 2 aHP tests. The peak hydrogen peroxide concentration was 338 ppm for HPV and 160 ppm for aHP. The total cycle time (including aeration) was 3 and 3.5 hours for the 3 HPV tests and the 3 aHP tests, respectively. Monitoring around the perimeter of the enclosure with a handheld sensor during tests of both systems did not identify leakage.

Conclusion

One HPV generator was more effective than 2 aHP machines for the inactivation of G. stearothermophilus BIs, and cycle times were faster for the HPV system.

Hydrogen peroxide — microbicidal activity and effective concentrations/times: A 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide demonstrated bactericidal and virucidal activity in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal activity in 5 minutes, and organisms with high cellular catalase activity required 30–60 minutes of exposure to 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for a 108 reduction in cell counts whereas organisms with lower catalase activity required only 15 minutes' exposure. For spores, a complete kill of 10⁶ spores occurred with a 10% concentration and a 60-minute exposure time, while a 3% concentration for 150 minutes killed 10⁶ spores in six of seven exposure trials. A 10% hydrogen peroxide solution resulted in a 10³ decrease in B. atrophaeus spores and a ≥ 10⁵ decrease when tested against 31 other pathogens in 30 minutes at 20°C. A 3.0% hydrogen peroxide solution was ineffective against VRE after 3 and 10 minutes exposure times and caused only a 2-log₁₀ reduction in the number of Acanthamoeba cysts in approximately 2 hours. A 7% stabilized hydrogen peroxide proved to be sporicidal (6 hours of exposure), mycobactericidal (20 minutes), fungicidal (5 minutes) at full strength, virucidal (5 minutes) and bactericidal (3 minutes) at a 1:16 dilution, and the 7% solution was sporicidal (> 7 log10 reduction in 6 hours).

Coccidioidomycosis laboratory exposure — extensive exposures potentially involving the entire laboratory may require full decontamination of the sealed laboratory using paraformaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide fumes; heating paraformaldehyde (optimally at 60%–80% humidity) results in gaseous formaldehyde. With paraformaldehyde, 0.3 g per cubic foot of room air is recommended, and if formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde has been vaporized, the room should remain sealed for at least 3 hours and then ventilated for 24 hours before the staff returns.

### Reduction in reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria from elderly subjects with normal and impaired glucose tolerance [^238ebf30]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

FIG. 3.
Production of hydrogen peroxide by isolated muscle mitochondria. Mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production was measured during state 1 (no added substrates) and in the presence of respiratory substrates/inhibitors succinate plus rotenone (S/R), S/R plus antimycin A (S/R+AA), glutamate plus malate (G/M), G/M plus rotenone (G/M+R), pyruvate plus malate (P/M), and P/M plus rotenone (P/M+R) in (A) younger and older (NGT + IGT) subjects and (B) younger, older with NGT, and older with IGT subjects. Data are means ± SE. ✱ p < 0.05 vs. younger group.

FIG. 4.
Effect of exercise training on the production of hydrogen peroxide by isolated muscle mitochondria. Mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production was measured in isolated skeletal muscle during state 1 (no added substrates) and in the presence of respiratory substrates/inhibitors succinate plus rotenone (S/R), S/R plus antimycin A (S/R+AA), glutamate plus malate (G/M), G/M plus rotenone (G/M+R), pyruvate plus malate (P/M), and P/M plus rotenone (P/M+R) in (A) older (NGT + IGT) subjects before and after exercise, (B) older subjects with NGT before and after exercise, (C) older subjects with IGT before and after exercise, and (D) younger subjects before and after exercise. Data are means ± SE. ✱ p < 0.05 vs. before exercise of respective group.

We also calculated the ROS/ATP production ratio, which reflects the number of ROS molecules generated during the production of one ATP molecule. ROS/ATP ratio was similar between the younger and the older group.

Overall, exercise increased ATP and ROS production in younger and older subjects. Nonetheless, the effect was more pronounced in the older group. This difference could be the result of elevated rates of ATP and ROS production at baseline in the younger group, leaving less room for improvement after training.

Vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) sterilization — One delivery method uses a deep vacuum to pull liquid hydrogen peroxide (30–35% concentration) through a heated vaporizer into the sterilization chamber, and VHP offers rapid cycle time (e.g., 30–45 minutes), low temperature, and environmentally safe by-products (H2O, oxygen [O2]). Limitations include that cellulose cannot be processed, nylon becomes brittle, and penetration capabilities are less than those of ETO. VHP has not been cleared by FDA for sterilization of medical devices in healthcare facilities.

Hydrogen peroxide — antimicrobial efficacy and chemical sterilant formulations are detailed across concentrations and organisms: a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution inactivated rhinovirus in 6–8 minutes, with times increasing to 18–20 minutes at 1.5% and 50–60 minutes at 0.75%; concentrations from 6% to 25% show promise as chemical sterilants, and the marketed sterilant contains 7.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.85% phosphoric acid; at 7.5% it inactivated > 10⁵ multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis after a 10-minute exposure; thirty minutes were required for > 99.9% inactivation of poliovirus and HAV, whereas 3% and 6% hydrogen peroxide failed to inactivate HAV in 1 minute; in endoscope disinfection, 7.5% hydrogen peroxide at 10 minutes versus 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde at 20 minutes showed no significant difference in germicidal activity, though in one study 6% hydrogen peroxide (unused product was 7.5%) was more effective than 2% glutaraldehyde; a new, rapid-acting 13.4% hydrogen peroxide formulation (not yet FDA-cleared) is reported to sterilize in 30 minutes and provide high-level disinfection in 5 minutes, and synergistic sporicidal effects were observed when spores were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (5.9% — 23.6%) plus peracetic acid.

### GlyPerA ™ effectively shields airway epithelia from SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammatory events [^dffb4cf5]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

GlyPerA™ is a formulation consisting of active compounds hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and glycine. Hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2, is an established antiseptic that destroys bacteria, viruses and fungi. Since many decades it is used: for disinfection of material surfaces (e.g. of medical instruments or devices), for sterilization of water and raw materials for food production (e.g. diary products), as antimicrobial agent for vegetable/fruit skin treatment, for disinfection of wounds and as antimicrobial agent for sanitation of oral or outer ear cavities. Although being a GRAS (Generally regarded as safe) substance for the applications mentioned above, amounts used are strictly regulated because H 2 O 2 in high concentrations and frequent or long-term application damages cells. The major target of hydrogen peroxide in the eukaryotic cell is mitochondria. It was discovered that a naturally occurring small carboxylic acid, glycolic acid, can ameliorate harmful effects of paraquat, a strong oxidant that produces Reactive Oxygen Species (including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide), on mitochondria. More recently it was shown that this endogenous compound acts by entering serine/glycine metabolism. In this way, conversion of glycolate into glycine boosts cellular Glutathione-defence system and neutralizes damage induced by H 2 O 2 treatment. Thus, GlyPerA™ exploits the principle: high concentration of hydrogen peroxide destroys microbes (among them viruses) outside of cells, whereas glycine neutralizes adverse effects of the former within cells. This makes possible to use GlyPerA™ for longer periods of time and more frequently then pure H 2 O 2.

While tissue destruction with concomitant innate immune–complement C3 — activation and high release of viruses into the basolateral subnatant was detected upon infection of normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells with Omicron VOCs BA.1 and BA.2, tissue integrity was completely restored and local complement C3 production and virus release significantly down-modulated by single application of the GlyPerA™ solution. Since this solution cannot only be used orally, but also intranasally, our results point towards an easy-to-use prophylactic treatment using GlyPerA™ in order to prevent infection with highly contagious novel SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

Biological indicators — organisms, incubation, and monitoring frequency — are recognized by most authorities as closest to the ideal monitors of the sterilization process and are the only process indicators that directly monitor lethality. B. atrophaeus spores (10⁶) are used to monitor ETO and dry heat, and G. stearothermophilus spores (10⁵) are used to monitor steam sterilization, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid sterilizers; G. stearothermophilus is incubated at 55–60°C, and B. atrophaeus is incubated at 35–37°C. Steam and low temperature sterilizers should be monitored at least weekly with the appropriate commercial preparation of spores, and if a sterilizer is used frequently (e.g., several loads per day), daily use of biological indicators allows earlier discovery of equipment malfunctions or procedural errors.

### Topological transformation of microbial proteins into iron single-atom sites for selective hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis [^1a3e26fc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The emergence of single-atom catalysts offers exciting prospects for the green production of hydrogen peroxide; however, their optimal local structure and the underlying structure–activity relationships remain unclear. Here we show trace Fe, up to 278 mg/kg and derived from microbial protein, serve as precursors to synthesize a variety of Fe single-atom catalysts containing FeN 5− x O x (1 ≤ x ≤ 4) moieties through controlled pyrolysis. These moieties resemble the structural features of nonheme Fe-dependent enzymes while being effectively confined on a microbe-derived, electrically conductive carbon support, enabling high-current density electrolysis. A comparative analysis involving catalysts derived from eleven representative microbes reveals that the presence of 0.05 wt% Fe single-atom sites leads to a significant 26% increase in hydrogen peroxide selectivity. Remarkably, the optimal catalyst featuring FeN 3 O 2 sites demonstrates a selectivity of up to 93.7% and generates hydrogen peroxide in a flow cell at an impressive rate of 29.6 mol g −1 h −1 at 200 mA cm −2. This work achieves structural fine-tuning of metal single-atom sites at the trace level and provides topological insights into single-atom catalyst design to achieve cost-efficient hydrogen peroxide production.

### Reactive oxygen species affect the potential for mineralization processes in permeable intertidal flats [^fcde497a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

At steady state, the standing stock of hydrogen peroxide represents a balance between production and consumption processes. Injection of oxygenated seawater at 3 and 4 cm depth led to a transient peak of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Processes responsible for hydrogen peroxide in deeper, anoxic sediments may be related to cycling of dissolved Fe 2+, iron oxides, and pyrite –. The sediments were iron-rich, with concentrations of 9.7 ± 1.8 and 2.3 ± 0.6 µmol g −1 sed in surface sediments (0–2 cm depth) in May and July 2020, and 4.0 ± 0.3 µmol g −1 sed in deep sediment (10–14 cm depth) in July 2020 (Supplementary Table 1), and Fe 2+ was present in the porewater (Supplementary Fig. 3). Despite persistent hydrogen peroxide levels at some depths, the sediment had a high capacity to rapidly degrade hydrogen peroxide. Additions of hydrogen peroxide resulted in rapid consumption at 3 and 4 cm depth (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6b, c), as the transient peaks of hydrogen peroxide lasted for only less than a minute. Injections of hydrogen peroxide near an oxygen sensor at the same depths resulted in large transient oxygen peaks (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6d). The underlying mechanisms responsible for the hydrogen peroxide-induced burst in oxygen are currently unresolved, but may include rapid catalytic activity by catalase within and outside the cell. We conclude that the ROS concentration in these sediments is delicately balanced between production and consumption.

Transvaginal transducer disinfection agents and alternatives — manufacturer guidance and validation: Most ultrasound manufacturers recommend use of 2% glutaraldehyde for high-level disinfection of contaminated transvaginal transducers, but this has been questioned due to potential device damage and toxic effects on gametes and embryos. An alternative procedure includes cleaning, wiping with 70% alcohol or soaking for 2 minutes in 500 ppm chlorine, and rinsing with tap water and air drying; however, the effectiveness of this and other methods has not been validated. High-level disinfection with a product (e.g., hydrogen peroxide) that is not toxic to staff, patients, probes, and retrieved cells should be used until the effectiveness of alternative procedures is demonstrated, and other probes such as rectal, cryosurgical, and transesophageal devices also should be high-level disinfected between patients.

### Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks for photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide [^544b8c5f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Photocatalysis provides a sustainable and environment-friendly strategy to produce H 2 O 2, yet the catalytic efficiency of H 2 O 2 overall photosynthesis (O₂ + 2H₂O → 2H₂O₂) needs to be further improved, especially in the absence of additional cocatalysts, photosensitizers and sacrificial agents. Here we find that hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks can serve as photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 overall photosynthesis under the above-mentioned conditions. Specifically, we constructed a donor-acceptor hydrogen-bonded organic framework that exhibits a high photocatalytic activity for H 2 O 2 overall photosynthesis, with a production rate of 681.2 μmol g -1 h -1. The control experiments and theoretical calculation revealed that the hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks with donor-acceptor structures can not only accelerate the charge separation and transfer but also optimize the reaction pathways, which significantly boosts the photocatalytic efficiency in H 2 O 2 overall photosynthesis. This work provides insights into the design and development of efficient photocatalysts for overall H 2 O 2 photosynthesis.

### Efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide generation coupled with selective benzylamine oxidation over defective zrSnanobelts [^d92d5aaa]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Artificial photosynthesis, i.e. the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, is considered as one of the promising approaches to synthesize chemicals with the unlimited energy source and minimized environmental problems. As a promising liquid solar fuel generated by artificial photosynthesis, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) has attracted growing attention because of its high commercial value and low transportation cost. Substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of effective photocatalysts or photocathodes for the H 2 O 2 generation from water and O 2 –. In the photocatalytic process, the sluggish oxidation of water induced by the photogenerated valence holes is a limiting factor for the production of H 2 O 2 –. Most previous reports focused on improving the half-reaction of O 2 reduction, e.g. by consuming holes with sacrificial agents, such as isopropyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and 2-PrOH. However, the development of an alternative oxidation reaction with accelerated kinetics to produce value-added chemicals was rarely reported. On the other hand, selective oxidation of amines to nitriles with lower oxidation potential than water plays an vital role in both laboratorial and industrial synthetic process since nitriles are the important intermediates during the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals –. Intensive research has been carried out to synthesize nitriles from primary amines through dehydrogenation –. However, most of the reactions are conducted in organic solvents under harsh conditions, such as high-temperature, exposure to high-pressure oxygen or air, and presence of oxidants. Photocatalytic reactions have been demonstrated to be an effective approach to synthesize nitriles under mild conditions –, but previous works were seriously limited by the use of noble metals as the co-catalysts to realize the dehydrogenation in organic solvents. Thus, the development of artificial photosynthesis in an aqueous and easy scale-up condition with earth-abundant photocatalysts is highly desirable for the production of nitriles in an economically-viable and environment-friendly way.

Methods of sterilization — Steam is the preferred method for sterilizing critical medical and surgical instruments that are not damaged by heat, steam, pressure, or moisture (Category IA). Cool steam- or heat-sterilized items before they are handled or used in the operative setting (Category IB). Follow the sterilization times, temperatures, and other operating parameters (e.g., gas concentration, humidity) recommended by the manufacturers of the instruments, the sterilizer, and the container or wrap used, and that are consistent with guidelines published by government agencies and professional organizations (Category IB). Use low-temperature sterilization technologies (e.g. EtO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma) for reprocessing critical patient-care equipment that is heat or moisture sensitive (Category IA). Completely aerate surgical and medical items that have been sterilized in the EtO sterilizer (e.g., polyvinylchloride tubing requires 12 hours at 50° C, 8 hours at 60° C) before using these items in patient care (Category IB). Sterilization using the peracetic acid immersion system can be used to sterilize heat-sensitive immersible medical and surgical items (Category IB), and critical items that have been sterilized by the peracetic acid immersion process must be used immediately (Category II). Dry-heat sterilization (e.g., 340°F for 60 minutes) can be used to sterilize items (e.g., powders, oils) that can sustain high temperatures (Category IB). Comply with the sterilizer manufacturer's instructions regarding the sterilizer cycle parameters.

### Building and identifying highly active oxygenated groups in carbon materials for oxygen reduction to HO [^d95bf07f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Hydrogen peroxide is widely used as a green oxidant in disinfectants, bleaching agents, sanitizing agents, chemical synthesis, and even as a potential energy carrier –. According to a report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc. the global consumption of H 2 O 2 is projected to reach 6.0 million metric tons by 2024. Approximately 99% of all H 2 O 2 is currently produced using the multi-step anthraquinone process. However, this process is energy intensive, and can only be performed in a centralized factory. The inherent complexity of the anthraquinone process has driven many researchers to investigate one-step methods, which can continuously produce H 2 O 2 on-site at small scale using a simple device. Among these, the electrochemical synthesis approach is one of the best choices to meet the above demands.

Metal-free oxidized carbon materials have received particular attention for this application because they offer a simple synthetic procedure, cost-effectiveness, as well as high activity and selectivity –. They allow the incorporation of a variety of oxygen functional groups, with the potential to widely tune performance, and to optimize active sites. For example, Lu et al. recently used nitric acid to oxidize carbon nanotubes and demonstrated that the resulting oxidized carbon-material was highly active for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide (ORHP). They considered the active sites to be the carbon atoms adjacent to carboxylic acid and etheric groups (–COOH and C–O–C). Kim et al. used few-layer mildly reduced graphene oxide electrodes, by partially removing oxygen from graphene oxide using hydrothermal heating without a reducing agent, and showed that sp 2 -hybridized carbon near ring ethers along the sheet edges were the most active sites for ORHP.

### Boosting electrochemical oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide coupled with organic oxidation [^bce22f54]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is appealing due to its sustainability. However, its efficiency is compromised by the competing 4e - ORR pathway. In this work, we report a hierarchical carbon nanosheet array electrode with a single-atom Ni catalyst synthesized using organic molecule-intercalated layered double hydroxides as precursors. The electrode exhibits excellent 2e - ORR performance under alkaline conditions and achieves H 2 O 2 yield rates of 0.73mol g cat -1 h -1 in the H-cell and 5.48mol g cat -1 h -1 in the flow cell, outperforming most reported catalysts. The experimental results show that the Ni atoms selectively adsorb O 2, while carbon nanosheets generate reactive hydrogen species, synergistically enhancing H 2 O 2 production. Furthermore, a coupling reaction system integrating the 2e - ORR with ethylene glycol oxidation significantly enhances H 2 O 2 yield rate to 7.30mol g cat -1 h -1 while producing valuable glycolic acid. Moreover, we convert alkaline electrolyte containing H 2 O 2 directly into the downstream product sodium perborate to reduce the separation cost further. Techno-economic analysis validates the economic viability of this system.

### Sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production over octonary high-entropy oxide [^0f6430d3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Nature photosynthesis process within green plants converts sunlight energy directly into chemical energy. For decades, the use of artificial photocatalytic systems to achieve photosynthetic production of fuels and high-value chemicals has long been explored for research into, for instance, the photocatalytic water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen fixation to ammonia –. In more recent years, there has been increasing interest in studies of the artificial photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide from water and oxygen. H 2 O 2 is an important green chemical oxidizer with widespread applications both in large-scale industrial processes, such as chemical synthesis and environmental remediation, as well as in small-scale on-site use including household disinfection. However, the industrial production of H 2 O 2 relies heavily on the costly anthraquinone process that suffers from high energy consumption and substantial toxic by-products. From a sustainability perspective, the solar-driven photosynthetic process provides a blueprint towards the renewable and sustainable production of H 2 O 2 especially for fulfilling on-site use, but unfortunately, the realization of such a process is still hindered by its limited efficiency. Currently, a key challenge in this regard has been the quest for innovative high-performance photocatalytic materials that can efficiently absorb and transform light into photoexcited charge carriers for driving the catalytic chemical conversion of H 2 O and/or O 2 into H 2 O 2 at sufficiently high efficiencies.

Endoscope reprocessing — FDA-cleared high-level disinfectants and practice notes include that at this time, the FDA-cleared and marketed formulations include: 22.4% glutaraldehyde, 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), 0.95% glutaraldehyde with 1.64% phenol/phenate, 7.35% hydrogen peroxide with 0.23% peracetic acid, 1.0% hydrogen peroxide with 0.08% peracetic acid, and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide. EtO sterilization of flexible endoscopes is infrequently needed because it requires a lengthy processing and aeration time (e.g., 12 hours) and is a potential hazard, and the two products most commonly used in the United States are glutaraldehyde and an automated, liquid chemical sterilization process that uses peracetic acid. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommends glutaraldehyde solutions that do not contain surfactants because residues are difficult to remove during rinsing, and ortho-phthalaldehydes have begun to replace glutaraldehyde in many facilities due to several potential advantages and a 12-minute high-level disinfection claim in the United States. Although these products have excellent antimicrobial activity, some oxidizing chemicals (e.g., 7.5% hydrogen peroxide and 1.0% hydrogen peroxide with 0.08% peracetic acid) reportedly have caused cosmetic and functional damage to endoscopes.

### Hydrogen peroxide signaling via its transformation to a stereospecific alkyl hydroperoxide that escapes reductive inactivation [^66893eac]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

During systemic inflammation, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) becomes expressed in endothelial cells where it uses hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) to oxidize L-tryptophan to the tricyclic hydroperoxide, cis -WOOH, that then relaxes arteries via oxidation of protein kinase G 1α. Here we show that arterial glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins that rapidly eliminate H 2 O 2, have little impact on relaxation of IDO1-expressing arteries, and that purified IDO1 forms cis -WOOH in the presence of peroxiredoxin 2. cis -WOOH oxidizes protein thiols in a selective and stereospecific manner. Compared with its epimer trans -WOOH and H 2 O 2, cis -WOOH reacts slower with the major arterial forms of glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins while it reacts more readily with its target, protein kinase G 1α. Our results indicate a paradigm of redox signaling by H 2 O 2 via its enzymatic conversion to an amino acid-derived hydroperoxide that 'escapes' effective reductive inactivation to engage in selective oxidative activation of key target proteins.

When chemicals are used to destroy all forms of microbiologic life they can be called chemical sterilants, and the same germicides used for shorter exposure periods also can be part of the disinfection process (i.e., high-level disinfection). Disinfection describes a process that eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms, except bacterial spores, on inanimate objects, and in health-care settings objects usually are disinfected by liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization.

### Origin and use of hydrogen peroxide in neurosurgery [^c91206eb]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a chemical with a wide range of applications. This includes its use in the medical field, in which its use has been ubiquitous but is most useful as an antiseptic and in achieving hemostasis. Neurosurgeons have been using H2O2 for well over a century, primarily for its hemostatic and antiseptic effects. This is in spite of the fact that the actual effectiveness of H2O2 as an antiseptic is questionable, and its use, in general, may be more dangerous than it appears. We review the application of H2O2 in medicine generally and, more specifically, in neurosurgery. This review outlines the reasoning behind the use of H2O2 as an antiseptic and details why it may not be as effective as one might think. We also detail its use as a hemostatic agent in neurosurgery, reviewing a number of techniques in which it has been useful in this role. Finally, we review the documented cases of complications associated with the use of H2O2 in neurosurgery. Ultimately, we conclude that the use of H2O2 in neurosurgery be reconsidered because of its lack of effectiveness as an antiseptic and potentially fatal complications.

For long or narrow lumens outside the United States, a diffusion enhancer — a small, breakable glass ampoule of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (50%) — is inserted into the device lumen and crushed immediately before sterilization; it has been shown to sterilize bronchoscopes contaminated with Mycobacteria tuberculosis, but at the present time, the diffusion enhancer is not FDA cleared. Another gas plasma system using peracetic acid-acetic acid- hydrogen peroxide vapor was removed from the marketplace because of reports of corneal destruction to patients, with degradation of the brass to copper and zinc and corneal decompensation documented; this toxicity is highly unlikely with the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma process. Mode of action states the process inactivates microorganisms primarily by the combined use of hydrogen peroxide gas and the generation of free radicals (hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl free radicals) during the plasma phase. Microbicidal activity notes the ability to inactivate a broad range of microorganisms, including resistant bacterial spores, with studies against vegetative bacteria (including mycobacteria), yeasts, fungi, viruses, and bacterial spores, and effectiveness can be altered by lumen length, lumen diameter, inorganic salts, and organic materials. Uses include materials and devices that cannot tolerate high temperatures and humidity (e.g., some plastics, electrical devices, corrosion-susceptible metal alloys), and this method has been compatible with most (> 95%) medical devices and materials tested.

### Crystal OH mediating pathway for hydrogen peroxide production via two-electron water oxidation in non-carbonate electrolytes [^30128053]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Hydrogen peroxide is a green energy substance that has garnered attention in various fields, including chemical manufacturing, biological and medical engineering, energy technology, and environmental remediation –. The traditional method of synthesizing H 2 O 2 poses safety risks and requires large-scale infrastructure, resulting in energy waste and the need for H 2 O 2 purification. In-situ production of hydrogen peroxide, particularly through electrocatalytic methods, is a promising alternative due to its safe operation, ambient reaction conditions, on-demand production, and availability of inexpensive raw materials.

Electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide can be achieved by two kinds of pathways: two-electron cathode oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) and two-electron anodic water oxidation reaction (2e − WOR). 2e − ORR pathway has been widely studied –. However, this method requires oxygen as a raw material, and a pumping device is unavoidably required during the entire reaction process because of the low solubility (~8 mg L⁻¹ at 25 °C, 1 atm) and slow diffusion (2.1×10⁻⁵ cm⁻² s⁻¹) of oxygen in the water, leading to high energy consumption and low oxygen utilization efficiency (< 1%). By contrast, 2e − WOR does not require oxygen gas and is not limited by low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen gas, making this method suitable in an oxygen-deficient environment. Moreover, the green energy of hydrogen (H 2) can be obtained simultaneously in the water electro-decomposition process (Eq. (1)).

At present, the most frequently used electrolyte in H 2 O 2 electro-synthesis through 2e- WOR are KHCO 3 solution and K 2 CO 3 –. Gill et al. reported the role of bicarbonate-based electrolytes in the production of hydrogen peroxide through water oxidation. Specifically, HCO 3 − is oxidized to HCO 4 − or C 2 O 6 2− intermediates at the anode, and these intermediates oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide and then change back to HCO 3 − simultaneously. Nadar et al. found that BiVO 4 with different index planes has different water oxidation performance to produce hydrogen peroxide. BiVO 4 with high-index planes is more favorable for the adsorption of HCO 3 − and thus favors the following synthesis of hydrogen peroxide. Hence, bicarbonate is beneficial to H 2 O 2 generation.

### Protein kinase CK1alphaLS promotes vascular cell proliferation and intimal hyperplasia [^0dfb8b50]. The American Journal of Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Protein kinase CK1alpha regulates several fundamental cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation. Up to four forms of this kinase are expressed in vertebrates resulting from alternative splicing of exons; these exons encode either the L-insert located within the catalytic domain or the S-insert located at the C terminus of the protein. Whereas the L-insert is known to target the kinase to the nucleus, the functional significance of nuclear CK1alphaLS has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that selective L-insert-targeted short hairpin small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CK1alphaLS in human vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells impairs proliferation and abolishes hydrogen peroxide-stimulated proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, with the cells accumulating in G(0)/G(1). In addition, selective knockdown of CK1alphaLS in cultured human arteries inhibits vascular activation, preventing smooth muscle cell proliferation, intimal hyperplasia, and proteoglycan deposition. Knockdown of CK1alphaLS results in the harmonious down-regulation of its target substrate heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C and results in the altered expression or alternative splicing of key genes involved in cellular activation including CXCR4, MMP3, CSF2, and SMURF1. Our results indicate that the nuclear form of CK1alpha in humans, CK1alphaLS, plays a critical role in vascular cell proliferation, cellular activation, and hydrogen peroxide-mediated mitogenic signal transduction.

### Enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide generation by tuning hydrazone linkage density in covalent organic frameworks [^23d09a85]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The conversion of solar energy into chemical energy or high-value chemicals has attracted considerable research interest in the context of the global energy crisis. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is a versatile and powerful oxidizing agent widely used in chemical synthesis and medical disinfection. H 2 O 2 also serves as a clean energy source in fuel cells, generating electricity with zero-carbon emissions. Recently, the sustainable production of H 2 O 2 from water and oxygen using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as photocatalysts has attracted considerable attention; however, systematic studies highlighting the role of linkages in determining photocatalytic performance are scarce. Under these circumstances, herein, we demonstrate that varying the imine and hydrazone linkages within the framework significantly influences photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production. COFs with high-density hydrazone linkages, providing optimal docking sites for water and oxygen, enhance H 2 O 2 generation activity (1588 μmol g −1 h −1 from pure water in the air), leading to highly efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion.

Reactive oxygen species are not only harmful agents that cause oxidative damage in pathologies, they also have important roles as regulatory agents in a range of biological phenomena. The relatively recent development of this more nuanced view presents a challenge to the biomedical research community on how best to assess the significance of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage in biological systems. Considerable progress is being made in addressing these issues, and here we survey some recent developments for those contemplating research in this area.

Hydrogen peroxide detection and quantification

Hydrogen peroxide production was evaluated using an assay adapted from a previous studyoriginally designed for LPMOs. To measure the hydrogen peroxide production rate in the absence of a polysaccharide substrate, 1 µM CelOCE was mixed with 50 µM Amplex Red reagent (Invitrogen) and 5 U mL –1 horseradish peroxidase type II (HRP, Sigma Aldrich), in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, in a 96-well microplate and incubated at 37 °C in a spectrophotometer. After 2 min, 1 mM ASC (Sigma Aldrich) was added to initiate the reaction. Absorbance at 563 nm was measured every 5 min for a total of 30 min. To measure the change in hydrogen peroxide production in the presence of increasing concentrations of polysaccharide, 1 µM enzyme (wild-type CelOCE, CelOCE(Δ2–5) or Tt AA9J) was mixed with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 and 0–100 g l –1 Avicel. Then, 1 mM ASC was added to initiate the reaction (final volume of 200 µl in 2 mL tubes). Incubation was performed in a ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf) at 37 °C and 850 rpm for 16 h (wild-type and mutant CelOCE enzymes) or 2 h (Tt AA9J). After incubation, the reaction tubes were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min to separate the substrate. Then, 50 µl of the supernatant was added to 50 µl of a mix containing Amplex Red, HRP and sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, and measured as in the previous assay. Hydrogen peroxide produced during the reactions was quantified using a standard curve. Each assay consisted of at least three independent experiments.

### Thiopental impairs neutrophil oxidative response by inhibition of intracellular signalling [^f2788aa1]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Thiopental in clinically relevant concentrations inhibits the oxidative function of neutrophils, whereas only very high, non-therapeutic concentrations of methohexital induce a similar effect. The study characterized the molecular basis of this differential action of oxy- and thiobarbiturates on neutrophils.

Methods

Neutrophils were incubated in vitro with thiopental or methohexital using concentrations within the therapeutic range. Neutrophil responses were induced using different stimuli: N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP), C5a and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8-DAG). FMLP and C5a bind to specific G-protein-coupled receptors that share the same second messenger cascade. In contrast, DiC8-DAG, an activator of protein kinase C, bypasses the signal transduction pathway downstream of the receptors. Hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils was assessed using flow cytometry. To characterize the localization of the interaction site, FMLP receptor expression and cytosolic-free calcium were further analysed.

Results

FMLP and C5a-induced hydrogen peroxide production were both significantly impaired by thiopental, but not by methohexital. When postreceptor signalling was bypassed, by stimulation with DiC8-DAG, neither thiopental nor methohexital affected hydrogen peroxide production. Additionally, neither of the barbiturates impaired the cytosolic Ca2+ response.

Conclusions

We conclude that neither protein kinase C nor the hydrogen peroxide-generating enzymes are affected by thiopental or methohexital. The unimpaired Ca2+ response suggests that the function of the receptors and G-proteins were also unimpaired. Taken together, this indicates that the site of action of thiopental is in the cellular signalling upstream of protein kinase C.

### Atomically dispersed asymmetric cobalt electrocatalyst for efficient hydrogen peroxide production in neutral media [^6f596214]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) production (EHPP) via a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e - ORR) provides a promising alternative to replace the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. M-N-C electrocatalysts, which consist of atomically dispersed transition metals and nitrogen-doped carbon, have demonstrated considerable EHPP efficiency. However, their full potential, particularly regarding the correlation between structural configurations and performances in neutral media, remains underexplored. Herein, a series of ultralow metal-loading M-N-C electrocatalysts are synthesized and investigated for the EHPP process in the neutral electrolyte. CoNCB material with the asymmetric Co-C/N/O configuration exhibits the highest EHPP activity and selectivity among various as-prepared M-N-C electrocatalyst, with an outstanding mass activity (6.1×10 5 A g Co -1 at 0.5V vs. RHE), and a high practical H 2 O 2 production rate (4.72mol g catalyst -1 h -1 cm -2). Compared with the popularly recognized square-planar symmetric Co-N 4 configuration, the superiority of asymmetric Co-C/N/O configurations is elucidated by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy analysis and computational studies.

### The reaction of methyl peroxy and hydroxyl radicals as a major source of atmospheric methanol [^b90a58fa]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Modelled global impact

Adopting the measured rateof CH 3 O 2 +OH, the reaction accounts for 20% of the global CH 3 O 2 sink according to IMAGES simulations. The global flux through that reaction is considerable: ∼11 Tmoles per year, comparable to, for example, the global source of isoprene. Although it is only a minor sink (∼10%) of CH 3 O 2 at high latitudes and over polluted continental regions (Fig. 3) where the reaction with NO is by far the largest sink (Supplementary Fig. 5), the reaction with OH represents 20–30% of the sink over tropical oceans and deserts, where CH 3 O 2 +HO 2 is however still dominant (30–50% of total sink).

Table 4 summarizes the model simulations. The best theoretical estimates are used in run B, while runs C and D adopt yields approaching respectively the high end and low end of the estimated uncertainty range of both the direct CH 3 OH yield and the TRIOX stabilization fraction. Relative to a simulation neglecting the title reaction, the HO 2 radical abundances are increased by 10–20% over tropical oceans (Supplementary Fig. 6). Unsurprisingly, the impact is highest when the HO 2 yield is highest (run D). The changes are negligible or even negative in high-NOx areas.

The changes in OH are of opposite sign to those of HO 2, reaching up to −7% over remote oceans. Loss of OH due to reaction with CH 3 O 2 and the products CH 3 OOH and CH 3 OH is partially offset by OH recycled from enhanced HO 2. The globally averaged OH concentration decreases by 1.5–3.2% depending on the simulation, increasing the methane lifetime by up to 0.3 years in run C. The largest OH changes are calculated in run C, due to its lower HO 2 yield and higher OH loss through reaction with CH 3 OOOH and CH 3 OH. Surface ozone is decreased due to the CH 3 O 2 +OH reaction, by up to 6% over remote oceans, and by 1–2% (< 1 ppbv) over Europe, North America and East Asia in July (Supplementary Fig. 7). Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is strongly impacted, owing to the quadratic dependence of its production on HO 2 levels. Its concentrations increase by up to 30% in run C (Fig. 4) and ∼50% in runs B and D.

Peracetic acid–hydrogen peroxide disinfectants — use patterns, microbicidal activity, and device compatibility are described as follows: The combination has been used for disinfecting hemodialyzers, and the percentage of dialysis centers using a peracetic acid–hydrogen peroxide disinfectant increased from 5% in 1983 to 56% in 1997. In testing, peroxide inactivated all microorganisms except bacterial spores within 20 minutes, and a 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide product effectively inactivated glutaraldehyde-resistant mycobacteria. Olympus America does not endorse use of 0.08% peracetic acid plus 1.0% hydrogen peroxide on any Olympus endoscope because of cosmetic and functional damage; this product is not currently available. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared a newer chemical sterilant with 0.23% peracetic acid and 7.35% hydrogen peroxide, after testing the 7.35% hydrogen peroxide and 0.23% peracetic acid product Olympus America concluded it was not compatible with the company's flexible gastrointestinal endoscopes based on immersion studies showing failure of test insertion tubes due to swelling and loosening of the black polymer layer.

### The complex transcriptional response ofto different oxygen levels [^68b3a069]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Photosynthesis uses solar energy, and transforms it into chemical energy, which is stored within the organic molecules of the organism. In essence, it provides the energy for all life on our planet. During oxygenic photosynthesis, sunlight is funneled toward a special pair of chlorophyll molecules, which produce a charge separation that results in the extraction of electrons from water. This initiates a chain of redox reactions that power the fixation of inorganic carbon into 3-phosphoglycerate, with oxygen (O 2) generated as a side product of this reaction. In fact, before photosynthesis occurred in ancient cyanobacteria around 3.5–2.4 billion yr ago, the atmosphere was largely anaerobic. Over billions of years, oxygenic photosynthetic organisms changed the Earth's atmosphere, steadily increasing its O 2 levels to over 21% (v/v). This permitted the rise of multicellular organisms, dependent upon aerobic respiration.

Aerobic respiration is highly efficient in recovering the energy contained within the chemical bonds of organic molecules through oxidative phosphorylation. However, organisms living in aerobic environments also run the risk of being damaged by oxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS include a number of reactive molecules derived from O 2. Clearly, O 2 in its ground state is harmless, as it has two unpaired electrons with parallel spin, making it paramagnetic. In this form, it is unlikely to participate in reactions with organic molecules, unless it is enzymatically or chemically activated by other reactions. However, oxygen-derived ROS comprise superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, which are a threat to the cell. Organisms mitigate ROS deleterious effects in various ways: by scavenging pathways, by changing the regulation of affected genes, by separating the location of their product to oxygen-free compartments like heterocysts, or by evolving an alternative pathway resistant to oxidation. Many metabolic pathways functioning today still contain enzymes sensitive to O 2 levels, as illustrated by the coexisting oxygen-dependent, or oxygen-independent, reactions within the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, and the activation of a counterpart D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) in response to changed O 2 levels.

### Shape-programmed 3D printed swimming microtori for the transport of passive and active agents [^5f7ed458]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We extracted the printed particles via pipetting and then dropcast the colloidal solution onto a gold-coated glass slide. In water, the tori exhibit pure Brownian diffusion. However, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the 7 μm glazed and dipped tori consumed the fuel and directionally translated across the surface (Fig. 2 a) (See Supplementary videos 1, 2). The slight decrease in velocity from glazed to dipped is the result of a decrease in the catalytic surface area on the torus. The propulsion velocity of the tori scales linearly with the concentration (v/v%) of hydrogen peroxide up to 10% and then saturates from 10 to 30% (Fig. 1 b). In 30% hydrogen peroxide, the glazed and dipped tori swam with the speed7 μm s(Fig. 1 b).

Fig. 2
Swimming trajectories. a Extracted and re-centered trajectories for linearly translating dipped and glazed Janus tori. b Trajectories of vertically oriented tori in an increasing magnetic field. The trajectories change continuously from cyclodial to linear. Blue trajectories are for 0.8 G; green trajectories are for 0.9 G; and red trajectories are for 1.0 G

Additionally, the deposition of a magnetic nickel binding layer (between the polymer and platinum) allowed us to alter the orientation of the swimming tori with a magnetic field varying between 0.8 and 1.0 G. In the presence of a magnetic field, the tori reoriented their axes to be perpendicular (90°) to the substrate. For a weaker magnetic field0.8 G, their trajectories are cycloidal (Fig. 2b) (Supplementary Video 3). As the strength of the field increased to1.0 G, the vertically-oriented tori rapidly altered their trajectories to be linear (Fig. 2b). We observed swimming trajectories in all directions, ruling out the migration in the magnetic field gradient.

### Keto-anthraquinone covalent organic framework for HOphotosynthesis with oxygen and alkaline water [^fb32b621]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide photosynthesis suffers from insufficient catalytic activity due to the high energy barrier of hydrogen extraction from H 2 O. Herein, we report that mechanochemically synthesized keto-form anthraquinone covalent organic framework which is able to directly synthesize H 2 O 2 (4784 μmol h -1 g -1 at λ > 400nm) from oxygen and alkaline water (pH = 13) in the absence of any sacrificial reagents. The strong alkalinity resulted in the formation of OH - (H 2 O) n clusters in water, which were adsorbed on keto moieties within the framework and then dissociated into O 2 and active hydrogen, because the energy barrier of hydrogen extraction was largely lowered. The produced hydrogen reacted with anthraquinone to generate anthrahydroquinone, which was subsequently oxidized by O 2 to produce H 2 O 2. This study ultimately sheds light on the importance of hydrogen extraction from H 2 O for H 2 O 2 photosynthesis and demonstrates that H 2 O 2 synthesis is achievable under alkaline conditions.

### Self-cycled photo-fenton-like system based on an artificial leaf with a solar-to-HOconversion efficiency of 1.46 [^8bac4288]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are a recognized approach that can effectively treat various organic pollutions in aqueous solutions because the generated reactive oxygen species (ROSs) have strong oxidation capabilities for mineralizing the organic molecules. Fenton reaction is one of the most representative AOPs which can rapidly generate hydroxyl radicals (·OH) with high concentration, therefore being widely adopted in wastewater treatment engineering. However, the Fenton reaction is an irreversible process that needs the continuous supply of various chemical reagents, such as H 2 O 2, iron salt, acid/alkali et al. which increases the costs of the whole wastewater treatment process by more than one time. Heterogeneous photocatalysis over semiconductors can generate a range of ROSs by photoinduced redox processes, which are regarded as green and sustainable AOPs with affordable cost. In the past several decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to photocatalytic degradation of organic pollution by developing or designing various photocatalysts and photocatalytic systems. However, directly generating ROSs by photoinduced redox processes in aqueous solutions are profoundly restricted by rapid recombination of photoinduced electron/hole pairs, and high thermodynamic barriers of radical generation (e.g. ·O 2 − at −0.33 V and ·OH at 1.99 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), while combined photocatalysis with Fenton reaction, so-called photo-Fenton reaction, also requires the supply of H 2 O 2. Therefore, there is a great necessity to find indeed efficient, low-cost, and sustainable AOPs.

In recent years, it is found that bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) can not only react with H 2 O 2 to form HCO 4 − with high reactivity but also act as an auxiliary for water-oxidative H 2 O 2 evolution under photoelectrochemical (PEC) condition, through a reversible reaction as follows,:

The above reversible reaction offers a possibility of an in situ generation and decomposition of H 2 O 2 in an aqueous solution containing HCO 3 − under solar light illumination –. In addition, the co-existence of HCO 4 − and H 2 O 2 was reported to facilitate the formation of various ROSs (·O 2 −, ·OH, CO 3
- − et al.) by Co, Cu or Mn ion activation –. The correlation between HCO 3 −, H 2 O 2, HCO 4 − and free radical species inspire us to design a self-cycled AOPs system with high efficiency and affordable cost –.

### Proteome-wide analysis of cysteine oxidation reveals metabolic sensitivity to redox stress [^bf70ad63]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide quantification

Phenylboronate (C 6 H 7 BO 2, Sigma 78181) was used as a probe to detect and quantify hydrogen peroxide, developed based on the methodology described in. In alkaline conditions, the nucleophilic peroxide attacks the boronic acid and forms a negatively charged tetrahedral boronate intermediate. The weak C–B bond undergoes a 1,2-insertion, which makes the C-bond migrate to the peroxide oxygen atoms. The newly formed borate ester is quickly hydrolysed by water to phenol. Briefly, reaction solution was prepared by diluting phenylboronate (stock solution 60 mM in EtOH) to 1 mM using TBS-T (pH 11 for experimental samples and positive control, pH 7.5 for negative control). To detect hydrogen peroxide in media, 30 µl of medium was added to 200 µl of reaction solution. As a positive control, 30 µl of 500 µM hydrogen peroxide in water was added to 200 µl of reaction solution. Additionally a standard curve was generated for quantification purposes using various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. As a negative control, 30 µl of 500 µM hydrogen peroxide was added to 20 µl of 0.2 mg/ml catalase (Sigma) in PBS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, before adding to reaction solution. All samples were vortexed for 2 s and incubated at 80 °C for 7 min, before 400 µl of LC-MS extraction solution (5:3:2 methanol:acetonitrile:H 2 O) was added. Samples were incubated in a shaker at max speed for 10 min at room temperature before centrifuging at 16,000 g for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred to glass vials and stored at −80 °C until LC-MS analysis. Phenol (C 6 H 6 O) generated by the reaction between phenylboronate and hydrogen peroxide was detected using LC-MS as described below.

Cell proliferation assay

Hydrogen peroxide was spiked into the medium at indicated concentrations. After 15 min, residual hydrogen peroxide was removed by aspirating and replenishing the medium. Cell proliferation was monitored by counting live cells at indicated time points.

### Hydrogen peroxide signaling via its transformation to a stereospecific alkyl hydroperoxide that escapes reductive inactivation [^fff08673]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Research on redox signaling involving 2-electron reactions commonly focuses on H 2 O 2 as the oxidant messenger. At present, four models have been proposed to explain H 2 O 2 -mediated redox signaling: the "floodgate" hypothesis, transient inactivation, redox relay, and direct activation model. In the floodgate hypothesis, high concentrations of H 2 O 2 are proposed to hyperoxidize reducing enzymes, mainly peroxiredoxins (Prxs), leading to a temporary local inactivation of the peroxidases and buildup of H 2 O 2 to concentrations sufficient to oxidize a Cys residue in a particular signaling protein –. Similarly, the transient inactivation model hypothesizes a transient inactivation of Prx via phosphorylation. The redox relay model proposes Prx to initially react with H 2 O 2 and oxidized Prx to then transmit the oxidizing equivalents to the signaling protein via formation of a heterodimeric protein disulfide complex. Last, the direct activation model assumes H 2 O 2 to react faster with its target signaling protein than Prx and glutathione peroxidases (GPx). A significant challenge for all models, especially the direct oxidation model is the fact that H 2 O 2 itself is a strong, but kinetically-hindered oxidant, and the rate of its reaction with target protein thiol groups is kinetically too slow (~10 1 M −1 s −1) to outcompete scavenging of H 2 O 2 by Prx and GPx, except perhaps in redox stress conditions.

Introduction

Chemical reactions at gas/water interfaces can be dramatically accelerated relative to the same processes that occurred in the gas phase or bulk water. This intriguing phenomenon is known as "on-water catalysis". Indeed, spraying bulk water into microdroplets brings about an aqueous interface-rich system ("droplets-in-gas" in Fig. 1a), where the chemical reaction has been accelerated by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude, owing to the mass accumulation, high electric field (~10 9 V/m) – and the resultant presence of highly reactive redox species(i.e. H 2 O
- + /H 2 O
- – and their derivatives). Since the intriguing finding of spontaneous generation of hydrogen peroxide from aqueous microdroplets, the interfacial reactivity of water microdroplets inspires the exploitation of chemical conversion reactions by efficiently utilizing the redox radical species derived from water. The redox condition performing like an electrochemical cell can be produced in situ via spraying mass spectrometry such as ammonia synthesis from nitrogen, urea synthesis from carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and methane oxidation to methane oxygenates –.

It is acknowledged that gas feeds through the porous membrane of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) can also create gas/water interfaces –, where the transports of electrons, ions, and gas reactants can be substantially improved, leading to enhanced reaction rates. For example, a gateway for ion transport between oxygen bubble surfaces and supporting solids was reported recently. Besides, gas cavities adhering to an electrode surface can initiate the oxidation of water-soluble species more effectively relative to the electrode areas free of bubbles. Despite these advances –, the microenvironment at the GDE interface remains elusive and requires further in-depth exploitation.

### Hydrogen peroxide serves as pivotal fountainhead for aerosol aqueous sulfate formation from a global perspective [^57dbdd59]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Traditional atmospheric chemistry posits that sulfur dioxide (SO 2) can be oxidized to sulfate (SO 4 2-) through aqueous-phase reactions in clouds and gas-phase oxidation. Despite adequate knowledge of traditional mechanisms, several studies have highlighted the potential for SO 2 oxidation within aerosol water. Given the widespread presence of tropospheric aerosols, SO 4 2- production through aqueous-phase oxidation in aerosol water could have a pervasive global impact. Here, we quantify the potential contributions of aerosol aqueous pathways to global sulfate formation based on the GEOS-Chem simulations and subsequent theoretical calculations. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) oxidation significantly influences continental regions both horizontally and vertically. Over the past two decades, shifts in the formation pathways within typical cities reveal an intriguing trend: despite reductions in SO 2 emissions, the increased atmospheric oxidation capacities, like rising H 2 O 2 levels, prevent a steady decline in SO 4 2- concentrations. Abating oxidants would facilitate the benefit of SO 2 reduction and the positive feedback in sulfate mitigation.

### Carbonate-carbonate coupling on platinum surface promotes electrochemical water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide [^e775ce75]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

H 2 O 2 generation at the anode is accomplished through the unconventional two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e − -WOR), which differs from traditional O 2 evolution reactions. This method is challenging, considering the thermodynamic favorability of the O 2 evolution reaction (Eqs. (1) and (2)).

Most studies on the two-electron water oxidation reaction focused on developing effective catalytic materials to enhance the selectivity of water oxidation towards hydrogen peroxide –. While the electrocatalyst plays a crucial role, the choice of the aqueous supporting electrolyte is equally significant as it can impact both the production and stability of H 2 O 2 –. Recent research exhibited that H 2 O 2 production rates increased in carbonate (CO 3 2−) electrolytes, i.e. Na 2 CO 3 solution, K 2 CO 3 /KHCO 3 mixtures, and other carbonate-based electrolytes. In carbonate solutions, using a platinum (Pt) electrode for water oxidation to produce H 2 O 2 can achieve a Faradaic efficiency reaching about 80% at a current density > 100 mA cm −2. Despite these progresses, there is significant controversy surrounding the anodic 2e − -water oxidation reaction mechanism for hydrogen peroxide production in carbonate solutions. Many research groups believe that this reaction proceeded through a key intermediate OH (ads) adsorbed at the surface. OH (ads) is a crucial intermediate in both ORR and OER processes, and two OH (ads) easily combine to produce H 2 O 2 (Eqs. (3) and (4)), denoted as Route 1)

Route 1:

Following this concept, researchers have focused on exploring catalysts that demonstrate reduced binding strengths with intermediate oxygen species in comparison to the OER. Some researchers also propose that the 2e − –water oxidation involves the coupling at the electrode surface between OH (ads) with CO 3 2− to establish an O−O bond (Eqs. (5)–(9)), ultimately leading to the production of peroxide species (Eq. (10)), which is denoted as Route 2 here.

Route 2:

or

Besides Routes 1 and 2, two CO 3
- − species might couple to form a C 2 O 6 2− intermediate with an O−O bond (Eq. (11)), producing H 2 O 2 eventually (Eq. (12), denoted as Route 3).

### DNA-SWCNT biosensors allow real-time monitoring of therapeutic responses in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^2952999b]. Cancer Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly desmoplastic cancer with limited treatment options. There is an urgent need for tools that monitor therapeutic responses in real time. Drugs such as gemcitabine and irinotecan elicit their therapeutic effect in cancer cells by producing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). In this study, specific DNA-wrapped single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), which precisely monitor H 2 O 2, were used to determine the therapeutic response of PDAC cells in vitro and tumors in vivo. Drug therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vitro by monitoring H 2 O 2 differences in situ using reversible alteration of Raman G-bands from the nanotubes. Implantation of the DNA-SWCNT probe inside the PDAC tumor resulted in approximately 50% reduction of Raman G-band intensity when treated with gemcitabine versus the pretreated tumor; the Raman G-band intensity reversed to its pretreatment level upon treatment withdrawal. In summary, using highly specific and sensitive DNA-SWCNT nanosensors, which can determine dynamic alteration of hydrogen peroxide in tumor, can evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: A novel biosensor is used to detect intratumoral hydrogen peroxide, allowing real-time monitoring of responses to chemotherapeutic drugs.

### Gold peroxide complexes and the conversion of hydroperoxides into gold hydrides by successive oxygen-transfer reactions [^7957b886]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Gold catalysts are widely studied in chemical and electrochemical oxidation processes. Computational modelling has suggested the participation of Au-OO-Au, Au-OOH or Au-OH surface species, attached to gold in various oxidation states. However, no structural information was available as isolable gold peroxo and hydroperoxo compounds were unknown. Here we report the syntheses, structures and reactions of a series of gold(III) peroxides, hydroperoxides and alkylperoxides. The Au-O bond energy in peroxides is weaker than in oxides and hydroxides; however, the Au-OH bond is also weaker than Au-H. Consequently Au-OH compounds are capable of oxygen-transfer generating gold hydrides, a key reaction in a water splitting cycle and an example that gold can react in a way that other metals cannot. For the first time it has become possible to establish a direct connection from peroxides to hydrides: Au-OO-Au→Au-OOH→Au-OH→Au-H, via successive oxygen-transfer events.

### Highly selective oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide on transition metal single atom coordination [^9abd8785]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Shifting electrochemical oxygen reduction towards 2e – pathway to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), instead of the traditional 4e – to water, becomes increasingly important as a green method for H 2 O 2 generation. Here, through a flexible control of oxygen reduction pathways on different transition metal single atom coordination in carbon nanotube, we discovered Fe-C-O as an efficient H 2 O 2 catalyst, with an unprecedented onset of 0.822 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M KOH to deliver 0.1 mA cm −2 H 2 O 2 current, and a high H 2 O 2 selectivity of above 95% in both alkaline and neutral pH. A wide range tuning of 2e – /4e – ORR pathways was achieved via different metal centers or neighboring metalloid coordination. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Fe-C-O motifs, in a sharp contrast to the well-known Fe-C-N for 4e –, are responsible for the H 2 O 2 pathway. This iron single atom catalyst demonstrated an effective water disinfection as a representative application.

### Suppressing hydrogen peroxide generation to achieve oxygen-insensitivity of a [NiFe] hydrogenase in redox active films [^58f6fcec]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Redox-active films were proposed as protective matrices for preventing oxidative deactivation of oxygen-sensitive catalysts such as hydrogenases for their use in fuel cells. However, the theoretical models predict quasi-infinite protection from oxygen and the aerobic half-life for hydrogenase-catalyzed hydrogen oxidation within redox films lasts only about a day. Here, we employ operando confocal microscopy to elucidate the deactivation processes. The hydrogen peroxide generated from incomplete reduction of oxygen induces the decomposition of the redox matrix rather than deactivation of the biocatalyst. We show that efficient dismutation of hydrogen peroxide by iodide extends the aerobic half-life of the catalytic film containing an oxygen-sensitive [NiFe] hydrogenase to over one week, approaching the experimental anaerobic half-life. Altogether, our data support the theory that redox films make the hydrogenases immune against the direct deactivation by oxygen and highlight the importance of suppressing hydrogen peroxide production in order to reach complete protection from oxidative stress.

### Understanding activity trends in electrochemical water oxidation to form hydrogen peroxide [^86761ec2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) from water oxidation could provide a very attractive route to locally produce a chemically valuable product from an abundant resource. Herein using density functional theory calculations, we predict trends in activity for water oxidation towards H 2 O 2 evolution on four different metal oxides, i.e. WO 3, SnO 2, TiO 2 and BiVO 4. The density functional theory predicted trend for H 2 O 2 evolution is further confirmed by our experimental measurements. Moreover, we identify that BiVO 4 has the best H 2 O 2 generation amount of those oxides and can achieve a Faraday efficiency of about 98% for H 2 O 2 production. Producing hydrogen peroxide via electrochemical oxidation of water is an attractive route to this valuable product. Here the authors theoretically and experimentally investigate hydrogen peroxide production activity trends for a range of metal oxides and identify the optimal bias ranges for high Faraday efficiencies.

### Monitoring the action of redox-directed cancer therapeutics using a human peroxiredoxin-2-based probe [^7d26061c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Redox cancer therapeutics target the increased reliance on intracellular antioxidant systems and enhanced susceptibility to oxidant-induced stress of some cancer cells compared to normal cells. Many of these therapeutics are thought to perturb intracellular levels of the oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), a signaling molecule that modulates a number of different processes in human cells. However, fluorescent probes for this species remain limited in their ability to detect the small perturbations induced during successful treatments. We report a fluorescent sensor based upon human peroxiredoxin-2, which acts as the natural indicator of small H 2 O 2 fluctuations in human cells. The new probe reveals peroxide-induced oxidation in human cells below the detection limit of current probes, as well as peroxiredoxin-2 oxidation caused by two different redox cancer therapeutics in living cells. This capability will be useful in elucidating the mechanism of current redox-based therapeutics and in developing new ones.

### Homologous heteropolyaromatic covalent organic frameworks for enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production and aerobic oxidation [^3901a935]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

DRIFTS was performed in-situ to identify the intermediates and photocatalytic active centers. The intensities of the characteristic peaks of
- O 2 − (1230 cm −1) and O − O (892 cm −1) increased progressively during the reaction in the in-situ DRIFTS tests for TTT-COF (Fig. 5d), signifying the adsorption of O 2 and the occurrence of the two-step single-electron pathway in the photocatalytic system based on TTT-COF. These comprehensive analyses reveal the pivotal role of
- O 2 − in the photosynthesis of H 2 O 2 and underscore the significance of the two-step single-electron ORR process in the overall mechanism. Meanwhile, signal peaks attributed to H 2 O oxidation intermediate C-OH and OH were observed at 1065 cm −1 and 1397 cm −1 for TTT-COF, proving the formation of adsorbed *OH for the WOR process. The insights gained from these experiments provide a robust foundation for further optimizing the photocatalytic performance of COFs in H 2 O 2 generation and other related applications.

### Role of metabolically generated reactive oxygen species for lipotoxicity in pancreatic β-cells [^1223f356]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Chronically elevated concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in type 2 diabetes may be involved in β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. It has been shown that long-chain saturated NEFAs exhibit a strong cytotoxic effect upon insulin-producing cells, while short-chain as well as unsaturated NEFAs are well tolerated. Moreover, long-chain unsaturated NEFAs counteract the toxicity of palmitic acid. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and gene expression analyses together with viability assays in different β-cell lines showed that the G-protein-coupled receptors 40 and 120 do not mediate lipotoxicity. This is independent from the role, which these receptors, specifically GPR40, play in the potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion by saturated and unsaturated long-chain NEFAs. Long-chain NEFAs are not only metabolized in the mitochondria but also in peroxisomes. In contrast to mitochondrial β-oxidation, the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) oxidases in the peroxisomes form hydrogen peroxide and not reducing equivalents. As β-cells almost completely lack catalase, they are exceptionally vulnerable to hydrogen peroxide generated in peroxisomes. ROS generation in the respiratory chain is less important because overexpression of catalase and superoxide dismutase in the mitochondria do not provide protection. Thus, peroxisomally generated hydrogen peroxide is the likely ROS that causes pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and ultimately β-cell death.

### Evidence from the pacific troposphere for large global sources of oxygenated organic compounds [^dadbb110]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The presence of oxygenated organic compounds in the troposphere strongly influences key atmospheric processes. Such oxygenated species are, for example, carriers of reactive nitrogen and are easily photolysed, producing free radicals-and so influence the oxidizing capacity and the ozone-forming potential of the atmosphere-and may also contribute significantly to the organic component of aerosols. But knowledge of the distribution and sources of oxygenated organic compounds, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, is limited. Here we characterize the tropospheric composition of oxygenated organic species, using data from a recent airborne survey conducted over the tropical Pacific Ocean (30 degrees N to 30 degrees S). Measurements of a dozen oxygenated chemicals (carbonyls, alcohols, organic nitrates, organic pernitrates and peroxides), along with several C2-C8 hydrocarbons, reveal that abundances of oxygenated species are extremely high, and collectively, oxygenated species are nearly five times more abundant than non-methane hydrocarbons in the Southern Hemisphere. Current atmospheric models are unable to correctly simulate these findings, suggesting that large, diffuse, and hitherto-unknown sources of oxygenated organic compounds must therefore exist. Although the origin of these sources is still unclear, we suggest that oxygenated species could be formed via the oxidation of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, the photochemical degradation of organic matter in the oceans, and direct emissions from terrestrial vegetation.

### Crystal OH mediating pathway for hydrogen peroxide production via two-electron water oxidation in non-carbonate electrolytes [^205ea5a3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Direct pathway via OH* and indirect pathway via SO 4 *.

a Structure of OH* adsorbed on Cu atom and O atom on Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 before structure relaxation. b Structure of OH* adsorbed on Cu atom and O atom on Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 after structure relaxation. c Structure of SO 4 * adsorbed on Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 before structure relaxation. d Structure of SO 4 * adsorbed on Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 after structure relaxation.

According to previous reports, the change of Gibbs free energy of *OH (ΔG OH*) is a crucial parameter for H 2 O 2 production. The optimized range for directing oxidation of OH is between 1.6 to 2.4 eV. However, the ΔG OH* is calculated to be about 0.70 eV when OH* is adsorbed on Cu, and 0.82 eV when OH* is adsorbed on O. These two values are not in the optimum range of 1.6 to 2.4 eV, suggesting directing oxidation of OH should not be the pathway for the generation of H 2 O 2.

In addition to OH −, SO 4 2− ions are the dominating ions in the electrolyte. Therefore, we further investigate the interaction between SO 4 2− and the substrate. As shown in Fig. 5c, an SO 4 2− ion is put near the substrate. Then, after structure relaxation, the structure of the SO 4 2− total changes (Fig. 5d). It is clear that the four O atoms rearrange. Interestingly, two O atoms link with each other to form the O-O bond, which is a very important bond for the production of H 2 O 2. Importantly, some O atoms from the SO 4 2− are bonded with the OH from the substrate Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3, suggesting there are interactions between the SO 4 2− and the Cu 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 (Supplementary Data 1). Importantly, the O-O bond distance is found to be about 1.47 Å, which is very close to the O-O bond distance of 1.48 Å in H 2 O 2. Therefore, this rearrangement of the SO 4 2− should be a crucial step for the production of H 2 O 2. Therefore, to conclude, the generation of H 2 O 2 should not be a direct pathway via OH* adsorption. Instead, it should be an indirect pathway via SO 4 2−.

Evidence from a meta-analysis of single-center quasi-experimental studies showed variable results by system type, baseline CDI incidence, and accompanying disinfectant; study quality was low, but 4 of 6 studies adding UV-C to bleach cleaning demonstrated decreased CDI incidence. In a cluster-randomized, multicenter, crossover study comparing UV-C/bleach versus bleach alone at CDI patient discharge, the incidence of CDI among subsequent room occupants did not differ, whereas a secondary analysis observed hospital-wide decreases in CDI incidence after implementing UV-C with standard quaternary ammonium (or with bleach for rooms previously occupied by a patient with C. difficile).
