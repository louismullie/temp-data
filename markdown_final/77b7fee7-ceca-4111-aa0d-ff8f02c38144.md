## Question

How do we assess patients with fracture in a cast or fraction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to assess patients with fractures who are managed in a cast or traction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment priorities and red flags. Then, I should verify the key elements of the focused history. Next, I will examine the neurovascular status and soft tissues. After that, I need to check the cast or traction construct itself. Then, I will review radiographic alignment and healing. I will now examine pain control and functional status. Next, I should review complication surveillance and risk stratification. Finally, I will consider age-specific nuances, documentation, and follow-up planning, making sure I cross-check each step against guidelines and trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities and red flags, because missing these can be catastrophic. I need to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are stable, screen for open fractures, neurovascular compromise, compartment syndrome, and polytrauma, and then decide whether splinting or traction is appropriate in the acute setting, since splints accommodate swelling and casts do not, and traction is generally reserved for temporizing alignment or specific indications rather than routine use [^111hDMS7] [^112NMQPj].

> Wait, let me verify the focused history elements I must capture. I should document the mechanism and energy of injury, time since injury, prior fractures or osteoporosis, baseline function and comorbidities, and any prior reduction attempts, because these factors influence both the risk of redisplacement and the choice of immobilization method and follow-up intensity [^1118Rjzu] [^112184vw].

> I will now examine the neurovascular status and soft tissues, and I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions before completing this. I should check pulses, capillary refill, temperature, and sensation, and ask about paresthesias, escalating pain, or pallor, because these may herald compartment syndrome or nerve injury; I should also inspect the skin for pressure sores, blisters, maceration, or cast burns, and palpate for focal tenderness suggesting a new or evolving injury [^112184vw] [^112r6dWa] [^11788wmM].

> Next, I should review the cast or traction construct itself. Hold on, I should verify that the cast is the right length, not too tight or too loose, and that windows or bivalving were appropriate. I should also confirm that the cast is not impinging on joints or causing pressure over bony prominences, and that traction pin sites are clean, dry, and not infected, because construct problems are a common source of preventable complications [^112184vw] [^112r6dWa] [^111v54Ru].

> Let me consider radiographic alignment and healing now. I should confirm initial and interval radiographs to assess dorsal tilt, radial inclination, radial height, and shortening for distal radius fractures, and I should double-check for loss of reduction at about 1 and 2 weeks, especially in older adults or after closed reduction, given high redisplacement rates. For pediatric fractures, I need to remember remodeling potential but still monitor for unacceptable angulation or shortening that exceeds age-appropriate thresholds [^111JTHLu] [^113MHJ8J] [^116xKW4a].

> I need to check pain control and functional status at each visit. I should confirm pain scores, sleep disturbance, and whether pain is improving or escalating, because worsening pain can signal compartment syndrome, cast tightness, or loss of reduction. I should also ask about activities of daily living, mobility, and whether the patient can comply with weight-bearing or immobilization instructions, as this affects both safety and outcomes [^117FXp18] [^112184vw].

> Hold on, I should verify complication surveillance and risk stratification. I will now examine for compartment syndrome, pressure sores, cast burns, nerve palsies, and thromboembolic risk in lower limb immobilization. For VTE risk, I should consider validated tools like the TRiP(cast) score to guide prophylaxis decisions, recognizing that low-risk patients may safely avoid anticoagulation, and I should also monitor for cast-related pain requiring ED revisits, which is not rare after closed reduction [^113yWQ83] [^114pCjqW] [^112CuQTv].

> Let me think about age-specific nuances, because management differs substantially by age. For pediatric patients, I should confirm that early spica casting is reasonable for femur fractures with less than 2 cm shortening, that below-elbow conversion can be safe after initial above-elbow immobilization for forearm fractures, and that remodeling can compensate for modest malalignment. For adults, I should double-check that distal radius fractures have higher redisplacement risk with age and may require closer follow-up or surgical consideration, and that ankle fractures may be managed equivalently with cast or removable brace in many cases [^111MAFBr] [^116xKW4a] [^113MHJ8J] [^111zcuTM].

> I should confirm that my documentation is complete and actionable. I need to record the neurovascular exam, pain scores, cast or traction construct assessment, radiographic findings and plan, and explicitly note any deviations from expected healing trajectories. I should also communicate clear return precautions for fever, escalating pain, numbness, or color change, and schedule follow-up at 1 to 2 weeks for most unstable fractures, with earlier checks if risk of redisplacement is high [^112184vw] [^111JTHLu].

> But wait, what if the patient is in traction rather than a cast? I should verify the indications and maintenance. Traction should not be used routinely for hip fractures preoperatively, but may be appropriate as a temporizing measure for femur fractures in polytrauma or when surgery must be delayed. I need to ensure pin-site care, alignment checks, and timely transition to definitive fixation when feasible [^112NMQPj] [^112e9ZFW] [^111hDMS7].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure nothing is missing. The sequence of red flags, history, neurovascular and soft tissue exam, construct review, radiographic assessment, pain and function tracking, complication surveillance with risk tools, age-specific adjustments, and meticulous documentation with scheduled follow-up provides a safety net that aligns with best practices and available evidence, and I should remain ready to pivot to operative management if alignment fails or complications emerge despite optimal nonoperative care [^112184vw] [^112Gj7nJ] [^112AX2YH].

Assessment of a patient with a fracture in a cast or traction requires a **structured approach** to detect complications and ensure alignment and healing. Key steps include: **neurovascular checks** (5 Ps: pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, pulselessness) [^112184vw]; inspection for cast/traction issues (tightness, pressure sores, infection, pin-site problems) [^115VpLb7]; and radiographs to confirm alignment and healing [^115L8KkH]. Monitor for compartment syndrome, nerve injury, infection, and loss of reduction, and adjust the cast/traction or escalate care as needed [^1138bjZD]. Use the **TRiP(cast) score** [^114pCjqW] to guide thromboprophylaxis in lower-limb immobilization.

## Clinical assessment

### Neurovascular status

- **Pain**: Assess intensity and character; escalating pain despite analgesia may indicate compartment syndrome or nerve compression [^notfound].

- **Pallor**: Check skin color for ischemia or poor perfusion [^notfound].

- **Paresthesia**: Document numbness or tingling, suggesting nerve compression or ischemia [^notfound].

- **Paralysis**: Evaluate motor function; new weakness or paralysis warrants urgent evaluation [^notfound].

- **Pulselessness**: Palpate distal pulses; absence or marked diminution indicates vascular compromise [^notfound].

---

### Cast or traction-specific assessment

- **Cast fit**: Ensure the cast is snug but not tight; check for tightness, indentations, or pressure points [^111hDMS7].

- **Cast integrity**: Inspect for cracks, softening, or breakage that could compromise immobilization [^116KbaHS].

- **Pressure sores**: Examine exposed skin for redness, blisters, or necrosis, especially over bony prominences [^111hDMS7].

- **Infection**: Look for erythema, warmth, swelling, discharge, or foul odor around cast edges or pin sites [^111HJQCZ].

- **Pin-site care**: For traction, assess pin sites for infection, loosening, or skin irritation [^111v54Ru].

---

### Functional assessment

Assess **range of motion** by checking for stiffness or limited joint movement, and evaluate **pain control** to ensure adequate analgesia and adjust as needed [^notfound].

---

## Radiographic assessment

Radiographs are essential to confirm alignment, monitor healing, and detect complications. Obtain **initial radiographs** to document baseline alignment and verify reduction, and schedule **follow-up radiographs** at 1–2 weeks to detect early loss of reduction, then at 2–4 week intervals until union is confirmed [^111JTHLu]. Evaluate **alignment** by measuring angulation, translation, and rotation, and assess **healing** by looking for callus formation and trabecular bridging across the fracture line [^112WziEr].

## Common complications and their management

| **Complication** | **Clinical signs** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Compartment syndrome | Severe pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, pulselessness | Immediate cast splitting or bivalving, emergency fasciotomy if unresolved [^notfound] |
| Pressure sores | Redness, blisters, skin breakdown | Cast windowing, padding, wound care, cast replacement if severe [^111hDMS7] |
| Cast tightness | Swelling, pain, numbness | Cast splitting or bivalving, reapplication once swelling subsides [^113C42AH] |
| Infection | Erythema, warmth, discharge, fever | Antibiotics, cast removal, wound care, surgical intervention if severe [^notfound] |
| Loss of reduction | Increased pain, deformity, abnormal radiographs | Cast removal, re-reduction, surgical fixation if unstable [^115L8KkH] |
| Pin-site infection | Erythema, discharge, pain | Antibiotics, pin care, pin removal if severe [^111HJQCZ] |

## Special considerations in pediatric patients

Pediatric patients have unique needs: **growth plate injuries** require careful monitoring for growth disturbances and regular follow-up [^116DzAfC], and **remodeling potential** allows greater tolerance of angulation and displacement, though alignment should still be monitored [^116xKW4a]. Parents should be educated on cast care, signs of complications, and activity restrictions [^11788wmM].

---

## Thromboprophylaxis in lower limb immobilization

Patients with lower-limb immobilization are at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Use the **TRiP(cast) score** to stratify VTE risk and guide prophylaxis; patients with a score < 7 have a low risk and may safely forgo anticoagulation, whereas those with a score ≥ 7 should receive prophylactic anticoagulation [^114pCjqW] [^113yWQ83].

---

## Documentation and communication

Record neurovascular status, pain control, cast/traction integrity, and radiographic findings at each visit. Communicate clearly with the patient and caregivers about warning signs, activity restrictions, and follow-up plans [^116DzAfC].

Cast immobilization is performed in pediatric patients to support fracture healing, provide post-operative protection, or correct congenital deformities. Pediatric dermatologists will likely encounter the casted patients in their practice. These patients may present with cast-related complications that can arise due to the cast application or removal process, the inner cast environment, direct physical effects of the cast, or other external factors. This article provides a review of the dermatologic complications of cast immobilization, as well as useful recommendations for patients and their families.

### Does early conversion to below-elbow casting for pediatric diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures adversely affect patient-reported outcomes and ROM? [^111Ex7Jd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Interventions

For the initial study, a surgeon reduced the fracture in the operating room under general anesthesia with fluoroscopic guidance. The fracture was checked for stability; if unstable, the patient was excluded and treated with intramedullary nails. The remaining fractures were defined as stable and the patients were randomized to 6 weeks of an above-elbow cast or to 3 weeks of an above-elbow cast followed by 3 weeks of a below-elbow cast. All casts were applied the same way, following a protocol set up by the research group. Clinical and radiographic evaluation happened at 1, 3, and 6 weeks after initial trauma. Fracture displacement, as defined by the loss of reduction according to the primary reduction criteria (Supplemental Table 2;), required new fracture reduction. Finally, the cast was removed 6 weeks after initial treatment. At 2 and 6 months after the initial trauma, patients were assessed for clinical and radiological outcome. For prosupination, two different methods were used: visual estimation and conventional goniometry. For the visual measurement, the elbow was held in 90° of flexion against the body and an estimate was made by two examiners (LWD, JWC). For the goniometer, a 180° protractor goniometer with two movable arms was used and both examiners performed three independent measurements, which they averaged.

Children with more than 30° of functional impairment at the 2-month examination were referred to a physiotherapist. At the 7-year mark, all patients who consented to follow-up were invited to the clinic for clinical and radiological evaluation.

### Is there still a place for cast wedging in pediatric forearm fractures? [^1169s3tm]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Forearm fractures are common skeletal injuries in childhood and can usually be treated nonoperatively with closed reduction and casting. Trends toward increasing operative treatment of these fractures have emerged. We aim to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cast wedging for treatment of pediatric forearm fractures.

Methods

We performed a prospective chart review of patients with forearm fractures, including distal radius (DR) fractures, treated with cast wedging at a single large pediatric hospital from June 2011 to September 2012. Inclusion criteria specified open distal radial physis, closed injury, loss of acceptable reduction, and availability of clinical and radiographic data from injury to cast removal. Exclusion criteria included pathologic fractures, neurovascular injury, fracture dislocations, open fractures, and closed DR physis. Reductions were performed and patients followed according to standard protocol at our institution, including placement into long-arm casts, initial follow-up visit within 5 to 10 days postinjury, and weekly visits for 2 weeks thereafter. If alignment were deemed unacceptable within 3 weeks of injury, cast wedging was utilized. Radiographic measurements of alignment included both radius and ulna on the injury film, postreduction, prewedge, postwedge, and final films. Radiographic technique was standardized, with repeatability testing demonstrating a precision of ± 2 degrees.

Results

Over 15 months, our hospital treated 2124 forearm or DR fractures with closed reduction and casting. There were 60 fractures treated either with percutaneous fixation (36) or open treatment (24). A total of 79 forearm or DR fractures were treated with cast wedging secondary to loss of reduction, of which 70 patients had complete clinical and radiographic data. Average age was 8.4 years (range, 3 to 14 y), with 25 females and 45 males. Significant improvement in angulation for both-bone forearm fracture from prewedge to final films was seen in 69 children, with no major complications. One patient failed wedging and required surgical reduction and fixation.

Conclusions

Cast wedging is a simple, safe, noninvasive, and effective method for treatment of excessive angulation in pediatric forearm fractures.

### Does early conversion to below-elbow casting for pediatric diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures adversely affect patient-reported outcomes and ROM? [^1177K6m2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Half of pediatric forearm fractures are both-bone forearm fractures, and 20% of these fractures are located in the diaphysis. Diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures are known for their higher risk of secondary displacement and malunions because of the lower remodeling capacity. They currently are treated with 6 weeks in an above-elbow cast. Colaris et al. showed that early conversion to an below-elbow cast results in more cast comfort with no increase in secondary dislocations. Children have a great remodeling capability and capacity for functional recovery; we believe that treatment recommendations should therefore be based on the occurrence of complications and functional outcomes in the long term. Our secondary analysis of an earlier RCT shows that early conversion to a below-elbow cast should be the recommended treatment strategy for stable, reduced pediatric both-bone forearm fractures because there are no difference in functional and radiological outcome when compared to 6 weeks in an above-elbow cast. Even the secondary displaced malunions showed excellent clinical outcomes at 7.5 years despite the fact that 62% of the malunions were not fully corrected by growth.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. Primarily, the clinical assessment was not blinded. Blinding of patients was impossible because of the cast morphology. The second limitation is the number of patients lost to follow-up. To address the potential effects of attrition secondary to loss of follow-up, we did a patient-group analysis, showing that the loss-to-follow-up group was representative of the original study group.

Clinical and Radiological Outcomes

We found no differences between the groups at 7.5 years of follow-up in terms of patient-reported outcomes, ROM, or grip strength. Furthermore, we found no clinically important differences in radiological outcomes between the two groups. Because patients find the below-elbow cast more comfortable, we recommend that early conversion to a below-elbow cast should be the treatment of choice for children with stable, diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures. We observed some differences in radiologic angulation between the two treatment groups, but none of these were clinically relevant. Regardless of the initial treatment, the radiological outcomes were good. This confirms findings from a study that reported good or excellent outcomes in 92% of patients who were treated with closed reduction and a cast. In that series, results were graded as excellent if there were no complaints with physical activity and/or a loss of ≤ 10° of forearm rotation.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^115L8KkH]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture — initial management with casting specifies that initial treatment of a DRF depends on the overall bony alignment; if alignment is deemed acceptable, immobilization is indicated and typically achieved with a short arm cast for 4 to 6 weeks, whereas if alignment is not acceptable, a closed reduction will be performed before casting; if reduction can be maintained with casting alone, 6 weeks of immobilization is typically sufficient to achieve bony union; when treating fractures with casting only there can be a risk of redisplacement, and based on subsequent radiographs, a decision may be made to abandon cast treatment and shift to operative intervention.

### Percutaneous pinning for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^111HJQCZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem. A key method of surgical fixation is percutaneous pinning, involving the insertion of wires through the skin to stabilise the fracture. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of percutaneous pinning versus cast immobilisation alone and of different methods and techniques of percutaneous pinning, modalities or duration of immobilisation after pinning, and methods or timing of pin or wire removal for treating fractures of the distal radius in adults. Our primary focus was on dorsally displaced fractures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registers, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles up to June 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials involving adults with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared percutaneous pinning with non-surgical treatment or different aspects of percutaneous pinning. Our main outcomes were patient-reported function at the short term (up to three months), medium term (three up to 12 months) and long term (greater than 12 months); overall numbers of participants with complications requiring secondary treatment and any complication; grip strength and health-related quality of life at 12 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and five quasi-RCTs, involving 1946 generally older and female adults with dorsally displaced and potentially or evidently unstable distal radial fractures. Trial populations varied but the majority of studies reported mean ages in the sixth decade or older. All trials were at high risk of bias, invariably performance bias - which for most trials reflected the impracticality of blinding care providers or participants to treatment allocation - and often detection bias and selective reporting bias. Allocation concealment was secure in one trial only. All trials reported outcomes incompletely. The studies tested one of 10 comparisons. In the following, we report on those of the main outcomes for which evidence was available. No subgroup analysis, such as by pinning methods, was viable. Eleven heterogeneous trials involving 917 participants compared percutaneous pinning with plaster cast immobilisation after closed reduction of the fracture. The quality of the evidence was very low for all reported outcomes. Thus, we are uncertain if percutaneous pinning compared with plaster cast alone makes any difference to patient-reported function, measured using the DASH questionnaire, at six weeks or six months (incomplete data from one trial). Overall numbers of participants with complications were not reported. Redisplacement resulting in secondary treatment occurred on average in 12% (range 3.3% to 75%) of participants treated by cast alone (six trials) whereas pin tract infection requiring antibiotics and, often, early wire removal, occurred on average in 7.7% (range 0% to 15%) of pinning group participants (seven trials). We are uncertain whether pinning makes a difference to the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome, reported in four studies. Although two studies found finger stiffness after cast removal was less common after pinning (20% versus 36%), the treatment implications were not reported. Other reported complications were mainly surgery-related. Based on incomplete data or qualitative statements from only four studies, we are uncertain of the effects of pinning on grip strength at 12 months. We are uncertain if percutaneous pinning compared with plaster cast alone makes any difference to patient-reported quality of life at four months (one study). Five comparisons of different pinning methods were made by six trials in all. One of these trials, which reported results for 96 participants, compared Kapandji intrafocal pinning (2 or 3 wires) with early mobilisation versus trans-styloid fixation (2 wires) with six weeks cast immobilisation. We are uncertain whether Kapandji pinning slightly increases the risk of superficial radial nerve symptoms or complex regional pain syndrome, or whether it makes a difference in grip strength at 12 months (very low-quality evidence). Two small trials using two distinct pinning techniques compared biodegradable pins versus metal pins in 70 participants. Although very low-quality evidence, the extra demands at surgery of insertion of biodegradable pins and excess of serious complications (e.g. severe osteolytic reactions) associated with biodegradable material are important findings. Three poorly-reported trials involving 168 participants compared burying of wire ends versus leaving them exposed. We are uncertain whether burying of wires reduces the incidence of superficial infection (very low-quality evidence). There is low-quality evidence that burying of wires may be associated with a higher risk of requiring more invasive treatment for wire removal. Four small trials compared different types or duration of postoperative immobilisation. Very low-quality evidence of small between-group differences in individual complications and grip strength at 17 weeks, means we are uncertain of the effects of positioning the wrist in dorsiflexion versus palmar flexion during cast immobilisation following pinning of redisplaced fractures (one trial; 60 participants). Three small heterogeneous trials compared cast immobilisation for one week (early mobilisation) versus four or six weeks after percutaneous pinning in 170 people. Although we note one trial using Kapandji pinning reported more complications in the early group, the very low-quality evidence means there is uncertainty of the effects of early mobilisation on overall and individual complications, or grip strength at 12 months. No trials tested different methods for, or timing of, pin/wire removal.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, there is insufficient RCT evidence to inform on the role of percutaneous pinning versus cast immobilisation alone or associated treatment decisions such as method of pinning, burying or not of wire ends, wrist position and duration of immobilisation after pinning. Although very low-quality evidence, the serious complications associated with biodegradable materials is noteworthy. We advise waiting on the results of a large ongoing study comparing pinning with plaster cast treatment as these could help inform future research.

### Emergency department revisits due to cast-related pain in children with forearm fractures [^112CuQTv]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of our study is that a certain amount (4.2%) of children with forearm fracture revisited the ED due to CstRP. In our cohort, two variables were mostly associated with ED revisit due to CstRP; being treated with closed reduction, and having a pain score of 6 or more on ED admission. Age, gender, type of cast immobilization (short cast or long cast) and location of the fracture (distal radius, mid-shaft/proximal shaft radius, radius and ulna) were not associated with revisits due to CstRP. These findings suggest that physicians should be more proactive in discussing the potential risk for CstRP in patients who underwent fracture reduction and patients who had significant pain level on ED admission. A possible way of preventing CstRP is splitting the cast, a method that many surgeons advocate. Previous studies reported the benefit of splitting or spreading of fiberglass casts. It is worth mentioning that a randomized controlled study failed to show any difference in the incidence of cast-related problems between closed cast and split cast in patients with forearm fractures.

The returned patients had a median pain score of 7 and were treated with analgesics according to our pain protocol. This finding implies that CstRP could lead to a severe pain that justifies early analgesia. In our study, two-thirds (95/153) of the patients who revisited the ED due to cast related complaints, were painful. Sawyer et al reported that only 10% of the patients with cast-related complications present with pain. We believe that our results better reflect the real situation because we abstracted the data from the triage process in which pain is assessed using standardized pain assessment protocol tools (Figure 1). Another important finding is that despite the fact that all the 95 painful patients were treated with cast splitting, trimming or replacement, no case of neurovascular compromise was recorded and no patient required surgery, re-reduction, or hospital admission for pain management. These results suggest that in children CstRP is infrequently associated with neurological deficit. Several other pediatric studies corroborate our findings.–It is worth mentioning, however, that most of the children with CstRP needed cast work to potentially prevent a compartment syndrome. In adults, neuropathic symptoms were reported in 6/296 (2%) of the patients with forearm fracture. None of the patients had carpel tunnel syndrome or compartment syndrome. One patient had decreased sensation over the ulnar nerve distribution.

### Does early conversion to below-elbow casting for pediatric diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures adversely affect patient-reported outcomes and ROM? [^116xKW4a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

For distal forearm fractures in children, it has been shown that a below-elbow cast is an adequate treatment that overcomes the discomfort of an above-elbow cast and unnecessary immobilization of the elbow. For reduced diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures, our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) — which compared an above-elbow cast with early conversion to a below-elbow cast — revealed no differences in the risk of redisplacement or functional outcomes at short-term follow-up. Although studies with a longer follow-up after diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children are scarce, they are essential, as growth might affect the outcome.

Questions/purposes

In this secondary analysis of an earlier RCT, we asked: (1) Does early conversion from an above-elbow to a below-elbow cast in children with reduced, stable diaphyseal forearm fractures result in worse clinical and radiological outcome? (2) Does a malunion result in inferior clinical outcomes at 7.5 years of follow-up?

Methods

In this study, we evaluated children at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up who were included in a previous RCT. The median (range) duration of follow-up was 7.5 years (5.2 to 9.9). The patients for this RCT were included from the emergency departments of four different urban hospitals. Between January 2006 and August 2010, we treated 128 patients for reduced diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures. All 128 patients were eligible; 24% (31) were excluded because they were lost before the minimum study follow-up or had incomplete datasets, leaving 76% (97) for secondary analysis. The loss in the follow-up group was comparable to the included population. Eligible patients were invited for secondary functional and radiographic assessment. The primary outcome was the difference in forearm rotation compared with the uninjured contralateral arm. Secondary outcomes were the ABILHAND-kids and QuickDASH questionnaire, loss of flexion and extension of the elbow and wrist compared with the contralateral forearm, JAMAR grip strength ratio, and radiological assessment of residual deformity. The study was not blinded regarding the children, parents, and clinicians.

Results

At 7.5-year follow-up, there were no differences in ABILHAND-kids questionnaire score (above-elbow cast: 41 ± 2.4 versus above/below-elbow cast: 41.7 ± 0.7, mean difference -0.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.4 to 0.04]; p = 0.06), QuickDASH (above-elbow cast: 5.8 ± 9.6 versus 2.9 ± 6.0 for above-/below-elbow cast, mean difference 2.9 [95% CI -0.5 to 6.2]; p = 0.92), and grip strength (0.9 ± 0.2 for above-elbow cast versus 1 ± 0.2 for above/below-elbow cast, mean difference -0.04 [95% CI -1 to 0.03]; p = 0.24). Functional outcomes showed no difference (loss of forearm rotation: above-elbow cast 7.9 ± 17.7 versus 4.1 ± 6.9 for above-/below-elbow cast, mean difference 3.8 [95% CI -1.7 to 9.4]; p = 0.47; arc of motion: above-elbow cast 152° ± 21° versus 155° ± 11° for the above/below-elbow cast group, mean difference -2.5 [95% CI -9.3 to -4.4]; p = 0.17; loss of wrist flexion-extension: above-elbow cast group 1.0° ± 5.0° versus 0.6° ± 4.2° for above/below-elbow cast, mean difference 0.4° [95% CI -1.5° to 2.2°]; p = 0.69). The secondary follow-up showed improvement in forearm rotation in both groups compared with the rotation at 7 months. For radiographical analysis, the only difference was in AP ulna (above-elbow cast: 6° ± 3° versus above/below-elbow cast: 5° ± 2°, mean difference 1.8° [0.7° to 3°]; p = 0.003), although this is likely not clinically relevant. There were no differences in the other parameters. Thirteen patients with persistent malunion at 7-month follow-up showed no clinically relevant differences in functional outcomes at 7.5-year follow-up compared with children without malunion. The loss of forearm rotation was 5.5ׄ° ± 9.1° for the malunion group compared with 6.0° ± 13.9° in the no malunion group, with a mean difference of 0.4 (95% CI of -7.5 to 8.4; p = 0.92).

Conclusion

In light of these results, we suggest that surgeons perform an early conversion to a below-elbow cast for reduced diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children. This study shows that even in patients with secondary fracture displacement, remodeling occurred. And even in persistent malunion, these patients mostly showed good-to-excellent final results. Future studies, such as a meta-analysis or a large, prospective observational study, would help to establish the influence of skeletal age, sex, and the severity and direction of malunion angulation of both the radius and ulna on clinical result. Furthermore, a similar systematic review could prove beneficial in clarifying the acceptable angulation for pediatric lower extremity fractures.

### Should acute scaphoid fractures be fixed? A randomized controlled trial [^112Q6nq6]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Background

With the proliferation of different fixation screws, there is an increasing trend to recommend early internal fixation of the broken scaphoid even if the fracture is not displaced. The benefits and risks of early fixation of scaphoid fractures have not been established. These were investigated in eighty-eight patients who were of working age with clearly defined minimally displaced or undisplaced bicortical fractures of the waist of the scaphoid.

Methods

Patients who provided informed consent were randomized to treatment with early internal fixation with use of a Herbert screw without a cast (forty-four patients) or to nonoperative treatment for eight weeks with immobilization in a below-the-elbow plaster cast with the thumb left free (forty-four patients). The patients were evaluated at two, eight, twelve, twenty-six, and fifty-two weeks with respect to the severity of pain; tenderness; swelling; wrist movement; grip strength; and symptoms and disability, which were assessed with the Patient Evaluation Measure. In addition, radiographs were made and assessed at each visit.

Results

No difference was detected between the groups with respect to age, sex, hand dominance, side of injury, mechanism of injury, or the occupation of the patients. The range of motion, score on the Patient Evaluation Measure, and grip strength were significantly better in the group managed operatively than in the group managed nonoperatively at the eight-week follow-up evaluation, which corresponded with the visit when the cast was removed in that group. Patients returned to work at five to six weeks after the injury in both groups. At twelve weeks, grip strength was better in patients who had had surgery. No significant difference was detected between the two groups with respect to any other outcome measure at any other time. Ten of the forty-four fractures treated nonoperatively had not healed radiographically at twelve weeks, and, as a consequence, the treatment was altered. Complications occurred in thirteen patients who had been managed operatively. All complications were minor, and ten were related to the scar.

Conclusions

This study did not demonstrate a clear overall benefit of early fixation of acute scaphoid fractures beyond the decrease in the rate of a change in treatment because of a delayed union at twelve weeks. Early internal fixation of minimally displaced or nondisplaced fractures of the scaphoid waist, which would heal in a cast, could lead to overtreatment of a large proportion of such fractures, exposing such patients to avoidable surgical risk. Thus, we have adopted a program of so-called aggressive conservative treatment, whereby we carefully assess fracture-healing with plain radiographs, and computed tomography scans if necessary, after six to eight weeks of cast immobilization and recommend surgical fixation with or without bone-grafting at that time if a gap is identified at the fracture site. Such an approach should result in fracture union in over 95% of such patients.

### Cast-OFF trial: one versus 4 to 5 weeks of plaster cast immobilization for nonreduced distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical feasibility trial [^116Qajpj]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

The study was a multicenter randomized clinical feasibility trial and was performed from July 2017 until December 2019. Adult patients with a nonreduced DRF were included in the study. After 1 week of plaster cast immobilization, patients were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups: 4 to 5 weeks of immobilization (control group) versus plaster cast removed (intervention group). Outcomes were measured at baseline (1 week after trauma), week 4 to 5, week 6, and at 3, 6, and 12 months.

Patients were treated, included, and randomized in the Radboud university medical center and two regional hospitals Gelderse Vallei and Rijnstate in the Netherlands. These hospitals collaborate as regional acute care providers. We included and randomized 40 patients.

Participants

Patients with an acute nonreduced DRF who were diagnosed at the emergency department of the 3 participating hospitals were eligible for inclusion in the study. The inclusion criteria were women/men between the age of 18 and 75 years with an isolated, nonreduced DRF. Nonreduced fractures meant intra-articular or extra-articular fractures and including nondisplaced and minimal displaced fractures (dorsal angulation less than 5°-10°, maximum radial shortening of 2 mm, and maximum radial shift of 2 mm) not needing a reduction. Patients were to have a good understanding of the Dutch language. All patients who did not receive a reduction, decided by their treating emergency physician, were eligible for inclusion.

### Assessment of complications associated with casting of acute distal radius fractures in adults [^112JaDTE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Controversy exists regarding the closed treatment of distal radius fractures. Circumferential casting of acute distal radius fractures has been shown to be safe in children, however, little research has demonstrated its safety in adults. The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of complications associated with casting acute distal radius fractures in adult patients.

Methods

Patients with a distal radius fracture treated by a single hand surgeon at a level 1 trauma center were retrospectively reviewed over a 3-year period. Patients were evaluated in the emergency room and were provisionally immobilized either with short-arm fiberglass casts or with splints. Patients were followed for a minimum of 4 weeks. Complication rates associated with casting were recorded, including rates of compartment syndrome and acute carpal tunnel syndrome.

Results

Eighty-one patients were included in this study. A total of 30 patients met inclusion criteria for placement of a short arm cast in the Emergency Department. Mean patient age was 63.2 years. The majority of patients sustained their injuries from a ground level fall. A minority of patients had radiographic evidence of intra-articular extension or underwent a reduction prior to casting. There were no patients who developed compartment syndrome or acute carpal tunnel syndrome as a result from the casting. The majority of patients did not require a cast change for at least 4 weeks. None of our patients went on to surgery.

Conclusion

There were no major complications associated with casting of acute, low energy distal radius fractures in this series of 30 adult patients. While further studies with larger numbers of patients are necessary to establish safety of casting, this study suggests that casting may be a safe and effective treatment for low-energy distal radius fractures in adult patients presenting with a normal neurovascular exam.

### Effect of patient age on the radiographic outcomes of distal radius fractures subject to nonoperative treatment [^113MHJ8J]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our study assessed the radiographic outcomes of nonsurgically treated distal radius fractures of patients who were 18 to 44 years old (group 1), 45 to 64 years old (group 2), and 65 years old or older (group 3).

Methods

All distal radius fractures seen in our emergency department from April 2002 to September 2004 that had nonsurgical management (either casting alone or closed reduction with immobilization) were considered for this study (n = 124; 50 casted, 74 closed reduced). Patients were further classified by age. Change in fracture alignment was assessed at the time of fracture union (approximately 8 weeks) and included measurements of angulation, articular gap/step-off, and radial shortening.

Results

When the fractures (n = 124) were evaluated at union, there was an overall secondary displacement rate of 64% (n = 79), with 42% in the group whose fractures were immobilized in a cast and 78% in the group whose fractures were treated by closed reduction and cast. There was an increase in displacement rate that was associated with increasing patient age. Among fractures that were only casted, there was no such age-matched increase in rates of secondary displacement. However, when considering those fractures that were subject to closed reduction (n = 74), rates of secondary displacement significantly increased with age (58% in group 1, 81% in group 2, and 89% in group 3; p = .03).

Conclusions

Our study found that secondary displacement of distal radius fractures increased with increasing patient age, primarily among fractures subject to closed reduction. Older patients with these fractures require closer management after initial reduction, therefore allowing for better monitoring of expected subsequent fracture collapse. Further, given these high rates of secondary displacement after nonoperative treatment (58% to 89%), it is also important to consider that surgical treatment of these fractures may be necessary.

### Surgery versus cast immobilisation for adults with a bicortical fracture of the scaphoid waist (SWIFFT): a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, randomised superiority trial [^112AX2YH]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Scaphoid fractures account for 90% of carpal fractures and occur predominantly in young men. The use of immediate surgical fixation to manage this type of fracture has increased, despite insufficient evidence of improved outcomes over non-surgical management. The SWIFFT trial compared the clinical effectiveness of surgical fixation with cast immobilisation and early fixation of fractures that fail to unite in adults with scaphoid waist fractures displaced by 2 mm or less.

Methods

This pragmatic, parallel-group, multicentre, open-label, two-arm, randomised superiority trial included adults (aged 16 years or older) who presented to orthopaedic departments of 31 hospitals in England and Wales with a clear bicortical fracture of the scaphoid waist on radiographs. An independent remote randomisation service used a computer-generated allocation sequence with randomly varying block sizes to randomly assign participants (1:1) to receive either early surgical fixation (surgery group) or below-elbow cast immobilisation followed by immediate fixation if non-union of the fracture was confirmed (cast immobilisation group). Randomisation was stratified by whether or not there was displacement of either a step or a gap of 1–2 mm inclusive on any radiographic view. The primary outcome was the total patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) score at 52 weeks after randomisation, and it was analysed on an available case intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN67901257, and is no longer recruiting, but long-term follow-up is ongoing.

Findings

Between July 23, 2013, and July 26, 2016, 439 (42%) of 1047 assessed patients (mean age 33 years; 363 [83%] men) were randomly assigned to the surgery group (n = 219) or to the cast immobilisation group (n = 220). Of these, 408 (93%) participants were included in the primary analysis (203 participants in the surgery group and 205 participants in the cast immobilisation group). 16 participants in the surgery group and 15 participants in the cast immobilisation group were excluded because of either withdrawal, no response, or no follow-up data at 6, 12, 26, or 52 weeks. There was no significant difference in mean PRWE scores at 52 weeks between the surgery group (adjusted mean 11.9 [95% CI 9.2–14.5]) and the cast immobilisation group (14.0 [11.3 to 16.6]; adjusted mean difference -2.1 [95% CI -5.8 to 1.6], p = 0.27). More participants in the surgery group (31 [14%] of 219 participants) had a potentially serious complication from surgery than in the cast immobilisation group (three [1%] of 220 participants), but fewer participants in the surgery group (five [2%]) had cast-related complications than in the cast immobilisation group (40 [18%]). The number of participants who had a medical complication was similar between the two groups (four [2%] in the surgery group and five [2%] in the cast immobilisation group).

Interpretation

Adult patients with scaphoid waist fractures displaced by 2 mm or less should have initial cast immobilisation, and any suspected non-unions should be confirmed and immediately fixed with surgery. This treatment strategy will help to avoid the risks of surgery and mostly limit the use of surgery to fixing fractures that fail to unite.

### Use of cast immobilisation versus removable brace in adults with an ankle fracture: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114pnKig]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

The current trial, a large scale pragmatic randomised controlled trial, was designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a plaster cast versus removable bracing for the management of ankle fractures in adults. The main limitation of our study was the 25% loss to follow-up; however, the minimum sample size was exceeded by a large margin and our post hoc sensitivity analysis, accounting for missing data, produced similar results to the primary analysis, providing reassurance that the primary analysis was robust. Bias could potentially have been introduced because participants who were lost to follow-up might have been different from those included in the final analysis, although baseline characteristics of the randomised population compared with the analysed population were similar, providing further reassurance.

Conclusions and policy implications

This trial provides strong evidence for no statistically significant difference between traditional cast immobilisation and removable bracing for ankle fractures in adults. Future research should consider the importance of later stage rehabilitation after the initial immobilisation phase.

### Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures [^116KbaHS]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Early or delayed spica casting — Moderate evidence supports early spica casting or traction with delayed spica casting for children age six months to five years with a diaphyseal femur fracture with less than 2 cm of shortening. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Comparisons of early spica casting with traction followed by spica casting found that there were significantly more infections in the traction group and more spica softening and plaster breakage in the early spica group, with no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in time to union, femoral shortening, malalignment, or malrotation, and the work group did not find conclusive evidence that one modality of treatment (spica casting or traction) was superior. We suggest using early spica casting for social and economic considerations, specifically in relative ease of care and decreased length of hospital stay. While the work group suggests early spica for children in this age group, traction may be appropriate in some cases. This recommendation does not suggest against the use of traction. In keeping with current best medical practice, we further suggest careful clinical and radiographic follow-up during the course of treatment. Evidence gaps noted include that no trial has specifically examined children in the age group of 4–5 years and that a third study indicates that in children as young as four more malunions occur with spica casting than with external fixation.

### Immediate incorporated hip spica casting in pediatric femoral fractures: comparison of efficacy between normal and high-risk groups [^114QqSXU]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Immediate hip spica casting is the most commonly used method for the treatment of pediatric femoral fractures. The main disadvantage of the method is the unacceptable shortening (> 25 mm), which may occur during the treatment. Buehler et al described the so-called telescope test to identify the cases with a relatively high risk of unacceptable shortening. On the basis of this test, patients with an overriding of the fracture ends of more than 30 mm have a 20.4 times higher risk of unacceptable shortening compared with those with an overriding of less than 30 mm. This relatively higher risk of unacceptable shortening may be avoided by a hip spica cast, which is incorporated to a distal femoral traction pin.

Methods

The study consists of 47 (26 boys and 21 girls) patients. Mean age was 40.3 months (range, 18 months to 6 years). Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the telescope test. Group 1 included patients with telescope test results of more than 30 mm. Group 2 included patients with telescope test results of 30 mm or less. All patients were treated with a hip spica cast, which is incorporated to a distal femoral traction pin within 8 hours of the initial trauma. During cast treatment, patients were followed up by weekly x-ray controls for the first month. Patients were assessed for unacceptable shortening and misalignment.

Results

Mean (SD) shortening during cast treatment was 2.9 (5.1) mm on the treated site. Shortening was detected in 16 patients (88.9%) in group 1 and in 7 patients (24.1%) in group 2. A significantly higher number (P < 0.001) of patients developed shortening in group 1. However, unacceptable shortening (> 25 mm) did not develop in any patient in both groups. There was no significant frontal plane malalignment in both groups (P > 0.05). Sagittal plane malalignment was significantly higher in group 1 (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Hip spica cast, which is incorporated to a distal femoral traction pin, avoids unacceptable shortening and frontal plane malalignment in pediatric femoral fractures, which even have a relatively high risk of unacceptable shortening based on the so-called telescope test. However, the technique cannot avoid sagittal malalignment.

### Interventions for treating fractures of the distal femur in adults [^112stCA7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the distal femur (the part of the thigh bone nearest the knee) are a considerable cause of morbidity. Various different surgical and non-surgical treatments have been used in the management of these injuries but the best treatment remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for treating fractures of the distal femur in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (9 September 2014); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 8); MEDLINE (1946 to August week 4 2014); EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 36); World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (January 2015); conference proceedings and reference lists without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing interventions for treating fractures of the distal femur in adults. Our primary outcomes were patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of knee function and adverse events, including re-operations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We assessed treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) and, where appropriate, we pooled data using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included seven studies that involved a total of 444 adults with distal femur fractures. Each of the included studies was small and assessed to be at substantial risk of bias, with four studies being quasi-randomised and none of the studies using blinding in outcome assessment. All studies provided an incomplete picture of outcome. Based on GRADE criteria, we assessed the quality of the evidence as very low for all reported outcomes, which means we are very uncertain of the reliability of these results. One study compared surgical (dynamic condylar screw (DCS) fixation) and non-surgical (skeletal traction) treatment in 42 older adults (mean age 79 years) with displaced fractures of the distal femur. This study, which did not report on PROMs, provided very low quality evidence of little between-group differences in adverse events such as death (2/20 surgical versus 1/20 non-surgical), re-operation or repeat procedures (1/20 versus 3/20) and other adverse effects including delayed union. However, while none of the findings were statistically significant, there were more complications such as pressure sores (0/20 versus 4/20) associated with prolonged immobilisation in the non-surgical group, who stayed on average one month longer in hospital. The other six studies compared different surgical interventions. Three studies, including 159 participants, compared retrograde intramedullary nail (RIMN) fixation versus DCS or blade-plate fixation (fixed-angle devices). None of these studies reported PROMS relating to function. None of the results for the reported adverse events showed a difference between the two implants. Thus, although there was very low quality evidence of a higher risk of re-operation in the RIMN group, the 95% confidence interval (CI) also included the possibility of a higher risk of re-operation for the fixed-angle device (9/83 RIMN versus 4/96 fixed-angle device; 3 studies: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.57). There was no clinically important difference between the two groups found in quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form in one study (23 fractures). One study (18 participants) provided very low quality evidence of there being little difference in adverse events between RIMN and non-locking plate fixation. One study (53 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a higher risk of re-operation after locking plate fixation compared with a single fixed-angle device (6/28 locking plate versus 1/25 fixed-angle device; RR 5.36, 95% CI 0.69 to 41.50); however, the 95% CI also included the possibility of a higher risk of re-operation for the fixed-angle device. Neither of these trials reported on PROMs. The largest included study, which reported outcomes in 126 participants at one-year follow-up, compared RIMN versus locking plate fixation; both implants are commonly used in current practice. None of the between-group differences in the reported outcomes were statistically significant; thus the CIs crossed the line of no effect. There was very low quality evidence of better patient-reported musculoskeletal function in the RIMN group based on Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (0 to 100: best function) scores (e.g. dysfunction index: MD -5.90 favouring RIMN, 95% CI -15.13 to 3.33) as well as quality of life using the EuroQoL-5D Index (0 to 1: best quality of life) (MD 0.10 favouring RIMN, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.21). The CIs for both results included a clinically important effect favouring RIMN but also a clinically insignificant effect in favour of locking plate fixation.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights the major limitations of the available evidence concerning current treatment interventions for fractures of the distal femur. The currently available evidence is incomplete and insufficient to inform current clinical practice. Priority should be given to a definitive, pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial comparing contemporary treatments such as locked plates and intramedullary nails. At minimum, these should report validated patient-reported functional and quality-of-life outcomes at one and two years. All trials should be reported in full using the CONSORT guidelines.

### Calcaneal skeletal traction versus elastic intramedullary nailing of displaced tibial shaft fractures in children [^111XQn22]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes and complications of patients who underwent either the calcaneal skeletal traction (CST) or the elastic intramedullary nails (EIN) procedure.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent EIN or CST surgery for tibia shaft fracture at our center from 2013 to 2018. The patient demographics, fracture characteristics, radiographic information, length of hospital stay, and medical expenses were recorded. All patients were clinically followed-up until they started to walk or for at least 6 months. The treatment outcomes and postoperative complications of the two procedures were compared.

Results

Overall, 186 patients who underwent EIN and CST were included in the study. The EIN patients had more low-energy mechanism of injury. In radiographic evaluation, significant differences were observed in distributions of fracture classification and location. Moreover, associated fibula fractures were higher in the EIN group than in the CST group. The CST procedure had faster surgical time, cast duration and lower expenses, and longer hospitalization time. Although they required more clinical visits, patients in the EIN group began exercising and endured weight-bearing earlier than those in the CST group. The average time for bone healing was 68.5 days in the EIN group, and 69.6 days in the CST group. However, the CST provided slight better results of coronal correction than EIN. Moreover, CST patients had less malalignment (> 5°) in complications. None had delay union, nonunion, and shortening over 10 mm at final assessment.

Conclusions

Both EIN and CST patients showed similar treatment outcomes. Hence, not only the characteristics of the patient and fracture, but also the individual's situation and expectation should be considered when choosing the best approach.

### Rapid remineralization of the distal radius after forearm fracture in children [^114EvmwK]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) have been shown to diminish after fracture and immobilization in adults. Distal radius fractures are common in children, and unlike adults, there is a low incidence of refracture. The primary aim of this study was to assess the change in radial BMC and BMD after upper extremity fracture and casting in healthy pediatric patients.

Methods

Patients were recruited at the time of distal radius fractures casting. The nonfractured (non-Fx) distal radius was initially scanned by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (baseline), and then both arms were scanned at the time of cast removal (CastOff), and 4, 8, 12, 24, and 52 weeks post CastOff.

Results

Twenty-one patients were enrolled (13 male, 13 Caucasian; 10.4 ± 2.5 y) with an average length of casting of 38 ± 11 days. Eighteen patients (86%) completed all protocol requirements. At CastOff, there was no significant difference in total BMC or BMD between the Fx and non-Fx arms. From CastOff to 24 weeks, the overall change in BMC and BMD for the non-Fx arm was +4.2% and +0.2%, respectively, whereas for the Fx arm, the change was +8.3% and +3.4%, respectively. By 24 weeks, the difference in the overall change in BMD between the Fx and non-Fx arms was statistically significant (greater than instrumental error; P < 0.05). However, by 52 weeks, these differences were no longer significant. The increased mineralization was unrelated to age, sex, arm dominance, or calcium intake.

Conclusions

These data show that there is rapid remineralization after a simple forearm fracture in children, with a transient elevation in BMD in the Fx arm after casting. This novel finding suggests that bone may be stronger around the site of fracture and could significantly change how we counsel young patients recovering from forearm fracture. Future research should focus on children immobilized for varying lengths of time and those with repeat fractures, using volumetric techniques of bone geometry and strength assessment.

### Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures [^117D6fkJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) comprise up to 2% of all fractures. These fractures are mostly caused by a fall from a height, and are common in younger adults. Treatment can be surgical or non-surgical; however, there is clinical uncertainty over optimal management. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus conservative treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trials registers in November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing surgical versus non-surgical management of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures in skeletally mature adults (older than 14 years of age). For surgical treatment, we included closed manipulation with percutaneous wire fixation, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) with or without bone graft, or primary arthrodesis. For non-surgical treatment, we included ice, elevation and rest, or plaster cast or splint immobilisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We collected data for the following outcomes: function in the short term (within three months of injury) or long term (more than three months after injury), chronic pain, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and ability to return to normal activities, as well as complications which may or may not have led to an unplanned return to theatre.

Main Results

We included 10 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs with 1097 participants. Sample sizes in studies ranged from 29 to 424 participants. Most participants were male (86%), and the mean age in studies ranged from 28 to 52 years. In the surgical groups, participants were mostly managed with ORIF with plates, screws, or wires; one study used only minimally invasive techniques. Participants in the non-surgical groups were managed with a plaster cast, removable splint or a bandage, or with rest, elevation, and sometimes ice. Risk of performance bias was unavoidably high in all studies as it was not possible to blind participants and personnel to treatment; in addition, some studies were at high or unclear risk of other types of bias (including high risk of selection bias for quasi-RCTs, high risk of attrition bias, and unclear risk of selective reporting bias). We downgraded the certainty of all the evidence for serious risk of bias. We also downgraded the certainty of the evidence for imprecision for all outcomes (except for complications requiring return to theatre for subtalar arthrodesis) because the evidence was derived from few participants. We downgraded the evidence for subtalar arthrodesis for inconsistency because the pooled data included high levels of statistical heterogeneity. We found that surgical management may improve function at six to 24 months after injury when measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score (mean difference (MD) 6.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 12.12; 5 studies, 319 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are not aware of a published minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the AOFAS score for this type of fracture. Previously published MCIDs for other foot conditions range from 2.0 to 7.9. No studies reported short-term function within three months of injury. Surgical management may reduce the number of people with chronic pain up to 24 months after injury (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84; 4 studies, 175 participants; low-certainty evidence); this equates to 295 per 1000 fewer people with pain after surgical management (95% CI 107 to 422 per 1000). Surgical management may also lead to improved physical HRQoL (MD 6.49, 95% CI 2.49 to 10.48; 2 studies, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence). This outcome was measured using the physical component score of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. We used a change in effect of 5% to indicate a clinically important difference for this scoring system and thus judged that the difference in HRQoL between people treated surgically or non-surgically includes both clinically relevant and not relevant changes for those treated surgically. There may be little or no difference in the number of people who returned to work within 24 months (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.68; 5 studies, 250 participants; low-certainty evidence) or who require secondary surgery for subtalar arthrodesis (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.53; 3 studies, 657 participants; low-certainty evidence). For other complications requiring return to theatre in people treated surgically, we found low-certainty evidence for amputation (2.4%; 1 study, 42 participants), implant removal (3.4%; 3 studies, 321 participants), deep infection (5.3%; 1 study, 206 participants), and wound debridement (2.7%; 1 study, 73 participants). We found low-certainty evidence that 14% of participants who were treated surgically (7 studies, 847 participants) had superficial site infection.

Authors' Conclusions

Our confidence in the evidence is limited. Although pooled evidence indicated that surgical treatment may lead to improved functional outcome but with an increased risk of unplanned second operations, we judged the evidence to be of low certainty as it was often derived from few participants in studies that were not sufficiently robust in design. We found no evidence of a difference between treatment options in the number of people who needed late reconstruction surgery for subtalar arthritis, although the estimate included the possibility of important harms and benefits. Large, well-conducted studies that attempt to minimise detection bias and that measure functional outcomes using calcaneal-specific measurement tools would increase the confidence in these findings. Given that minimally invasive surgical procedures are already becoming more prevalent in practice, research is urgently needed to determine whether these newer surgical techniques offer better outcomes with regard to function, pain, quality of life, and postoperative complications for intra-articular displaced calcaneal fractures.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for distal radius fracture, more specifically with respect to immobilization (casting), AAOS 2011 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend for or against immobilization of the elbow in patients treated with cast immobilization.

### Surgical fixation with K-wires versus casting in adults with fracture of distal radius: DRAFFT2 multicentre randomised clinical trial [^113nj96r]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with previous studies

We chose K-wire fixation as the surgical intervention comparator, as previous research indicates that K-wire fixation provides similar outcomes to the alternative plate and screw fixation for those patients in whom a closed reduction of the fracture can be achieved, with plates being reserved for fractures requiring an open reduction of the articular surface of the fracture. The use of wires reflects current UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the management of distal radius fractures. After the DRAFFT2 trial started, Karantana et al published a Cochrane review of wire fixation for adult patients with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius. This review included a total of 11 randomised or quasi-randomised trials of manipulation and plaster cast versus manipulation and K-wire fixation, involving 917 participants nearly all of whom were older adults. The authors concluded that the quality of the existing evidence was very low. All of the trials included in the review were found to be at high risk of bias, with incomplete reporting meaning that the authors were unable to draw a conclusion about the effect of the interventions on patient reported function. They did report that the risk of re-displacement of the fracture in the participants treated with manipulation and cast was very similar to that found in DRAFFT2, with an average of 12% (range 3–75%). We updated this evidence synthesis in July 2020 with a search of the NIH National Library of Medicine via PubMed.gov and did not find any other trials that attempted to answer this question.

### Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures [^113p3Gjk]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Elastic intramedullary nails — 2009 evidence synthesis and caveats: The evidence review included ten studies with one hundred varying outcomes, of which twenty-one were significant, and there were no studies that directly compared flexible nails to spica casting. When comparing flexible nails to external fixation and traction plus casting, nine significant outcomes favored flexible nails, one significant outcome favored external fixation, and one favored traction plus casting; external fixation was favored over spica casting for malunions, including anterior/posterior angulation, while twelve other outcomes for this comparison were non-significant. Two moderate quality studies show more rapid return to walking and school with flexible intramedullary nailing and one low quality study illustrates less associated hospital costs when compared to traction and casting; there is evidence that flexible intramedullary nailing has less adverse events and more rapid return to school than external fixation in both stable and unstable fractures. The work group acknowledges including their expert opinion and downgraded the Grade of this Recommendation to a "limited" recommendation; there is currently insufficient literature in specially designed pediatric rigid intramedullary nails and bridge plating for inclusion. Patients over age 11 or with weight over 49 kg are at increased risk of a poor outcome with flexible intramedullary nailing, and although mean weight differed significantly between outcome groups, weight was not independent of age and had a sensitivity of only 59% in predicting poor outcomes.

### Is external fixation in pediatric femoral fractures a risk factor for refracture? [^117CJcoy]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether external fixation is a risk factor for refracture by comparing the outcomes of children who received three different forms of treatment of femoral fractures. One hundred ninety-two patients treated for femoral fracture between 1990 and 1999 who underwent final examination were assessed. One hundred were treated with hip spica casting after traction, 57 with closed reduction and external fixation, and 35 with open reduction and external fixation. Morbidity results such as time to union, length of hospital stay, refracture, and wire site infection were statistically evaluated. Patients undergoing open reduction had a greater time to union and length of hospital stay and a higher refracture rate. The difference was statistically significant. Wire site infection occurred in all three groups; there was no statistically significant difference between groups. The authors concluded that external fixation is not a risk factor for refracture in the treatment of pediatric closed femoral diaphyseal fractures, and that it may be used with ease in clinics with shortages of personnel and space.

### Pre-operative traction for hip fractures in adults [^116b2kEo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Following a hip fracture, traction may be applied to the injured limb before surgery. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1997, and previously updated in 2006.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of traction applied to the injured limb prior to surgery for a fractured hip. Different methods of applying traction (skin or skeletal) were considered.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to April week 2 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 week 16), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 April 2011), conference proceedings, trials registries and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing either skin or skeletal traction with no traction, or skin with skeletal traction for patients with an acute hip fracture prior to surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Additional information was sought from all trialists. Wherever appropriate and possible, data were pooled.

Main Results

One new trial was included in this update. In all, 11 trials (six were randomised and five were quasi-randomised), involving a total of 1654 predominantly elderly patients with hip fractures, are included in the review. Most trials were at risk of bias, particularly that resulting from inadequate allocation concealment, lack of assessor blinding and incomplete outcome assessment. Only very limited data pooling was possible. Ten trials compared predominantly skin traction with no traction. The available data provided no evidence of benefit from traction either in the relief of pain (pain soon after immobilisation (visual analogue score 0: none to 10: worst pain): mean difference 0.11, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.50; 3 trials), ease of fracture reduction or quality of fracture reduction at time of surgery. There were inconclusive data for pressures sores and other complications, including fracture fixation failure. Three minor adverse effects (sensory disturbance and skin blisters) related to skin traction were reported. One of the above trials included both skin and skeletal traction groups. This trial and one other compared skeletal traction with skin traction and found no important differences between these two methods, although the initial application of skeletal traction was noted as being more painful and more costly.

Authors' Conclusions

From the evidence available, the routine use of traction (either skin or skeletal) prior to surgery for a hip fracture does not appear to have any benefit. However, the evidence is also insufficient to rule out the potential advantages for traction, in particular for specific fracture types, or to confirm additional complications due to traction use. Given the increasing lack of evidence for the use of pre-operative traction, the onus should now be on clinicians who persist in using pre-operative traction to either stop using it or to use it only in the context of a well-designed randomised controlled trial.

### Clinical risk assessment model to predict venous thromboembolism risk after immobilization for lower-limb trauma [^113yWQ83]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines for thromboprophylaxis and therefore practices vary widely among countries, ranging from the absence of preventive anticoagulation in the USto thromboprophylaxis for all patients for whom plantar support is not possible in France. This variation can be explained by the lack of convincing evidence when these guidelines were written. Some trials showed efficacy of thromboprophylaxis on asymptomatic VTE for patients following lower-limb cast immobilization. However, the recent POT-CAST trial failed to demonstrate efficacy of LMWH versus no treatment on the 3-month cumulative incidence of symptomatic VTE with a relative risk of 0.8 (95%CI, 0.3–1.7). Contrary, a recent Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis, including these RCTs, showed moderate-quality evidence in favor of thromboprophylaxis for patients with brace or casting. Yet, concerning the methodological issues for many of these trials (e.g. doubtful classification of symptomatic events), inconsistency between the efficacy on asymptomatic vs symptomatic VTE, publication bias towards efficacy and high number needed to treat (250 based on POT-CAST), the quality of evidence was downgraded. The final conclusion of the authors was that future research should give more directives on specific advice for different patients or patients groups, based on patient and trauma characteristics. This goal has now come nearer with the TRiP(cast) score.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^113L9Z4N]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Barton et alreported an association between radial shortening and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation score at a mean of 29 months after treatment with k-wire fixation among patients aged 55 years and older. Likewise, Brogren et alreported worse Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores among adult patients with malunion diagnosed 2 years after treatment with casting or pinning. Our results are more similar to previous investigations, that reported no association between fracture alignment and PROs in older patients. The WRIST trial provided evidence that, although more than 50% of casting participants experience malunion, casting provides long-term outcomes that are indistinguishable from those of participants treated with surgical procedures. Furthermore, casting patients experienced these outcomes with fractures of equal severity compared with surgical participants.

Although the 24-month EFP outcomes were no different than those for the other treatments, for Colles type fractures that are common in older adults with osteoporosis, EFP is not ideal. EFP is inadequate in restoring anatomic alignment and is cumbersome for older adults. Furthermore, pin site infection is a constant concern with the exposed pins. Finally, the WRIST investigators experienced difficulty enrolling eligible participants because they did not want to risk randomization into EFP. Avoiding randomization was cited by 46% of declining patients, and 4 enrolled participants who were randomized to EFP refused to have the procedure. However, EFP is still applicable for severely comminuted fractures or for those requiring temporary stabilization during infection.

Limitations

One limitation of this study is low participant retention, in particular for the casting group. Participants who did not complete follow-up assessments were also older, less active, current smokers, more likely to be Asian, and tended to be in worse health, and their exclusion may result in an overestimation of any improvements between 12 and 24 months. Despite adjusting for baseline characteristics that are associated with missing 24-month outcomes, the differential missingness associated with these measured and unmeasured baseline characteristics could have made our results appear more favorable for casting than may actually have been the case. Conversely, patients who did not return for 24-month assessments may have done so because they were satisfied with their recovery, thus underestimating 12- to 24-month improvements. Despite the limitation, similar profiles in mean MHQ summary scores over time across missing data patterns within each treatment groups suggest no evidence for biases.

### Review of lower extremity traction in current orthopaedic trauma [^1165mEAN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Although methods of traction for temporizing and definitive treatment of orthopaedic injuries are described in dated textbooks, current literature and recommendations on the use of skin and skeletal traction in orthopaedic trauma are lacking. Elaborate traction schemas have been described, but few of them have been retained in practice and even fewer have been supported by scientific data. Several options exist for traction modalities that involve the pelvis and lower extremities, including portable traction devices and traction pins.

### Circumferential casting of distal radius fractures [^113C42AH]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence and predictive factors for the early cast alteration (splitting, trimming, and complete replacement) in patients with distal radius fractures (DRFs) treated in circumferential cast. To determine whether performing early cast alterations affects the fracture alignment.

Design

Retrospective Cohort Study.

Setting

Level 1 Trauma Center.

Patients

All adult patients who presented with a DRF to a tertiary care hospital over a 3-year period.

Intervention

All DRFs without immediate surgical indications are initially treated with circumferential casts at this center.

Outcome Measurements

The following variables were analyzed: patient demographics, polytrauma at the time of injury, physician subspecialty performing reduction, and type of cast alteration. Radiographs were used to assess initial fracture characteristics and secondary displacement of reduction over time. Analysis was performed primarily to identify predictive variables for the early cast alteration and secondarily to determine the effect of these alterations on fracture alignment.

Results

296 patients were included in the study. One of every 4–5 patients had their cast altered within the first 10 days of treatment. One of 3 polytrauma patients had their cast altered. No type of cast alteration was found to be significantly predictive of loss of fracture alignment at 2 or 6 weeks.

Conclusions

Cast alteration is commonplace after casting of DRFs but is not associated with the loss of alignment. Patients with polytrauma may benefit from immediate cast splitting.

Level Of Evidence

Prognostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Surgical treatment of distal femur fractures in geriatric patients [^114sXQBi]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fractures of the distal femur account for approximately 0.4% of all human fractures and 3% to 6% of all femoral fractures. While these fractures mainly occur due to high-velocity accidents in young patients, low-energy trauma from ground-level falls can cause similar fracture patterns in the elderly population. The treatment of geriatic patients can be especially challenging due to poor bone quality, preexisting implants (eg, knee or hip arthroplasty), and impaired compliance during rehabilitation in mentally and physically restricted patients. Perioperative complication and mortality rates of distal femur fractures are similar to fractures of the proximal femur but have not been assessed as thoroughly. Patients with distal femur fractures aged 80 years or older face high mortality rates of up to 33% after 12 months and 50% after 5 years. The treatment options have evolved over the past decades due to a better understanding of fracture patterns and biology, as well as the development of biomechanically improved implants. In the 1960s, closed treatment with traction was found to have more satisfactory results compared with patients treated with osteosyntheses. In 1974, Schatzker et alshared their "Toronto experience" demonstrating good results for internal fixation in 75% of the cases, compared to 32% for nonoperative treatment with an ischial cast, concluding that operative treatment posed a valid therapeutic option. Nonetheless, in 1995, Karpman et aldescribed an above-knee amputation being necessary in 9% of patients with distal femur fractures and osteoporotic bone due to displacement of fractures or infections, proposing primary amputation as a treatment option in selected patients.

With the introduction of angular stable implants, the options for operative treatment have greatly increased. Various implants and techniques for internal fixation of distal femur fractures are available including intramedullary nailing with different distal locking features, lateral locking plates, and primary distal femoral arthroplasty. Since 2013, all patients admitted to our clinic with distal femur fractures have been treated with distal femur locking plates. The aim of this analysis was to assess the mortality, local, and systemic morbidity as well as functional results in geriatric patients having a distal femur fracture.

### Cast-OFF trial: one versus 4 to 5 weeks of plaster cast immobilization for nonreduced distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical feasibility trial [^117LcWri]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Distal radius fracture is a common fracture of which the incidence appears to be increasing worldwide. This pilot study investigated whether 1 week of plaster cast is feasible for nonreduced (stable fractures including nondisplaced and displaced fractures) distal radius fractures.

Methods

The study was a multicenter randomized clinical feasibility trial including patients from regional acute care providers. Patients with a nonreduced distal radius fracture were included in the study. Nonreduced fractures meant intra-articular or extra-articular fractures and including nondisplaced and minimal displaced fractures (dorsal angulation less than 5°-10°, maximum radial shortening of 2 mm, and maximum radial shift of 2 mm) not needing a reduction. Forty Patients were included and randomized. After 1 week of plaster cast, patients were randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups: plaster cast removed (intervention group) versus 4 to 5 weeks of plaster cast (control group).

Results

The analysis shows no significant differences between the 2 groups in having less pain, better function after 6 weeks, and better overall patient satisfaction. No difference was shown in secondary displacement between the 2 groups (control 1 vs intervention 0)

Conclusion

One week of plaster cast treatment for nonreduced distal radius fracture is feasible, preferred by patients, with at least the same functional outcome and pain scores.

Level of Evidence

According to the Oxford 2011 level of evidence, the level of evidence of this study is 2.

### Orthopaedic traumatology: fundamental principles and current controversies for the acute care surgeon [^111hDMS7]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Initial management

Initial management for a fracture is realignment and splinting. Realignment and splinting improve pain control, arterial flow, venous drainage and decreases soft tissue tension caused by displaced fractures. Furthermore, realignment and splinting can decrease the potential volume around the fracture diminishing the amount of bleeding. Displaced fractures may also result in nerve impingement that can be relieved with realignment. A dislocated joint should be urgently reduced to prevent further damage to the ligaments, tendons, neurovascular structures and the inner chondral surfaces. Splints are non-circumferential and are molded or otherwise secured around a limb to accommodate swelling.

Casts are circumferential, made from plaster or synthetic material. Focal pressure over a bony prominence can cause skin and soft tissue pressure necrosis, hence the need for careful application and extra padding over threatened skin.

Traction improves alignment, reduces fracture motion and can be used as a temporary measure until definitive fixation. An example of this would be the multiple-injured patient with a severe head injury with elevated intracranial pressures and a femur fracture. Length and alignment of the femur fracture can be maintained in traction until the brain injury improves enough for the patient to tolerate non-cranial invasive procedures. Both skeletal and cutaneous traction may be used in a safe manner, however skeletal traction is typically preferred over cutaneous, especially for prolonged delays.

### Variability in the follow-up management of pediatric femoral fractures [^113gEXtX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Complications and/or expected sequelae were found to increase the duration of time that patients were followed for in this study. The main documented expected sequelae was leg-length discrepancy, with all cases but one resolving or becoming clinically insignificant without the need for additional intervention. The main documented true complications were cast irritation, infection, and notable pain. The average time until complications and expected sequelae arose was approximately 6 months, with the latest documented sequelae being leg-length discrepancy occurring at 43 months after injury. Aside from two patients, all complications occurred within 2 years of the initial injury. This indicates that the current standard teaching of 2-year follow-up is sufficient, although potentially unnecessary, with the overall number of complications remaining low. There was a large range in the duration of time until patients presented with complications, and an overall small number of patients who experienced complications, making it hard to draw definite conclusions. Furthermore, there was no appreciable pattern in which specific complications were presented earlier versus later in treatment.

Because our institution is responsible for specialist pediatric care spanning a wide geographic region, families may be required to travel in from distant locations for follow-up clinic visits. Ideally, patients should be followed long enough to monitor for and identify all potential complications/sequelae while also limiting nonessential patient visits such that time and financial costs could be minimized for families.

This study has a number of limitations. Owing to its retrospective nature, the quality of data collected was dependent on the information available in electronic health records; therefore, certain variables were not available to assess because of inconsistent reporting in patient charts. These include leg dominance, height, weight, medications given in the emergency department and prescribed on discharge, referral to physiotherapy, and casting and implant materials. In addition, the small sample size limited the types of statistical analyses that were suitable to conduct (eg, subgroup analyses were not feasible), particularly when stratifying follow-up data by the surgeon. Most current literature assesses fewer variables, including smaller age ranges, fewer numbers of treatment options, and a fewer numbers of fracture types. This patient cohort included a wide range of fracture patterns and ages, creating the potential for large variability from this alone and making it difficult to draw conclusions about them as a whole. In addition, the list of search terms may not be fully exhaustive, and it is therefore possible that a small number of cases have been missed in this analysis. Finally, the surgeons in this study saw different volumes of patients, and the patients may have differed in ways not measured.

### Use of cast immobilisation versus removable brace in adults with an ankle fracture: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^111zcuTM]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This pragmatic, multicentre, superiority randomised controlled trial was undertaken at 20 trauma units in the UK National Health Service. The trial protocol (see supplementary file 1) was accepted for publication on 31 October 2018 and first published online on 18 December 2018. The independent trial steering committee and data and safety monitoring committee approved the statistical analysis plan. These independent committees were convened to oversee the study throughout the trial's duration.

Participants

Trauma research teams at UK NHS trust sites screened adults aged 18 years and older with a closed ankle fracture. In this pragmatic study design, if the treating clinician would usually treat the fracture in a cast for a minimum of three weeks, whether treated non-operatively or operatively, then the patient was considered eligible. Therefore, patients did not meet the initial criteria for entry to the study if the clinician decided that no immobilisation (cast or brace) was required.

On further screening, people were excluded if they had a fracture secondary to known metastatic disease, complex intra-articular fracture (eg, Pilon fracture), wound complications contraindicating a removable bracing, pre-existing neuropathic joint disease, previous ankle fracture already randomised in the present trial, were unable to adhere to trial follow-up procedures, or required close contact casting.

Indications for first line definitive management (operative or non-operative) were according to usual practice for each individual clinician, as were any adjunctive treatments (eg, antibiotic use). The trial population included patients managed both operatively and non-operatively.

Operatively managed participants had initially received standard local clinical care in the UK, typically consisting of a temporary partial backslab, and wound check about two weeks after surgery. At this point in the care pathway, randomisation processes were completed and a member of the clinical team applied the intervention.

Non-operatively managed participants completed the randomisation processes immediately at presentation to the trauma service, when a member of the clinical team then applied the cast or removable brace. As it is usual clinical practice in the UK to delay decisions about first line non-operative management (ie, to check if the fracture is stable) for some patients, our eligibility criteria allowed up to three weeks before a definitive decision was required.

### External fixation versus conservative treatment for distal radial fractures in adults [^113WxhLt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture of the distal radius ('broken wrist') is a common clinical problem. It can be treated conservatively, usually involving wrist immobilisation in a plaster cast, or surgically. A key method of surgical fixation is external fixation.

Objectives

To evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing external fixation with conservative treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials involving adults with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared external fixation with conservative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

After independent study selection by all review authors, two authors independently assessed the included trials. Independent data extraction of new trials was performed by two authors. Pooling of data was undertaken where appropriate.

Main Results

Fifteen heterogeneous trials, involving 1022 adults with dorsally displaced and potentially or evidently unstable distal radial fractures, were included. While all trials compared external fixation versus plaster cast immobilisation, there was considerable variation especially in terms of patient characteristics and interventions. Methodological weaknesses among these trials included lack of allocation concealment and inadequate outcome assessment. External fixation maintained reduced fracture positions (redisplacement requiring secondary treatment: 7/356 versus 51/338 (data from 9 trials); relative risk 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.32) and prevented late collapse and malunion compared with plaster cast immobilisation. There was insufficient evidence to confirm a superior overall functional or clinical result for the external fixation group. External fixation was associated with a high number of complications, such as pin-track infection, but many of these were minor. Probably, some complications could have been avoided using a different surgical technique for pin insertion. There was insufficient evidence to establish a difference between the two groups in serious complications such as reflex sympathetic dystropy: 25/384 versus 17/347 (data from 11 trials); relative risk 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 2.32.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults. Though there is insufficient evidence to confirm a better functional outcome, external fixation reduces redisplacement, gives improved anatomical results and most of the excess surgically-related complications are minor.

### Assessment of distal radius fracture complications among adults 60 years or older: a secondary analysis of the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^1164GpJj]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are the second most prevalent fracture in elderly individuals and affect more than 85 000 older Americans each year. Distal radius fractures are associated with substantial increases in health care consumption. In the 6-month period following a DRF, the average Medicare beneficiary incurs $7700 more in charges relative to prefracture levels. Annually, DRFs cost $535 million in direct medical expenses alone. Treatment of DRFs can be managed via casting, internal fixation, external fixation, or percutaneous pinning. Casting is noninvasive but malunion or fracture collapse can ensue. Internal fixation maintains fracture alignment but is an invasive surgical procedure. External fixation and pinning are less invasive and less expensive, but pin site infections frequently occur. Despite decades of experience in DRF management, there is no consensus as to the optimal treatment modality, especially for older individuals.

Complications result in additional use of resources and time and can quadruple surgical costs. Published complication rates after DRF treatment vary widely, with rates ranging from 0% to 47%. Furthermore, a systematic review found that some studies did not report complications at all. When they are reported, complications are limited to a subset of serious or rare complications. Few investigators use a uniform or a standardized reporting method. This is likely because complications are frequently assessed as a secondary or even tertiary outcome with less precise estimates than those used for functional or patient-reported outcomes. Prognostic factors associated with complications after DRF treatment are rarely evaluated adequately. To overcome these shortcomings, we performed a secondary analysis of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial (WRIST), a randomized clinical trial that enrolled participants at 24 sites in the United States, Canada, and Singapore.

The aims of the current study are to characterize complications experienced by WRIST participants through 12-month follow-up to determine whether complication frequency or type is associated with treatment modality, and to determine predictors of 12-month complications. We hypothesized that participants treated with internal fixation with a volar locking plate system (VLPS) will have fewer complications than other participants.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of hip fractures in older adults [^112e9ZFW]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — preoperative traction in hip fracture: Preoperative traction should not routinely be used for patients with a hip fracture. Quality of Evidence: High. Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Evidence cited notes that a position splint resulted in significant difference in immobilization comfort score (30.1/100) and pain compared to traction; Endo found no differences in pain and no significant differences in complications between traction and no traction; and preoperative traction resulted in more pre-operative complications than a position splint applied for 1 day preoperatively. The recommendation reflects that there are some instances in which traction may be required (e.g., specific cases with peri-trochanteric fractures), however, in most cases pre-operative traction should not be used. There are no known harms of implementing this recommendation, not using preoperative traction may decrease cost/resource utilization compared to bedrest with positioning for comfort using pillows, and use of alternatives to preoperative traction appeared to be acceptable to patients.

### Metacarpal neck fractures: results of treatment with traction reduction and cast immobilization [^116Lj9jt]. Hand (2009). Low credibility.

Although fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck (boxer's fractures) are common, their treatment can be problematic. A description of a technique utilizing traction reduction is presented in this paper. The records and radiographs of 59 patients who underwent reduction using longitudinal traction and subsequent immobilization in a specially molded cast were retrospectively reviewed. On average, 80% of initial fracture angulation in the sagittal plane was corrected, and only 1 degrees of this correction was lost at the discontinuation of casting (3–4 weeks). We have found this technique to be highly effective in the treatment of boxer's fractures. Advantages of this treatment include its efficacy, ease, and improved patient tolerance over other casting techniques.

### Splints and casts: indications and methods | AAFP… [^1138bjZD]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

3, 4 Casting involves circumferential application of plaster or fiberglass to an extremity. Casts provide superior immobilization, but are less forgiving and have higher complication rates. Therefore, they are usually reserved for complex and/or definitive fracture management. Application of any immobilizer comes with potential complications, including ischemia, heat injury, pressure sores, skin breakdown, infection, dermatitis, neurologic injury, and compartment syndrome. These conditions can occur regardless of how long the device is used. RADIAL GUTTER CAST Common Uses. Definitive or alternative treatment of fractures initially managed with a radial gutter splint. Application. Placement of the casting materials is similar to that of the radial gutter splint, except the plaster or fiberglass is wrapped circumferentially. The cast is usually placed two to seven days after the initial injury to allow for resolution of swelling. Pearls and Pitfalls.

Minimal angulation or rotation at the fracture site may cause functional problems, such as difficulty with grasp, pinch, or opposition. Therefore, meticulous evaluation and follow-up are essential. THUMB SPICA CAST Common Uses. Suspected or nondisplaced, distal fractures of the scaphoid; nonangulated, nondisplaced, extra-articular fractures of the base of the first metacarpal. Application. The cast uses the same position of function as described for a thumb spica splint, but requires circumferential application of casting materials. 8 Non-displaced distal fractures of the scaphoid have a greater potential to heal and may be placed in a short arm thumb spica cast and reevaluated out of the cast by radiography in two weeks. 2, 9 Nondisplaced fractures of the middle or proximal one third of the scaphoid are treated with a long arm thumb spica cast initially and require vigilant monitoring for nonunion.
2. SHORT ARM CAST Common Uses.

Nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures of the distal wrist, such as Colles and Smith fractures or greenstick, buckle, and physeal fractures in children; carpal bone fractures other than scaphoid or trapezium. Application. The cast extends from the proximal one third of the forearm to the distal palmar crease volarly and just proximal to the MCP joints dorsally.

### Targeted prophylactic anticoagulation based on the TRiP (cast) score in patients with lower limb immobilisation: a multicentre, stepped wedge, randomised implementation trial [^114pCjqW]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Prophylactic anticoagulation in emergency department patients with lower limb trauma requiring immobilisation is controversial. The Thrombosis Risk Prediction for Patients with Cast Immobilisation-TRiP(cast)-score could identify a large subgroup of patients at low risk of venous thromboembolism for whom prophylactic anticoagulation can be safely withheld. We aimed to prospectively assess the safety of withholding anticoagulation for patients with lower limb trauma at low risk of venous thromboembolism, defined by a TRiP(cast) score of less than 7.

Methods

CASTING was a stepped-wedge, multicentre, cluster-randomised trial with blinded outcome assessment. 15 emergency departments in France and Belgium were selected and randomly assigned staggered start dates for switching from the control phase (ie, anticoagulation prescription according to the physician's usual practice) to the intervention phase (ie, targeted anticoagulation according to TRiP(cast) score: no prescription if score < 7 and anticoagulation if score was ≥ 7). Patients were included if they presented to a participating emergency department with lower limb trauma requiring immobilisation for at least 7 days and were aged 18 years or older. The primary outcome was the 3-month cumulative rate of symptomatic venous thromboembolism during the intervention phase in patients with a TRiP(cast) score of less than 7. The targeted strategy was considered safe if this rate was less than 1% with an upper 95% CI of less than 2%. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04064489).

Findings

Between June 16, 2020, and Sept 15, 2021, 15 clusters and 2120 patients were included. Of the 1505 patients analysed in the intervention phase, 1159 (77.0%) had a TRiP(cast) score of less than 7 and did not receive anticoagulant treatment. The symptomatic venous thromboembolism rate was 0.7% (95% CI 0.3–1.4, n = 8/1159). There was no difference between the control and the intervention phases in the cumulative rate of symptomatic venous thromboembolism or in bleeding rates.

Interpretation

Patients with a TRiP(cast) score of less than 7 who are not receiving anticoagulation have a very low risk of venous thromboembolism. A large proportion of patients with lower limb trauma and immobilisation could safely avoid thromboprophylaxis.

### Cast-OFF trial: one versus 4 to 5 weeks of plaster cast immobilization for nonreduced distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical feasibility trial [^1129STRR]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

An intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analysis was performed to compare the outcomes between the control and intervention group. For the per protocol analysis, we compared the intervention and control group, not based on the randomization but based on the treatment they received. Descriptive analysis with median, range, and percentage was used to describe demographic variables.

All reported P values are 2-sided and are considered significant at P < .05.

For missing data from patients who fulfilled the study, we analyzed the available data.

The results from the PRWE, DASH, pain indicated on a VAS and with the PROMIS Pain Interference score, and Quality of life (SF-36) were analyzed with a bivariate analysis. The association between Patient-Rated Outcome (PRO) scores and treatment group was investigated in multilevel linear mixed model with an unstructured parameterization for longitudinal covariance. Age, sex, VAS pain score, and fracture classification were used as fixed factors with time as the random factor. We used a random intercept and slope model. To investigate whether rate of change in PRO score over time was different between the intervention and control group, we studied the interaction between treatment (control vs intervention) group and time. We used the per-protocol analysis for the multilevel linear mixed analysis. The difference in complication rate was determined using a Fisher exact test.

### Management of pediatric femur fracture using 90–90 traction [^112ddxEP]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

This video discusses treatment of pediatric femur fractures using 90–90 traction, followed by delayed spica casting. This study details the treatment of a 2-year-old girl with a subtrochanteric femur fracture featuring a 4-cm acute shortening and severe malalignment. The patient was placed in 90–90 traction in the operative setting. When adequate callous was observed radiographically, the patient was treated with a spica cast in the hospital on day 16. She was noted to have obtained uneventful healing of the fracture with no functional deficits, as detailed during serial office visits.

Despite advances in surgical techniques and technology, casting remains an important treatment modality in the armamentarium of orthopedic surgery. Opportunities for skill development and complication management are a decreasing commodity for the surgeon in training. Appropriate indications for casting and technical expertise of cast application are key to complication avoidance. Prompt recognition and evaluation of potential complications are key to optimizing patient outcomes. Following the lead of the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery Resident Skills Modules, we implore teaching institutions to develop and maintain robust teaching programs, skills acquisitions laboratories, and assessments for confirmation of competency for all residency programs.

### The pediatric "Floating knee" injury: a state-of-the-art multicenter study [^114xDwS1]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Isolated femoral and tibial fractures are 2 of the top 5 causes of pediatric orthopaedic hospital admission, yet their simultaneous ipsilateral presentation, the "floating knee" injury, remains rare. Historically, treatment consisted of traction and cast immobilization, which resulted in prolonged periods of immobilization, lengthy hospitalizations, and high rates of malunion. As such, previous authors have recommended fixation of at least 1 bone in the setting of a floating knee injury. This strategy, however, has never been evaluated and the outcomes of modern treatment are unknown.

Methods

We performed a multicenter retrospective review of the records of pediatric patients with ipsilateral femoral and tibial fractures that had been treated at 11 tertiary care level-I pediatric trauma centers from 2004 to 2014. Outcomes and treatment strategies were assessed with standardized means.

Results

Over the study period, 130 floating knees in 129 patients met the inclusion criteria for evaluation. The average patient age was 10.2 years, and 63.1% were male. One-third of the patients presented with open injuries, and 83.8% of injuries were related to vehicular trauma. Simple diaphyseal fractures (OTA/AO 32-A and B femoral fractures and OTA/AO 42-A and B tibial fractures) were most common. Intramedullary fixation (rigid or flexible) was the most common treatment strategy for femoral fractures (69.2%). Tibial fractures were treated most commonly with casting (27.7%), followed by flexible intramedullary nailing (24.6%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 9.7 days. Outcomes were excellent in 66.6% of cases and good in 26.4% of cases.

Conclusions

Previous literature on pediatric floating knee injuries consisted of small case series that were published prior to the introduction of flexible intramedullary nailing to North America. This multicenter study of a large cohort demonstrates a change in practice pattern from a largely nonoperative treatment strategy to operative fixation of at least the femoral fracture. In the present study, this approach led to good or excellent results in 93.1% of cases and was associated with a short duration of hospitalization.

### Surgical fixation with K-wires versus casting in adults with fracture of distal radius: DRAFFT2 multicentre randomised clinical trial [^111778Fw]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

The strengths of DRAFFT2 were the use of multiple centres and clinicians reflecting the care provided across a healthcare system; the large number of participants, including adults of all ages; and the use of validated patient reported outcomes.

Recruiting patients to trials in the context of urgent surgery is difficult. A concern before this trial started was that patients, surgeons, or both would not be willing to take part. In fact, only 196 patients declined to take part in the study. A bigger limitation was equipoise within the surgical community. Four hundred and ninety five potentially eligible patients were not offered the chance to take part in the trial because the treating surgeon had a clinical preference for a particular treatment; 120 patients were offered K-wire fixation, 31 manipulation and cast, and 344 other treatments or unspecified. Although these numbers are low in relation to the total of 2636 patients who were screened as part of the study, they may affect the external validity of the trial. A further anticipated limitation was crossover of participants from the allocated intervention. However, only 27 of the 500 participants did not receive their allocated intervention. The secondary per protocol analysis of participants who received their allocated intervention confirmed the results of the primary intention to treat analysis, finding no evidence of a difference between the groups.

Loss to follow-up in a trial can reduce the generalisability of the results. Seventy nine per cent of patients in this trial provided primary outcome data, and this was in keeping with the loss to follow-up of 20% planned for in the sample size calculation, which indicated a minimum of 460 participants be recruited. As the trial recruited 500 participants, we can be confident that this clinical trial had the intended level of statistical precision, and this is evidenced by the relatively narrow confidence intervals.

The final major limitation of the trial was that neither the treating clinicians nor the participants could be blind to the interventions. This is inevitable for surgical interventions in which the treatment is clearly visible to the patients. Assessment bias was minimised by the fact that the surgeons providing the interventions played no part in the assessment of the participants' outcomes.

### Three week versus six week immobilisation for stable Weber B type ankle fractures: randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial [^115t9tnB]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and blinding

Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1 ratio) to the six week cast, three week cast, or three week orthosis group using sealed and consecutively numbered, opaque envelopes. A biostatistician who was not involved in the clinical care of the patients prepared the envelopes using a computerised random number generator. Allocation was stratified by site and blocked within stratums using random permuted blocks (block size 6, 9, and 12). After consent had been obtained, the orthopaedic surgeon on-call individually randomised participants by opening the next available numbered envelope. These surgeons were not involved in further treatment of the participants. Blinding of participants was not possible because of the nature of the interventions. The unblinded participants self reported the primary outcomes, but the outcome assessors (trained study physiotherapists) of other study outcomes and doctors carrying out the follow-up visits were blinded to group allocation when possible.

### Closed reduction methods for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^112AgTY5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem, particularly in older white women with osteoporosis. Displaced fractures are usually reduced using closed reduction methods, which are non-surgical and generally comprise traction and manipulation, and the resulting position stabilised by external means, typically plaster cast immobilisation.

Objectives

To examine the evidence for the relative effectiveness of different methods of closed reduction for displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (to July 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to July week 4 2002), EMBASE (1988 to 2002 week 31), CINAHL (1982 to June week 4 2002), the UK National Research Register (Issue 2, 2002) and reference lists of articles. We also handsearched the British Volume of the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery supplements (1996 onwards), and abstracts of the American Orthopaedic Trauma Association annual meetings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials evaluating different methods of closed reduction. We also included trials in which the use (or not) of anaesthesia could be classed as a co-intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

All trials judged as fitting the selection criteria by both reviewers were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted independently by one reviewer and checked by the other. Quantitative data are presented using relative risks or mean differences together with 95 per cent confidence limits. No pooling was possible.

Main Results

Three trials involving a total of 404, mainly female and older, patients with displaced fractures of the distal radius were included. These failed to assess functional outcome, and only one trial reported on complications. One trial found no statistically significant differences between mechanical reduction using finger trap traction and manual reduction in anatomical outcomes. One trial compared a novel method of manual reduction where the non-anaesthetised patient actively provided counter-traction versus traditional manual reduction under intravenous regional anaesthesia. While patients of the novel method group suffered more, yet not intolerable, pain during the reduction procedure, the latter was shorter in duration. No differences in anatomical outcome were detected. The third study compared mechanical reduction involving a special device without anaesthesia versus manual reduction under haematoma block (local anaesthesia). Less pain during the reduction procedure was recorded for the mechanical traction group. Both methods yielded similar radiological results. Fewer patients in the mechanical traction group had signs of neurological impairment, mainly finger numbness, at five weeks but this difference was not statistically significant by one year.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of closed reduction used in the treatment of displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults. Given the many unresolved questions over the management of these fractures, we suggest an integrated programme of research, which includes consideration of reduction methods, is the way forward.

### Use of cast immobilisation versus removable brace in adults with an ankle fracture: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1143b4Qu]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This randomised controlled trial found no statically significant difference in ankle function between a plaster cast and a removable fixed angle brace at 16 weeks in adults with an ankle fracture. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval effectively excluded any possibility that one intervention was superior to the other.

No clinically relevant differences were found in Olerud Molander ankle score at secondary time points or in the secondary outcome measures of Manchester-Oxford foot questionnaire, disability rating index, quality of life, and complications. We found no statistically significant differences in the safety profiles of serious complications across both interventions. A higher number of complications occurred in the removable brace group, particularly wound breakdown (7 v 15), wound infection (10 v 19), and need for further surgery (4 v 8). The study was not, however, powered to detect a difference in these secondary outcomes.

Comparison with other studies

A Cochrane review identified 10 randomised controlled trials that compared a removable type of immobilisation and early movement with a cast and no early movement (n = 531). In our updated search, we identified four subsequent randomised controlled trials (n = 451). One trial (n = 50) was the Ankle Injury Rehabilitation feasibility study to this current study and made no inferences to clinical effectiveness. A further study (n = 110) concluded that removable bracing was superior at six weeks, but the difference on the Olerud Molander ankle score diminished by 12 weeks. These findings were supported by a further randomised controlled trial that used a visual analogue scale pain score as a primary measure (n = 44). The largest randomised controlled trial (n = 247) indicated non-inferiority of removable bracing at 6, 12, and 52 weeks using the Olerud Molander ankle score. No trials found a difference in safety profiles of removable bracing compared with cast.

This trial did not find any clinically relevant differences between traditional cast compared with removable brace management at any time point, in keeping with previous trials.

### Thromboprophylaxis in lower limb immobilisation after injury (TiLLI) [^114b5Pob]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

We conducted a further systematic review and engaged topic experts to try and identify available RAMs for use in this population. This work identified seven RAMs, three of which have undergone attempted external validation. Variation and essential characteristics of the identified RAMs are presented in table 2. All studies looking to derive or externally validate a RAM were deemed to be at high risk of bias and did not report discrimination or calibration within an appropriate external population.

Table 2
Summary of design characteristics and threshold levels of identified RAMs

Prognostic accuracy measures for the three scores evaluated in two validation studies are presented in table 3. RAM sensitivity varies from 57.1% to 92.6% and specificity varies from 4.76% to 60.8%. As an ordinal score with additional validation data, The L-TRiP(cast) RAM is displayed in this table using thresholds denoting optimal performance and to allow direct comparison with other validated scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the L-TRiP(cast) score ranged from 0.77 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.87) in the derivation cohort to 0.77 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.96) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.99) in the two subsequent validation cohorts. In addition, subsequent retrospective evaluation of the L-TRiP(cast) score within the POT-CAST cohort reports a lower area under the curve value of 0.69 (95% CI 0.58, 0.80). As such, although the concept of a RAM is intuitive in this situation, the available supporting evidence is weak. Further RAMs (such as the Trauma, Immobilisation and Patients' Characteristics (TIP) score) continue to be published using Delphi consensus methodology and other derivation techniques, reporting improved performance metrics on internal validation. All proposed RAMS remain in need of robust external validation.

### Comparison of titanium elastic nails with traction and a spica cast to treat femoral fractures in children [^111sidcB]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Titanium elastic nails are commonly used to stabilize femoral fractures in school-aged children, but there have been few studies assessing the risks and benefits of this procedure compared with those of traditional traction and application of a spica cast. This prospective cohort study was designed to evaluate these two methods of treatment, with a specific focus on the first year after injury, the period when the treatment method should have the greatest impact.

Methods

Eighty-three consecutive children, six to sixteen years of age, were studied prospectively. Factors that were analyzed included clinical and radiographic data, complications, hospital charges, and outcome data. Outcome and recovery were assessed both with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Pediatric Outcomes Data Collections Instrument, version 2.0, and according to a series of important recovery milestones including the time to walking with aids, time to independent walking, time absent from school, and time until full activity was allowed.

Results

Thirty-five children (thirty-five fractures), with a mean age of 8.7 years, were treated with traction and application of a spica cast, and forty-eight children (forty-nine fractures), with a mean age of 10.2 years, were treated with titanium elastic nails. All fractures healed, and no child sustained a complication that was expected to cause permanent disability. At one year after the fracture, eighty of the children had acceptable alignment and no inequality between the lengths of the lower extremities. The remaining three children, who had an unsatisfactory result, had been treated with traction and a spica cast. Twelve patients (34%) treated with traction and a cast had a complication compared with ten patients (21%) treated with titanium elastic nails. Compared with the children treated with traction and a cast, those treated with titanium elastic nails had shorter hospitalization, walked with support sooner, walked independently sooner, and returned to school earlier. These differences were significant (p < 0.0001). We could detect no difference in total hospital charges between the two groups.

Conclusions

The results of this prospective study support the recent empiric observations and published results of retrospective series indicating that a child in whom a femoral fracture is treated with titanium elastic nails achieves recovery milestones significantly faster than a child treated with traction and a spica cast. Hospital charges for the two treatment methods are similar. The complication rate associated with nailing compares favorably with that associated with traction and application of a spica cast.

### Use of cast immobilisation versus removable brace in adults with an ankle fracture: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^115hza9g]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

The target between group difference for the primary Olerud Molander ankle score outcome was 10 points, consistent with other studies of ankle fracture management — this is the accepted minimally clinically important difference. The standard deviation of the Olerud Molander ankle score from previous feasibility work was 28 points, so we used a conservative estimate of 30 points for the sample size calculation. With significance set at the 5% level and at 90% power, we determined that we needed data on 382 participants. Allowing for 20% loss to follow up, 478 participants were required. As recruitment exceeded planned expectations, to improve precision of our effect size estimate we obtained relevant approvals to continue recruiting to the predefined end recruitment date. The study was not powered to detect differences in the secondary outcome measures.

The primary analysis was the Olerud Molander ankle score at 16 weeks. The planned main analysis, which was on an intention-to-treat basis, used adjusted mixed effects linear regression analysis to assess evidence for differences in the Olerud Molander ankle score between the intervention arms. We included study recruitment centre as a random effect and adjusted the analysis for the stratification variables (age and operative or non-operative management) as fixed effects. Participants who maintained their allocated intervention for at least three weeks were considered to have followed the protocol. A sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of missingness and adherence was conducted using multiple imputation. All analyses were implemented in R.

Two prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken to determine whether the intervention effect differed between participants who received operative or non-operative treatment before the study intervention and between those who were younger than 50 years or 50 years and older at randomisation; those older than 50 years being more likely to have experienced a fragility fracture related to osteoporosis. The original cut-off for 60 years was amended to 50 years following advice from the independent oversight committees but before publication of the final protocoland approval of the statistical analysis plan. The subgroup analyses followed the methods described for the primary analysis, with additional interaction terms incorporated into the mixed effects model.

Patient and public involvement

Public and patient representatives co-produced this study. After a single site feasibility trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research (ISRCTN17809322), two public and patient representatives (RG and KK) continued their roles through the planning, development, and delivery of the current main randomised controlled trial.

### Casting vs surgical treatment of children with medial epicondyle fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^111iozMZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The study Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures was published by Petra Grahn and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Humeral fracture and Medial epicondylar fracture. In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the trial question was: is casting noninferior to open surgical reduction and internal fixation in children with displaced medial epicondylar fractures? In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the population was: 72 patients (43 female, 29 male). The inclusion criteria were children with displaced medial epicondylar fractures. The key exclusion criteria were joint incarceration; ulnar nerve dysfunction; pathological or open fractures; systemic bone disease; concomitant upper limb fractures requiring surgery; conditions precluding full participation in follow-up. In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the interventions were: n = 35 casting (long-arm cast for 4 weeks only) n = 37 surgery (surgery within 7 days; open reduction and internal fixation, followed by long-arm cast for 4 weeks). In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in mean Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score at 12 months (2.71 points vs. 1.73 points; MD 0.98, 95% CI -0.98 to 2.95). In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median cosmetic VAS score at 12 months (100 mm vs. 91 mm; MD -8.9, 95% CI -16.6 to -1.2) No significant difference in mean elbow ROM at 12 months (141.1 degrees vs. 150.6 degrees; MD -9.5, 95% CI -26.27 to 7.27) No significant difference in mean grip strength at 12 months (1.1 kg vs. 0.4 kg; MD 0.7, 95% CI -0.25 to 1.65). In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in diminished sensation postoperatively. significant difference in fracture nonunion at 12 months (68.6% vs. 2.7%). In the Casting vs. Surgery for Medial Epicondylar Fractures study, the conclusion was: in children with displaced medial epicondylar fractures, casting was noninferior to surgery with respect to mean Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score at 12 months.

### Structural alterations during fracture healing lead to void spaces developing in surrounding bone microarchitecture [^113RzWes]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Distal radius fractures are among the most common skeletal injuries, with a high incidence across all age groups, from children to the elderly. Although distal radius fracture outcomes are often less severe than fractures at axial sites, such as the hip and spine, they still have important clinical implications and can be indicative of osteoporosis in adults over 50 yr. Radius fractures result in loss of function, pain, and, if complications arise, can require extensive rehabilitation. Moreover, distal radius fractures serve as an important predictor of future fracture risk, particularly in older individuals with osteopenia or osteoporosis. The standard treatment for most radial fractures is cast immobilization, typically for a period of 4–6 weeks. However, the optimal timing for cast removal remains uncertain and can significantly influence patient outcomes. Factors such as age and bone quality further contribute to the variability observed in the healing process, underscoring the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying bone healing and post-fracture function to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient care.

### Cast or nail? Using a preference-based tool for shared decision-making in pediatric femoral shaft fracture treatment [^114cjgwz]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Femoral shaft fractures are common injuries in children 2 to 7 years of age, with treatments ranging from casting to flexible intramedullary nails (FIN). Each treatment has unique attributes and outcomes are overall similar. Given equivalent outcomes, we hypothesized that a shared decision-making process, using adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA), can be used to assess individual family situations to determine ultimate treatment choice.

Methods

An interactive survey incorporating an ACA exercise to elicit the preferences of individuals was created. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to recruit survey respondents simulating the at-risk population. Basic demographic information and family characteristics were collected. Sawtooth Software was utilized to generate relative importance values of five treatment attributes and determine subjects' ultimate treatment choice. Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare relative importance between groups.

Results

The final analysis included 186 subjects with 147 (79%) choosing casting as their ultimate treatment choice, while 39 (21%) chose FIN. Need for second surgery had the highest overall average relative importance (42.0), followed by a chance of serious complications (24.6), time away from school (12.9), effort required by caregivers (11.0), and return to activities (9.6). Most respondents (85%) indicated the generated relative importance of attributes aligned "very well or well" with their preferences. For those who chose casting instead of FIN, the need for secondary surgery (43.9 vs. 34.8, P < 0.001) and the chance of serious complications (25.9 vs. 19.6, P < 0.001) were the most important factors. In addition, returning to activities, the burden to caregivers, and time away from school were all significantly more important to those choosing surgery versus casting (12.6 vs. 8.7 P < 0.001, 12.6 vs. 9.8 P = 0.014, 16.6 vs. 11.7 P < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

Our decision-making tool accurately identified subjects' treatment preferences and appropriately aligned them with a treatment decision. Given the increased emphasis on shared decision-making in health care, this tool may have the potential to improve shared decision-making and family understanding, leading to improved satisfaction rates and overall outcomes.

### Optimal care for the management of older people non-weight bearing after lower limb fracture: a consensus study [^113rLuMx]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The consensus study findings that achieved consensus drawing from panellists, representing seven clinical disciplines show promise towards developing a clinical guideline in the management of patients with weight bearing restrictions after lower limb fractures. Further work to develop a clinical guideline should be inclusive of all relevant parties, including patients and their families. Still, clinicians managing these patients can use these findings in quality improvement work. Additionally, researchers can use these findings to optimise care when novel interventions are trialled and may stimulate further research questions.

### Use of cast immobilisation versus removable brace in adults with an ankle fracture: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112pWaAa]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and blinding

Baseline data were collected before randomisation. Participants were randomised on a 1:1 basis to the two study intervention arms sequentially as they presented. A secure web based system maintained by an independent randomisation team allocated participants using a minimisation algorithm with a random element and stratification by centre, operative or non-operative management, and age (≤ 49 v ≥ 50 years).

Blinding of participants and clinicians was not possible. All follow-up data were participant reported through postal questionnaires; no clinicians or researchers assessed outcome measures.

Interventions

The interventions were worn for a minimum of three weeks in both groups.

Standard below knee cast immobilisation was applied according to local procedures. Participants in the cast group started active unloaded ankle range of movement exercises once the cast was removed.

Removable braces were of a fixed angle design, to replicate what is routinely used in UK practice, and were applied in accordance with local procedures. The specific brand of removable brace was not standardised across sites, and each site used its own brand. The treating clinician in the trauma service setting encouraged participants in verbal and written formats to take off the removable brace to complete active unloaded ankle range of movement exercises as often as pain allowed, with a recommendation for each movement to be performed 10 times, three times a day (see supplementary file 2).

In this pragmatic trial, any other rehabilitation input beyond rigid immobilisation in a cast compared with early active movement in a removable brace was at the discretion of the treating member of the clinical team, in accordance with current UK practice. This included choice of weightbearing for the participant, duration of immobilisation period (beyond the minimum of three weeks), and decision to onward refer participants to physiotherapy services. These details were collected for each participant as part of the trial dataset.

### Use of cast immobilisation versus removable brace in adults with an ankle fracture: multicentre randomised controlled trial [^111hcjzA]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Each year more than 120 000 people in the United Kingdom experience an ankle fracture. Such fractures represent a major trauma workload, and demand is increasing — because the number of older adults who remain active is increasing, by 2030 ankle fractures are expected to increase threefold. The frequency of this injury places an increasing burden on the UK National Health Service. Affected adults are unable to engage in usual physical activities for prolonged periods. The qualitative impact on individuals is substantial, affecting family and social life, sleep, sense of independence, and psychological wellbeing.

Conventionally, after fracture the ankle is immobilised in a rigid cast for several weeks, which allows the bones to heal but can result in joint stiffness and muscle weakness. An alternative is a removable brace, which can be taken off to allow early movement. Using a removable brace could prevent the consequences of rigid immobilisation and help to accelerate recovery. Both methods are routinely used in the UK.

A Cochrane review concluded that functional bracing might reduce activity limitation and pain and improve ankle movement. These potential advantages, however, need to be balanced against the increased incidence of adverse events. High quality evidence is not available to support the effectiveness or safety of early movement after ankle fracture.

In light of the increasing numbers of ankle fractures and large personal and societal costs, we compared removable bracing with casting on function, quality of life, and complications in adults with an ankle fracture.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^117FXp18]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic pain management — immobilization in extremity and pelvic trauma stabilizes the body part and has a beneficial effect on pain during the acute injury period; however, acute analgesic benefit must be balanced against faster recovery with early mobilization. Evidence includes a single RCT where more versus less immobilization in supracondylar fractures yielded a significant analgesic benefit and an additional RCT showing significant pain reduction in casted versus splinted buckle fractures of the distal radius. Immobilization of the affected extremity is strongly recommended as an adjunct to pain management in adult and pediatric patients with acute pelvic or extremity trauma.

Methods

Study conduct and oversight

The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available online. This multicentre randomised superiority clinical trial was conducted at 36 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK. The National Research Ethics Committee gave the study a favourable opinion on 6 October 2016, and recruitment centres received permission from their research and development departments. Two minor amendments were made to the protocol to extend the duration of the trial, add digital follow-up, and allow for incentives for follow-up. A local researcher approached eligible patients prospectively and provided them with written information about the trial before asking them to provide informed consent.

Participants

All patients aged 16 years or over with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius were screened. Patients were potentially eligible if their treating surgeon recommended that they needed a manipulation of their fracture. Patients were excluded if the injury was more than two weeks old, the fracture extended more than 3 cm from radiocarpal joint, the fracture was open with a Gustilo and Anderson grading greater than 1, the joint surface of the fracture could not be reduced by closed manipulation, or the patient was unable to complete follow-up questionnaires. After provision of informed consent, the local research team recorded baseline data, including pre-fracture wrist function (retrospective by recall) and current, post-fracture wrist function.

Randomisation and blinding

The randomisation sequence, prepared by the trial statistician, included block stratification by recruitment centre, articular extension of the fracture (intra-articular or extra-articular), and age of the participant (< 50 or ≥ 50 years). The treatment allocation was computer generated via a secure, centralised web based randomisation service.

Patients who provided informed consent were advised that at the time of surgery, in a minority of cases, the surgeon might be unable to manipulate the fracture into its normal anatomical alignment without making incisions in the skin to access the fracture site. Patients who needed such an "open" reduction of the articular surface of their fracture were not randomised into the trial and were treated according to their surgeons' normal clinical practice. For participants in whom a closed reduction of the fracture was possible, the surgeon completed the randomisation process after the manipulation. The participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive a moulded cast ("cast group") or surgical fixation with K-wires ("K-wire group"). Surgeons commonly use both techniques in their normal clinical practice. As the interventions were clearly visible to the participants, they could not be blind to treatment allocation.

Conservative Group

Immediately after admission, patients underwent bone traction on the affected side's tibial tuberosity (with traction weight set at 10%-15% of body weight) to achieve preliminary stabilization of the fracture. Simultaneously, a systemic internal environment regulation plan was initiated: targeted correction of anemia (target hemoglobin > 90 g/L), hypoalbuminemia (target serum albumin > 30 g/L), and electrolyte imbalances based on laboratory test results. If necessary, concentrated red blood cells or human albumin were administered intravenously. All cases routinely received low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis. Patients with underlying diseases underwent multidisciplinary consultations (led by cardiology, respiratory medicine, and endocrinology) to develop comorbidity management strategies aimed at optimizing organ functional reserve. Throughout the treatment, a standardized ankle pump training program was executed under the supervision of a physical therapist. After a 14-day hospitalization period with dynamic monitoring, bone traction was removed, and patients transitioned to home rehabilitation. Post-discharge, patients continued bed rest and followed regular follow-up appointments as per medical advice, including reexamination of X-rays. Once the fracture healed, rehabilitation exercises for the affected lower limb could be intensified, and gradual attempts to walk could be made (Figure 1B).

Outcome Measures

Outcome indicators include VAS scores on the 7th day and 3 months of admission for two groups, fracture healing time, incidence of complications, HHS and quality of life measured by the SF-36 at the last follow-up, as well as one-year survival rates.

The criteria for assessing fracture healing adhere to a multimodal comprehensive evaluation principle: (1) Radiological healing: Continuous anteroposterior X-rays show complete disappearance of the fracture line, with continuous connectivity of the trabecular bone; (2) Clinical functional assessment: Negative axial percussion pain in the affected limb, and no significant pain during active/passive range of motion testing. All physical examinations are conducted by senior orthopedic attending physicians. Radiological interpretation follows a double-blind protocol — two senior radiologists independently evaluated the images. In the event of discrepancies, a consensus meeting is held to integrate clinical and imaging data to form a final diagnosis.

### Common forearm fractures in adults [^1118Rjzu]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Fractures of the forearm are common injuries in adults. Proper initial assessment includes a detailed history of the mechanism of injury, a complete examination of the affected arm, and appropriate radiography. Open fractures, joint dislocation or instability, and evidence of neurovascular injury are indications for emergent referral. Fractures demonstrating significant displacement, comminution, or intra-articular involvement may also warrant orthopedic consultation. In the absence of these findings, many forearm fractures can be managed by a primary care physician. Initial management of forearm fractures should follow the PRICE (protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation) protocol, with the exception of compression, which should be avoided in the acute setting. Distal radius fractures with minimal displacement can be treated with a short arm cast. Isolated ulnar fractures can usually be managed with a short arm cast or a functional forearm brace. Mason type I radial head fractures can be treated with a splint for five to seven days or with a sling as needed for comfort, along with early range-of-motion exercises. Patients with an olecranon fracture are candidates for nonsurgical treatment if the elbow is stable and the extensor mechanism is intact.

### The management of ankle fractures [^114ethMA]. BOA (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ankle fracture, more specifically with respect to return to normal activities, BOA 2016 guidelines recommend to allow most patients to bear weight as tolerated in a splint or cast unless there are specific concerns regarding the stability of the fixation or contraindications, such as peripheral neuropathy or particular concerns about the status of the soft tissues.

### Conservative interventions for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^1155NDci]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem particularly in elderly white women with osteoporosis.

Objectives

To determine the most appropriate conservative treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (January 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2002), EMBASE (1988 to 2002 Week 04), CINAHL (1982 to December Week 2 2001), the National Research Register (up to Issue 4, 2001) and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving skeletally mature patients with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared commonly applied conservative interventions for fracture fixation. These included the application of an external support (plaster cast or brace) and fracture manipulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

All trials, judged as fitting the selection criteria by both reviewers, were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted for anatomical, functional and clinical, including complications, outcomes. The trials were grouped into categories relating to cast position, extent and duration of immobilisation, use of braces, cast material and fracture manipulation. Although quantitative data from some trials are presented, the lack of good quality trials and trial heterogeneity inhibited pooling of results.

Main Results

Two trials were newly included in this update. In all, there are 33 trials, involving a total of 3664 mainly female and older patients, meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Comprehensive details of the individual trials are provided in tabular form, and their results, grouped as indicated above, have been presented in text and analyses tables. The poor quality and heterogeneity in terms of patient characteristics, interventions compared and outcome measurement, of the included trials meant that no meta-analyses were undertaken.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine which methods of conservative treatment are the most appropriate for the more common types of distal radial fractures in adults. Therefore, at present, practitioners applying conservative management should use an accepted technique with which they are familiar, and which is cost-effective from the perspective of their provider unit. Patient preferences and circumstances, and the risk of complications should also be considered. Further research to clarify the most appropriate conservative treatment for this common fracture is warranted but requires careful preparation with an emphasis on undertaking a systematic approach. For this, it is important to reflect on the issues raised in this review, to ascertain patient preferences, prioritise researchable questions and agree a core data set for classification of fractures and outcomes.

### Interventions for treating fractures of the patella in adults [^114fbYPq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fractures of the patella (kneecap) account for around 1% of all human fractures. The treatment of these fractures can be surgical or conservative (such as immobilisation with a cast or brace). There are many different surgical and conservative interventions for treating fractures of the patella in adults. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions (surgical and conservative) for treating fractures of the patella in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, trial registers and references lists of articles to January 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that evaluated any surgical or conservative intervention for treating adults with fractures of the patella. The primary outcomes were patient-rated knee function, knee pain and major adverse outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected eligible trials, assessed risk of bias and cross-checked data extraction. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials.

Main Results

We included 11 small trials involving 564 adults (aged 16 to 76 years) with patella fractures. There were 340 men and 212 women; the gender of 12 participants was not reported. Seven trials were conducted in China and one each in Finland, Mexico, Pakistan and Turkey. All 11 trials compared different surgical interventions for patella fractures. All trials had design flaws, such as lack of assessor blinding, which put them at high risk of bias, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings. No trial reported on health-related quality of life, return to previous activity or cosmetic appearance. The trials tested one of seven comparisons. In the following, we report those of the main outcomes for which evidence was available for the three most important comparisons. Four trials (174 participants) compared percutaneous osteosynthesis versus open surgery. Very low-quality evidence means that we are uncertain of the findings of no clinically important difference between the two interventions in patient-rated knee function at 12 months (1 study, 50 participants) or in knee pain at intermediate-term follow-up at eight weeks to three months. Furthermore, very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain whether, compared with open surgery, percutaneous fixation surgery reduces the incidence of major adverse outcomes, such as loss of reduction and hardware complications, or results in better observer-rated knee function scores. Two trials (112 participants) compared cable pin system (open or percutaneous surgery) versus tension band technique. The very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the findings at one year in favour of the cable pin system of slightly better patient-rated knee function, fewer adverse events and slightly better observer-rated measures of knee function. There was very low-quality evidence of little clinically important between-group difference in knee pain at three months. Very low-quality evidence from two small trials (47 participants) means that we are uncertain of the findings of little difference between biodegradable versus metallic implants at two-year follow-up in the numbers of participants with occasional knee pain, incurring adverse events or with reduced knee motion. There was very low-quality and incomplete evidence from single trials for four other comparisons. This means we are uncertain of the results of one trial (28 participants) that compared patellectomy with advancement of vastus medialis obliquus surgery with simple patellectomy; of one quasi-RCT (56 participants) that compared a new intraoperative reduction technique compared with a standard technique; of one quasi-RCT (65 participants) that compared a modified tension band technique versus the conventional AO tension band wiring (TBW) technique; and of one trial (57 participants) that compared adjustable patella claws and absorbable suture versus Kirschner wire tension band.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very limited evidence from nine RCTs and two quasi-RCTs on the relative effects of different surgical interventions for treating fractures of the patella in adults. There is no evidence from trials evaluating the relative effects of surgical versus conservative treatment or different types of conservative interventions. Given the very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether methods of percutaneous osteosynthesis give better results than conventional open surgery; whether cable pin system (open or percutaneous surgery) gives better results than the tension band technique; and whether biodegradable implants are better than metallic implants for displaced patellar fractures. Further randomised trials are needed, but, to optimise research effort, these should be preceded by research that aims to identify priority questions.

### Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures [^113cgqMM]. AAOS (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures — patient weight and outcome prediction: The difference in mean weight between poor-outcome and excellent/satisfactory-outcome groups was statistically significant (p = .003). Using a cut-off point of 49 kg, heavier patients were about five times more likely than lighter patients to have poor outcomes, but weight did not independently predict a poor outcome when age was included in a logistic regression model. The weight cut-off had 78.5% specificity and 59% sensitivity for detecting a poor outcome. A previously published systematic review concluded that intramedullary nailing resulted in fewer malunions and adverse events than traction or subsequent casting; however, it was not specific to the population of interest and was not included in the systematic review.

### Distal radius-ulna fractures in children [^116DzAfC]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Fractures involving the distal radius and ulna are commonly seen in children and adolescents. Management of these injuries in pediatric patients should include assessment of the neurovascular status of the extremity, associated soft-tissue injury, and, most importantly, possible involvement of the physes of the radius and ulna. Treatment of these injuries may vary from simple casting and radiographic follow-up to urgent reduction and surgical fixation. Regardless of the initial treatment plan, the treating surgeon must remain aware of the potential for both early and late complications that may affect outcomes.

### Cast-OFF trial: one versus 4 to 5 weeks of plaster cast immobilization for nonreduced distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical feasibility trial [^114zohsF]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Multilevel Linear Mixed Analysis

In multilevel linear mixed model analysis adjusted for age, sex, VAS score at baseline, fracture classification, and time of data collection, there were no differences in DASH score, PRWE score, and PROMIS PI score between patients who were randomized in the control group or the intervention group (respectively, DASH: coeff = −1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] −9.49 to 5.55, P = 0.61; PRWE: coeff = −4.91; 95% CI, −11.23 to 1.1, P = 0.13; PROMIS PI: coeff = −3.52; 95% CI, −7.61 to 0.57, P = 0.09). There was no statistically significant interaction between treatment and time for any of the PRO scores (P = 0.76 for DASH, P = 0.45 for PRWE, and P = 0.55 for PROMIS PI). However, in general, all PRO scores decreased over time, with the highest scores after 6 weeks. There were 28 individuals with at least 2 measurements of DASH score. This number was 30 and 31 for PRWE score and PROMIS Pain Interference score, respectively.

Short Form-36

After 6 weeks, the intervention group scored better on the physical function, general health, and health change sections (control vs intervention: physical function, 68.7 vs 86.8, P = 0.02; general health, 60.3 vs 83.5, P < .01; health change, 41.7 vs 54.4, P < .01). After 3, 6, and 12 months, the intervention group scored better for the section pain (control vs intervention: pain 3 months, 69.4 vs 85.9, P = 0.04; pain 6 months, 75.6 vs 90.2, P = 0.04; pain 12 months, 75.7 vs 93.8, P = 0.02) see. The per protocol showed no significant difference between the groups except for emotional problems after 12 months (control vs intervention: 80.0 vs 100.0, P = 0.03) see.

### What can we learn from COVID-19 protocols with regard to management of nonoperative pediatric orthopaedic injuries? [^113YwL9e]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to normal practice in pediatric outpatient orthopaedics, with the instigation of telephone fracture clinic appointments, and the use of self-removable casting. We aim to determine any beneficial or detrimental short-term effects of these changes.

Methods

All patients referred to fracture clinic from the emergency department during the period March 24, 2020 to May 10, 2020 (national lockdown) were assessed for number of face to face and telephone appointments, number of radiographs performed, time to discharge, use of a removable cast, any cast complications, other complications, reattendance or re-referral after discharge. They were compared with patients referred in the same period in 2019. Follow-up was to 6 months for every patient.

Results

In 2019, 240 patients were reviewed and 110 in 2020. Changes in practice resulted in significant differences in the number of face to face appointments per patient [2 (1 to 6) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 5) 2020 (P < 0.00001)] and increase in telephone appointments [0 (0 to 1) 2019 vs. 1 (0 to 2) 2020]. Number of radiographs per patient [1 (1 to 7) 2019 vs. 1 (1 to) 2020 (P = 0.0178)] and time to discharge [29d (0 to 483) 2019 vs. 16d (0 to 216) 2020 (P < 0.00001)] also reduced significantly. Use of a self-removable casting technique increased significantly (2.4% of casts in 2019 vs. 91.8% in 2020 (P < 0.00001). There were no significant differences in complications related to cast or otherwise, unplanned attendance or reattendance after discharge. Use of self-removable casts for supracondylar fractures and for simple injuries (including distal radius, forearm, Toddler's, and ankle fractures) also demonstrated no change in complication rate. Significant potential cost savings of > £185000 per annum could be demonstrated through clinic appointment and cast removal reductions.

Discussion

Changes to the normal management of pediatric orthopaedic trauma brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have been demonstrated to be safe in the short term with no increase in complications demonstrated. Potential cost savings are possible both to the health care provider and also to the patient because of reduced hospital attendance. It is feasible to continue these practices for the potential benefits as they appear safe in the short term.

### Rehabilitation for distal radial fractures in adults [^112qTWQ5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem, particularly in older people with osteoporosis. There is considerable variation in the management, including rehabilitation, of these fractures. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2006.

Objectives

To examine the effects of rehabilitation interventions in adults with conservatively or surgically treated distal radial fractures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014; Issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, OTseeker and other databases, trial registers, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. We did not apply any language restrictions. The date of the last search was 12 January 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs evaluating rehabilitation as part of the management of fractures of the distal radius sustained by adults. Rehabilitation interventions such as active and passive mobilisation exercises, and training for activities of daily living, could be used on their own or in combination, and be applied in various ways by various clinicians.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors independently screened and selected trials, and reviewed eligible trials. We contacted study authors for additional information. We did not pool data.

Main Results

We included 26 trials, involving 1269 mainly female and older patients. With few exceptions, these studies did not include people with serious fracture or treatment-related complications, or older people with comorbidities and poor overall function that would have precluded trial participation or required more intensive treatment. Only four of the 23 comparisons covered by these 26 trials were evaluated by more than one trial. Participants of 15 trials were initially treated conservatively, involving plaster cast immobilisation. Initial treatment was surgery (external fixation or internal fixation) for all participants in five trials. Initial treatment was either surgery or plaster cast alone in six trials. Rehabilitation started during immobilisation in seven trials and after post-immobilisation in the other 19 trials. As well as being small, the majority of the included trials had methodological shortcomings and were at high risk of bias, usually related to lack of blinding, that could affect the validity of their findings. Based on GRADE criteria for assessment quality, we rated the evidence for each of the 23 comparisons as either low or very low quality; both ratings indicate considerable uncertainty in the findings. For interventions started during immobilisation, there was very low quality evidence of improved hand function for hand therapy compared with instructions only at four days after plaster cast removal, with some beneficial effects continuing one month later (one trial, 17 participants). There was very low quality evidence of improved hand function in the short-term, but not in the longer-term (three months), for early occupational therapy (one trial, 40 participants), and of a lack of differences in outcome between supervised and unsupervised exercises (one trial, 96 participants). Four trials separately provided very low quality evidence of clinically marginal benefits of specific interventions applied in addition to standard care (therapist-applied programme of digit mobilisation during external fixation (22 participants); pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) during cast immobilisation (60 participants); cyclic pneumatic soft tissue compression using an inflatable cuff placed under the plaster cast (19 participants); and cross-education involving strength training of the non-fractured hand during cast immobilisation with or without surgical repair (39 participants)). For interventions started post-immobilisation, there was very low quality evidence from one study (47 participants) of improved function for a single session of physiotherapy, primarily advice and instructions for a home exercise programme, compared with 'no intervention' after cast removal. There was low quality evidence from four heterogeneous trials (30, 33, 66 and 75 participants) of a lack of clinically important differences in outcome in patients receiving routine physiotherapy or occupational therapy in addition to instructions for home exercises versus instructions for home exercises from a therapist. There was very low quality evidence of better short-term hand function in participants given physiotherapy than in those given either instructions for home exercises by a surgeon (16 participants, one trial) or a progressive home exercise programme (20 participants, one trial). Both trials (46 and 76 participants) comparing physiotherapy or occupational therapy versus a progressive home exercise programme after volar plate fixation provided low quality evidence in favour of a structured programme of home exercises preceded by instructions or coaching. One trial (63 participants) provided very low quality evidence of a short-term, but not persisting, benefit of accelerated compared with usual rehabilitation after volar plate fixation. For trials testing single interventions applied post-immobilisation, there was very low quality evidence of no clinically significant differences in outcome in patients receiving passive mobilisation (69 participants, two trials), ice (83 participants, one trial), PEMF (83 participants, one trial), PEMF plus ice (39 participants, one trial), whirlpool immersion (24 participants, one trial), and dynamic extension splint for patients with wrist contracture (40 participants, one trial), compared with no intervention. This finding applied also to the trial (44 participants) comparing PEMF versus ice, and the trial (29 participants) comparing manual oedema mobilisation versus traditional oedema treatment. There was very low quality evidence from single trials of a short-term benefit of continuous passive motion post-external fixation (seven participants), intermittent pneumatic compression (31 participants) and ultrasound (38 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to establish the relative effectiveness of the various interventions used in the rehabilitation of adults with fractures of the distal radius. Further randomised trials are warranted. However, in order to optimise research effort and engender the large multicentre randomised trials that are required to inform practice, these should be preceded by research that aims to identify priority questions.

### Cast and splint immobilization: complications [^115VpLb7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

During the past three decades, internal fixation has become increasingly popular for fracture management and limb reconstruction. As a result, during their training, orthopaedic surgeons receive less formal instruction in the art of extremity immobilization and cast application and removal. Casting is not without risks and complications (eg, stiffness, pressure sores, compartment syndrome); the risk of morbidity is higher when casts are applied by less experienced practitioners. Certain materials and methods of ideal cast and splint application are recommended to prevent morbidity in the patient who is at high risk for complications with casting and splinting. Those at high risk include the obtunded or comatose multitrauma patient, the patient under anesthesia, the very young patient, the developmentally delayed patient, and the patient with spasticity.

### Three week versus six week immobilisation for stable Weber B type ankle fractures: randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority clinical trial [^114SqLej]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Sample size calculations were performed assuming a two arm study (six week cast versus three week cast or versus three week orthotic device). In our previous studyon non-operative treatment of stable ankle fractures with the same primary outcome (OMAS), the mean OMAS score was 88 (SD 20), and our sample size calculation was based on this (non-inferiority margin). During the design of the present trial, no estimate for minimal clinically relevant change existed for OMAS. In the absence of better evidence, we organised a focus group discussion among experts to define the appropriate estimate for non-inferiority margin. The panel reached a consensus that a 10% difference in 0–100 OMAS scale would not be clinically significant, which was then used to derive our non-inferiority margin (10% equals 8.8 points on the OMAS scale, Cohen's d = 0.215, indicating a small effect size). With α = 0.05, power 80% (1−β = 0.8), a non-inferiority margin of 10% (8.8 points), and the estimated true difference between the novel treatments compared with conventional treatment equals 1.0 point in favour of the new treatments, with a dropout rate of 20%, the calculations resulted in 82 patients in each group (total n = 246) (see trial protocol, supplementary appendix 1). Given that some preliminary evidence suggested that more functional ankle fracture treatment could result in slightly superior outcomes to traditional six week treatment with a cast, we assumed that the possible benefit of the three week treatments (cast or orthosis) equals one OMAS point.

### Interventions for treating femoral shaft fractures in children and adolescents [^1127syh6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fractures of the femoral shaft in children are relatively uncommon but serious injuries that disrupt the lives of children and their carers and can result in significant long-term disability. Treatment involves either surgical fixation, such as intramedullary nailing or external fixation, or conservative treatment involving prolonged immobilisation, often in hospital.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for treating femoral shaft fractures in children and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (accessed 16 August 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013 Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August Week 1 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 week 9), CINAHL (16 August 2013), clinical trials registries, conference proceedings and reference lists; and contacted trial authors and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing conservative and surgical interventions for diaphyseal fractures of the femur in children under 18 years of age. Our primary outcomes were functional outcome measures, unacceptable malunion, and serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome for each comparison using the GRADE approach. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included 10 trials (six randomised and four quasi-randomised) involving a total of 527 children (531 fractures). All trials were at some risk of bias, including performance bias as care provider blinding was not practical, but to a differing extent. Just one trial was at low risk of selection bias. Reflecting both the risk of bias and the imprecision of findings, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for most outcomes, meaning that we are unsure about the estimates of effect. Most trials failed to report on self-assessed function or when children resumed their usual activities. The trials evaluated 10 different comparisons, belonging to three main categories. Surgical versus conservative treatment Four trials presenting data for 264 children aged 4 to 12 years made this comparison. Low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) showed children had very similar function assessed using the RAND health status score at two years after surgery (external fixation) compared with conservative treatment (spica cast): mean 69 versus 68. The other three trials did not report on function. There was moderate quality evidence (four trials, 264 children, aged 4 to 12 years, followed up 3 to 24 months) that surgery reduced the risk of malunion (risk ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.59, 4 trials). Assuming an illustrative baseline risk of 115 malunions per 1000 in children treated conservatively, these data equate to 81 fewer (95% CI 47 to 97 fewer) malunions per 1000 in surgically-treated children. Conversely, low quality evidence indicated that there were more serious adverse events such as infections after surgery (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.17, 4 trials). Assuming an illustrative baseline risk of 40 serious adverse events per 1000 for conservative treatment, these data equate to 56 more (95% CI 4 to 167 more) serious adverse events per 1000 children treated surgically. There was low quality evidence (one trial, 101 children) of similar satisfaction levels in children and parents with surgery involving external fixation and plaster cast only. However, there was low quality evidence (one trial, 46 children) that more parents were satisfied with intramedullary nailing than with traction followed by a cast, and that surgery reduced the time taken off from school. Comparisons of different methods of conservative treatmentThe three trials in this category made three different comparisons. We are very unsure if unacceptable malunion rates differ between immediate hip spica versus skeletal traction followed by spica in children aged 3 to 10 years followed up for six to eight weeks (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 32.9; one trial, 42 children; very low quality evidence). Malunion rates at 5 to 10 years may not differ between traction followed by functional orthosis versus traction followed by spica cast in children aged 5 to 13 years (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.12; one trial, 43 children; low quality evidence). We are very unsure (very low quality evidence) if either function or serious adverse events (zero events reported) differ between single-leg versus double-leg spica casts (one trial, 52 young children aged two to seven years). Low quality evidence on the same comparison indicates that single-leg casts are less awkward to manage by parents, more comfortable for the child and may require less time off work by the caregiver. Comparisons of different methods of surgical treatmentThe three trials in this category made three different comparisons. Very low quality evidence means that we are very unsure if the rates of malunion, serious adverse events, time to return to school or parental satisfaction actually differ in children whose fractures were fixed using elastic stable intramedullary nailing or external fixation (one trial, 19 children). The same applies to the rates of serious adverse events and time to resume full weight-bearing in children treated with dynamic versus static external fixation (one trial, 52 children). Very low quality evidence (one trial, 47 children) means that we do not know if malunion, serious adverse events and time to resume weight-bearing actually differ between intramedullary nailing versus submuscular plating. However, there could be more difficulties in plate removal subsequently.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine if long-term function differs between surgical and conservative treatment. Surgery results in lower rates of malunion in children aged 4 to 12 years, but may increase the risk of serious adverse events. Elastic stable intramedullary nailing may reduce recovery time. There is insufficient evidence from comparisons of different methods of conservative treatment or of different methods of surgical treatment to draw conclusions on the relative effects of the treatments compared in the included trials.

### Validating scoring systems for fracture healing in infants and young children: pilot study [^1168uNrE]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Messer et al. carried out a systematic review surrounding time lines for dating of paediatric fractures. They highlight the fact that previous research studies vary greatly with differing combinations of fracture sites and patient ages. They conclude further research is required that must assess the effect of fracture site and patient age on fracture healing time frames and also focus on validating the findings of previous studies. These suggestions are in keeping with the work carried out in our pilot study.

Figure 4 shows a logistic regression curve for the probability of SPNBF in patients ages 12 months and older. Numbers in the patient age group 11 months and younger were insufficient for a reliable regression curve to be produced. This should be investigated in a larger, definitive study.

Reader agreement in our study varied between the different stages of fracture healing, with callus showing substantial agreement and SPNBF and remodelling showing moderate agreement. Reader variability is an important consideration in the setting of inflicted injury and fracture dating. Reader variability may be due to reasons such as imaging through cast. In our subanalysis of reader agreement for fractures in and out of cast, we noted a moderate agreement for SPNBF out of cast compared with only a fair agreement in cast. Cast makes it more difficult to accurately assess the healing phase of the fracture and the edge of the cast may easily be mistaken for periosteal reaction (Fig. 5). It is also evident that there can be difficulty differentiating SPNBF from callus and we question the value of this differentiation.

### Functional outcome after nonoperative management of tibial plateau fractures in skeletally mature patients: what sizes of gaps and stepoffs can be accepted? [^116vqJZE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization recommends taking 10,000 steps a day to stay healthy, which equates to approximately 3 million steps per person each year. A tibial plateau fracture may have a major impact on a patient's mobility, social activities, and ability to work. Adequate treatment is crucial to minimize the risks of progressive posttraumatic arthritis and patient disability. Assessment of fracture displacement is essential to choose the best treatment strategy for tibial plateau fractures. Gap and stepoff measurements, which provide information about fracture displacement, are used for clinical decision-making when choosing between operative or nonoperative treatment. Nonoperative management usually consists of a knee brace or long-leg cast for several weeks and is considered a good option for the treatment of minimally displaced tibial plateau fractures.

A frequently reported indication for nonoperative treatment of tibial plateau fractures includes minimal displacement with an articular fracture gap and/or stepoff of less than 2 mm. However, in a review of previous studies, Giannoudis et al. reported that articular gaps and stepoffs up to 10 mm are well tolerated and could be accepted for nonoperative treatment. However, we are not aware of any evidence regarding fracture displacement and the functional outcome after nonoperative treatment of tibial plateau fractures. Most studies of tibial plateau fracture treatment are focused on functional outcomes after surgery. Moreover, few studies have primarily focused on the correlation between initial fracture displacement and functional outcome. Additionally, several studies have used standard radiographs to assess fracture displacement, whereas over time, clinical decision-making has become increasingly based on CT images. CT images have been shown to increase the accuracy of assessing fracture displacement. There seems to be no consensus on the impact of minimal fracture displacement on functional outcome. Because the degree of fracture displacement is important for patient counseling regarding the indications for surgery and prognosis, it is crucial to assess what sizes of gaps and stepoffs could be accepted for the nonoperative treatment of tibial plateau fractures.

We therefore asked: (1) In patients treated nonoperatively for tibial plateau fractures, what is the association between initial fracture displacement, as measured by gaps and stepoffs at the articular surface on a CT image, and functional outcome? (2) What is the survivorship of the native joint, free from conversion to total knee prosthesis, among patients with tibial plateau fractures who were treated without surgery?

Initial evaluation and diagnosis — hemodynamically stable patients with evidence of a pelvic fracture on X ray should undergo cross-sectional imaging with a CT scan for further evaluation, and prior to being taken to CT these patients should be placed in a temporary pelvic binder for injury patterns at high risk for bleeding, such as open book and vertical shear patterns.

### Closed reduction of colles fractures: comparison of manual manipulation and finger-trap traction: a prospective, randomized study [^111JTHLu]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2002). Low credibility.

Background

An optimal outcome of closed treatment of a Colles fracture may depend on accurate reduction and adequate immobilization. It has been suggested that the use of finger-trap traction results in a better reduction and a lower rate of redisplacement than manual manipulation does, but to our knowledge these concepts have never been evaluated scientifically. We compared these two methods in a prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Two hundred and twenty-three patients with 225 displaced Colles-type fractures were randomized to treatment with closed reduction with either finger-trap traction (112 patients) or manual manipulation (111 patients). The fractures were assessed radiographically by measurement of the radial angle, dorsal tilt, and radial shortening before reduction, immediately after reduction, and at one and five weeks after reduction.

Results

The groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, side of injury, fracture grade, and amount of displacement at presentation. No significant differences were found between the alignment of the fractures in the two treatment groups at any time. With dorsal tilt of < 10 degrees and radial shortening of < 5 mm considered acceptable, the two techniques both produced an 87% rate of satisfactory reductions. However, the percentages of fractures in an acceptable alignment were only 57% and 50% at one week after finger-trap traction and manual manipulation, respectively, and only 27% and 32% at five weeks. The failure rates did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

The two methods of fracture reduction did not differ with regard to the eventual position of the fracture or the rate of failure. Although closed reduction was successful for the majority of fractures, most redisplaced substantially during the period of cast immobilization.

### Variability in the follow-up management of pediatric femoral fractures [^113qHW3C]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Femoral fractures represent the most common orthopaedic injury requiring hospitalization in the pediatric population, comprising approximately 20% of these injuries. The incidence of diaphyseal femoral fractures is estimated to be 19 fractures per 100,000 children annually. The most common treatment options include hip spica casting, traction, elastic stable intramedullary nailing, rigid locking nail, and plating. In children younger than 6 months, a Pavlik harness can also be a viable treatment option. It is well known that patients' age, size, and fracture pattern will influence treatment, but surgeon preference may also play a role, particularly in clinical follow-up practices.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has published guidelines outlining treatment practices for pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures, but these guidelines lack comprehensive suggestions on the ideal duration or frequency of follow-up. Most current published literature assesses one or two treatment types or evaluates treatment practices for one specific type of femur fracture. The duration and frequency of follow-up are not rigorously evaluated and can often be due to surgeon preference.

A recent study by Adamich et al examined the necessity for the orthopaedic follow-up in the management of pediatric clavicle fractures, focusing on when the decision is made to treat patients surgically. This led to the conclusion that not all clavicle fractures require an orthopaedic follow-up. Applying a similar methodology, we assessed the duration and frequency of orthopaedic follow-up in pediatric femur fractures because this has not previously been evaluated. The primary purpose of this study was to assess variability in follow-up practices in pediatric femur fractures between surgeons at a single center adjusting for patient age and fracture type.

### Splints and casts: indications and methods [^112184vw]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Management of a wide variety of musculoskeletal conditions requires the use of a cast or splint. Splints are noncircumferential immobilizers that accommodate swelling. This quality makes splints ideal for the management of a variety of acute musculoskeletal conditions in which swelling is anticipated, such as acute fractures or sprains, or for initial stabilization of reduced, displaced, or unstable fractures before orthopedic intervention. Casts are circumferential immobilizers. Because of this, casts provide superior immobilization but are less forgiving, have higher complication rates, and are generally reserved for complex and/or definitive fracture management. To maximize benefits while minimizing complications, the use of casts and splints is generally limited to the short term. Excessive immobilization from continuous use of a cast or splint can lead to chronic pain, joint stiffness, muscle atrophy, or more severe complications (e.g., complex regional pain syndrome). All patients who are placed in a splint or cast require careful monitoring to ensure proper recovery. Selection of a specific cast or splint varies based on the area of the body being treated, and on the acuity and stability of the injury. Indications and accurate application techniques vary for each type of splint and cast commonly encountered in a primary care setting. This article highlights the different types of splints and casts that are used in various circumstances and how each is applied.

### Computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging versus bone scintigraphy for clinically suspected scaphoid fractures in patients with negative plain radiographs [^117BF7Rs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In clinically suspected scaphoid fractures, early diagnosis reduces the risk of non-union and minimises loss in productivity resulting from unnecessary cast immobilisation. Since initial radiographs do not exclude the possibility of a fracture, additional imaging is needed. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scintigraphy (BS) are widely used to establish a definitive diagnosis, but there is uncertainty about the most appropriate method.

Objectives

The primary aim of this study is to identify the most suitable diagnostic imaging strategy for identifying clinically suspected fractures of the scaphoid bone in patients with normal radiographs. Therefore we looked at the diagnostic performance characteristics of the most used imaging modalities for this purpose: computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy.

Search Methods

In July 2012, we searched the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database. In September 2012, we searched MEDION, ARIF, Current Controlled Trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, conference proceedings and reference lists of all articles.

Selection Criteria

We included all prospective or retrospective studies involving a consecutive series of patients of all ages that evaluated the accuracy of BS, CT or MRI, or any combination of these, for diagnosing suspected scaphoid fractures. We considered the use of one or two index tests or six-week follow-up radiographs as adequate reference standards.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text reports of potentially eligible studies. The same authors extracted data from full-text reports and assessed methodological quality using the QUADAS checklist. For each index test, estimates of sensitivity and speciﬁcity from each study were plotted in ROC space; and forest plots were constructed for visual examination of variation in test accuracy. We performed meta-analyses using the HSROC model to produce summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

Main Results

We included 11 studies that looked at diagnostic accuracy of one or two index tests: four studies (277 suspected fractures) looked at CT, five studies (221 suspected fractures) looked at MRI and six studies (543 suspected fractures) looked at BS. Four of the studies made direct comparisons: two studies compared CT and MRI, one study compared CT and BS, and one study compared MRI and BS. Overall, the studies were of moderate to good quality, but relevant clinical information during evaluation of CT, MRI or BS was mostly unclear or unavailable. As few studies made direct comparisons between tests with the same participants, our results are based on data from indirect comparisons, which means that these results are more susceptible to bias due to confounding. Nonetheless, the direct comparisons showed similar patterns of differences in sensitivity and specificity as for the pooled indirect comparisons. Summary sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.92) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.00); for MRI, these were 0.88 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.97) and 1.00 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.00); for BS, these were 0.99 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.00) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.94). Indirect comparisons suggest that diagnostic accuracy of BS was significantly higher than CT and MRI; and CT and MRI have comparable diagnostic accuracy. The low prevalence of a true fracture among suspected fractures (median = 20%) means the lower specificity for BS is problematic. For example, in a cohort of 1000 patients, 112 will be over-treated when BS is used for diagnosis. If CT is used, only 8 will receive unnecessary treatment. In terms of missed fractures, BS will miss 2 fractures and CT will miss 56 fractures.

Authors' Conclusions

Although quality of the included studies is moderate to good, findings are based on only 11 studies and the confidence intervals for the summary estimates are wide for all three tests. Well-designed direct comparison studies including CT, MRI and BS could give valuable additional information. Bone scintigraphy is statistically the best diagnostic modality to establish a definitive diagnosis in clinically suspected fractures when radiographs appear normal. However, physicians must keep in mind that BS is more invasive than the other modalities, with safety issues due to level of radiation exposure, as well as diagnostic delay of at least 72 hours. The number of overtreated patients is substantially lower with CT and MRI. Prior to performing comparative studies, there is a need to raise the initially detected prevalence of true fractures in order to reduce the effect of the relatively low specificity in daily practice. This can be achieved by improving clinical evaluation and initial radiographical assessment.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness, comparing traction to intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures, in the less economically developed context [^111v54Ru]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

The search returned three cost-effectiveness studies and 13 cohort studies relating outcomes of traction and or IM fixation (figure 1). Only one of the cohort studies compared the two modalities. Fourteen other papers reported database analysis, qualitative aspects and background information, but no randomised control trials were evident. See online Supplementary file 1 for details of studies excluded during full text review.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of study selection.

Table 1 summarises the details of the included studies.

Table 1
Summary of effectiveness study characteristics

The earliest cohort study, 1954–1971, involved treatment with traction in Nigeria. The study includes paediatric patients; however, the format of data presentation allows extraction of findings for 33 patients, 20 years of age and over. Of these, only 11 had skeletal traction and although they do not provide figures for pin site infection, they indicate that it was common, even stating that one patient, excluded from analysis, died from pin site related septicaemia. Their focus is on duration of inpatient treatment, and aside from the absence of any cases of non-union or readmission, they do not comment on complications and follow-up patterns are unclear. Surprisingly, their mean of 65 inpatient bed days is only marginally higher than in later studies despite physiotherapy only being available during 2 years of the study, perhaps because multiply injured patients were excluded.

Another study over 3 years during this period, in South Africa, compared cohorts of 54 patients treated with Perkins' method, 67 with Küntscher nailing and a further group treated in Thomas' splints. No detail is provided on how the method of treatment was selected. They highlight that pin site related 'sepsis' was seen only with Steinmann's and not Denham's pins, although there is no detail of diagnostic criteria. The mean hospital stay in the IM nailing group was as protracted as 5.5 weeks (seven for traction); however, there is a suggestion of crossover into this group when clinicians became frustrated with slow progress. The prevalence of severe injuries in the cohort, suggested by the mortality rate of 3.9%–11.8% across the groups, may also have delayed rehabilitation.

### Interventions for treating ankle fractures in children [^116Skbdy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ankle fractures, which usually occur after a twisting incident, are a diverse collection of injuries with different levels of complexity and severity. They have an incidence of 1 in 1000 a year in children. Treatment generally involves splints and casts for minor fractures and surgical fixation with screws, plates and pins followed by immobilisation for more serious fractures.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different interventions for treating ankle fractures in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (22 September 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 2 2015), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (21 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 2015 Week 38), CINAHL (1937 to 22 September 2015), trial registers (17 February 2015), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for treating ankle fractures in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full articles for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and collected data. We undertook no meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included three randomised controlled trials reporting results for 189 children, all of whom had a clinical diagnosis of a "low risk" ankle fracture. These were predominantly classified as undisplaced Salter-Harris type I fractures of the distal fibula. All three trials compared non-surgical management options. The three trials were at high risk of bias, primarily relating to the impracticality of blinding participants and treating clinicians to the allocated interventions. Two trials compared the Aircast Air-Stirrup ankle brace versus a rigid cast, which was a removable fibreglass posterior splint in one trial (trial A) and a below-knee fibreglass walking cast in the other trial (trial B). In trial A, both devices were removed at around two weeks. In trial B, removal of the brace was optional after five days, while the walking cast was removed after three weeks. There was low-quality evidence of clinically important differences in function scores at four weeks in favour of the brace groups of both trials. Function was measured using the Activities Scale for Kids-performance (ASKp; score range 0 to 100, higher scores mean better function) in trial A and using a modified version of the ASKp score (range 0 to 100%, higher percentages mean better function) in trial B. The results for trial A (40 participants) were median 91.9 in the brace group versus 84.2 in the splint group. The results for trial B (104 participants) were 91.3% versus 85.3%; mean difference (MD) 6.00% favouring brace (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38% to 10.62%). Trial B indicated that 5% amounted to a clinically relevant difference in the modified ASKp score. Neither trial reported on unacceptable anatomy or related outcomes or long-term follow-up. There was very low-quality evidence relating to adverse events, none of which were serious. Trial A found twice as many children with pressure-related complications in the brace group (10 of 20 versus 5 of 20). In contrast, trial B found four times as many children in the cast group had adverse outcomes assessed in terms of an unscheduled visit to a healthcare provider (4 of 54 versus 16 of 50). Both trials linked some of the adverse events in the brace group with the failure to wear a protective sock. There was very low-quality evidence indicating an earlier return to pre-injury activity in the brace groups in both trials. Trial B provided low-quality evidence that children much prefer five days or more wearing an ankle brace than three weeks immobilised in a walking ankle cast. There was moderate-quality evidence of a lack of difference between the two groups in pain at four weeks. The third trial compared the Tubigrip bandage plus crutches and advice versus a plaster of Paris walking cast for two weeks and reported results at four weeks' follow-up for 45 children with an inversion injury of the ankle. The trial found very low-quality evidence of little difference in pain and function between the two groups, measured using a non-validated pain and function score at four weeks. The trial did not report on adverse effects. There was very low-quality evidence of an earlier return to normal activities, averaging six days, in children treated with Tubigrip (mean 14.17 days for Tubigrip versus 20.19 days for cast; MD -6.02 days, 95% CI -8.92 to -3.12 days). Recent evidence from magnetic resonance imaging studies of the main category of injury evaluated in these three trials suggests that most of the injuries in these trials were sprains or bone bruises rather than fractures of the distal fibular growth plate.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-quality evidence of a quicker recovery of self reported function at four weeks in children with clinically diagnosed low-risk ankle fractures who are treated with an ankle brace compared with those treated with a rigid cast, especially a non-removable walking cast. There is otherwise a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform clinical practice for children with ankle fractures. Research to identify and address priority questions on the treatment of these common fractures is needed.
