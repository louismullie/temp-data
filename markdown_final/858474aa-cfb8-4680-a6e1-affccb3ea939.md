## Question

Can Pamelor be used to treat ADHD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Pamelor can be used to treat ADHD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Pamelor actually is in terms of its generic name and drug class. Then, I should verify its FDA-approved indications versus common off-label uses. Next, I will check current evidence-based ADHD guidelines to see if nortriptyline appears anywhere in recommended therapy. After that, I need to review any direct evidence on tricyclic antidepressants for ADHD and weigh safety considerations, especially cardiac risk. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical recommendation and suggest evidence-based alternatives if appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the basic pharmacology so we do not jump to conclusions: Pamelor is the brand name for nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant that primarily inhibits norepinephrine reuptake with anticholinergic properties, which already hints that it is not a standard ADHD agent like stimulants or atomoxetine.

> Now, I will examine labeled indications; at first glance, I thought the approved uses included major depressive disorder, smoking cessation, neuropathic pain, migraine prevention, tinnitus, and panic disorder, which would suggest a broad therapeutic footprint and might tempt off-label consideration for ADHD based on noradrenergic effects.

> Wait, let me verify and separate true FDA-labeled indications from compendial dosing; hold on, I should double-check the official Pamelor label because I need to ensure I am not misclassifying off-label uses as approvals, and on review the FDA labeling for Pamelor centers on depression with boxed warnings and does not include ADHD, while those dosing entries for smoking cessation, neuropathic pain, migraine prevention, tinnitus, and panic disorder reflect compendial or off-label use rather than FDA-approved indications, so my initial list was overinclusive and requires correction [^114XYKD9] [^114A6owR] [^115Cqk2u].

> Next, I should review guideline-based care for ADHD; contemporary, high-credibility guidelines recommend stimulants as first-line for adults and children, with non-stimulants such as atomoxetine and viloxazine, and sometimes bupropion, as alternatives when stimulants are contraindicated or not tolerated, and notably nortriptyline and other TCAs do not appear as recommended agents in either AAFP adult guidance or the AAP pediatric guidance, which is a key signal against its use for ADHD [^1119zEet] [^111DiYEq] [^115oYhSW] [^111orm8m].

> I will now examine direct evidence about TCAs for ADHD; the clearest statement I can find concludes that tricyclic antidepressants have minimal empirical support and debatable safety for adolescent ADHD, which, although dated, aligns with their omission from modern guidelines, and while the mechanism-of-action argument about augmenting norepinephrine may sound theoretically relevant, that does not translate into established clinical efficacy for ADHD [^111Yo7y8].

> Let me consider safety next because I need to ensure risk-benefit is appropriate; nortriptyline carries meaningful cardiovascular risks including QT interval prolongation and arrhythmias, along with anticholinergic and neurologic adverse effects, suicidality warnings, and MAOI contraindications, and these concerns are particularly relevant in ADHD populations where stimulants may already affect heart rate and blood pressure, making TCAs a higher-risk and lower-value choice for this indication [^115acYeC] [^113vm6mz] [^114XYKD9].

> But wait, what if there is some off-label niche where nortriptyline is used for ADHD; I should double-check older and ancillary sources, and while some older publications vaguely mention antidepressants as adjuvants, they do not provide robust nortriptyline-specific evidence or contemporary endorsement, reinforcing that there is no evidence-based off-label role for Pamelor in ADHD management today [^114GHJ8p].

> Pulling this together, I should confirm the practical clinical path; nortriptyline is not FDA-approved for ADHD, does not appear in modern ADHD treatment guidelines, has only minimal and dated supportive data for ADHD with explicit safety concerns, and presents a risk profile that is not favorable relative to guideline-recommended therapies such as stimulants first-line and atomoxetine or viloxazine, with bupropion as a reasonable alternative in selected adults, so the appropriate recommendation is to avoid Pamelor for ADHD and instead follow guideline-concordant options with appropriate monitoring and shared decision-making [^114XYKD9] [^1119zEet] [^111DiYEq] [^115oYhSW] [^111Yo7y8].

---

Pamelor (nortriptyline) is **not recommended for ADHD** [^1119zEet] due to a **lack of evidence of efficacy** [^111Yo7y8] and its omission from current guidelines [^111DiYEq]. It is **not FDA-approved for ADHD** and should be considered only when first-line stimulants and non-stimulants are **ineffective or contraindicated**, with close monitoring for cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects [^115acYeC] [^114sALti].

---

## Pharmacological properties and mechanism of action

Nortriptyline is a **tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)** that inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, increasing their synaptic levels. It also has anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects, which contribute to its side-effect profile [^115acYeC]. While ADHD treatments often target dopamine and norepinephrine pathways, nortriptyline's indirect effects on these neurotransmitters are **less specific** than those of stimulants or atomoxetine.

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy in ADHD

There is **limited and outdated evidence** regarding nortriptyline's efficacy in ADHD [^111Yo7y8]. Early studies suggested modest benefits, but these findings have **not been consistently replicated** or supported by recent research [^112XSGMa]. Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend nortriptyline** as a first- or second-line treatment for ADHD [^113p8UYm].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from major medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [^111orm8m] and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) [^1119zEet], **do not recommend nortriptyline** for ADHD management. Instead, they emphasize **FDA-approved medications**, including stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine) [^115i7cgX] [^111DiYEq].

---

## Comparison with other ADHD medications

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Stimulants | - Methylphenidate <br/> - Amphetamines | High efficacy [^112tnJo1] | Well-established safety profile | First-line treatment [^1119zEet] |
| Non-stimulants | - Atomoxetine <br/> - Guanfacine <br/> - Clonidine | Moderate efficacy [^112XSGMa] | Generally well-tolerated | Second-line treatment [^111DiYEq] |
| Antidepressants | - Bupropion <br/> - TCAs (including nortriptyline) | Limited efficacy [^111Yo7y8] | Higher risk of side effects [^115acYeC] | Not recommended |

---

Nortriptyline is **less effective** [^111Yo7y8] and carries a **higher risk of adverse effects** [^115acYeC] than stimulants and non-stimulant medications. Its use is generally **reserved for cases in which first-line treatments are ineffective or contraindicated**.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Nortriptyline is associated with several significant risks and side effects, including:

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Tachycardia, arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, and increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke [^115acYeC].

- **Psychiatric risks**: Suicidal ideation, agitation, anxiety, and mania [^115acYeC] [^114XYKD9].

- **Anticholinergic effects**: Dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive impairment [^115acYeC].

- **Other risks**: Weight gain, sedation, and potential for overdose toxicity [^115acYeC].

Given these risks, **careful monitoring and regular follow-up are essential** when prescribing nortriptyline [^114sALti].

---

## Specific patient populations

Nortriptyline may be considered in **specific patient populations** when **first-line treatments are contraindicated or ineffective** [^111DiYEq] — for example, **patients with stimulant use disorder**, who may be candidates for non-stimulant medications, including TCAs, when stimulants are contraindicated, and **patients with comorbid depression or anxiety**, who may benefit from nortriptyline for co-occurring mood disorders, although its usefulness for ADHD symptoms remains limited [^113brPpa].

---

## Long-term outcomes and safety considerations

Evidence regarding the long-term effectiveness and safety of nortriptyline in ADHD is **limited**. Most available data focus on short-term outcomes, and **long-term studies are lacking**. This uncertainty **further limits its use in clinical practice**.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Nortriptyline (Pamelor) is **not recommended as a primary treatment for ADHD** given limited evidence of efficacy and significant potential risks [^111Yo7y8] [^115acYeC]. Current clinical guidelines emphasize **FDA-approved stimulants and non-stimulant medications** as first-line treatments [^1119zEet] [^111orm8m]. Nortriptyline may be considered **only in specific cases** in which first-line treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, and **careful monitoring is essential** [^111DiYEq] [^114sALti].

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^11524h9e]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2015). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide. ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failures, accidents, criminality, social disability, and addictions throughout an individual's lifetime. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases, ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors, each having a small individual effect and acting together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the disorder's heterogeneity, evidenced by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment, and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it.

The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of the patient's developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although no curative treatments for ADHD exist, evidence-based treatments can markedly reduce symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and generally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^116e7yRQ]. Lancet (2020). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), like other psychiatric disorders, represents an evolving construct that has been refined and developed over the past several decades in response to research into its clinical nature and structure. The clinical presentation and course of the disorder have been extensively characterized. Efficacious medication-based treatments are available and widely used, often alongside complementary psychosocial approaches. However, their effectiveness has been questioned because they might not address the broader clinical needs of many individuals with ADHD, especially over the longer term.

Non-pharmacological approaches to treatment have proven less effective than previously thought, whereas scientific and clinical studies are starting to fundamentally challenge conceptions of the causes of ADHD in ways that might have the potential to alter clinical approaches in the future. In view of this:

- **Diagnosis, epidemiology, and treatment of ADHD**: We first provide an account of these aspects from the perspective of both the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the eleventh edition of the International Classification of Diseases.
- **Understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of ADHD**: We review the progress in this area based on science over the past decade or so.
- **Key challenges to models and treatment of ADHD**: Finally, using these discoveries, we explore some of the challenges and the ways in which these findings can promote new perspectives.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to May 13, 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, handsearched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' generalisability, such as exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity.

### Childhood: A suitable case for treatment [^11726CgY]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

We examine the contemporary debate on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, in which concerns about medicalisation and overuse of drug treatments are paramount. We show medicalisation in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to be a complex issue that requires systematic research to be properly understood. In particular, we suggest that the debate on this disorder might be more productive and less divisive if longitudinal, evidence-based understanding of the harms and benefits of psychiatric diagnosis and misdiagnosis existed, as well as better access to effective, non-drug treatments. If articulation of the values that should guide clinical practice in child psychiatry is encouraged, this might create greater trust and less division.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Effects of treatment and non-treatment [^113rbqSq]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The results of four studies included in this analysis, which used both types of comparators within the same study — (1) non-ADHD controls and (2) untreated ADHD participants or ADHD participants' pretreatment baseline — were consistent with the present overall observations. There was clear improvement or stabilization with the treatment of ADHD for social function, antisocial behavior, and academic outcomes, but not to the extent that non-ADHD control outcomes were matched.

This general pattern was noticed in the earliest of the four studies, as the authors conclude in their 12-year follow-up study that "The most striking finding of the study is the repetitive pattern of finding significant differences between the stimulant-treated hyperactives and their control group (with the control group almost invariably doing better). However, there are several areas in which the stimulant-treated hyperactives seem to do better than their untreated counterparts", referring to academic, driving, self-esteem, and social function outcomes. This pattern was also found in an 8-year follow-up study of a different sample, stating that "despite overall maintenance of improvement in functioning relative to baseline (pretreatment), the MTA group as a whole was functioning significantly less well than the non-ADHD classmate sample". In the present study, this pattern was broadly replicated across the outcome groups when analyzed individually. Comparisons against non-ADHD controls only may mask improvements with treatment.

It should be noted that ADHD Rating Scale IV total scores decline (improve) between ages.

### ADHD in children: Common questions and answers [^111DeDUk]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a multidimensional chronic neurodevelopmental condition that affects 8.4% of U.S. children between two and 17 years of age and may pose long-term morbidity if untreated. The evaluation for ADHD begins when parents or caregivers present to primary care physicians with concerns about behavior problems or poor school or social function. A comprehensive history and physical examination should assess for comorbid or other conditions that can mimic ADHD. The combination of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, criteria and validated screening tools completed by parents, teachers, or other adults can aid in establishing the diagnosis. The goals of treatment include symptom reduction and improved social and cognitive function.

- **Psychosocial interventions**: These are the recommended first-line treatment for preschool children (four to five years) and can improve overall function when used as adjunct therapy in elementary school children (six to 11 years of age) and adolescents (12 to 17 years of age).

- **Medication management**: Stimulant medications are well-established as an effective treatment for reducing symptoms of ADHD in elementary school children and adolescents. Nonstimulant medications are less effective but reasonable as adjunct or alternative therapy when stimulants are ineffective or not tolerated.

Regular follow-up is key in the management of ADHD and should assess symptoms, overall function, presence of comorbidities, adverse effects of treatment, and medication use.

### Treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents: A systematic review [^114G8Uzz]. Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Effective treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is essential to improving youth outcomes.

- **Objectives**: This systematic review provides an overview of the available treatment options.

- **Data sources**: We identified controlled treatment evaluations in 12 databases published from 1980 to June 2023; treatments were not restricted by intervention content.

- **Study selection**: Studies in children and adolescents with clinically diagnosed ADHD, reporting patient health and psychosocial outcomes, were eligible. Publications were screened by trained reviewers, supported by machine learning.

- **Data extraction**: Data were abstracted and critically appraised by one reviewer and checked by a methodologist. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Strength of evidence and applicability assessments followed Evidence-based Practice Center standards.

- **Results**: In total, 312 studies reported in 540 publications were included. We grouped evidence for medication, psychosocial interventions, parent support, nutrition and supplements, neurofeedback, neurostimulation, physical exercise, complementary medicine, school interventions, and provider approaches. Several treatments improved ADHD symptoms. Medications had the strongest evidence base for improving outcomes, including disruptive behaviors and broadband measures, but were associated with adverse events.

- **Limitations**: We found limited evidence of studies comparing alternative treatments directly and indirect analyses identified few systematic differences across stimulants and nonstimulants.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^116nobYd]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurocognitive behavioral developmental disorder most commonly seen in childhood and adolescence, which often extends to the adult years. Relative to a decade ago, there has been extensive research into understanding the factors underlying ADHD, leading to far more treatment options available for both adolescents and adults with this disorder. Novel stimulant formulations have made it possible to tailor treatment to the duration of efficacy required by patients and help mitigate the potential for abuse, misuse, and diversion. Several new non-stimulant options have also emerged in the past few years. Among these, cognitive behavioral interventions have proven popular in the treatment of adult ADHD, especially within the adult population who cannot or will not use medications, along with many medication-treated patients who continue to show residual disability.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117NtF7x]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Is treatment with methylphenidate associated with benefits or harms for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

Methylphenidate is associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms, general behavior, and quality of life; however, due to the very low quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the associated improvement is uncertain. Methylphenidate was also associated with an increased risk of nonserious adverse events. There are too few data to assess the association with serious adverse events.

### Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^117KWrvV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a childhood onset disorder that can persist into adulthood. Amphetamines are used to treat adult ADHD, but uncertainties persist about their efficacy and safety.

- **Objectives**: To examine the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for adults with ADHD, as well as the influence of dose, drug type, and release formulation type.

- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, UK Clinical Trials Gateway, and references obtained from articles and experts in the field. We conducted the electronic searches on 25 February 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of amphetamine derivatives against placebo or an active intervention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors extracted data from each included study. We used the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the risk ratio (RR) to assess continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. We conducted a stratified analysis to determine the influence of moderating variables. We assessed the trials for risk of bias and drew a funnel plot to investigate the possibility of publication bias.

- **Main results**: We included seven studies, which enrolled 1,091 participants. All studies were placebo-controlled, and three included an active comparator: guanfacine, modafinil, and paroxetine. Most studies had short-term follow-up, with a mean study length of 8.1 weeks. Amphetamines improved ADHD symptom severity (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.57) but did not improve retention in treatment overall.

### Mechanism of action of agents used in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^1153AoQ9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Several medications have been demonstrated to be effective in treating individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There appears to be some commonality in the physiological mechanisms of action of these agents relevant to the treatment of ADHD. Either direct or indirect attenuation of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission appears related to both stimulant and non-stimulant medications efficacious in ADHD. However, important differences exist both between and within the specific classes of agents. Elucidating the various mechanisms of action of ADHD medications may lead to better choices in matching potential response to the characteristics (e.g. genotype) of individuals.

### Nonpharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review [^112sbMiJ]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Nonpharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) encompass a range of care approaches, from structured behavioral interventions to complementary medicines. This review aims to assess the comparative effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments for ADHD among individuals 17 years of age and younger.

The data for this review were sourced from PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The studies were selected based on their publication in English between January 1, 2009, and November 7, 2016. We included studies that compared any ADHD nonpharmacologic treatment strategy with placebo, pharmacologic, or another nonpharmacologic treatment.

Data extraction involved gathering information on study design, patient characteristics, intervention approaches, follow-up times, and outcomes. For comparisons with at least three similar studies, a random-effects meta-analysis was utilized to generate pooled estimates.

Our review identified 54 studies of nonpharmacologic treatments, including neurofeedback, cognitive training, cognitive behavioral therapy, child or parent training, dietary omega fatty acid supplementation, and herbal and/or dietary approaches. The pooled results for omega fatty acids found no significant effects for parent rating of ADHD total symptoms (n = 411; standardized mean difference -0.32; 95% confidence interval -0.80 to 0.15; I² = 52.4%; p = 0.10) or teacher-rated total ADHD symptoms (n = 287; standardized mean difference -0.08; 95% confidence interval). Unfortunately, no new guidance was identified regarding the comparative effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Effects of treatment and non-treatment [^112vyFdx]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review and analysis explores the long-term outcomes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), focusing on the effects of treatment and non-treatment. The review considers various interventions and their impact on ADHD symptoms over extended periods.

- **Treatment outcomes**: Evidence suggests that consistent medication and behavioral therapies can lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes, including reduced symptoms and enhanced functional capabilities. The integration of multimodal treatment approaches is often more effective than single-mode interventions.

- **Non-treatment implications**: Individuals with untreated ADHD often experience persistent challenges in academic, occupational, and social settings, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and intervention. Long-term follow-ups indicate that untreated symptoms can exacerbate and lead to comorbidities.

The findings underscore the necessity for tailored treatment plans that consider individual patient needs and long-term monitoring to optimize outcomes in ADHD management.

### Getting to long-term effectiveness and safety of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications [^111hE6w8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use has dramatically increased in youth worldwide. Recent prevalence data in some European countries show expanded use, with one country now matching U.S. usage. However, substantial geographic differences remain regarding the extent to which children receive ADHD medications. These geographic differences raise research questions about which country's prevalence data represents appropriate medication use. We urgently need country-level studies to contribute to our understanding of an appropriate prevalence of ADHD medication use.

### Treatment outcomes with licensed and unlicensed stimulant doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138w7NB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines) are often prescribed at unlicensed doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Whether dose escalation beyond US Food and Drug Administration recommendations is associated with positive risk benefits is unclear.

The study aimed to investigate the impact of stimulant doses on treatment outcomes in adults with ADHD and to determine whether unlicensed doses are associated with positive risk benefits compared with licensed doses. Data were sourced from twelve databases, including published (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Sciences) and unpublished (ClinicalTrials.gov) literature, up until February 22, 2023, without language restrictions. Two researchers independently screened records to identify double-blinded randomized clinical trials of stimulants against placebo in adults (18 years and older) with ADHD.

Aggregate data were extracted and synthesized in random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and network meta-analyses. The main outcome measures included changes in ADHD symptoms and discontinuations due to adverse events.

Results indicated a total of 47 randomized clinical trials (7714 participants; mean age, 35 [SD, 11] years; 4204 male [56%]) were included. For methylphenidate, dose-response curves indicated additional reductions of symptoms with increments in doses; however, the gains were progressively smaller and accompanied by continued additional risk of adverse event dropouts. Network meta-analyses showed that unlicensed doses led to similar patterns of symptom reduction and adverse event risks.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^111RLS1t]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2024). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; also known as hyperkinetic disorder) is a common neurodevelopmental condition affecting children and adults worldwide. ADHD predominantly has a genetic etiology involving both common and rare genetic variants. Although some environmental correlates have been identified, establishing causation remains challenging.

The heterogeneity of ADHD is evident in the diverse presentation of symptoms, varying levels of impairment, numerous co-occurring mental and physical conditions, various domains of neurocognitive impairment, and extensive minor structural and functional brain differences. The diagnosis is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard diagnostic criteria.

While curative treatments for ADHD do not exist, evidence-based treatments substantially reduce symptoms and/or functional impairment. Medications are effective for core symptoms and are usually well tolerated. Additionally, some non-pharmacological treatments are valuable, particularly for improving adaptive functioning. Clinical and neurobiological research is ongoing and could lead to the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder.

Many adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were never diagnosed as children. The impairment caused by untreated ADHD can complicate or even lead to other psychiatric conditions. Accurate diagnosis and efficacious treatment of ADHD in adults, which may include pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, is vital to improve their functioning. When a patient has both ADHD and a co-occurring condition, the clinician should usually treat the most impairing condition first.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^116ZHTCW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder

Can I use doses of psychostimulants beyond the maximum licensed or recommended ones?

The maximum recommended doses of psychostimulants, which act by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine and, for amphetamines, inducing their release, for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in guidelines or formularies, may be higher than the maximum licensed doses by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Agency. More specifically, the maximum licensed dose of methylphenidate for children, except for osmotic release and prolonged release formulations (see below), is 60 mg/day. However, the British National Formulary (BNF) recommends a dose of up to 90 mg/day under the direction of a specialist.

For osmotic-release (Concerta® XL, Janssen Cilag, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK) and prolonged-release formulations (e.g. Xaggitin® XL, Ethypharm, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK, and Delmosart® prolonged-release tablet, Accord UK Ltd, Barnstaple, Devon, UK) of methylphenidate, the maximum licensed dose is 54 mg/day. However, the BNF mentions a maximum of 108 mg/day for Concerta® XL in line with other clinical guidelines, such as those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (caddra.ca). For lisdexamfetamine, both the maximum licensed and the BNF recommended dose is 70 mg/day.

Many prescribers will use doses above the maximum licensed ones, and some will also use doses beyond the maximum recommended in guidelines/formularies.

### Prenatal antidepressant use and risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: Population based cohort study [^115Qywp5]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

In another approach, we explored the impact of confounding by indication. Firstly, we compared preconception users of antidepressants (women who stopped treatment before conception) with never users. We restricted the cohort to mothers who neither used antidepressants nor antipsychotics during pregnancy. Mothers who had only used antidepressants before pregnancy were defined as the preconception group, which acted as a negative control group 1. An increased risk of ADHD in the offspring of mothers among the preconception group might indicate confounding by indication, as the fetus was not exposed to antidepressants.

Similarly, mothers with gestational use of antidepressants were compared with the preconception group to assess if there is a difference in risk of ADHD in children. Secondly, we assessed the association between maternal psychiatric disorders and risk of ADHD in children. The analysis was restricted to mothers with a psychiatric diagnosis who had never used antidepressants or antipsychotics before delivery (never users); this acted as negative control group 2. This allowed us to estimate the role of maternal psychiatric disorder in ADHD in their offspring. If a psychiatric disorder in mothers is associated with the risk of ADHD in offspring, it is a confounder between prenatal use of antidepressants and risk of ADHD. As a psychiatric disorder is an indication for antidepressants, this introduces the possibility of confounding by indication.

Thirdly, we restricted the analysis to mothers who used either antidepressants or antipsychotics during pregnancy. We repeated the analysis in this context to further assess any associations.

### The efficacy, safety, and practicality of treatments for adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111Yo7y8]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2000). Low credibility.

Studies examining interventions for adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were reviewed to evaluate their efficacy. These efficacy findings were supplemented with a preliminary system for judging safety and practicality. Results suggest that the stimulant drug methylphenidate (MPH) is safe and well-established empirically, although it has some problems with inconvenience and noncompliance.

Preliminary research supports the efficacy, safety, and practicality of some psychotherapeutic interventions, including behavioral classroom interventions, note-taking training, and family therapy. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants was judged to have minimal empirical support and debatable safety.

Very little is known about the long-term effectiveness of treatments, long-term compliance, or multimodal treatments for adolescents, such as stimulants plus behavior therapy.

### Psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^111Fh5KW]. Current psychiatry reports (2008). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic disorder requiring developmentally sensitive interventions across the lifespan. Although pharmacotherapy traditionally has been considered the first-line treatment for ADHD, many individuals continue to experience significant functional impairment or choose not to pursue pharmacotherapy. Thus, evidence-based alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacologic treatment for individuals with ADHD are needed. Behavioral parent training and behavioral school interventions are the only empirically supported nonpharmacologic interventions for children and adolescents with ADHD.

This article reviews recent additions to the ADHD literature, including evaluations of behavioral interventions in traditional clinical practice and schools, treatment efficacy for preschool-aged children and adults, and the investigation of a novel treatment for individuals with the predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Management [^114GHJ8p]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder of childhood and often persists into adulthood. ADHD is a neurophysiologic disorder defined in behavioral terms and associated with significant morbidity in the realms of social and academic success, and self-esteem. ADHD is often associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders and learning disabilities, which further impede the successful development of these individuals. It is essential that family physicians be knowledgeable about the presentation and diagnosis of ADHD.

Stimulant medications continue to be the mainstay of treatment, although many other medications, such as antidepressants and alpha blockers, are helpful adjuvants to therapy. Recommendations for treatment include an individualized, multimodal approach involving parents, teachers, counselors, and the school system. Treatment follow-up includes monitoring response to medications in various settings, as well as side effects. With time and interest, the family physician can develop the skills needed to treat this disorder.

### Bupropion for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^115vRigy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurobiological condition, characterized by behavioral and cognitive symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, and/or excessive activity. The syndrome is commonly accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities and is associated with educational and occupational underachievement. Although psychostimulant medications are the mainstay of treatment for ADHD, not all adults respond optimally to or can tolerate these medicines. Thus, alternative non-stimulant treatment approaches for ADHD have been explored. One of these alternatives is bupropion, an aminoketone antidepressant and non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Bupropion is registered for the treatment of depression and smoking cessation but is also used off-label to treat ADHD.

To assess the effects and safety of bupropion for the treatment of adults with ADHD, we conducted a comprehensive search. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases in February 2017. Additionally, we searched three trial registers and three online thesis portals, checked references of included studies, and contacted study authors to identify potentially relevant studies that were missed by our search.

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects, including adverse effects, of bupropion compared to placebo in adults with ADHD. Two review authors independently screened records and extracted data to ensure a rigorous and objective analysis.

### Methylphenidate for ADHD rejected from the WHO essential medicines list due to uncertainties in benefit-harm profile [^1124UCwg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder with global prevalence rates estimated between 3% and 5% in children and 2.5% in adults, depending on the classification system used. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used medications for ADHD. In this analysis, we describe the evidence in the field, the application for inclusion of methylphenidate on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the comments raised regarding the application, and the WHO Expert Committee's decision.

The application for getting methylphenidate on the WHO list was overly optimistic in reporting potential benefits without adequately highlighting key uncertainties and harms. Decisions about medicines considered for the WHO Model List should not be based on speculative potential benefits but should fully incorporate areas of uncertainties. Even though methylphenidate has been used for over 60 years, the evidence concerning its benefits in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD remains uncertain. The committee decided not to include methylphenidate in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines due to uncertainties in the estimates of benefit and concerns regarding the quality and limitations of the available evidence for both benefit and harm.

### Long-term treatment of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^112orBzs]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Only 7% to 50% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) actually receive treatment. Among those who begin treatment, only 18% to 50% continue it for any extended duration, such as 2 to 3 years. Consequently, available data on the long-term effects of both medication and psychosocial treatment are limited and pose challenges. This article reviews existing data on the long-term effects of both stimulant and nonstimulant medication, as well as psychosocial treatment.

### Value of preclinical systematic reviews and meta-analyses in pediatric research [^1177BX2V]. Pediatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Not only justifying the intervention but also clarifying the comparison is crucial in pediatric systematic reviews (SRs). Commonly used comparisons in pediatric trials are "standard care", which may be an off-label drug or placebo. When the "standard care" is an off-label drug, there is the underlying problem of insufficient safety and effectiveness data. This raises the ethical dilemma of protecting children from research risks against not approved therapies. When a placebo is used as a comparison, one should have in mind that it may have a higher response rate in children and adolescents compared to adults. This may ultimately introduce the underestimation of the placebo effect and overestimation of the drug effect if the drug efficacy is extrapolated from adult trials.

Likewise, in adult SRs, the outcomes should be determined at the planning stage of the review. Considering the age-related maturational process, some benefits and harms of the intervention may appear later in life. Acknowledging this may influence which study designs and outcomes should be included in SR. For instance, a recent scoping review on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) brings up the limitations of the evidence on long-term outcomes of the intervention in children and adolescents with ADHD. It suggests the overdiagnosis and overtreatment in children and adolescents with ADHD, highlighting the gaps in evidence regarding the long-term benefits and harms of diagnosis and treatment of children with milder symptoms. Such "gaps in evidence" may be the outcome of interest in SRs even though they are not.

### Prenatal antidepressant use and risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: Population based cohort study [^112H5fH5]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

**Strengths and limitations of this study**: The novelty of the study is that we utilized two complementary planned negative control groups. An increased risk of ADHD was observed in children whose mothers had used antidepressants before conception (negative control group 1) and those mothers with a psychiatric diagnosis who had never used antidepressants (negative control group 2). Although it is difficult to adjust for confounding by indication in the classic population-based analysis, the outcomes of the two negative control analyses aid the interpretation of our results. To further explore the possibility of confounding by indication, we pre-selected mothers who used antipsychotic drugs as an active comparator group, and the lack of association in this analysis adds further weight to the interpretation. Finally, we also conducted a sibling matched analysis using sibling pairs. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of type 2 error in this analysis, the results further strengthen our hypothesis that confounding by indication may play a major role in the observed positive association between gestational use of antidepressants and ADHD in offspring. We have not been able to identify any other published studies that have applied such a comprehensive series of analyses to these associations. We recommend that this approach should be considered in future studies that investigate gestational drug use and outcomes in offspring, particularly diseases and disorders with high heritability that are therefore more likely to be confounded by indication.

### Risks and benefits of available treatments for adult ADHD [^111XtjNg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Several pharmacotherapeutic options, both FDA-approved and off-label, exist for the treatment of adult ADHD. The most commonly used agents include several stimulants and atomoxetine, which have demonstrated significant, though similar, efficacy for ADHD versus placebo. Treatment should be selected according to patient comorbidity profiles, cardiovascular risks, and risk of abuse of prescription medications. In this activity, treatments for ADHD with and without comorbidity are discussed, including mechanisms of action, safety risks, and the potential for substance abuse. Implementing psychosocial education in conjunction with pharmacotherapy is recommended.

### Long-term, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: An interim analysis [^115NRF4F]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early-onset neuropsychiatric disorder that affects 3% to 7% of school-age children and 4% of adults. Its pathophysiology is thought to involve the dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways associated with attention control and impulsivity. These symptoms have largely been defined in the childhood population, but the course of the condition and its expression in the adult population are not as well characterized.

This ongoing, 3-year, open-label study consists of adults with DSM-IV ADHD who were previously enrolled in one of two double-blind, acute-treatment studies of atomoxetine. The interim analysis presented here was derived from the study of 384 patients at 31 sites who had been observed for up to 97 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Investigator Rated: Screening Version (CAARS-Inv:SV) total ADHD symptom score. In addition, safety, adverse events, and vital sign measurements were assessed.

Significant improvement was noted with atomoxetine therapy, with mean CAARS-Inv:SV total ADHD symptom scores decreasing by 33.2%, from 29.2 (baseline of open-label therapy) to 19.5 (endpoint of open-label therapy) (p < .001). Similar and significant decreases were observed for the secondary efficacy measures. Adverse events consisted primarily of pharmacologically (noradrenergic) expected effects, such as increases in heart rate and blood pressure and a slight decrease in weight.

The results of this interim analysis of an ongoing study demonstrate that atomoxetine can lead to significant improvements in ADHD symptoms in adults and that the treatment is associated mainly with expected pharmacological side effects.

### Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and risk for non-affective psychotic disorder: The role of ADHD medication and comorbidity, and sibling comparison [^1124Bm6F]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder in childhood. It remains unclear whether ADHD increases the risk of non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD). The study included a matched cohort drawn from all individuals born in Sweden from 1987 to 1991 (n = 548,852). ADHD was defined by ICD diagnosis and/or the prescription of ADHD medication. A distinction was made between stimulants and non-stimulants, as well as usage duration: less than 1 year, 1 to 2 years, and 2 or more years.

We calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for NAPD, adjusted for confounders like comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substance abuse. ADHD cases were also compared to their unaffected full siblings. The analysis comprised 18,139 ADHD cases and 72,437 sex and birth year-matched controls. NAPD was more common in cases than controls (2.7% and 0.4%, respectively). After adjusting for confounders, ADHD cases showed a markedly higher risk for NAPD (OR: 6.99; 95% CI 6.03–8.10), which was further attenuated after additional adjustment for ASD and substance abuse (OR: 2.57; 95% CI 2.09–3.16).

The utilization of ADHD medication increased the risk for NAPD, with odds ratios for changes in NAPD risk associated with every five extra prescriptions being 1.06 (95% CI 1.02–1.10) for stimulants and 1.15 (95% CI 1.01–1.30) for non-stimulants. There was no association between the length of medication usage and the risk for NAPD. The risk was higher in individuals with ADHD compared to their unaffected siblings (OR: 2.95; 95% CI 2.07–4.20). Overall, ADHD was associated with an elevated risk for NAPD, which is not entirely explained by shared familial factors.

### Diagnosis and management of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^113brPpa]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood can persist into adulthood in at least 30% of patients, with 3% to 4% of adults meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, diagnostic criteria. A number of conditions, such as thyroid disease, mood disorders, and substance use disorders, have symptoms similar to those of ADHD and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Steroids, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, caffeine, and nicotine also can have adverse effects that mimic ADHD symptoms. Proper diagnosis and treatment can improve daily functioning.

Diagnosis relies on a thorough clinical history, supported by a number of rating scales that take five to 20 minutes to complete, depending on the scale. Clinical guidelines recommend stimulants and the nonstimulant atomoxetine as first-line treatments, followed by antidepressants. Cognitive behavior therapy has also been shown to be helpful as adjunctive treatment with medication. For adults with coexisting depression, the combination of an antidepressant and stimulants has been shown to be safe and effective. To monitor for misuse or diversion of stimulants, family physicians should consider using a controlled substances agreement and random urine drug screening in addition to regular follow-up visits.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend diagnosing ADHD according to the DSM-5 criteria. This includes documenting symptoms and impairment in one or more major settings (social, academic, or occupational). Information should be primarily drawn from reports by parents or guardians, teachers, other school personnel, and mental health clinicians involved in the patient's care. It is important to rule out any alternative causes.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^117Rwajw]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Stimulants, such as amphetamine-based and methylphenidate-based agents, and non-stimulants, including atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine, are licensed as pharmacological treatments for ADHD. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line treatment due to their greater efficacy. However, recommendations from international clinical guidelines are inconsistent with respect to the order in which stimulants should be offered, with some guidelines advocating for methylphenidate over amphetamines in children, while other guidelines make no distinction between the stimulants. The non-stimulant atomoxetine is recommended by guidelines as a second- or third-line treatment. As such, consumption patterns of different ADHD medications across geographical locations may differ but remain unclear.

We previously reported the prevalence of ADHD medication use in thirteen countries and one special administration region between 2001 and 2015 and found an increasing trend in all studied sites, with methylphenidate being the most commonly used ADHD medication in most countries. However, existing literature on global ADHD medication use beyond 2015, particularly from middle-income countries and geographical regions such as Africa, Central and South America, Southern and Western Asia, remains scarce. A recent study examined psychotropic medicine consumption in 65 countries and regions and found that geographical locations and income levels are explanatory factors for between-country/region consumption disparities. Furthermore, guanfacine and clonidine were not licensed for ADHD in most countries.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend addressing ADHD symptoms as part of the treatment for those with a co-occurring substance use disorder. Consider offering the following:

- **Psychostimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.

- **Non-stimulant medications**: To manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks.

- **Behavioral approaches**: These should be considered as part of the comprehensive treatment plan.

### Factors associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder among US children: results from a national survey [^116T5HGW]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

This study examines various factors linked to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among US children, using data from a national survey. The research aims to identify associations with ADHD and its subtypes, including ADHD and currently taking medication (ADHD-CM) and ADHD and not currently taking medication (ADHD-NCM). The primary abbreviations used throughout the study include ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), ADHD, and DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).

Various socio-economic and environmental factors are analyzed. These include body mass index (BMI), odds ratios (OR), educational background (EDUC), and family structure (FAMILY). The study also considers the impact of lifestyle elements such as participation in sports (SPORTS), computer usage (COMP), watching TV or playing video games (TV), and smoking status of family members (SMOKE).

Healthcare coverage indicators like healthcare maintenance organizations (HMOs) and insurance (INS) are assessed, along with the socio-economic status (SES) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) poverty guidelines (POVERTY). The analysis considers confidence intervals (CI) and standard errors (SE) to evaluate the statistical significance of the findings.

The data suggests correlations between ADHD prevalence and participation in clubs (CLUBS) and sports, socio-economic factors, depression (DEP), and anxiety (ANX). The study underscores the complexity of addressing ADHD within the pediatric population, requiring a nuanced understanding of its multifaceted influencers.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Effects of treatment and non-treatment [^112x1Gmz]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The number of studies of long-term outcomes of ADHD has risen noticeably over the last 30 years, especially since 2000. This corresponds to a trend in awareness of the consequences of ADHD by clinicians, which appears to be on the rise.

Treatment resulted in beneficial effects for many of the outcomes reported (72% of outcome results). These beneficial effects were observed as either significant improvement over the pretreatment baseline, in comparison to untreated ADHD participants, or stabilization of the outcomes (that is, prevention of the deterioration over time from baseline reported with untreated ADHD). Driving and obesity outcomes were the most often reported to be responsive to treatment. A decrease in obesity may be due to an appetite suppressant effect of stimulants and atomoxetine. The relatively small number of studies of these two outcomes (two studies each) comparing treated with untreated ADHD and the consistently positive response to treatment support further investigation in these areas.

- **Self-esteem, social function, and academic outcomes**: Three other outcomes that were often reported to be responsive to treatment. These results are supported by a relatively large number of studies (10, 12, and 21 studies, respectively) comparing participants with treated ADHD with participants with untreated ADHD. These outcomes may be more closely related to symptom relief. The outcomes reported are not independent of one another, and changes in one may reflect changes in others. The wider effects of response to treatment in these areas may warrant further investigation.

### Moderators and mediators of symptoms and quality of life outcomes in an open-label study of adults treated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^1166FeBV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The Quality of Life, Effectiveness, Safety, and Tolerability (QU.E.S.T.) study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of long-acting amphetamines in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in community practice settings. This article reports on the moderators and mediators of symptoms and quality of life outcomes.

This was an open-label study of 725 adults with DSM-IV-diagnosed ADHD, treated with mixed amphetamine salts extended release and followed for up to 8 months. Multiple regressions were used to determine if patient moderators impact the response in ADHD symptoms and how ADHD symptoms and medication satisfaction mediate quality of life. The study was conducted from December 2003 to December 2004.

Amphetamine treatment of ADHD resulted in a robust and enduring symptom response. Patient characteristics such as age, female gender, severity of illness, and treatment-naïve status moderate improved symptom outcomes. Symptom change and satisfaction with medication independently mediate changes in mental but not physical quality of life outcomes. There is no time lag between changes in symptoms and improved quality of life. Attention is a stronger mediator of ADHD-specific quality of life outcomes than disruptive behavior.

If symptoms and quality of life improve simultaneously, improvement in quality of life can be understood as more than just a downstream, secondary effect of symptom remission. Satisfaction with medication is a direct measure of the complex interplay of symptom change, tolerability, and patient perception.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113p8UYm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarize literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed, and further compounds are being investigated.

The publication of randomized controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently, there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults, and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Do stimulants reduce the risk for cigarette smoking in youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder? A prospective, long-term, open-label study of extended-release methylphenidate [^112B9DYj]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Although attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a well-known risk factor for cigarette smoking, prospective studies aimed at reducing smoking risk in this population are critically needed.

- **Study design**: This was a 2-year, prospective, open-label clinical trial of extended-release methylphenidate for smoking prevention in adolescents with ADHD (n = 154). Smoking outcomes were assessed with the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire. Comparisons were made using data from a historical, naturalistic sample of ADHD (n = 103) and non-ADHD comparators (n = 188) of similar age and sex assessed with the same assessment battery as that used in subjects participating in the clinical trial.

- **Results**: The smoking rate at endpoint (mean, 10 months of methylphenidate treatment) was low in the clinical trial subjects and not significantly different from that in the non-ADHD comparators or the ADHD comparators receiving stimulants naturalistically (7.1% vs 8.0% vs 10.9%; P > .20). In contrast, the smoking rate was significantly lower in the clinical trial subjects than in the naturalistic sample of ADHD comparators who were not receiving stimulant treatment (7.1% vs 19.6%; p = 0.009), adjusting for comorbid conduct disorder and alcohol and drug abuse.

- **Conclusion**: Although considered preliminary until replicated in future randomized clinical trials, the findings from this single-site, open-label study suggest that stimulant treatment may contribute to a decreased risk for smoking in adolescents with ADHD. If confirmed, this finding would have significant implications.

### Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children [^114M3dJx]. Health Psychology Research (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:

- **Definition**: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by pervasive and impairing symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, according to DSM-V.

- **Pathophysiology**: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is caused by biological factors, including genetics and brain structure, and their influence on neuropsychology. Environmental factors such as pregnancy or birth complications, exposure to environmental toxins, chaotic parenting, and diet also contribute.

- **Disease course**: The interplay of environmental and genetic factors, coupled with dysfunction in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellum, results in ADHD. This leads to clinical manifestations of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is associated with poor motor coordination, impaired academic functioning, unintentional physical injury, sleep disturbances, and poor quality of life (QoL).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is not associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality.

### Managing the risks of ADHD treatments [^114sALti]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a well-established and effective treatment modality; however, ADHD medications are not without side effects. Understanding the prevalence of adverse events and effective management of risks associated with stimulants and other medications used to treat ADHD is central to broad applicability and effective treatment. This review discusses the literature on the prevalence of adverse events and management strategies employed.

We conducted searches in online MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles using several keywords relating to adverse events associated with ADHD medication management. We discuss the relevant data on the significance and prevalence of side effects and adverse events, highlight recent updates in the field, and suggest approaches to clinical management.

### Prenatal antidepressant use and risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: Population based cohort study [^114r5vXY]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents. It is characterized by pervasive hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsiveness, which impairs the lives of young people. ADHD is common among school-aged children, with a worldwide prevalence of 5–7%. Rates of diagnosis are high in North America and, while ADHD is under-diagnosed in most other parts of the world, the rates of identified cases are increasing. Owing to early onset, lifelong persistence, and high levels of comorbidities and impairment associated with ADHD, its negative impact on social outcomes, education, and the health of patients and their caregivers is substantial. Understanding the risk factors for ADHD is an important public health matter.

Recent studies have suggested a potential association between maternal prenatal use of antidepressants, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the risk of ADHD in children. A systematic literature search identified six observational studies, including three cohort studies and three case-control studies, which investigated the association between antidepressant use in pregnancy and ADHD in children, with the study populations from Scandinavian countries or North America. However, findings were inconsistent. Only one case-control study restricted its sample to children aged at least 5 years, whereas the others did not. As ADHD is usually diagnosed clinically after age 5 years, previous studies might have identified unrepresentative samples because of large numbers of children.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Effects of treatment and non-treatment [^112sdq4s]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The National Institute of Health in the US funded the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA); this is one of the largest independent trials examining the effects on ADHD symptoms and long-term outcomes of different ADHD treatments, including intensive behavioral intervention, medication, these two treatments combined, or routine community care.

In the primary intent-to-treat analyses, outcomes in this study were not significantly different for pharmacological treatment alone versus combined treatment after correction for multiple tests, but the combined group allowed as good a result with a significantly lower dose of medication (methylphenidate). In two secondary analyses compositing several outcome measures, combined treatment was significantly better than pharmacological treatment alone.

An 8-year follow-up for this trial failed to differentiate the four treatment groups, demonstrating that regardless of treatment, participants showed improved outcomes (delinquency rating, reading and overall academic performance, and social skills) compared with baseline (pretreatment). The reasons why the original differences between groups disappeared after 8 years have been extensively debated, with arguments on opposite sides that medication was no longer effective, or that all participants improved from treatment and the improvement was sustained, or that the natural course of the disorder accounted for the improvement. The best interpretation may be that the data were confounded and conclusions difficult to draw. The MTA study is the best-known study of the long.

### Prenatal antidepressant use and risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring: Population based cohort study [^1126TKHt]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the potential association between prenatal use of antidepressants and the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring. The design was a population-based cohort study utilizing data from the Hong Kong population-based electronic medical records on the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. Participants included 190,618 children born in Hong Kong public hospitals between January 2001 and December 2009, with follow-up until December 2015.

The main outcome measure was the hazard ratio of maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy and ADHD in children aged 6 to 14 years, with an average follow-up time of 9.3 years (ranging from 7.4 to 11.0 years). Among the 190,618 children, 1,252 had a mother who used prenatal antidepressants. A total of 5,659 children (3.0%) were diagnosed with ADHD or received treatment for ADHD. The crude hazard ratio of maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy was 2.26 (P < 0.01) compared to non-use. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, including maternal psychiatric disorders and the use of other psychiatric drugs, the adjusted hazard ratio decreased to 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.82, P = 0.01).

Likewise, similar results were observed when comparing children of mothers who had used antidepressants before pregnancy with those who were never users, with a hazard ratio of 1.76 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.30, P < 0.01). The risk of ADHD in children of mothers with psychiatric disorders was higher compared to children of mothers without psychiatric disorders, even if the mothers had never used antidepressants (hazard ratio 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.54 to 2.18, P < 0.01). All sensitivity analyses were consistent with these findings.
