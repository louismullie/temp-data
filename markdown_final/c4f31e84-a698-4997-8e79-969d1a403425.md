## Question

central abdominal pain can be caused by

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause central abdominal pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying what "central" means here and distinguish location from central mediation. Then, I should triage immediately dangerous causes and the emergency approach. Next, I will characterize pain by location and migration to refine the anatomic differential. After that, I should separate organic from functional etiologies and consider centrally mediated pain mechanisms. I will then screen for red flags and appropriate imaging. Next, I should review diagnostic adjuncts such as quantitative sensory testing and neuroimaging when central mediation is suspected. Finally, I will map treatments by etiology, consider special populations, and close with an integrative summary and caveats to avoid iatrogenic harm.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "central abdominal pain" can mean two different things, and I need to ensure I do not conflate them. Wait, this could refer to pain located in the midline/periumbilical or epigastric region, or it could mean pain that is centrally mediated by the CNS independent of ongoing peripheral input. I should double-check that the differential and management differ accordingly and explicitly state that "central location" does not automatically imply central sensitization or centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome, which is conceptually distinct and often independent of gut motility events.

> Now, I need to triage life-threatening and high-acuity causes first, especially because epigastric pain can mimic cardiac disease. Wait, let me verify the emergency priorities: in epigastric presentations, obtain ECG and cardiac enzymes early to exclude acute coronary syndromes, then assess for perforation, mesenteric ischemia, pancreatitis, and bowel obstruction based on exam and labs. I should confirm clinical red flags that raise the probability of significant pathology, including guarding, tachycardia, vomiting, and leukocytosis, and remember that the absence of all four substantially lowers the likelihood of serious intra-abdominal disease and may support safe discharge with follow-up. Hold on, I initially noted an epigastric pain review as ref "1ca5c28a"; I need to check the provided list and correct that the actual ref ID is "1ca5d28a", so I will use that for support going forward [^1149qknL] [^116wdgrL] [^1111Jzaz] [^111jUMNZ].

> Next, I should characterize pain location, timing, and radiation because midline pain narrows the anatomic approach. Let me think this through: epigastric pain often reflects gastroduodenal pathology such as functional dyspepsia, gastritis, or peptic ulcer disease, but I must keep pancreatitis and cardiac causes in mind. Periumbilical pain may represent early appendicitis, small bowel processes, or disorders of gut–brain interaction such as IBS, and migration of pain can guide localization as in appendicitis that begins centrally and moves to the right lower quadrant. I should confirm that clinical pathways emphasize location-driven evaluation while integrating time course and associated symptoms such as vomiting or postprandial exacerbation [^111kDKdj] [^117MPGHq] [^111jUMNZ].

> Hold on, I should now separate organic from functional categories to avoid premature closure. Organic causes include inflammatory, infectious, mechanical, vascular, and neoplastic etiologies, so I need to check for features of IBD, appendicitis, diverticulitis, gastroenteritis or parasitic disease, mechanical obstruction or congenital anomalies such as Meckel diverticulum, and vascular events like mesenteric ischemia when risk factors and exam suggest these. I should verify that atypical and pediatric presentations are possible, which reinforces the need for careful imaging and observation when the story is not straightforward [^112SnJKg] [^1123nYgU] [^111kDKdj].

> Let me now consider functional disorders, but I need to ensure alarm features are absent first. IBS presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits and involves visceral hypersensitivity and brain–gut dysregulation; functional dyspepsia typically localizes to the epigastrium with postprandial distress or epigastric pain syndrome; functional abdominal cramping pain describes sudden, undulating cramping without bowel habit change and minimal interference with activities; centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome features persistent, often severe pain with minimal GI symptom correlation and a dominant central sensitization component. Wait, I should confirm prevalence ranges and clinical hallmarks to differentiate them properly at the bedside [^112M21Uj] [^117MPGHq] [^112QDC5r] [^1138ALj2] [^1155KKVz] [^115HkdBq].

> I will now examine the evidence for central mediation, because mistaking central sensitization for peripheral pathology can lead to unnecessary procedures. Let me verify the brain–gut circuitry: recent high-credibility work identifies a PVH to lateral septum pathway in visceral pain regulation, and a vagus-dominant tetra-synaptic NTS–LPB–PVT–prelimbic cortex circuit in gastric nociception, supporting central nodes that can amplify pain perception. I should confirm that centrally mediated conditions show disinhibition of pain signals rather than heightened peripheral input, and I must remember the phenomenon of opioid-induced hyperalgesia or narcotic bowel syndrome, which paradoxically worsens pain until opioids are tapered and withdrawn [^113HvYZP] [^112ap4sF] [^116xFdM3] [^114nxzhQ] [^114QrX1P].

> Before diagnosing a functional or centrally mediated condition, I need to ensure red flags are absent to avoid missing organic disease. I should double-check absolute alarm features such as age of new-onset pain in older adults, unintentional weight loss, nocturnal pain, GI bleeding, anemia, persistent vomiting, fever, or a mass, and verify that family history of IBD or colorectal cancer modifies pretest probability. If any are present, I will not jump to conclusions and will instead pursue targeted imaging, using ultrasound first for right upper quadrant and CT for lower quadrant pain per appropriateness criteria [^112QDC5r] [^1138ALj2] [^117PDmzo].

> For ambiguous cases where central mediation is suspected, I should confirm whether adjunctive testing can help phenotype pain. Quantitative sensory testing of the abdomen now has normative values by age and sex, allowing evaluation of pressure, thermal, and electrical thresholds; central amplification patterns may show preserved detection with reduced pain thresholds, consistent with hyperalgesia. Wait, neuroimaging does not diagnose at the individual level, but resting-state fMRI studies demonstrate altered regional homogeneity in insula and cingulate correlating with pain severity in GI disease, supporting central processing differences when clinical evaluations are otherwise unrevealing [^112CML84] [^1119t8s6].

> Treatment must be etiology-driven, so I need to ensure I match therapy to the source. For organic disease, I will treat the underlying pathology, such as source control for sepsis or obstruction, anti-inflammatory or disease-modifying therapy for IBD, and reserve surgery when indicated. Let me remember that in IBD, controlling inflammation comes first, and then I should reassess for residual functional pain mechanisms and avoid defaulting to opioids given risks of hyperalgesia and worse outcomes [^114QrX1P].

> For IBS and other disorders of gut–brain interaction, I should confirm a multimodal plan. Diet strategies such as low FODMAP can reduce meal-related pain, antispasmodics may relieve cramping, and central neuromodulators can modulate pain pathways when symptoms persist; emerging data also support endocannabinoid system modulation as a rational target for visceral pain, though I need to balance efficacy with safety and local regulations. Hold on, I should tailor neuromodulator selection to pain, bowel habit, and comorbid anxiety or depression rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach [^112M21Uj] [^115pQeHB] [^112HwQWX] [^111m5yah].

> For centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome, I need to ensure I do not rely on peripherally focused analgesics. Let me double-check the randomized data: both local lidocaine and an opioid analgesic showed no short-term efficacy in CAPS, reinforcing that central mechanisms predominate and guiding me toward centrally targeted neuromodulators and behavioral therapies grounded in the fear-avoidance model. But wait, if I suspect narcotic bowel syndrome, opioid taper and withdrawal are essential steps to enable recovery of pain modulatory systems and prevent perpetuation of hyperalgesia [^115HkdBq] [^117LWK2G] [^1155KKVz] [^113yBoUg] [^114nxzhQ].

> I should not forget special populations, because the pretest probabilities and consequences differ. In women of childbearing age, I need to consider gynecologic etiologies and pregnancy-related complications alongside GI causes; in older adults, malignancy and vascular disease are more likely and presentations may be atypical; in children and adolescents, functional dyspepsia and other disorders of gut–brain interaction are common, with age-specific red flags guiding testing and a preference for conservative imaging to minimize radiation exposure [^111kDKdj] [^117MPGHq].

> To integrate this, let me reconsider the two meanings of "central abdominal pain" so I apply the right pathway. If "central" means midline location, I will first rule out cardiac and catastrophic intra-abdominal causes, then use location, migration, and time course to distinguish acute surgical from medical etiologies and, in chronic cases, parse functional from organic using red flags, selective testing, and response to initial therapy. If "central" means centrally mediated, I should confirm negative peripheral workup, consider QST or research-grade neuroimaging patterns as supportive evidence, and then prioritize centrally acting neuromodulators, behavioral therapies, and avoidance of opioids, recognizing that peripherally directed analgesics will often fail in CAPS. Finally, I should remember that even after thorough evaluation, up to one-third of abdominal pain in primary care remains unexplained, so I need to avoid overtesting and iatrogenic harm while validating the patient's pain and providing evidence-based management and follow-up [^117PDmzo] [^112CML84] [^113yBoUg] [^112MiJLT].

Central abdominal pain has diverse etiologies, including **gastrointestinal disorders** (such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction, and irritable bowel syndrome), **vascular emergencies** (such as abdominal aortic aneurysm and mesenteric ischemia), **metabolic/endocrine issues** (such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hypercalcemia), **infectious diseases** (such as gastroenteritis and parasitic infections), and **functional or centrally mediated syndromes** (such as functional dyspepsia and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome) [^114UY3kK] [^1114fmQt]. A thorough **clinical evaluation** — including history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic testing — is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate management [^111kDKdj].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

- **Gastritis and peptic ulcer disease**: Inflammation or ulceration of the stomach or duodenum can cause central abdominal pain, often associated with nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia [^111jUMNZ].

- **Pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas typically presents with severe central abdominal pain radiating to the back, often associated with nausea and vomiting [^111jUMNZ].

- **Small bowel obstruction**: Obstruction of the small intestine causes central abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and constipation [^111kDKdj].

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: A functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits [^112M21Uj].

---

## Vascular causes

Vascular causes include **abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** — a dilatation of the abdominal aorta that can cause central abdominal pain, particularly if ruptured or leaking — and **mesenteric ischemia**, in which reduced intestinal blood flow causes severe central abdominal pain often disproportionate to physical findings [^1149qknL].

---

## Metabolic and endocrine causes

Metabolic and endocrine causes include **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** — a complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis — presenting with central abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and **hypercalcemia**, in which elevated calcium levels can cause central abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation [^1114fmQt].

---

## Infectious causes

Infectious causes include **gastroenteritis** [^112MiJLT], a gastrointestinal infection causing central abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, and **parasitic infections**, in which parasites such as Giardia lamblia or Entamoeba histolytica can cause central abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss [^112SnJKg].

---

## Functional and centrally mediated pain syndromes

Functional and centrally mediated pain syndromes include **functional dyspepsia**, which presents with chronic upper abdominal pain or discomfort without an identifiable organic cause and is often associated with bloating, nausea, and early satiety, and **centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS)**, a chronic abdominal pain syndrome thought to result from central sensitization [^111axdUo] and altered pain processing in the central nervous system [^114nxzhQ].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause of central abdominal pain:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history, including onset, duration, character, associated symptoms, and risk factors, followed by thorough physical examination [^1114fmQt].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, liver function tests, amylase/lipase, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers [^116wdgrL].

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as indicated [^117PDmzo].

- **Endoscopy**: Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy if gastrointestinal pathology is suspected [^111kDKdj].

---

Central abdominal pain can result from **gastrointestinal, vascular, metabolic, infectious, and functional conditions**. A thorough **clinical evaluation**, with targeted diagnostic testing, is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^114UY3kK].

### Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome [^112M21Uj]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on irritable bowel syndrome:

- **Definition**: IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, or both), often with associated bloating.

- **Pathophysiology**: The etiology of IBS is poorly understood. Potential etiological mechanisms include genetic factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, chronic infections, and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability; disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10–20% of patients with diarrhea); abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of IBS is estimated at 196 cases per 100,000 person-years, with an estimated prevalence of 5–12% based on Rome II criteria.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations include abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: There is no evidence that IBS is associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, patients with IBS exhibit a poorer quality of life and utilize the healthcare system to a greater degree than patients without the diagnosis.

### Centrally mediated disorders of gastrointestinal pain [^114nxzhQ]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Centrally Mediated Abdominal Pain Syndrome (CAPS), formerly known as Functional Abdominal Pain Syndrome, can be distinguished from other functional GI disorders by its strong central component and relative independence from motility disturbances. CAPS results from central sensitization with disinhibition of pain signals, rather than increased peripheral afferent excitability. A newly described condition, Narcotic Bowel Syndrome (NBS)/Opioid-Induced GI Hyperalgesia, is characterized by paradoxical development of or increases in abdominal pain associated with continuous or increasing dosages of opioids. Patients experience relief only when opioids are withdrawn. Both conditions are defined in the context of epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment, emphasizing the importance of a physician-patient relationship in all aspects of care.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^112QDC5r]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

When diagnosing functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) in primary care, it is essential to begin by ruling out any "red flags" or alarm signals indicative of structural organic disease, which would require referral to a specialist.

- **Ruling out organic pathology**:
	- The initial evaluation of a patient presenting with FACP symptoms involves identifying potential serious organic diseases. Key red flag signs and symptoms that could indicate structural disease are necessary for consideration. If any signs are present, a referral to a specialist is warranted for further investigation.

	- A comprehensive assessment should include:
	- **Family history, medication, and characteristics of pain**:
		Investigations should focus on a detailed evaluation of family medical histories, current medications, pain characteristics, and eating/bowel habits.
	- **Selected cases may require**:
		At the doctor's discretion, a physical examination (including an assessment of bowel sounds and a digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and a psychosocial assessment could be utilized. Additionally, abdominal ultrasound investigations may be beneficial.

These steps ensure a thorough investigation and can help distinguish FACP from more serious conditions requiring specialist intervention.

### Abdominophrenic dyssynergia: A narrative review [^114i9cWW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic bloating and abdominal distension are common and highly bothersome gastrointestinal symptoms. Although the differential diagnoses for bloating and distension are broad, these symptoms are frequently associated with disorders of the gut-brain interaction. Functional abdominal bloating may result from visceral hypersensitivity, whereas abdominal distension seems to be a somatic behavioral response associated with abdominophrenic dyssynergia, featuring diaphragmatic contraction and abdominal wall relaxation. We review the available literature regarding abdominophrenic dyssynergia and comment on its epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and avenues to address in the near future.

### A vagus nerve dominant tetra-synaptic ascending pathway for gastric pain processing [^112ap4sF]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Gastric pain has limited treatment options, and the mechanisms within the central circuitry remain largely unclear. This study investigates the central circuitry in gastric pain induced by noxious gastric distension (GD) in mice. Here, we identified that the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) serves as the first-level center of gastric pain, primarily via the vagus nerve. The prelimbic cortex (PL) is engaged in the perception of gastric pain. The lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB) and the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) are crucial regions for synaptic transmission from the NTS to the PL. The glutamatergic tetra-synaptic NTS–LPB–PVT–PL circuitry is necessary and sufficient for the processing of gastric pain. Overall, our finding reveals a glutamatergic tetra-synaptic NTS–LPB–PVT–PL circuitry that transmits gastric nociceptive signaling by the vagus nerve in mice and provides insight into the gastric pain ascending pathway, offering potential therapeutic targets for relieving visceral pain.

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^1136UUMU]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Disorders of the gut-brain interaction (DGBI) encompass various conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation (IBS-C), irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D), irritable bowel syndrome with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M), and irritable bowel syndrome unsubtyped (IBS-U).

With an increasing number of DGBI diagnoses within the main anatomical DGBI categories, a gradual increase in the proportion of subjects with frequent meal-related abdominal pain was noted (Fig. 3). Within the subgroup of individuals with four DGBI diagnoses, the proportion of subjects with frequent meal-related abdominal pain was higher than the proportion of subjects with occasional and no meal-related abdominal pain (66.5% vs. 28.9% vs. 4.5%, respectively).

- **Analysis**: When the number of DGBI diagnoses increased from zero to four, a gradual increase in the proportion of subjects with frequent meal-related abdominal pain (≥ 50% of the abdominal pain episodes were meal-related) was noted. Conversely, a gradual decrease in the proportion of subjects with no meal-related abdominal pain (0% of the abdominal pain episodes were meal-related) was observed. For this analysis, DGBI diagnoses were grouped within the main anatomical DGBI categories: esophageal, gastroduodenal, bowel, and anorectal disorders.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^1138ALj2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The algorithm for the symptomatic management of functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is designed for use by physicians. FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen. This pain lasts from seconds to minutes or up to a few hours, without any "red flag" signs or symptoms of structural organic disease, and is typically not strongly associated with defecation, which might indicate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Importantly, FACP typically does not significantly interfere with daily activities. Abbreviations used include FACP (functional abdominal cramping pain), IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), and TCA (tricyclic antidepressant).

Given the prevalence of self-care among patients experiencing FACP, an adaptation of this algorithm could assist pharmacists and patients in enhancing self-management. It aims to raise awareness of "red flag" signs and symptoms that warrant referral to or consultation with a physician, and to highlight alternative approaches that patients might not consider intuitively (Figs. 3, 4). These algorithms could serve as the foundation for pharmacist and patient education, promoting the recognition and effective self-treatment of FACP.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^117JGrYW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Emergency department providers have become skilled at triaging patients with abdominal pain requiring surgical interventions. However, abdominal pain mimics, which are medical conditions that cause the sensation of abdominal pain without abdominal abnormality, continue to puzzle even the best physicians.

### The abdominal wall: An overlooked source of pain [^111WSypB]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

When abdominal pain is chronic and unremitting, with minimal or no relationship to eating or bowel function but often a relationship to posture (i.e. lying, sitting, standing), the abdominal wall should be suspected as the source of pain. Frequently, a localized, tender trigger point can be identified, although the pain may radiate over a diffuse area of the abdomen. If tenderness is unchanged or increased when abdominal muscles are tensed (positive Carnett's sign), the abdominal wall is the likely origin of pain. Most commonly, abdominal wall pain is related to cutaneous nerve root irritation or myofascial irritation. The pain can also result from structural conditions, such as localized endometriosis or rectus sheath hematoma, or from incisional or other abdominal wall hernias. If hernia or structural disease is excluded, injection of a local anesthetic with or without a corticosteroid into the pain trigger point can be diagnostic and therapeutic.

### Functional dyspepsia: An enigma in a conundrum [^117MPGHq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

As defined by Rome III, there are four abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children: irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia (FD), abdominal migraine, and functional abdominal pain. Dyspepsia is a constellation of symptoms referable to the gastroduodenal region of the upper gastrointestinal tract. FD refers to dyspeptic symptoms that cannot currently be explained by an organic cause, affecting 25% to 40% of the adult population over a lifetime. In children, this condition results in increased specialist consultations, with reported prevalence between 3% and 27%. The Rome III criteria for pediatric FD include the presence or persistence of pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, without evidence of organic disease or change in frequency of stools. Symptoms must be chronic, occurring at least weekly and over a period of at least six months. The goal of this article is to provide a narrative review of the diagnosis and management of FD in the pediatric population. A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) was carried out to identify all articles published in English from 1998 to November 2015, using three key terms: "FD", "functional gastrointestinal disorders", and "children".

### Quantitative somatosensory testing of the abdomen: Establishing initial reference values across developmental age and biological sex [^112CML84]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common symptom of several debilitating conditions (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and endometriosis) and affects individuals throughout their lifespan. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) reference values exist for many body sites but not the abdomen. Using a QST battery adapted from the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain, we collected QST data on the upper and lower abdomen in 181 pain-free participants, ages 12 to 50 years, to establish reference values by age and biological sex.

The normative values are presented as medians for each QST measure by sex (male, n = 63; female, n = 118) and across three age categories: adolescents (12–19 years, n = 48), young adults (20–30 years, n = 87), and adults (31–50 years, n = 46). Evaluating the sensory functioning of the abdomen and characterizing ranges of QST measures is an essential first step in understanding and monitoring the clinical course of sensory abnormalities in patients with underlying diseases affecting the abdomen and pelvis. The impact of age and development on sensory functioning is necessary, given age-related changes in pain perception and modulation.

### Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of local analgesic (lidocaine) and opioid analgesic (sufentanil) on patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^115HkdBq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Clinically, lidocaine surface anesthesia is often used for superficial surgery or endoscopic examination of the nose, pharynx, trachea, and urethra, among others. Intrarectal infusion of lidocaine gel has been reported to effectively relieve pain in patients with IBS. Submucosal injection of lidocaine has shown efficacy in controlling postoperative pain after endoscopic submucosal dissection in patients with early gastric cancer. Intraperitoneal and intravenous administration of lidocaine was also effective in alleviating postoperative laparoscopic pain.

In our study, a negative effect was demonstrated when local analgesic lidocaine was sprayed in patients with CAPS. In a previous study, patients with functional abdominal pain syndrome were found to have normal rectal perceptual thresholds — an indication of normal sensitivity to painful distention. This suggests a different mechanism of abdominal pain in CAPS. Physiological visceral afferent input from the gut plays a lesser role in symptom generation of CAPS compared to other FGIDs. It differs from IBS and functional dyspepsia, which are related to peripheral events such as food intake or defecation.

No consistent initiating triggers are noted in CAPS, and the central mediation role is dominant. This may indicate the possibility of consistent activity of the responsible brain functional region even without peripheral afferent stimulus. On the other hand, if the chronic pain neural circuit is underlying, there is also a possibility of peripheral activation.

### The potential role of behavioral therapies in the management of centrally mediated abdominal pain [^113yBoUg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain carries a substantial healthcare burden, but little is known about best practices for its management across ambulatory, hospital, and emergency room settings. This is particularly true when abdominal pain presents without peripheral triggers like tissue injury (e.g. appendicitis) or altered bowel movements (e.g. IBS). Once central sensitization occurs, pain can manifest without any stimulation or with minimal peripheral stimulation, such as the feeling of clothing on the area of the abdomen. Several studies have demonstrated the superior efficacy of behavioral interventions in managing many centrally mediated pain conditions, including headaches and musculoskeletal problems. However, behavioral treatment of centrally mediated abdominal pain is less investigated, due to the complexity of the patients involved and the limited understanding of the factors that either initiate or maintain persistent GI pain.

We examine the evidence for a range of psychological and behavioral interventions in the context of centrally mediated abdominal pain. In addition to providing a strong rationale for a behavioral approach tied to the fear-avoidance model of pain, we describe the structure, therapeutic targets, evidence, and relevance for each class of behavioral interventions.

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^1167sZGz]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a substantial proportion of the worldwide population experiences frequent meal-related abdominal pain. Identifying these subjects in the general population is important to assess the magnitude of this problem. However, identifying them in clinical practice could also be of importance. This could allow clinicians to propose a management strategy that focuses more on meal-related issues, potentially involving the help of trained dieticians. To improve the management of these subjects, more studies investigating meal-related gastrointestinal symptoms (beyond abdominal pain) are needed. This will help us to understand the complete symptom profile of this specific subgroup and enhance our understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Somatoform abdominal pain in surgery: Is SD worthy of surgical attention? Case reports and literature review [^114M1M9P]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Somatoform disorders (SD), or medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS), are a group of disorders characterized by symptoms that cannot be explained by organic or physical pathology. These disorders are widely prevalent, and if unrecognized, SD may lead medical professionals to undertake tests or procedures that could result in unnecessary iatrogenic complications. Despite the high prevalence, they are inadequately included in medical training curricula at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

In this article, we review the literature and present two cases. The first case involved a patient who presented with an acute abdomen and underwent an unnecessary CT scan. The second case involved a laparoscopy for acute right-sided abdominal pain; the results were normal, but the patient was readmitted shortly after with acute urine retention, which resolved spontaneously following discussion with the patient and family. Both cases were referred for psychiatric assessment, and their family doctors were informed.

### Visceral perception: inflammatory and non-inflammatory mediators [^111AC3Hh]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Visceral hypersensitivity is currently the most widely accepted mechanism responsible for abdominal pain. Inflammatory mediators are known to sensitize primary afferents and recruit silent nociceptors. Recent evidence suggests that non-inflammatory mediators also have the potential to trigger visceral pain. This sequence of events may constitute part of an alerting system that prompts the central nervous system to correct gastrointestinal responses to ingestion.

### Evidence-based medicine approach to abdominal pain [^1114fmQt]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The chief complaint of abdominal pain accounts for 5% to 10% of all presentations in the emergency department. With such a broad differential and numerous diagnostic modalities available, this article focuses on a systematic approach to evaluating abdominal pain, which is essential for providing patients with efficient and accurate care.

### Ex vivo study of human visceral nociceptors [^115nyZRJ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom of gastrointestinal (GI) disease. For many patients, this presents a chronic problem without any clear underlying pathology. Treating chronic abdominal pain is clinically challenging due to the lack of efficacy or presence of gut-specific side effects of many analgesics. As a result, abdominal pain is a significant factor in the long-term morbidity associated with many GI diseases, impacting negatively on various quality of life indicators such as fatigue, sleep, and depression. Conditions characterized by chronic pain are consistently identified as a major burden on the healthcare system, underpinning the need to develop new, safe, and effective treatments from both clinical and socioeconomic perspectives.

One approach to analgesic development has been to target sensory nerves called nociceptors that transduce painful or noxious stimuli from the periphery to the central nervous system. This approach has therapeutic potential as evidenced by the effectiveness of local anesthetics, which inhibit peripheral input into the pain pathway. A goal of research in this area has been to identify mechanisms specific to nociceptor activation that can reproduce the efficacy of local anesthetics without the side effects associated with pan-sodium channel blockade.

In particular, the identification of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels as key transducers of noxious stimuli such as heat, cold, and pressure, and as downstream effectors of receptor activation by inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, ATP, or prostaglandins, has been the focus of recent studies.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, prioritizing life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### Centrally targeted pharmacotherapy for chronic abdominal pain [^114rK7oQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain in the context of functional gastrointestinal disorders diverges from the traditional approach to treating gastrointestinal symptoms. It involves a dysregulation of brain-gut modulation of afferent signaling, so treatments focused solely on the gut are often insufficient to achieve a clinical response. Rather, the treatment methods depend on re-establishing central pain regulation.

A conceptual model of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors explains how chronic pain develops, providing evidence for central neuron degeneration as a key component of this process. The rationale for centrally targeted medications, particularly antidepressants, is discussed in terms of their effects independent of treating psychiatric disorders, such as the downregulation of afferent pain signals and their potential role in neuron proliferation.

Guiding examples of which drugs to use and treatment combinations, including augmentation treatment involving multiple drugs, are outlined. Additionally, some brief clinical cases of centrally targeted pharmacotherapy are presented.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain without vomiting, guarding, or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra-abdominal pathology. Therefore, these patients can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function tests are helpful in indicating the possibility of biliary colic, as is microscopic hematuria, which may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common in emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illnesses, which have no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. High white blood cell (WBC) counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. Indeed, for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain, the most common diagnosis with an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness, pain migration, and vomiting may help differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease. Patients with the latter tend to have raised white cell counts and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can complicate differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically, and patients commonly undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging, such as ultrasound, is helpful…

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^116wdgrL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common cause for emergency admission. While some patients have serious abdominal pathology, a significant group of those patients have no specific cause for the pain. This study was conducted to identify those who have non-specific abdominal pain who can be either admitted short term for observation or reassured and discharged for outpatient management.

- **Patients and methods**: A prospective documentation of clinical and laboratory data was obtained on a consecutive cohort of 286 patients who were admitted to a surgical unit over a nine-month period with symptoms of abdominal pain regarded as severe enough for full assessment in the casualty department and admission to a surgical ward. The patients were followed until a definite diagnosis was made or the patient's condition and abdominal pain improved and the patient was discharged. The hospital where the study took place is a small peripheral general hospital serving a population of 120,000 people in a rural area in New Zealand.

- **Results**: There were 286 admissions to the emergency department. Logistic regression multivariate statistical analysis showed that guarding, raised white cell count, tachycardia, and vomiting were the only variables associated with significant pathology.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with no vomiting, no guarding, normal pulse rates, and normal white cell counts are unlikely to have significant pathology requiring further active intervention, either medical or surgical.

### Pain management in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: translational approaches from bench to bedside [^114QrX1P]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that negatively affects quality of life and can lead to increased health-seeking behavior. Although abdominal pain has been traditionally attributed to inflammation, there is growing literature demonstrating the existence of functional abdominal pain in patients with IBD, of which there are a variety of potential causes. Thus, when approaching a patient with IBD who has abdominal pain, in addition to IBD-related complications (e.g. inflammation/stricture), it is important to screen for related contributors, including peripheral factors (visceral hypersensitivity, bacterial overgrowth, and bowel dysmotility) and centrally mediated neurobiological and psychosocial underpinnings. These central factors include psychological symptoms/diagnoses, sleep disturbance, and stress. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (e.g. narcotic bowel syndrome) is also growing in recognition as a potential central source of abdominal pain.

This review draws from clinical studies and animal models of colitis and abdominal pain to consider how knowledge of these potential etiologies can be used to individualize treatment of abdominal pain in patients with IBD, including the consideration of potential novel treatment modalities for the future. Accurate assessment of the source(s) of pain in patients with IBD can help guide appropriate diagnostic workup and use of disease-modifying therapy.

### Somatosensory changes in the referred pain area following acute inflammation of the appendix [^113qcJae]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain provoked by acute gastrointestinal disease may increase sensitivity in the referred somatic pain area. The aim of this study was to examine sensory changes in the referred pain area during acute appendicitis.

- **Subjects**: Twenty patients with clinical symptoms of appendicitis were included; 16 of these had appendicitis confirmed at operation. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls.

- **Methods**: In patients with symptoms of appendicitis, somatic sensitivity was assessed using different stimuli presented in the area of referred pain and in a comparable non-painful area at the contralateral site of the abdomen. In healthy control subjects, the same stimuli were presented to McBurney's point and at a similar area on the left abdomen. The rating to pinprick was determined using a Von Frey hair. The rating to thermal stimuli was tested by warm and cold metal rollers. A constant stimulator was used to measure the sensation and pain-detection threshold to single and repeated electrical stimuli. The pressure pain threshold was determined by an electronic pressure algometer.

- **Results**: Patients (n = 16) with verified appendicitis showed increased ratings to pinprick (50%, P < 0.05) and thermal stimuli (56%, P < 0.05) in the referred pain area. There was a reduction in pain thresholds to single electrical (4.3 v. 8.4 mA, P = 0.001), repeated electrical (3.5 v. 4.6 mA, P = 0.005), and pressure (89 v. 243 kPa, P < 0.001) stimuli in the referred pain area versus the control area. In the control group, no difference was observed between the two.

### Meckel diverticulum presenting as abdominal pain and subsequent bowel perforation [^1123nYgU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with a broad array of potential etiologies. Meckel diverticulum (MD), the most common congenital gastrointestinal malformation, classically presents with painless gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it can also lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, manifesting as abdominal pain.

- **Case report**: A 2-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and loose stools. Abdominal ultrasound findings were consistent with ileitis and ileocolic intussusception, but no such intussusception was seen during fluoroscopic air enema. The patient was admitted for serial abdominal examinations and subsequently developed an acute abdomen. Emergent laparotomy revealed a perforated MD. Small bowel resection and primary anastomosis were performed, and no complications developed.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: The presence of an MD can lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, putting the patient at risk of bowel perforation. As such, it is important to consider MD in the differential diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain. In cases in which sonographic findings are ambiguous or transient, additional observation or alternative imaging, such as computed tomography, should be strongly considered.

### Characterization of abdominal pain during methylnaltrexone treatment of opioid-induced constipation in advanced illness: A post hoc analysis of two clinical trials [^116rSSft]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Methylnaltrexone is a selective peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that decreases the constipating effects of opioids without affecting centrally mediated analgesia. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies of methylnaltrexone for opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness, abdominal pain was the most common adverse event (AE) reported.

The analysis sought to further characterize the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities-defined abdominal pain AEs experienced in these studies. A post hoc analysis of verbatim descriptions was used to further assess AEs characterized as abdominal pain in both trials. Descriptive summary statistics were used to assess the severity of abdominal pain, the effect of abdominal pain on global pain scores, and other characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of baseline characteristics with abdominal pain.

Most verbatim descriptions of abdominal pain referred to "abdominal cramps" or "cramping". Abdominal pain AEs were mostly mild to moderate in severity and did not affect patients' global evaluation of pain. The incidence of abdominal pain AEs in methylnaltrexone-treated patients was greatest after the first dose and decreased with subsequent doses. No association between abdominal pain AEs and most baseline patient characteristics was noted.

In conclusion, abdominal pain AEs in methylnaltrexone-treated patients in clinical trials are usually described as "cramps" or "cramping" and are mostly mild to moderate in severity.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^111pku6q]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Visceral pain is a common feature of many gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is a major cause of healthcare seeking, disability, and reduction in health-related quality of life. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a bidirectional, hierarchically controlled brain-body nexus that integrates the external environment with the internal milieu and has been postulated to play a critical role in the genesis and modulation of visceral pain through its multiple interactions with the nociceptive system at the level of the periphery, spinal cord, brainstem, and forebrain. Dysfunction of the ANS has been variably described in both IBD and IBS.

The main neural substrate of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is the vagus nerve, containing both afferent and efferent pathways. In humans, the vagus nerve innervates the entirety of the GI tract except the distal third of the colon. The efferent vagus nerve is increasingly considered to play a critical role in the neuro-endocrine-immune axis within the gut through what is termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Thus, the non-invasive measurement of vagal tone in humans is likely to remain high on the contemporaneous GI research agenda.

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^116DSZUU]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) report meal intake to be associated with symptoms. DGBI patients with meal-related symptoms may have more severe symptoms overall and worse health outcomes, but this subgroup has not been well characterized. We aimed to describe the global prevalence of meal-related abdominal pain and characterize this subgroup.

- **Methods**: The data analyzed originated from the Internet survey component of the population-based Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study, completed in 26 countries (n = 54,127). Adult subjects were asked whether they had abdominal pain and how often this was meal-related. Respondents were categorized into "no", "occasional", and "frequent" meal-related abdominal pain groups based on 0%, 10–40%, and ≥ 50% of the pain episodes being meal-related, respectively. DGBI diagnoses, frequency of other GI symptoms, psychological distress, non-GI somatic symptoms, quality of life, and healthcare utilization were compared between groups. Mixed linear and ordinal regression was used to assess independent associations between psychological distress, non-GI somatic symptoms, quality of life, other GI symptoms, and meal-related abdominal pain.

- **Results**: Overall, 51.9% of the respondents reported abdominal pain in the last 3 months, and 11.0% belonged to the group with frequent meal-related abdominal pain, which included more females and younger subjects. DGBI diagnoses were more common in subjects with frequent meal-related abdominal pain, and the frequency of several GI symptoms was associated with having more frequent abdominal pain.

### A vagus nerve dominant tetra-synaptic ascending pathway for gastric pain processing [^116xFdM3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Vagal and spinal afferents are the two major primary afferents that convey sensory information of different natures from the upper gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system. It has been commonly assumed that vagal afferents convey predominantly physiological information, while spinal afferents process nociception. Existing electrophysiological evidence reveals that vagal afferents respond to gastric distension (GD) in the noxious range (up to 60 mmHg); however, there is no conclusive evidence to show that vagal afferents include nociceptors that initiate pain due to the lack of high-threshold mechanosensitive afferent fibers (putative nociceptors). Despite this, a considerable body of evidence indicates that vagal afferents act as pain modulators.

For example, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy enhances visceromotor responses to colorectal distension, a region beyond the innervation of vagal afferents. Sensitization of vagal afferents causes changes in the amygdala, resulting in suppression of nociceptive signals conveyed by gastric spinal afferents via the descending pain modulatory pathway. In addition, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces different forms of somatic or visceral pain, although some studies report no effect or a dual effect. The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is a principal nucleus that receives afferent projections from the vagus nerve and is responsible for relaying information from various organs within the body. Studies have reported that noxious GD induces significantly more c-Fos expression in the NTS, indicating increased neural activity in response to pain stimuli.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: Why, how, and when [^112HwQWX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Choosing a central neuromodulator for treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be based on the pharmacological properties of different groups and the predominant symptoms of each patient, as well as considering potential side effects.

- **Central neuromodulator selection**: Selecting an appropriate central neuromodulator involves evaluating its activity on abdominal pain, intestinal motility, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, potential side effects must be considered to tailor treatment effectively to the patient's needs.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^117DVFSv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is frequently encountered in the general population. It may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, and biliary pain. Although national and international guidelines exist for managing the symptoms of IBS, including abdominal pain, recommendations for the general diagnosis and symptomatic management of FACP are lacking.

The lack of guidance on how to diagnose and manage FACP reflects the absence of a standard, accepted definition and limited focused literature on this complaint. The Rome Foundation has developed and updated its own criteria, currently up to Rome IV, to diagnose FGIDs, including those associated with FACP, such as IBS, functional dyspepsia, biliary pain, postprandial distress syndrome, epigastric pain syndrome, and narcotic bowel syndrome (also referred to as opioid-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia). However, although the Rome criteria are a useful tool for gastroenterologists and researchers, they do not fully capture the presentation of FACP seen in everyday practice. Nor are they practical enough to be used routinely by primary care physicians (PCPs), general practitioners (GPs), pharmacists, or patients, whose primary objective — once structural, organic causation has been ruled out — is symptom alleviation. The present expert guidance attempts to address these issues by providing a consensus definition for FACP and by presenting practical strategies for management.

### Chronic visceral pain: New peripheral mechanistic insights and resulting treatments [^111axdUo]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic visceral pain is one of the most common reasons patients with gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or disorders of brain-gut interaction, seek medical attention. It represents a substantial burden to patients and is associated with anxiety, depression, reductions in quality of life, and impaired social functioning, as well as increased direct and indirect health care costs to society. Unfortunately, diagnosing and treating chronic visceral pain is difficult, partly because our understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic basis is incomplete.

In this review, we highlight recent advances in peripheral pain signaling and specific physiologic and pathophysiologic preclinical mechanisms that result in the sensitization of peripheral pain pathways. We focus on preclinical mechanisms that have been translated into treatment approaches and summarize the evidence base for directing treatment toward these mechanisms of chronic visceral pain derived from clinical trials. The effective management of chronic visceral pain remains of critical importance for the quality of life of sufferers. A deeper understanding of peripheral pain mechanisms is necessary and may provide the basis for novel therapeutic interventions.

### Visceral pain readouts in experimental medicine [^111xoFJH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Visceral pain is studied electrophysiologically at the level of the primary afferent fiber, spinal cord, subcortical, and cortical levels, and through brain imaging, which provides an objective measure of excitation at each level. However, correlating these measures with actual perception of pain in conscious animal models has been problematic, prompting reliance on indirect measures in most preclinical research. The main method is the electromyographic recording of abdominal muscle contractions in response to colorectal distension (CRD), which may reflect reflexes set up at several levels of the above pathway.

Several experimental treatments for visceral pain have failed in clinical trials, possibly due to difficulties in translating preclinical observations on CRD responses in animals to perceptions of spontaneous events in patients. Therefore, more objective outcomes are needed. In this issue of NGM, Hultin et al. demonstrate the feasibility of routine recordings of cortical evoked electrical potentials (CEP) using implanted cranial electrodes in response to graded CRD in rats. The CEP comprised three temporal components with latencies of approximately 20–50 ms, 90–180 ms, and 300 ms, which were reproducible and graded in intensity and latency with distension pressure.

From this basic study, it is evident that colorectal evoked potentials can be recorded reliably in awake rats and may serve as an objective marker for centrally projecting visceral sensory signals in rodents. Future research will need to determine how these responses are affected by drugs under development for the clinical management of visceral pain.

### The influence of voltage-gated sodium channels on human gastrointestinal nociception [^1145ewAs]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a frequent and persistent problem in the most common gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Pain adversely impacts quality of life, incurs significant healthcare expenditures, and remains a challenging issue to manage with few safe therapeutic options currently available. It is imperative that new methods are developed for identifying and treating this symptom. A variety of peripherally active neuroendocrine signaling elements have the capability to influence gastrointestinal pain perception. A large and growing body of evidence suggests that voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play a critical role in the development and modulation of nociceptive signaling associated with the gut. Several VGSC isoforms demonstrate significant promise as potential targets for improved diagnosis and treatment of gut-based disorders associated with hyper- and hyposensitivity to abdominal pain.

- **Purpose**: In this article, we critically review key investigations that have evaluated the potential role that VGSCs play in visceral nociception and discuss recent advances related to this topic. Specifically, we discuss the following: (a) what is known about the structure and basic function of VGSCs, (b) the role that each VGSC plays in gut nociception, particularly as it relates to human physiology, and (c) potential diagnostic and therapeutic uses of VGSCs to manage disorders associated with chronic abdominal pain.

### Putative therapeutic targets in the treatment of visceral hyperalgesia [^115hhanw]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

The management of abdominal pain remains a major challenge for clinicians despite an explosion of knowledge regarding the physiology and pathophysiology of sensory neural circuits. Initial progress was made in the field of somatic pain, which provided broad hypotheses that could be tested in the field of visceral pain. Major advances in our understanding of basic mechanisms underlying visceral pain originated in the urinary tract and have been applied to the gut. However, this increased understanding of enteric sensory physiology has yet to generate new effective treatments for abdominal pain. This review addresses novel insights into peripheral mechanisms underlying visceral hyperalgesia and their applicability to the development of therapeutic approaches for treating chronic abdominal pain.

### Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of local analgesic (lidocaine) and opioid analgesic (sufentanil) on patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^117LWK2G]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Local analgesic lidocaine and central analgesic sufentanil showed negative efficacy in the short-term observation. No adverse events were found in the two groups, indicating that the opioid receptor blocker sufentanil did not worsen the symptoms of patients with CAPS after receiving colonoscopy under general anesthesia in a short-term observation. Peripheral and central analgesic intervention by lidocaine and sufentanil were ineffective, which may indicate the potential dominant role of continuous central mediation and mental therapy in the management of CAPS.

### Appearance of burning abdominal pain during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia in a patient with complex regional pain syndrome: a case report [^114Kjfuo]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The mechanism of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is reported to be related to both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recurrence of CRPS has reportedly been induced by hand surgery in patients with upper limb CRPS. However, there is no documentation of mechanical allodynia and burning abdominal pain induced by Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia in patients with upper limb CRPS.

- **Case**: We report the case of a patient who experienced burning abdominal pain during a Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, 13 years after an episode of venipuncture-induced CRPS of the upper arm. The pain characteristics mirrored those of her previous CRPS episode 13 years earlier. Additionally, mechanical allodynia was confirmed around the incision area post-surgery. Ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block using 20 mL of 0.4% ropivacaine was administered twice, resulting in the disappearance of spontaneous pain and allodynia.

- **Discussion**: The pain relief was probably linked to the blockade of peripheral input by the block, which likely improved her central sensitization.

- **Conclusion**: Our report underscores the necessity of paying attention to neuropathic abdominal pain during Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia in patients with a history of CRPS.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a very common presentation to emergency departments. It is vital that physicians understand and are familiar with the presentations of common diseases causing abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost-effectiveness, it would be beneficial to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra-abdominal pathology, thus encouraging early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of whom do not have appendicitis. Those who lack the classical features of appendicitis and show no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history, physical examination, initial imaging, and laboratory findings helps determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, warranting more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### Targeting epigenetic mechanisms for chronic visceral pain: A valid approach for the development of novel therapeutics [^113rQx3A]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic visceral pain is persistent pain emanating from thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal origin that is poorly localized with regard to the specific organ affected. The prevalence can range up to 25% in the adult population, as chronic visceral pain is a common feature of many visceral disorders, which may or may not be accompanied by distinct structural or histological abnormalities within the visceral organs. Mounting evidence suggests that changes in epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the top-down or bottom-up sensitization of pain pathways and the development of chronic pain. Epigenetic changes can lead to long-term alterations in gene expression profiles of neurons and consequently alter the functionality of peripheral neurons, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and brain neurons. However, epigenetic modifications are dynamic and, thus, detrimental changes may be reversible. Hence, external factors or therapeutic interventions may be capable of modulating the epigenome and restoring normal gene expression for extended periods of time.

The goal of this review is to highlight the latest discoveries made toward understanding the epigenetic mechanisms that are involved in the development or maintenance of chronic visceral pain. Furthermore, this review will provide evidence supporting that targeting these epigenetic mechanisms may represent a novel approach to treat chronic visceral pain.

### Novel nervous system mechanisms in visceral pain [^112RpiEG]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Visceral hypersensitivity is an important factor underlying abdominal pain in functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and can result from aberrant signaling from the gut to the brain or vice versa. Over the last two decades, research has identified several selective, intertwining pathways that underlie IBS-related visceral nociception, including specific receptors on afferent and efferent nerve fibers such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and opioid and cannabinoid receptors.

In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Gil et al. demonstrate that in an animal model with reduced descending inhibitory control, the sympathetic nervous system outflow is enhanced, contributing to visceral and somatic hypersensitivity. They also provide evidence that interfering with the activation of adrenergic receptors on sensory nerves can be an interesting new strategy to treat visceral pain in IBS. This mini-review places these findings in a broader perspective by providing an overview of promising novel mechanisms to alter the nervous control of visceral pain, interfering with afferent or efferent neuronal signaling.

### Abdominal pain and the neurotrophic system in ulcerative colitis [^115VGHXV]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We undertook a study to test the hypothesis that inflammation alters peripheral sensory mechanisms, thereby contributing to chronic abdominal pain in ulcerative colitis (UC).

- **Methods**: Patients with UC and healthy individuals rated abdominal pain using a visual analog scale and completed surveys describing anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score) and gastrointestinal symptoms (Rome III questionnaire). Patient age, sex, and severity of inflammation were determined. Rectal biopsies were processed using immunohistochemical techniques to assess nerve fiber density and real-time PCR to determine the transcript expression of neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, artemin, neurturin), ion channels (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1), and inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17).

- **Results**: A total of 77 patients with UC (27 female, 50 male) and 21 controls (10 female, 11 male) were enrolled. Patients with UC with pain had significantly higher depression scores than controls and patients with UC without pain (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between any of the inflammatory markers and pain scores. Visual analog scale pain scores significantly correlated with younger age, higher depression scores, increased expression of neurturin, and decreased expression of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 in the mucosa. Mucosal nerve fiber density did not correlate with any measures of inflammation or pain.

### Visceral and somatic sensory function in functional dyspepsia [^112u2hNN]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Visceral hypersensitivity is one of the proposed underlying mechanisms in functional dyspepsia (FD). It is not clear whether visceral hypersensitivity in FD is a manifestation of central sensitization also encompassing somatic sensitization. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) pathways are involved in gastric mechanosensory physiology, and the TRPV1 receptor agonist, capsaicin, has been used as a chemical stimulant.

In this double-blind, randomized study, we evaluated both visceral and somatic sensory function in 34 FD patients and 42 healthy controls using quantitative sensory testing. Visceral pain sensitivity was assessed using a validated gastric pain model with oral capsaicin capsule titration, and somatic pain sensitivity was determined by foot heat and hand electric stimulation.

- **Key results**: The median capsaicin dose required to attain moderate pain was 0.5 mg in FD and 1 mg in controls (P = 0.03). At these doses, mean pain intensities on a 0–100 visual analog scale were greater for FD than controls [56.9 (95% confidence intervals, 52.2–61.5) vs. 45.1 (41.6–48.6), respectively] (P = 0.005). Overall, mean somatic sensory and pain thresholds were similar in FD and control groups, but in a subgroup of FD, pain hypersensitivity was seen on the hand and foot at different stimulation thresholds.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: A majority of patients with FD have visceral chemo-hypersensitivity involving TRPV1 pathways. A substantial subgroup also has somatic hypersensitivity as evidence of central sensitization.

### Gastrointestinal pain [^114UY3kK]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) pain, a form of visceral pain, is common in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and pancreatitis. Identifying the cause of GI pain frequently represents a diagnostic challenge, as the clinical presentation is often blurred by concomitant autonomic and somatic symptoms. GI pain can be nociceptive, neuropathic, and associated with cancer; however, multiple aetiologies often coexist in an individual patient.

- **Mechanisms of GI pain**: They are complex and include both peripheral and central sensitization, along with the involvement of the autonomic nervous system, which plays a role in generating the symptoms that frequently accompany pain.

- **Treatment of GI pain**: This depends on the precise type of pain and the primary disorder in the patient. It can include pharmacological therapy, cognitive behavioral therapies, invasive surgical procedures, endoscopic procedures, and lifestyle alterations. Owing to major differences between organ involvement, disease mechanisms, and individual factors, treatment always needs to be personalized. Some data suggest that phenotyping and subsequent individual management of GI pain might be options in the future.

### Studies of the symptom abdominal pain — a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MiJLT]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning in primary care patients with abdominal pain is a complex challenge for GPs. To ensure evidence-based decision-making for this symptom, GPs need setting-specific knowledge about the prevalence, potential risks for diseases, and the chance of recovery or risk of undesirable courses of disease.

- **Aim**: We conducted a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies on prevalence, aetiology, or prognosis of abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: We included all studies evaluating the symptom 'abdominal pain' as a reason for consultation in primary care. We included all types of study designs except for qualitative studies. Studies focused solely on children or settings other than primary care were also excluded.

- **Results**: We identified 14 studies. The mean consultation prevalence is 2.8% for abdominal pain. In about one-third of patients, the underlying cause of abdominal pain cannot be specified. The most common aetiologies are gastroenteritis (7.2–18.7%), irritable bowel disease (2.6–13.2%), urological cause (5.3%), and gastritis (5.2%). About 1 in 10 abdominal pain patients suffers from an acute disease like appendicitis (1.9%), diverticulitis (3.0%), biliary/pancreatic (4.0%), or neoplastic (1.0%) diseases needing immediate therapy.

- **Conclusion**: There is a high prevalence of patients consulting GPs for abdominal pain. The review identified a comparably high rate of acute underlying diseases in need of further investigation or therapy. At the same time, the underlying cause of the complaints often remains unexplained. Further symptom-evaluating studies are necessary.

### Association of pain location with computed tomography abnormalities in emergency department patients with abdominal pain [^112FZXaV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, the usage of computed tomography (CT) imaging has risen dramatically in emergency department (ED) patients with abdominal pain. Recognizing the potential disadvantages of the overuse of CT imaging, efforts are being made to reduce imaging.

- **Objective**: We determined the operating characteristics for the location of abdominal pain for the entities of acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, and intestinal obstruction. We hypothesized that patients with pain localized to the upper abdomen would be less likely to have CT abnormalities than those with lower abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective, observational registry of ED patients with abdominal pain, conducted in an academic, suburban ED with an annual census of 110,000. Presence of clinically significant CT abnormalities (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction) was recorded along with clinical variables including laboratory values, vital signs, reported location of pain, location of tenderness on examination, and physician pretest probability.

- **Results**: A convenience sample of 1154 patients was enrolled. Of all patients, 273 cases (24%) had abnormal CT results, including appendicitis (n = 95), diverticulitis (n = 133), and bowel obstruction (n = 49). Right upper quadrant pain was negatively associated with abnormal CT (p = 0.02). Clinician gestalt was highly specific but lacked sensitivity for the diagnosis of appendicitis, diverticulitis, and obstruction. Twenty-four percent of patients diagnosed with appendicitis had no right lower quadrant pain or tenderness, and 7% of patients…

### Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of local analgesic (lidocaine) and opioid analgesic (sufentanil) on patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^1155KKVz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS) is characterized by abdominal pain that is often severe and persists for more than six months. CAPS can impair function across several life domains and is considered less common than other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), with prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 2.1%. Females are 1.5 to 2 times more susceptible to CAPS than males, with the peak age of occurrence in the fourth decade of life.

CAPS is a complex, heterogeneous condition resulting from physical stimuli as well as cognitive and emotional factors. Lessons from other FGIDs suggest that disorders of gut–brain interaction, peripheral stimuli, and structural changes in responsible brain functional regions are related to CAPS. However, unlike irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), intestinal features are largely disconnected in CAPS, with cognitive and emotional features playing a more dominant role in the pain experience. Given the severity and chronicity of pain symptoms in patients with CAPS, structural changes in the relevant functional regions of the brain are more probable. Psychological factors may amplify the experience of pain, providing a rationale for using psychological interventions in the management of CAPS.

Presently, related clinical trials are limited, possibly due to the low incidence of CAPS, uncertain efficacy of treatments, and unclear mechanisms of CAPS. This inadequacy hampers the explanation of CAPS by structural or psychological factors.

Previous studies have found that 300 mg of intrarectal lidocaine jelly could improve abdominal pain symptoms…

### Targeting the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome [^111m5yah]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The management of visceral pain in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction, notably irritable bowel syndrome, presents a considerable clinical challenge, with few available treatment options. Patients are increasingly using cannabis and cannabinoids to control abdominal pain. Cannabis acts on receptors of the endocannabinoid system, an endogenous system of lipid mediators that regulates gastrointestinal function and pain processing pathways in health and disease. The endocannabinoid system represents a logical molecular therapeutic target for the treatment of pain in irritable bowel syndrome.

- **Physiological and pathophysiological functions**: We review the physiological and pathophysiological functions of the endocannabinoid system with a focus on the peripheral and central regulation of gastrointestinal function and visceral nociception.

- **Cannabinoids in pain management**: We address the use of cannabinoids in pain management, comparing them to other treatment modalities, including opioids and neuromodulators.

- **Emerging therapeutic candidates**: Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic candidates targeting the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of pain in irritable bowel syndrome.

### What activates visceral afferents [^114J9PV8]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Vagal and spinal afferents represent the information superhighways that convey sensory information from the gut to the central nervous system. These afferents are sensitive to both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Vagal afferents terminate in the muscle layers and in the mucosa. Muscle afferents are activated at physiological levels of distension and during peristalsis, whereas spinal afferents encode supraphysiological levels of intestinal pressure. Vagal and spinal afferents also express a wide range of membrane receptors to a variety of chemical mediators generated from both within and outside the gut wall.

Some of these receptors are part of a modality-specific transduction pathway involved in sensory signalling from the gut lumen to vagal afferent endings in the mucosa. Others, which are activated by substances derived from multiple cellular sources during ischemia, injury, or inflammation, act in a synergistic way to cause acute or chronic sensitization of the afferent nerves to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie hypersensitivity may have implications for the pharmaceutical approach to the treatment of functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions, from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point for further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g. constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g. anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis).

The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease that may cause abdominal pain, and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Differences in regional homogeneity between patients with Crohn's disease with and without abdominal pain revealed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging [^1119t8s6]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Abnormal pain processing in the central nervous system may be related to abdominal pain in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in resting-state brain activity in patients with CD in remission and its relationship with the presence of abdominal pain. Twenty-five patients with CD and with abdominal pain, 25 patients with CD and without abdominal pain, and 32 healthy subjects were scanned using a 3.0-T functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to assess resting-state brain activity. Daily pain scores were collected one week before functional magnetic resonance imaging.

We found that patients with abdominal pain exhibited lower ReHo values in the insula, middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and supplementary motor area, and higher ReHo values in the temporal pole. In contrast, patients without abdominal pain exhibited lower ReHo values in the hippocampal/parahippocampal cortex and higher ReHo values in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (all P < 0.05, corrected). The ReHo values of the insula and MCC were significantly negatively correlated with daily pain scores for patients with abdominal pain (r = -0.53, P = 0.008 and r = -0.61, P = 0.002, respectively).

These findings suggest that resting-state brain activities are different between remissive patients with CD with and without abdominal pain, and that abnormal activities in the insula and MCC are closely related to the severity of abdominal pain.

### Abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome: The cause of localized abdominal pain in a young pregnant woman [^113iZdq9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the broad differential diagnosis in any patient presenting with symptoms involving the chest or abdomen, a small number of conditions overshadow the rest by their probability. Chest and abdominal wall pain continue to constitute a common and expensive overlooked source of unknown cause pain. In particular, cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is commonly encountered but not easily diagnosed unless its specific symptoms are sought, and a precise physical examination is undertaken.

- **Case report**: A primigravida woman with unbearable abdominal pain was repeatedly referred, seeking a solution for her suffering. Numerous laboratory and imaging studies were employed to elucidate the cause of her condition. After numerous visits and unnecessary delays, the diagnosis was finally made by a physician fully versed in the field of torso wall pain. The focused physical examination disclosed abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome as the diagnosis, and anesthetic infiltration led to immediate alleviation of her pain.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Cutaneous nerve entrapment is a common cause of abdominal pain diagnosed through thorough history and physical examination alone. Knowledge dissemination of the various torso wall syndromes is imperative for prompt delivery of suitable care. All emergency physicians should be fully aware of this entity because the diagnosis is based solely on physical examination, and immediate relief can be provided within the framework of the first visit. Wider recognition of this syndrome will promote better patient outcomes.

### Stress and visceral pain: Focusing on irritable bowel syndrome [^1138N53w]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Recent advances in brain science have shown that the brain function encoding emotion depends on interoceptive signals such as visceral pain. Visceral pain arose early in our evolutionary history.

- **Bottom-up processing**: Gut-to-brain signaling and top-down autonomic/neuroendocrine mechanisms in brain-to-gut signaling constitute a circuit. Brain imaging techniques have enabled us to depict the visceral pain pathway as well as the related emotional circuit.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort associated with bowel dysfunction. It is also thought to be a disorder of the brain-gut link associated with an exaggerated response to stress. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a major mediator of the stress response in the brain-gut axis, is an obvious candidate in the pathophysiology of IBS. Administration of CRH has been shown to aggravate the visceral sensorimotor response in IBS patients, while the administration of peptidergic CRH antagonists seems to alleviate IBS pathophysiology.

Serotonin (5-HT) is another likely candidate associated with brain-gut function in IBS. 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT4 agonists, and antidepressants were demonstrated to regulate 5-HT neurotransmission in IBS patients.

- **Autonomic nervous system function**: The neuroimmune axis and the brain-gut-microbiota axis show specific profiles in IBS patients. Further studies on stress and visceral pain neuropathways in IBS patients are warranted.

### A paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus input to ventral of lateral septal nucleus controls chronic visceral pain [^113HvYZP]. Pain (2023). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic visceral pain with complex etiology and difficult treatment. Accumulated evidence has confirmed that the sensitization of the central nervous system plays an important role in the development of visceral pain, whereas the exact mechanisms of action of the neural pathways remain largely unknown.

In this study, a distinct neural circuit was identified from the paraventricular hypothalamic (PVH) to the ventral of lateral septal (LSV) region. This circuit was responsible for regulating visceral pain. The data indicated that the PVH CaMKIIα-positive neurons' inputs to the LSV CaMKIIα-positive neurons were only activated by colorectal distention rather than somatic stimulations. The PVH-LSV CaMKIIα+ projection pathway was further confirmed by experiments containing a viral tracer.

Optogenetic inhibition of PVH CaMKIIα+ inputs to LSV CaMKIIα-positive neurons suppressed visceral pain, whereas selective activation of the PVH-LSV CaMKIIα+ projection evoked visceral pain. These findings suggest the critical role of the PVH-LSV CaMKIIα+ circuit in regulating visceral pain.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain.

Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^112YGc9M]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The key strength of our study is the use of a globally reaching, uniformly collected dataset. General population sampling was done with different quotas, allowing demographically balanced and population-representative samples with regard to age, gender, and education level. The initial epidemiology questionnaire study was collaboratively designed by a team of international DGBI experts, generating a very rich set of information focusing on the evaluation of all DGBI diagnoses using the latest diagnostic Rome IV criteria. All questionnaires were translated using a uniform translation method with cultural adaptations and linguistic validations. Quality checks were included in the online survey and subsequent data processing to ensure that inconsistent and non-attentive responders could be eliminated from the analyses.

Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. The first limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the data. It has been demonstrated that the severity of symptoms that patients with DGBI experience varies over time and that they can potentially shift between DGBI diagnoses depending on their symptom profile. In addition, despite the fact that we identified and excluded subjects with common doctor-diagnosed organic GI diseases (such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer anywhere in the GI tract, peptic ulcer, and diverticulitis) from DGBI diagnoses, we could potentially have missed less common organic GI conditions that could explain the symptom profile. Furthermore, since the survey was conducted anonymously, we could not invite subjec…

### Basic and clinical aspects of visceral sensation: Transmission in the CNS [^115BEZES]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2005). Low credibility.

Pain and discomfort are the leading causes of consultative visits to gastroenterologists. Acute pain should be considered a symptom of an underlying disease, thereby serving a physiologically important function. However, many patients experience chronic pain in the absence of potentially harmful stimuli or disorders, turning pain into the primary problem rather than a symptom. Vagal and spinal afferents both contribute to the sensory component of the gut-brain axis. Evidence suggests that they convey different elements of the complex sensory experience. Spinal afferents play a key role in the discriminatory dimension, while vagal input primarily affects the strong emotional and autonomic reactions to noxious visceral stimuli. Drugs, surgical, and non-pharmacological treatments can target these pathways and provide therapeutic options for patients with chronic visceral pain syndromes.

### Antispasmodics for chronic abdominal pain: Analysis of North American treatment options [^115pQeHB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom prompting an office-based outpatient or emergency department visit in the United States. Functional GI disorders, more formally described as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS), are the underlying cause of abdominal pain in many patients.

IBS is a chronic disorder characterized by recurring abdominal pain associated with disordered bowel habits. According to Rome IV criteria, the diagnosis of IBS requires patients to have abdominal pain on ≥ 1 day per week in the previous 3 months. FD is also a pain-predominant disorder. Rome IV diagnostic criteria for FD require patients to present with bothersome epigastric pain (≥ 1 day per week), epigastric burning (≥ 1 day per week), postprandial fullness (≥ 3 days per week), or early satiation (≥ 3 days per week) during the previous 3 months. Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome is characterized by persistent abdominal pain that interferes with daily activities; it is not associated with altered bowel habits.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Algorithms to aid the recognition and management of FACP**: A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of FACP by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP, pain with cramping characteristics, which is generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction.

	- To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is the exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease. It also involves considering the results of appropriate investigations, conducted as indicated by such signals.

	- The algorithm considers the likelihood of an IBS diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. It also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin.

	- For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation.
