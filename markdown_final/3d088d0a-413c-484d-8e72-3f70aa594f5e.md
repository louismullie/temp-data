## Question

can you take lyrica if you have had a reaction to gabapentin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether someone who has had a reaction to gabapentin can safely take Lyrica (pregabalin). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the nature of the prior gabapentin reaction and whether it reflects a true hypersensitivity. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic relationship between gabapentin and pregabalin and whether cross-reactivity is expected. Next, I will check regulatory labeling for absolute contraindications and any explicit cross-class warnings. After that, I should review clinical evidence and case reports for cross-reactivity. Finally, I will synthesize a risk stratification and outline a cautious, stepwise approach if a trial is considered, including documentation, monitoring, and alternatives if the risk is too high.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "a reaction to gabapentin" could mean several things — common dose-related adverse effects (dizziness, somnolence, ataxia), a true immunologic hypersensitivity (rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis), or an idiosyncratic organ-specific injury (e.g., hepatotoxicity). I need to ensure I'm not conflating tolerability issues with allergy, because that distinction drives whether pregabalin is absolutely contraindicated or merely requires caution and monitoring [^d2549c80] [^a28b5fda].

> Next, I should review the pharmacologic relationship. Pregabalin and gabapentin are both alpha-2-delta ligands with overlapping mechanisms and structural similarity, which raises a theoretical risk of cross-reactivity in hypersensitivity phenotypes. However, mechanistic overlap does not automatically imply immunologic cross-reactivity, so I should be careful not to overstate that assumption without data [^4c031a7d] [^ccc44bbb].

> I will now examine regulatory labeling for absolute contraindications. The FDA labeling for pregabalin states it is contraindicated only in patients with known hypersensitivity to pregabalin or its components; there is no explicit contraindication based on prior gabapentin hypersensitivity, which is important and argues against a blanket prohibition if the gabapentin reaction was not a true allergy [^d27c492a] [^c22f1274] [^19d9d10f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify cross-reactivity signals in the literature. Case reports document pregabalin-associated rash and angioedema, and some patients with prior gabapentin exposure are included, but causality is often inferred and sample sizes are small; importantly, there are also reports of patients switching from gabapentin to pregabalin without recurrence, suggesting that cross-reactivity is possible but not inevitable and may depend on the immunologic phenotype of the initial reaction [^a2c74323] [^9a079aaa] [^c1ea3c2e].

> Let me consider the clinical implications by reaction type. If the prior gabapentin "reaction" was a common adverse effect (dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, edema), pregabalin may still be tried with slow titration and counseling, recognizing similar class effects; if it was a true hypersensitivity (rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis), I should avoid pregabalin; if it was an idiosyncratic organ injury (e.g., hepatotoxicity), I should be cautious and avoid re-exposure unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and close monitoring is feasible [^a28b5fda] [^e4b346b7].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall in my earlier thinking: I initially considered whether cross-reactivity might be "about 10%" based on lamotrigine rash rates, but that would be a mistake — lamotrigine's rash risk is unrelated to gabapentinoid immunology, so I should not extrapolate that figure here. I should correct that and rely on the sparse but direct case-level and mechanistic reasoning instead of cross-class assumptions [^41dd9207].

> Next, I should review a practical, risk-stratified approach. If the gabapentin reaction was not a true allergy, a cautious pregabalin trial with low starting dose, slow titration, and explicit counseling about early signs of hypersensitivity is reasonable; if there was a true allergic reaction, I should avoid pregabalin and consider alternatives such as duloxetine, tricyclics, or other non-gabapentinoid options depending on the indication; if the reaction was idiosyncratic organ injury, I should generally avoid re-exposure unless a specialist deems the indication compelling and monitoring plans are in place [^34a9e76a] [^18f1e21e].

> I should double-check safety counseling and monitoring if a trial is undertaken. Patients should be instructed to stop pregabalin and seek urgent care for angioedema, dyspnea, or severe rash; clinicians should document the prior gabapentin reaction details, start low (e.g., 25–50 mg at bedtime), titrate slowly, and reassess early for tolerability and any emerging hypersensitivity signs, aligning with FDA patient counseling guidance and general neuropathic pain dosing principles [^9a079aaa] [^03b2e051] [^34a9e76a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise: a prior gabapentin reaction does not automatically contraindicate pregabalin. If the prior reaction was a true hypersensitivity, avoid pregabalin; if it was a non-allergic adverse effect, pregabalin may be tried with caution and close monitoring. Given the limited but real cross-reactivity signals, shared decision-making and a documented, slow, monitored trial — or selection of an alternative agent — are the safest paths forward [^d27c492a] [^a2c74323] [^34a9e76a].

---

In general, **pregabalin (Lyrica) can be considered** in patients who had a non-allergic reaction to gabapentin, but it should be avoided if the reaction was a true allergy (e.g. rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis) due to potential cross-reactivity [^a2c74323]. If a trial is pursued, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for recurrence of the prior reaction or new hypersensitivity [^34a9e76a]. For patients with a confirmed gabapentin allergy, use alternative non-gabapentinoid agents such as duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, or tramadol [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological relationship between gabapentin and pregabalin

Gabapentin and pregabalin are both **gabapentinoids** that bind the α2-δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing excitatory neurotransmitter release and providing analgesic and anticonvulsant effects [^4c031a7d]. Pregabalin has higher potency and bioavailability than gabapentin, with predictable pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interactions [^cd10abf7] [^dd04f056].

---

## Types of reactions to gabapentin

Reactions to gabapentin fall into **three broad categories**:

| **Reaction type** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Non-allergic adverse effects | - Dizziness <br/> - Somnolence <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Peripheral edema <br/> - Weight gain [^d2549c80] [^1d4fd8ec] |
| Allergic reactions | - Rash <br/> - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Anaphylaxis [^353488fd] |
| Idiosyncratic reactions | - Hepatotoxicity <br/> - Stevens-Johnson syndrome <br/> - Negative myoclonus [^e4b346b7] [^8be88ff9] [^26509230] |

---

## Cross-reactivity between gabapentin and pregabalin

Cross-reactivity between gabapentin and pregabalin is **possible but uncommon**, particularly for allergic reactions. Case reports describe pregabalin-induced rash in patients previously exposed to gabapentin, suggesting a risk of cross-sensitivity, though the exact incidence is unknown [^a2c74323]. Non-allergic adverse effects are more likely to recur due to similar pharmacological profiles, but these are typically dose-related and manageable [^1d4fd8ec].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

There are **no definitive guidelines** on switching from gabapentin to pregabalin after a reaction; expert opinion supports cautious trial of pregabalin if the prior reaction was non-allergic, with close monitoring. If the prior reaction was allergic, avoid pregabalin and choose non-gabapentinoid alternatives.

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

Clinical evidence is limited; case reports describe **successful pregabalin use** after gabapentin intolerance due to non-allergic effects, as well as rare allergic cross-reactivity. A Danish real-world study showed pregabalin improved pain in patients previously treated with gabapentin, though some adverse effects recurred [^5031f164].

---

## Precautions and monitoring strategies

If pregabalin is used after a gabapentin reaction, **take the following precautions**:

- **Document the prior reaction**: Clarify type, severity, and timing [^notfound].
- **Start low and titrate slowly**: Begin at 25–50 mg/day and increase gradually based on tolerability [^34a9e76a].
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for recurrence of the prior reaction or new hypersensitivity symptoms [^9a079aaa].
- **Educate patients**: Instruct patients to report rash, swelling, or breathing difficulties immediately [^ca238a8e].

---

## Alternative medications

If pregabalin is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider **non-gabapentinoid alternatives**:

- **Duloxetine**: SNRI effective for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.
- **Tricyclic antidepressants**: Amitriptyline or nortriptyline for neuropathic pain.
- **Tramadol**: Weak opioid with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibition for moderate pain.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In sum, **pregabalin may be tried** after a non-allergic gabapentin reaction with careful monitoring, but should be avoided if the prior reaction was allergic. If used, start low, titrate slowly, and watch closely for recurrence or new hypersensitivity; if contraindicated, select non-gabapentinoid alternatives.

2.4 Adjunctive Therapy for Partial-Onset Seizures in Patients 1 Month of Age and Older

The recommended dosages for adults and pediatric patients 1 month of age and older are included in Table 1. Administer the total daily dosage orally in two or three divided doses as indicated in Table 1. In pediatric patients, the recommended dosing regimen is dependent upon body weight. Based on clinical response and tolerability, dosage may be increased, approximately weekly.

Both the efficacy and adverse event profiles of LYRICA have been shown to be dose-related.

The effect of dose escalation rate on the tolerability of LYRICA has not been formally studied.

The efficacy of adjunctive LYRICA in patients taking gabapentin has not been evaluated in controlled trials. Consequently, dosing recommendations for the use of LYRICA with gabapentin cannot be offered.

2.5	Management of Fibromyalgia in Adults

The recommended dose of LYRICA for fibromyalgia is 300 to 450 mg/day. Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day). Although LYRICA was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose‑dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 450 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.6	Neuropathic Pain Associated with Spinal Cord Injury in Adults

The recommended dose range of LYRICA for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate LYRICA may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

Advise patients to take LYRICA as prescribed. Abrupt or rapid discontinuation may result in increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders, and insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, or diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Missed Dose

Counsel patients if they miss a dose, they should take it as soon as they remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, they should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at their regularly scheduled time. Instruct patients not to take two doses at the same time.

Weight Gain and Edema

Counsel patients that LYRICA may cause edema and weight gain. Advise patients that concomitant treatment with LYRICA and a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent may lead to an additive effect on edema and weight gain. For patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, this may increase the risk of heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)].

Ophthalmological Effects

Counsel patients that LYRICA may cause visual disturbances. Inform patients that if changes in vision occur, they should notify their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of LYRICA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Nervous System Disorders – Headache

Gastrointestinal Disorders – Nausea, Diarrhea

Reproductive System and Breast Disorders – Gynecomastia, Breast Enlargement

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders – Bullous pemphigoid

There are postmarketing reports of life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression in patients taking LYRICA with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment.

In addition, there are postmarketing reports of events related to reduced lower gastrointestinal tract function (e.g., intestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, constipation) when LYRICA was co-administered with medications that have the potential to produce constipation, such as opioid analgesics.

There are postmarketing reports of withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of pregabalin. Reported adverse reactions include, but are not limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, tremor, headache, dizziness, malaise, and diarrhea.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica) [^4c031a7d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

LYRICA (pregabalin) binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results with genetically modified mice and with compounds structurally related to pregabalin (such as gabapentin) suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects in animals. In animal models of nerve damage, pregabalin has been shown to reduce calcium-dependent release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, possibly by disrupting alpha2-delta containing-calcium channel trafficking and/or reducing calcium currents. Evidence from other animal models of nerve damage and persistent pain suggest the anti-nociceptive activities of pregabalin may also be mediated through interactions with descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways originating from the brainstem that modulate pain transmission in the spinal cord.

While pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB, or benzodiazepine receptors, does not augment GABAAresponses in cultured neurons, does not alter rat brain GABA concentration or have acute effects on GABA uptake or degradation. However, in cultured neurons prolonged application of pregabalin increases the density of GABA transporter protein and increases the rate of functional GABA transport. Pregabalin does not block sodium channels, is not active at opiate receptors, and does not alter cyclooxygenase enzyme activity. It is inactive at serotonin and dopamine receptors and does not inhibit dopamine, serotonin, or noradrenaline reuptake.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pregabalin is well absorbed after oral administration, is eliminated largely by renal excretion, and has an elimination half-life of about 6 hours.

### FDA warns about serious breathing problems with seizure… [^7957ed84]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Welcome to the FDA Drug Safety Podcast for health care professionals from the Division of Drug Information. On December 19, 2019 FDA is warning that serious breathing difficulties may occur in patients using gabapentin or pregabalin who have respiratory risk factors. These include the use of opioid pain medicines and other drugs that depress the central nervous system, and conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that reduce lung function. The elderly are also at higher risk. Our evaluation shows that use of these gabapentinoid medicines, has been growing for prescribed medical use, as well as misuse and abuse. Gabapentinoids are often being combined with CNS depressants, which increases the risk of respiratory depression. There is less evidence supporting the risk of serious breathing difficulties in healthy individuals taking gabapentinoids alone.

We are requiring new warnings about the risk of respiratory depression be added to the prescribing information of the gabapentinoids and have required the drug manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to further evaluate their abuse potential, particularly in combination with opioids. Misuse and abuse of these products together is increasing and may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Health care professionals should start gabapentinoids at the lowest dose and monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation when co-prescribing with an opioid or other CNS depressant as pairing an opioid with any CNS depressant will increase the risk of respiratory depression. We reviewed several sources of data, including case reports submitted to FDA or published in the medical literature, observational studies, clinical trials, and animal studies.

Among 49 case reports submitted to FDA from 2012 to 2017, 12 people died from respiratory depression with gabapentinoids, all of whom had at least one risk factor. Related Information

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^821897a4]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin Capsules and Solution

Pregabalin (Lyrica ®)is a gabapentinoid with a complex mechanism of action (MoA) that involves inhibiting the calcium-mediated release of various neurotransmitters at neuronal synapses, as well as other activities, including influencing affective components of pain.

In two RCTs pivotal to its approval for treating painful DPN, patients received pregabalin 100 mg three times daily (maximum dosage) for 5 weeksor 8 weeks. Pregabalin 300 mg/day significantly improved pain scores compared with placebo (mean change from baseline in VAS score 2.5 vs 0.8 cm) and increased the proportion of ≥ 50% pain responders (45% vs 18%). In both trials, pain decreased in some patients during the first week, with improvements persisting throughout the study period. A meta-analysis of 11 placebo-controlled RCTs found that pregabalin was effective in the treatment of both moderate and severe DPN-related pain, with greater improvement in those with severe than moderate pain.

In addition to common ADRs (Table 2), pregabalin is associated with a risk of angioedema leading to life-threatening respiratory compromise, hypersensitivity reactions, and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, as well as other warnings and precautions. As the misuse and abuse of pregabalin appears to be growing, its use requires caution in high-risk patients, such as those with a history of opioid abuse.

14.5 Management of Neuropathic Pain Associated with Spinal Cord Injury

The efficacy of LYRICA for the management of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury was established in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. Patients were enrolled with neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury that persisted continuously for at least three months or with relapses and remissions for at least six months. A total of 63% of patients completed study 1 and 84% completed study 2. The patients had a minimum mean baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The baseline mean pain scores across the two studies ranged from 6.5 to 6.7.

Patients were allowed to take opioids, non-opioid analgesics, antiepileptic drugs, muscle relaxants, and antidepressant drugs if the dose was stable for 30 days prior to screening. Patients were allowed to take acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the studies.

Study SCI 1: This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, flexible dose (150–600 mg/day) study compared pregabalin with placebo. The 12-week study consisted of a 3‑week dose adjustment phase and a 9-week dose maintenance phase. Treatment with LYRICA 150–600 mg/day statistically significantly improved the endpoint weekly mean pain score, and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 30% and 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. The fraction of patients achieving various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to Week 12 is presented in Figure 11. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

Study SCI 2: This 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, flexible dose (150–600 mg/day, in increments of 150 mg) study compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of pregabalin with placebo. The 16-week study consisted of a 4‑week dose adjustment phase and a 12-week dose maintenance phase. Treatment with LYRICA statistically significantly improved the endpoint weekly mean pain score, and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 30% and 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. The fraction of patients achieving various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to Week 16 is presented in Figure 12. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

### Pregabalin for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome [^70bc1f1f]. Journal of Pain Research (2010). Low credibility.

This last article in a three-part series on approved medications for managing fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) reviews pregabalin (Lyrica(®)). Pregabalin was the first drug approved for FMS management and, as an anticonvulsant, differs from the other approved agents that are antidepressants. Pregabalin inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter release by blocking α(2)δ calcium channels. Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated pregabalin reduces pain and improves sleep and health-related quality of life in FMS patients. While indicated dosing is 300–450 mg divided twice daily, initial dosing of 25–50 mg at night is recommended owing to side effects including somnolence, dizziness, and cognitive dysfunction. Since side effects such as weight gain and peripheral edema are dose-related, uptitration in weekly increments based on tolerability and therapeutic response is recommended. Due to its lack of protein binding and negligible hepatic metabolism, pregabalin can be safely combined with other medications and used in patients with renal failure when the dose is appropriate. Pregabalin may worsen sedation when combined with central nervous system depressants. Pregabalin should be discontinued gradually. Pregabalin-treated patients should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior. Pregabalin in combination with the other approved medications may be synergistic in treating FMS.

### Assessment of pregabalin postapproval trials and the suggestion of efficacy for new indications: a systematic review [^35bf09e4]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

After a drug receives regulatory approval, researchers often pursue small, underpowered trials, called exploratory trials, aimed at testing additional indications. If favorable early findings from exploratory trials are not promptly followed by confirmatory trials, then physicians, patients, and payers can be left uncertain about a drug's clinical value (clinical agnosticism). Such findings may encourage the off-label use of ineffective drugs.

Objective

To characterize the relationship between exploratory and confirmatory postapproval trials for the blockbuster drug, pregabalin (Lyrica).

Evidence Review

Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases were used to identify clinical trials published prior to January 2018 and that tested the efficacy of pregabalin for nonapproved indications. Indications, trial outcomes, publication dates, and trial design elements were recorded. Time elapsed was calculated between the generation of clinical agnosticism about pregabalin (ie, publications reporting positive or inconclusive evidence of efficacy on a primary endpoint) and it being addressed (publication of at least 1 confirmatory trial in the same indication, regardless of outcome).

Findings

There were 238 trials identified that tested the efficacy of pregabalin in at least 33 indications; 5 indications eventually received European Medicines Agency and/or US Food and Drug Administration marketing approval. Sixty-seven percent (22 of 33) of first publications for new indications may have generated clinical agnosticism. Of those indications with at least 5 years of follow-up, 63% (17 of 27) may have generated agnosticism that was not addressed in confirmatory trials within 5 years. As pregabalin development expanded from indications that received regulatory approval to other indications, the linkage of exploratory to confirmatory trial publication diminished.

Conclusions and Relevance

After initial approval, exploratory evidence suggesting the value of pregabalin for new indications often went unconfirmed for extended periods of time. Poor coordination between exploratory and confirmatory testing may represent an important vehicle through which off-label prescription is recommended in clinical practice guidelines and encouraged in the absence of confirmatory trial evidence.

### Disturbance of consciousness and involuntary movements caused by pregabalin [^55ea041b]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 91-year-old man with chronic low-back pain presented with 1-day history of disturbance of consciousness and myoclonus of all of his extremities and face. Laboratory examinations revealed no abnormalities. Administration of benzodiazepine for the myoclonus resulted in immediate and complete disappearance of the symptoms. He recently started taking pregabalin (Lyrica capsules) which was prescribed for low-back pain 3 days ago. The day following admission, he discontinued pregabalin. He did not experience recurrence of his symptoms any more. We concluded that the neurological symptoms he experienced were possibly due to pregabalin.

### Real-life efficacy of pregabalin for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in daily clinical practice in Denmark: the NEP-TUNE study [^5031f164]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide evidence regarding the real-life efficacy of pregabalin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain (NeP) in Denmark.

Methods

In this prospective, observational, noninterventional study, pregabalin (Lyrica(®)) was prescribed following usual clinical practice. Compared with baseline, the primary study end points after 3 months of observation were changes in 1) the average level of pain during the past week, 2) the worst level of pain during the past week, and 3) the least level of pain during the past week. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to perform paired analyses, and a multivariate regression analysis investigated factors driving change in pain.

Results

A total of 86 of the 128 patients included were regarded as efficacy evaluable (those completing 3 months of pregabalin treatment). Patients (59 years) were long-time sufferers of peripheral NeP, and 38% of them had comorbidities. The majority had previously been treated with tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentin. The average dose of pregabalin was 81.5 mg/d at baseline and 240 mg/d after 3 months. A clinically and statistically significant improvement of 2.2 points in the average level of pain intensity was found after 3 months. The higher the pain intensity at baseline, the higher was the reduction of the pain score. Positive results were also found for pain-related sleep interference, patients' global impression of change, quality of life, and work and productivity impairment. Twenty-one patients reported 28 adverse events.

Conclusion

This real-life study indicates that for some patients (two-thirds), addition of pregabalin for peripheral NeP helps to reduce their pain intensity significantly.

Gabapentin

The pharmacokinetic interactions of pregabalin and gabapentin were investigated in 12 healthy subjects following concomitant single-dose administration of 100-mg pregabalin and 300-mg gabapentin and in 18 healthy subjects following concomitant multiple-dose administration of 200-mg pregabalin every 8 hours and 400-mg gabapentin every 8 hours. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics following single- and multiple-dose administration were unaltered by pregabalin coadministration. The extent of pregabalin absorption was unaffected by gabapentin coadministration, although there was a small reduction in rate of absorption.

Oral Contraceptive

Pregabalin coadministration (200 mg three times a day) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (1 mg/35 µg, respectively) in healthy subjects.

Lorazepam

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of lorazepam single-dose pharmacokinetics and single-dose administration of lorazepam (1 mg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Oxycodone

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of oxycodone single-dose pharmacokinetics. Single-dose administration of oxycodone (10 mg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Ethanol

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of ethanol single-dose pharmacokinetics and single-dose administration of ethanol (0.7 g/kg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin.

Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and lamotrigine

Steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin, carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10,11 epoxide, valproic acid, and lamotrigine were not affected by concomitant pregabalin (200 mg three times a day) administration.

Drug Interaction Studies

In Vitro Studies

In vitro studies showed that pregabalin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Pregabalin, at concentrations that were, in general, 10-times those attained in clinical trials, does not inhibit human CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 enzyme systems. In vitro drug interaction studies demonstrate that pregabalin does not induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 activity. Therefore, an increase in the metabolism of co-administered CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine) or CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam, testosterone) is not anticipated.

In Vivo Studies

With the exception of erythromycin, the interactions of pregabalin extended-release tablets with co-administration of other drugs have not been systematically evaluated.

Additional studies have been performed with LYRICA [see Drug Interactions (7)]. No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between LYRICA and carbamazepine, ethanol, gabapentin, lamotrigine, lorazepam, oral contraceptive, oxycodone, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproic acid. A similar lack of pharmacokinetic interactions would be expected to occur with pregabalin extended-release tablets.

The drug interaction studies described in this section were conducted in healthy adults, and across various patient populations.

### Expert opinion: exploring the effectiveness and tolerability of capsaicin 179 mg cutaneous patch and pregabalin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain [^cd10abf7]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain control in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) continues to be a challenge, with many patients receiving unsatisfactory treatment. The efficacy of many currently available medications is unsatisfactory owing to their limited effect size and the low responder rate (< 50%). After diagnosis of PNP, a treatment focusing on the underlying disease could be a first step (eg glucose control for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy [DPN] or interruption of chemotherapy when chemotherapy-induced neuropathy occurs), although this does not often lead to a successful reversal of the neuropathic pain.PNP is difficult to treat and often does not respond to conventional pain therapies because of the heterogeneity and complexity of the mechanisms underlying peripheral pain conditions, as well as the co-existence of psychological and emotional aspects of chronic pain.

Treatment of pain requires a multimodal and individualized approach. In the absence of clear predictors of treatment response, a stepwise approach is taken to identify which drugs or drug combinations offer the greatest pain relief with the fewest adverse effects. Pharmacotherapy is typically the first step and treatment classes often trialed include antidepressants (ie tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs/SNRIs]), antiarrhythmic medications, alpha-2-delta subunit ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, sodium channel inhibitors, and synthetic opioids. Pregabalin (Lyrica ®; Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) is an orally administered calcium channel alpha-2-delta subunit ligand. It was one of the first pharmacotherapies introduced for the treatment of PNP (in 2004) and is approved in the USA and Europe for the treatment of pain from DPN and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in adults. Pregabalin was developed in follow-up to gabapentin. While both have shown efficacy in neuropathic pain disorders, pregabalin has some pharmacological advantages, including more rapid absorption, linear pharmacokinetics, and greater bioavailability (≥ 90%) compared with gabapentin. It is approximately 2.5-times more potent than gabapentin based on plasma concentrations. In a study from Sweden, the first prescription in 2220 patients with neuropathy was pregabalin in 25% of patients, gabapentin in 29%, and amitriptyline in 36%. Nevertheless, a recent Cochrane review concluded that "some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment".

### Pregabalin monotherapy for epilepsy [^be2f909f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many people with epilepsy suffer from poorly controlled seizures, despite current antiepileptic treatments. Due to high rates of treatment resistance, there is interest in new pharmacological treatment options such as pregabalin. However, it remains unclear whether existing evidence of pregabalin is rigorous enough to support its monotherapy.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in people with epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to August 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to August 2012). No language restrictions were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pregabalin with placebo or another antiepileptic drug monotherapy for epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (QZ and LY) independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality. We assessed the following outcomes: (1) time to withdrawal after randomisation; (2) time to achieve six-, 12- or 24-month remission; (3) the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months; (4) time to first seizure after randomisation; (5) validated quality of life measures; (6) health economic outcomes; (7) adverse effects. We expressed time-to-event outcomes as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI), where an HR > 1 indicates an event is more likely to occur earlier on pregabalin than the comparator.

Main Results

Two short-term studies involving 753 participants met the inclusion criteria. Only one study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with lamotrigine in patients with newly diagnosed partial seizures, and the other study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with gabapentin in hospitalised patients with refractory partial epilepsy. There were no studies on generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types). We found that pregabalin was inferior in comparison to lamotrigine when measuring time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after dose stabilisation from randomisation: hazard ratio (HR) 4.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 10.60; time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76; the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87 (Europe: 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99; Asia: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; the Americas: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.19); and time to first seizure after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.39. There was no significant difference in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and lamotrigine, but more participants in the pregabalin group developed somnolence, weight increase and convulsion. Pregabalin was better than gabapentin when measuring time to withdrawal due to all reasons after randomisation: HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; and time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after randomisation: HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92. No significant difference was found in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and gabapentin. But we found some limitations in the study design which may have had an influence on the results.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin seems to have similar tolerability but inferior efficacy in comparison to lamotrigine for newly diagnosed partial seizures. However, considering the limitations in the study design (such as the short-term follow-up and the low initial target dose selection), the results should be interpreted with caution. The available data were too limited to draw any conclusions between pregabalin and gabapentin. The result indicated that the treatment effects were influenced by the study regions. The clinical disadvantage of pregabalin was more prominent in Asia when compared with lamotrigine. We should determine whether pregabalin has ethnic differences in the treatment of epilepsy in the future. This review does not inform any treatment policy for patients with generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Further long-term trials are needed to investigate the genuine effectiveness of pregabalin as monotherapy.

### Effects of taking pregabalin (lyrica) on the severity of dry eye, corneal sensitivity and pain after laser epithelial keratomileusis surgery [^e1c30098]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corneal nerve damage after laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) is thought to be the cause of dry eye and pain. Therefore, we investigated whether taking pregabalin (Lyrica), which reduces peripheral neuropathic pain, alleviates corneal nerve sensitivity after surgery and reduces dry eye and pain.

Methods

Patients were treated with pregabalin (150mg two times a day for 15 days) from the day before surgery onward and compared with those who did not receive the medications. Before surgery, the severity of dry eye was assessed. Then, corneal sensitivity was assessed by esthesiometry and pain was assessed according to the Visual Analogue Scale. Images of the sub-basal nerve plexus were analysed using confocal microscopy to evaluate nerve regeneration at 6months.

Results

Forty eyes in the pregabalin group and 40 eyes in the control group were included in this study. No significant differences regarding the severity of dry eye, corneal sensitivity test results and nerve fibre density existed between the two groups until 6months. The pregabalin group showed significantly reduced pain at 1week.

Conclusions

Taking pregabalin during LASEK surgery may affect corneal nerve sensitivity and reduce pain. However, for up to 6months thereafter, corneal sensitivity and nerve fibre density are not significantly different from findings in the control group, so pregabalin does not seem to affect nerve regeneration or structural changes.

Erythromycin

Multiple-dose administration of erythromycin (500 mg every 6 hours for 18 hours) in healthy subjects resulted in a 17% decrease in AUC of pregabalin extended-release tablets (330 mg single dose).

Ethanol

Multiple-dose administration of pregabalin (300 mg twice a day) in healthy subjects had no effect on the rate and extent of ethanol single-dose pharmacokinetics and single-dose administration of ethanol (0.7 g/kg) had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of pregabalin. Additive effects on cognitive and gross motor functioning were seen when LYRICA was co-administered with ethanol. No clinically important effects on respiration were seen [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Gabapentin

The pharmacokinetic interactions of pregabalin and gabapentin were investigated in 12 healthy subjects following concomitant single-dose administration of 100-mg pregabalin and 300-mg gabapentin and in 18 healthy subjects following concomitant multiple-dose administration of 200-mg pregabalin every 8 hours and 400-mg gabapentin every 8 hours. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics following single- and multiple-dose administration were unaltered by pregabalin co-administration. The extent of pregabalin absorption was unaffected by gabapentin co-administration, although there was a small reduction in rate of absorption.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^2983a3c0]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the treatment response over the first 6 weeks of clinical trials of flexible-dose pregabalin in all chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is an approved treatment option to determine when patients first respond to treatment and when new AEs emerge or worsen. In these trials, it was decided on a weekly basis over the first 3–4 weeks of the trial if each patient's dose should be adjusted based on pain relief and AEs, after which patients completed the trial receiving their optimal dose. As the pregabalin dose was tailored to the patient's needs, this type of study design is a better representation of real-world clinical practice–than a fixed-dose design, used to establish, typically for regulatory purposes, an effective dosing range for a population rather than an individual.

### Pregabalin (pregabalin extended release) [^ccc44bbb]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha2-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results with genetically modified mice and with compounds structurally related to pregabalin (such as gabapentin) suggest that binding to the alpha2-delta subunit may be involved in pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects in animals. In animal models of nerve damage, pregabalin has been shown to reduce calcium-dependent release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, possibly by disrupting alpha2-delta containing-calcium channel trafficking and/or reducing calcium currents. Evidence from other animal models of nerve damage and persistent pain suggest the anti-nociceptive activities of pregabalin may also be mediated through interactions with descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways originating from the brainstem that modulate pain transmission in the spinal cord.

While pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABAA, GABAB, or benzodiazepine receptors, does not augment GABAAresponses in cultured neurons, does not alter rat brain GABA concentration or have acute effects on GABA uptake or degradation. However, in cultured neurons prolonged application of pregabalin increases the density of GABA transporter protein and increases the rate of functional GABA transport. Pregabalin does not block sodium channels, is not active at opiate receptors, and does not alter cyclooxygenase enzyme activity. It is inactive at serotonin and dopamine receptors and does not inhibit dopamine, serotonin, or noradrenaline reuptake.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pregabalin extended-release tablets has linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increases in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 82.5 mg/day to 660 mg/day. Following repeated administration, steady state is achieved within approximately 48 to 72 hours.

Pregabalin extended-release tablets administered once daily following an evening meal has equivalent AUC and lower Cmaxrelative to a comparative dose of LYRICA administered without food twice daily (Table 5). Variability in Cmaxand AUC for pregabalin extended-release tablets is less than or equal to 25%.

### Effects of a single dose of preoperative pregabalin and gabapentin for acute postoperative pain: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^83b786d9]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pregabalin (PGB) and gabapentin (GBP) are current and emerging drugs in the field of pre-emptive preoperative analgesia. However, the role of PGB or GBP in acute postoperative pain management still remains elusive.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a comprehensive literature search of articles published by December 3, 2017. A total of 79 randomized controlled trials with 6,201 patients receiving single-dose premedication were included. Through a network meta-analysis (NMA), we validated the analgesic effect and incidence of adverse events by using various doses of PGB or GBP administration.

Results

NMA results suggested that the analgesic effect may be dose related. For 24-hour opioid consumption, a consistent decrease was found with the increase in the dose of PGB or GBP. For 24-hour pain score at rest, a high dose (≥ 150 mg) of PGB was more effective in decreasing pain score than a dose of 75 mg, and a high dose (≥ 900 mg) of GBP reduced pain intensity than doses of 300 or 600 mg. Moreover, the incidence of adverse reactions varied with varying doses of PGB or GBP.

Conclusion

A dose-response relationship was detected in opioid consumption and postoperative pain for a single-dose preoperative administration of PGB and GBP. Making reasonable choice of drugs and dosage may prevent the occurrence of adverse reactions.

### Gabapentin or pregabalin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^d4cac770]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin/gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of gabapentin/gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between gabapentin and comparator (placebo, active control, or gabapentin in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We also summarised data on adverse events from all single dosage studies and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Five trials on gabapentin and one trial on its prodrug gabapentin enacarbil met the inclusion criteria; no reports on pregabalin were identified. In total, data from 1009 patients were considered. One trial each of gabapentin 900 mg (53 patients), and gabapentin titrated to 1200 mg (63 patients) and 1800 mg (122 patients) failed to show a statistically significant reduction in headache frequency in the active treatment group as compared to the placebo group, whereas one trial of gabapentin titrated to 1800 to 2400 mg (113 patients) demonstrated a small but statistically significant superiority of active treatment for this outcome (MD -0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.55 to -0.05). The pooled results of these four studies (MD -0.44; 95% CI -1.43 to 0.56; 351 patients) do not demonstrate a significant difference between gabapentin and placebo. One trial of gabapentin titrated to 1800 mg (122 patients) failed to demonstrate a significant difference between active treatment and placebo in the proportion of responders (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.11), whereas one trial of gabapentin titrated to 1800 to 2400 mg (113 patients) demonstrated a small but statistically significant superiority of active treatment for this outcome (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.09 to 7.17). The pooled results of these two studies (OR 1.59; 95% CI 0.57 to 4.46; 235 patients) do not demonstrate a significant difference between gabapentin and placebo. Comparisons from one study (135 patients) suggest that gabapentin 2000 mg is no more effective than gabapentin 1200 mg. One trial of gabapentin enacarbil (523 participants) failed to demonstrate a significant difference versus placebo or between doses for gabapentin enacarbil titrated to between 1200 mg and 3000 mg with regard to proportion of responders; there was also no evidence of a dose-response trend. Adverse events, most notably dizziness and somnolence, were common with gabapentin.

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled evidence derived from trials of gabapentin suggests that it is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. Since adverse events were common among the gabapentin-treated patients, it is advocated that gabapentin should not be used in routine clinical practice. Gabapentin enacarbil is not efficacious for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults. There is no published evidence from controlled trials of pregabalin for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults.

### Rash associated with pregabalin use [^a2c74323]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of extensive rash induced by orally administered pregabalin in a patient with neuropathic pain.

Case Summary

A 35-year-old white female with a diffuse, erythematous, maculopapular rash localized to her back and extremities presented to the preoperative holding area for planned exploratory nerve surgery. Prior to presentation, she had been receiving oral pregabalin 50 mg 3 times a day for approximately 2 weeks to treat her neuropathy. Prior to pregabalin therapy, the patient indicated that she had taken gabapentin for approximately 3 weeks for the pain, but had discontinued it due to adverse effects and perceived lack of efficacy. Pregabalin was discontinued and diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone were given to treat the rash. The rash almost completely resolved one week after pregabalin was discontinued.

Discussion

Pregabalin-induced rash was rarely reported in Phase 3 trials, and a clinical description of such events has not been published. Pregabalin exhibits pharmacokinetics different from those of most other antiepileptic agents. Presently, there are no clear mechanisms known for rash associated with pregabalin. The Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the development of rash and use of pregabalin by our patient.

Conclusions

There are currently no other available reports of the development of a rash coinciding with the use of pregabalin. As both Food and Drug Administration-approved and off-label use of this drug increases, further consideration of risk factors associated with the development of rash is needed.

Non‑opioid pharmacologic therapy in chronic pain — scope, harms, and safety alerts — includes nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants including serotonin‑norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclics (TCAs), anticonvulsants, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants, and these therapies are associated with risks in older adults, pregnant patients, and those with cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic comorbidities. NSAIDs have been associated with serious gastrointestinal and major coronary events and with about 30% of hospital admissions for preventable adverse drug reactions; CDC guidelines show moderate quality evidence (with small improvement) for NSAIDs in chronic low back pain, and for other pain conditions the guidelines strongly recommend the use of NSAIDs. Pregabalin and gabapentin are frequently prescribed with hopes that they can provide opioid‑sparing effects, but on December 19, 2019, the FDA required new warnings for gabapentinoids about risk of respiratory depression, noting reports of abuse alone and with opioids with serious consequences including respiratory depression and increased risk of opioid overdose death, and increases in non‑serious adverse events have been found with pregabalin and gabapentin (e.g., blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain; dizziness and peripheral edema with pregabalin).

### Delirium following pregabalin discontinuation in an individual with no psychiatric or substance use history [^fb0af054]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The report further highlights the diagnostic challenges in emergency rooms due to the existing limitations of drug-testing tools. Newer drug-testing tools cover a broader range of substances but often exclude gabapentinoids. Comprehensive testing for various substances, including gabapentin, can be achieved using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. However, these technologies remain out of reach in many settings owing to resource limitations. The growing prevalence of recreational opioid use in various communities, along with the increasing coabuse of opioids and gabapentinoidsand concomitant overdose risks, emphasises the importance of broadening access to elective GC/MS testing in emergency settings.

Patient's perspective

After I hurt my back, they gave me this drug called pregabalin. It made me feel really relaxed, and soon, I was taking about 15 of those 150 mg capsules every day. It is quite surprising, especially since I've always stayed away from drugs and alcohol. As I was running out, I thought about telling a small lie to my doctor to get more. But he changed my prescription to ibuprofen because my back was getting better. Just thinking about lying made me feel guilty, and I decided to never take something like this again. I felt very nervous in the next few days, and after that, I remember waking up in the hospital to learn what happened. Seeing how worried my family was made me realise my mistake. If I knew that this medicine can make me so addicted, I would have never taken it. I also did not know that stopping a medicine suddenly can make me unwell.

### Routine prescribing of gabapentin or pregabalin in supportive and palliative care: what are the comparative performances of the medications in a palliative care population? [^605c5e1e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a prevalent and distressing problem faced by people with life-limiting illness that is often difficult to palliate. Gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed as part of the routine approach to palliating neuropathic pain. Although they are often viewed as interchangeable agents, very little comparative data of their benefits and harms exists in clinical practice. Two previously reported pharmacovigilance studies that had used the same methodology for gabapentin and pregabalin were compared. These studies examined the benefits and harms of gabapentin and pregabalin after the medications had been routinely prescribed by clinicians working in a network of palliative care services using the same data collection tools with the same definitions and the same time points. Data were collected over 21 days from 282 patients prescribed either gabapentin or pregabalin for pain. Items included medication doses, pain scores, and adverse effects. In order to compare the medication responses, the final doses of pregabalin were converted to gabapentin does equivalents using previously published recommendations. The final pain scores were similar for both groups, and the reduction in pain were similar (OR = 11.2; 95% CI 3.9, 32.7, p < 0.001). However, this was achieved at lower doses of gabapentin compared to pregabalin. Those receiving gabapentin were more likely to experience harms (OR = 3.5; 95% CI 1.4, 9.1, p = 0.009) with the reported harms including somnolence, ataxia, nausea, tremor and nystagmus This hypothesis-generating work strongly supports the need for further trials to best delineate clinical differences in the GABA analogues.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^41dd9207]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lamotrigine

Lamotrigine has been reported to be helpful as an add-on therapy in a small randomised cross-over trial. Lamotrigine can be used in patients who cannot tolerate carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, or as add-on therapy to increase efficacy. It is generally associated with fewer side effects than carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. The dose of lamotrigine should be escalated slowly as the incidence of lamotrigine-induced rash is well recognised to be dose and titration dependent. About 10% of people taking lamotrigine develop benign adverse cutaneous reactions. However life-threatening conditions, like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, can rarely occur. Since the introduction of a slow-dose titration protocol, the rate of severe rashes has reduced to 0.1%–0.01%. In view of the need for this slow-dose titration, lamotrigine is not appropriate for managing severe TN exacerbation to those who need rapid pain control.

Gabapentin and pregabalin

There are 16 randomised controlled trials for gabapentin, all published in Chinese, comparing it with carbamazepine. However, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions as the inclusion criteria, endpoints and dosage are either not clarified or very varied. There are no such trials for pregabalin, but a long-term study suggests that it may be effective.

Clinical experience shows that gabapentin and pregabalin are less effective but have fewer side effects than carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. They can therefore be used in place of or in addition to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. However, there is a risk of dependency and they are controlled drugs in the UK.

Baclofen

Baclofen can help in TN especially in people with multiple sclerosis who may be using the drug for spasticity.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^fc032740]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain — antiepileptics (gabapentin and pregabalin) are supported by very low quality evidence and a neutral stance; evidence on antiepileptics was limited to pregabalin and gabapentin, the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation. Pregabalin is a controlled substance with the potential for abuse and dependence, while gabapentin is not federally scheduled but some states have scheduled it due to addiction and dependence concerns. One study indicates that gabapentin in combination with opioids significantly increases the risk of opioid-related mortality and respiratory depression. Gabapentin or pregabalin may be beneficial in patients with comorbid anxiety or insomnia, as these agents have been used off-label for these indications. The potential harms of adverse events (AEs), including medication abuse and dependence, slightly outweighed the benefits versus placebo.

Randomised, double blind trials reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the patient as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse events and study withdrawals.

Main Results

There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis. Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia. With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo. Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin has proven efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions and fibromyalgia. A minority of patients will have substantial benefit with pregabalin, and more will have moderate benefit. Many will have no or trivial benefit, or will discontinue because of adverse events. Individualisation of treatment is needed to maximise pain relief and minimise adverse events. There is no evidence to support the use of pregabalin in acute pain scenarios.

### Pregabalin in the treatment of spasticity: a retrospective case series [^c86fea8a]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the therapeutic effects of the GABA analogue, pregabalin, on patients with conditions producing spasticity who had not responded to, or experienced problems with side-effects of the available anti-spasticity agents.

Method

A retrospective case series review of 22 patients who were prescribed open label Pregabalin as monotherapy for spasticity, starting with 75 mg bd and increasing to 300 mg bd. Twenty one of these patients had previously tried gabapentin, 19 had tried baclofen, 7 had tried tizanidine and 3 had tried dantrolene.

Results

Twelve patients perceived a definite reduction in symptoms of spasticity with pregabalin, and 9 continued to take it. Eight patients experienced significant side-effects which limited its use, 5 experienced no beneficial or adverse effects.

Conclusions

Pregabalin may be of value as a systemic agent in the treatment of spasticity, although properly controlled studies with clearly defined outcome measures are required to confirm this finding. This is relevant to the study of disability and rehabilitation because of the difficulties encountered in the management of spasticity and the impact that this can have on the rehabilitation of individuals with neurological conditions.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^466f98c6]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Study design and participants

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (GaPP2) took place in 39 UK hospital centres. Ethical approval for the trial was obtained from the UK Coventry and Warwick Research Ethics Committee (REC 15/WM/0036) and clinical trial authorisation was obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. A trial steering committee provided independent oversight of the trial. Confidential interim analysis of all available data alongside anonymised reports of adverse events by participants were reviewed by a data monitoring committee on four occasions. No reason to recommend halting or modifying the trial was identified. The trial protocol has been published elsewhere.

The recruitment criteria for this study were defined before the International Classification of Diseases-11 classification for chronic secondary visceral pain was drawn up, and were based on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists definition for chronic pelvic pain and the 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain taxonomy. Moreover, we believe that they reflect the group of women commonly seen in gynaecological practice within the UK and that any heterogeneity is a strength, ensuring that our results are generalisable. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. We limited the study to women because of the growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that suggest sex differences in pain thresholds, sensitivity, and underlying neuroimmune modulation. Pelvic pain was defined as pain located within the true pelvis (between and below the anterior iliac crests). Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy (eg, macroscopic endometriosis lesions, complex ovarian cysts or ovarian cysts of > 5 cm, fibroids of > 3 cm, and dense adhesions), which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Women were excluded if they only had dysmenorrhoea; had a malignancy; were currently using or had previously used gabapentin or pregabalin; had surgery planned in next 6 months; had contraindications to taking gabapentin; had a previous reaction to gabapentin; were taking gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists and were unable or unwilling to stop; were breastfeeding, pregnant, or planned a pregnancy in next 6 months; or had pain suspected to be of gastrointestinal origin (according to positive Rome III Diagnostic Criteria); or had previously participated in the GaPP1 pilot study. All women provided written informed consent. After confirmation of clinical eligibility, women entered a pre-randomisation screening phase where they were required to return their worst and average pain scores on a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable), weekly for 4 weeks via a centralised text messaging system. To be considered eligible for randomisation, women were required to have returned at least three of four pre-randomisation NRS scores on both the worst and average NRS scales to show adherence to data collection. At least two of the worst NRS pain scores needed to be a score of 4 or higher, for the pain to be considered sufficient for entry into the trial. No study drugs were taken during this pre-randomisation screening phase, but participants were able to remain on any analgesics they were taking. We did not specify a target recruitment per centre; all centres recruited as many women as they could during the recruitment period.

### Expert consensus on ion channel drugs for chronic pain treatment in China [^f410c1fb]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Gabapentin

Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, and peripheral edema. The symptoms of withdrawal include disturbances of consciousness, disorientation, non-specific gastrointestinal reactions, hyperhidrosis, and tremors. Gabapentin dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's renal function. During the medication period, the withdrawal of gabapentin or the addition of a new treatment plan should be gradually carried out, and the time should be at least 1 week. The plasma concentration of gabapentin may increase in patients treated with morphine at the same time. Even if gabapentin was administered per the prescribed dosage, the reaction rate was reduced. Therefore, individuals engaged in driving and manipulating complex machinery should use them cautiously.

Pregabalin

The adverse effects include dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, headaches, language barriers, and tremors. Pregabalin can cause peripheral edema and a prolonged PR interval and should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure and heart function grade III or IV. Adverse endocrine effects include an increase in body weight, with an occurrence rate of 4% to 12%. Muscular skeletal adverse effects include elevated creatine kinase levels, myoclonus, and stripe muscle dissolution. Pregabalin treatment occasionally causes mild transient increases in liver enzymes, saliva deficiency, constipation, thrombocytopenia, blurred vision, diplopia, and amblyopia. The pregabalin dosage needs to be adjusted according to the patient's renal function. During treatment, it is necessary to monitor for signs of depression, suicidal thoughts, or abnormal behavioral and mood changes.

Gabapentin and pregabalin are addictive, and sudden withdrawal increases the frequency of seizures and produces withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, headache, and diarrhea. Therefore, when discontinuing the drug, the dosage should be gradually reduced for at least 1 week.

### Pregabalin-induced hepatotoxicity [^e4b346b7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of acute elevation of hepatic enzyme levels as a probable adverse reaction associated with pregabalin.

Case Summary

A 59-year-old man with a history of mantle cell lymphoma developed neuropathic pain and was treated with pregabalin 25 mg daily. Fourteen days after beginning pregabalin therapy, he developed left ankle edema and elevation of liver enzyme levels. Peak values were aspartate transaminase 907 U/L, alanine transaminase 1582 U/L, and γ-glutamyltransferase 510 U/L. Pregabalin was discontinued and hepatic enzyme levels returned gradually (over 4 months) to baseline levels.

Discussion

Many medications are commonly associated with liver injury; few cases of pregabalin-associated hepatotoxicity have been documented. A MEDLINE search (1966-November 2010) revealed 2 reports of acute liver injury with the initiation of pregabalin. In our patient, with hemosiderosis after hematopoietic cell transplantation, pregabalin worsened the underlying liver injury. The low pregabalin dosage and the short time to elevation of liver enzyme levels suggest an idiosyncratic reaction. According to the Naranjo probability scale and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences probability scale, this reaction was probably due to pregabalin.

Conclusions

Prescribers should be alert to the possibility of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity associated with pregabalin use.

### Initiation of pregabalin vs gabapentin and development of heart failure [^46f1f29d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Based on currently available but limited evidence of increased risk of HF associated with pregabalin compared with gabapentin, the American Heart Association currently lists pregabalin, but not gabapentin, as a medication that may cause or exacerbate HF. The European Medicines Agency recommends caution when using pregabalin, but not gabapentin, in older patients with cardiovascular comorbidities due to the increased risk of HF.

Despite these recommendations, only a few cohort studies, have examined the comparative risk of HF between pregabalin and gabapentin. Most of these prior studies restricted their analyses to neurological indications for use (neuropathy or seizures), did not use a rigorous definition of HF, did not exclude those with a history of HF, or did not focus on older patients.

Thus, the relationship between the incidence of HF and pregabalin use among patients at the highest risk of adverse reactions (ie, older patients with cardiovascular comorbidities) remains unclear. Our hypothesis was that pregabalin would be associated with a higher risk for HF in this population compared with gabapentin. To assess this association without a randomized clinical trial, we conducted a target trial emulation comparing HF incidence among Medicare beneficiaries prescribed pregabalin or gabapentin for a diverse range of chronic noncancer pain indications.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^162c346d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs which have been developed to improve outcomes. This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2014, and includes three new studies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), on 5 July 2018, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 5 July 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov (5 July 2018), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 5 July 2018), and contacted Pfizer Ltd, manufacturer of pregabalin, to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. We presented results as risk ratios (RR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Two review authors assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

We included nine industry-sponsored randomised controlled trials (3327 participants) in the review. Seven trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.42, 7 trials, 2193 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.65, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.88 to 3.74, 7 trials, 2193 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12, 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11, 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12, 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83) for seizure freedom, however, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.52), levetiracetam (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49), or gabapentin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.07) for treatment withdrawal due to any reason or due to adverse effects (pregabalin versus lamotrigine: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48; versus levetiracetam: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.54; versus gabapentin: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.11). Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant focal epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, however issues with tolerability were noted at higher doses. The trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making.

### The relationship between the reporting of euphoria events and early treatment responses to pregabalin: an exploratory post-hoc analysis [^58819695]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Studies included in the analysis

The dates of the studies ranged between March 1998 and August 2015. Pregabalin was administered in doses of 75–600 mg/day (either fixed or flexible dosing). Treatment duration ranged from 4 to 16 weeks. All of the original studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and/or Good Clinical Practice Guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation and were approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee of each participating center. Each patient or their legal guardian or representative provided written informed consent to participate in the study. No new patients were recruited for this analysis.

Capturing of euphoria events as adverse events

Investigators were responsible for reporting treatment-emergent AEs in the original studies, including severity and potential relationship to study medication. For the purpose of this analysis, the reporting of euphoria events was coded using the preferred term "euphoric mood" (code 10015535 of the MedDRA, version 19.0). The present study did not consider the severity of reported euphoria events or the relationship to study medication. Events were captured separately for pregabalin and placebo. Most studies were of parallel group design, and incidences of euphoria events were captured throughout the duration of the treatment period. Four studies were of 2-period, 2-way crossover design, and the incidences of euphoria events in these studies were captured during the first treatment period only.

### Pregabalin for neuropathic pain in adults [^18f1e21e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled "Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults", and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment. Postherpetic neuralgia: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (50% vs 25%; RR 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 2.6); NNTB 3.9 (3.0 to 5.6); 3 studies, 589 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (32% vs 13%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.4); NNTB 5.3 (3.9 to 8.1); 4 studies, 713 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (62% vs 24%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2); NNTB 2.7 (2.2 to 3.7); 3 studies, 537 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 15%; RR 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.5); NNTB 3.9 (3.1 to 5.5); 4 studies, 732 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 16% versus 5.5%, 600 mg 25% versus 5.8%; dizziness 300 mg 29% versus 8.1%, 600 mg 35% versus 8.8%. Painful diabetic neuropathy: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (47% vs 42%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.2); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 8 studies, 2320 participants, moderate-quality evidence), more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (31% vs 24%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 11 studies, 2931 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had PGIC much or very much improved (51% vs 30%; RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0); NNTB 4.9 (3.8 to 6.9); 5 studies, 1050 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (63% vs 52%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.4); NNTB 9.6 (5.5 to 41); 2 studies, 611 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 28%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7); NNTB 7.8 (5.4 to 14); 5 studies, 1015 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 11% versus 3.1%, 600 mg 15% versus 4.5%; dizziness 300 mg 13% versus 3.8%, 600 mg 22% versus 4.4%. Mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (48% vs 36%; RR 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4); NNTB 8.2 (5.7 to 15); 4 studies, 1367 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (34% vs 20%; RR 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9); NNTB 7.2 (5.4 to 11); 4 studies, 1367 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence (12% vs 3.9%) and dizziness (23% vs 6.2%) were more common with pregabalin. Central neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (44% vs 28%; RR 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0); NNTB 5.9 (4.1 to 11); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence) and at least 50% pain intensity reduction (26% vs 15%; RR 1.7 (1.2 to 2.3); NNTB 9.8 (6.0 to 28); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence (32% vs 11%) and dizziness (23% vs 8.6%) were more common with pregabalin. Other neuropathic pain conditions: Studies show no evidence of benefit for 600 mg pregabalin in HIV neuropathy (2 studies, 674 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and limited evidence of benefit in neuropathic back pain or sciatica, neuropathic cancer pain, or polyneuropathy. Serious adverse events, all conditions: Serious adverse events were no more common with placebo than with pregabalin 300 mg (3.1% vs 2.6%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 17 studies, 4112 participants, high-quality evidence) or pregabalin 600 mg (3.4% vs 3.4%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.5); 16 studies, 3995 participants, high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.

### GABA-ergic drugs: exit stage left, enter stage right [^d86a7900]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity by interacting at post-synaptic GABA(A) receptors have long been used as hypnotics, sedatives, tranquillizers and anticonvulsants. In this category, benzodiazepines rapidly gained pride of place, replacing barbiturates and becoming the most commonly prescribed of all drugs in the Western world in the 1970s. However, problems such as dependence and withdrawal reactions became apparent in the 1980s, and it seemed that the usefulness of drugs with this mode of action was limited. Recently, focus has shifted to a new group of drugs with GABA-ergic actions mediated through various mechanisms not directly involving the GABA(A) receptor. These drugs include gabapentin, vigabatrin, tiagabine, lamotrigine, pregabalin and others. Although originally developed as anticonvulsants for epilepsy, they appear to have wider applications for use in affective disorders, especially bipolar depression, anxiety disorders and pain conditions. The current information on the properties and therapeutic potential of this new generation of GABA-ergic drugs is reviewed. It remains to be seen whether long-term use leads to tolerance, dependence and withdrawal or discontinuation reactions.

### The relationship between the reporting of euphoria events and early treatment responses to pregabalin: an exploratory post-hoc analysis [^aabfc388]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Euphoria is often perceived as a signal of potential substance abuse or addiction and has been described as an exaggerated feeling of physical and emotional well-being and optimism not consistent with apparent stimuli or events.–It has been reported as an adverse event (AE) in clinical trials of medications that act on the central nervous system including analgesics. Feelings of euphoria can contribute to the abuse of prescription drugs, as illustrated by the rise in recent years of the misuse of prescription opioids in the US population, where there was a 140% increase in prescription drug misuse from 7.8 million in 1992 to 15.1 million in 2003. However, euphoria is a complex multifactorial phenomenon that is not well understood. For instance, euphoria events occur in clinical trials of some medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and corticosteroids, which are known not to be abused for psychotropic purposes.–Moreover, many prescription drugs with significant abuse potential, such as benzodiazepines, are not typically associated with euphoria in clinical trials. Euphoria may also be reported in patients who receive placebo in some clinical trials. One additional complexity that has not been explored is the potential relationship between the reporting of euphoria events and treatment responses.

Pregabalin is an α2δ calcium channel subunit ligand and analgesic,–indicated in multiple countries for the treatment of peripheral or central neuropathic pain (NeP) and fibromyalgia, as well as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and partial-onset seizures. In placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, 4% of patients who received pregabalin reported euphoria events (defined by the preferred term "euphoric mood" using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA], version 19.0), with incidences varying across indications, while 1% of patients who received placebo also reported euphoria events.

Because of the large number of patients who have participated in clinical studies of pregabalin, an opportunity exists to examine possible links between the reporting of euphoria events and treatment responses. In this exploratory post-hoc analysis of data from 40 placebo-controlled clinical trials, the objective was to assess the relationship between reported euphoria events and early treatment responses (pain and sleep) to pregabalin in patients with NeP or non-NeP.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^6431d3ea]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — nonhormonal prescription therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS): For women seeking pharmacological management for moderate to severe VMS for whom menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is contraindicated, or who choose not to take MHT, we recommend SSRIs/SNRIs or gabapentin or pregabalin (if there are no contraindications). (1|⊕⊕⊕○) For those women not responding to or tolerating these nonhormonal prescription therapies, we suggest a trial of clonidine (if there are no contraindications). (2|⊕⊕○○) Several RCTs demonstrated that clonidine reduced hot flashes, but less effectively than the SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, and pregabalin, and with more side effects, and clonidine transdermal patches are preferred over tablets because of more stable blood levels.

### Concerns about pregabalin: further experience with its potential of causing addictive behaviors [^5f536011]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pregabalin (PRG) is approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain, partial seizures, and generalized anxiety disorder in many countries. Supported by case reports and a few studies there is an ongoing debate on PRG's potential to cause addictive behaviors. Considering that PRG is currently under investigation for the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal as well as relapse prevention in alcohol dependence, assessment of PRG's abuse and dependence potential is indispensable. We report the case of a 38-year-old female patient with borderline personality disorder and past alcohol abuse who developed PRG abuse. The patient took up to 800 mg PRG per day, initially administered to treat unspecific anxiety, and experienced euphoric feelings after PRG intake. In the further course, she increased the daily PRG dosage and consulted other physicians to receive additional PRG prescriptions. During reduction of PRG, the patient developed a moderate withdrawal syndrome with vegetative symptoms. Because of the early detection of the developing PRG abuse (4 months after first application of PRG), the development of PRG dependence was prevented. This case illustrates the possibility of PRG to trigger the development of addictive behaviors and should encourage physicians to be very careful when administering PRG to patients with current or past substance-related disorders.

### Real-life efficacy of pregabalin for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in daily clinical practice in Denmark: the NEP-TUNE study [^4917aff2]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Patient selection

All patients enrolled in the study had to meet the usual prescribing criteria for pregabalin as per the local product information and were entered into the study at the prescribing physicians' discretion. Patients included in the study had to meet the following six inclusion criteria: 1) aged 18 years or above; 2) diagnosed with peripheral NeP; 3) had not previously been prescribed pregabalin for the treatment of peripheral NeP ("first prescription patients") or were prescribed pregabalin again ("retreatment patients") but had not used pregabalin within the previous 6 months; 4) had not taken the first dose of the prescribed pregabalin at enrollment; 5) able to read and understand Danish and fill in patient questionnaires; and 6) signed a dated informed consent document. Exclusion criteria were 1) patients younger than 18 years, 2) patients who did not consent to participate, and 3) patients who at study inclusion (baseline) had already been prescribed pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder or epilepsy.

Data recorded

Data were collected and recorded using electronic case report forms at the baseline visit and at all subsequent visits, including the telephone follow-up. The following information was collected: demographic and socioeconomic data (age and sex), data regarding the patient's pain history (time with NeP pain condition, etiology, other pain types, comorbidities, and pain drug history), treatment (prebaseline treatment, pregabalin treatment and dose, postbaseline treatment), treatment end points (pain intensity, pain-related sleep inference, WPAI, PGIC, and quality of life), and finally any reported adverse events. Standard criteria were applied in the study to all observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of suspected causal relationship to pregabalin, which were recorded on the adverse event pages of the case report form, including criteria for classification as a serious adverse event. Data transformation of WPAI and EQ-5D followed the official guidelines issued for these instruments.

Study size

The study was designed to have 80% power to show an improvement of at least 0.75 points on the 11-point Likert pain scale using a 95% confidence level and assuming a true improvement of 1.25 points and standard deviation of 1.91. Using these assumptions, 115 evaluable patients were needed. Patients who were evaluable for efficacy were defined as patients with data on pregabalin use at baseline and at the 3-month telephone follow-up.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^ccfc935a]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Pain responders

New responders were classified as having a ≥ 30% and/or ≥ 50% reduction in mean pain score from baseline. Once a patient responded, they were not scored subsequently and were excluded from the ongoing analysis. Mean pain score was determined as the mean score over the past 7 days as recorded by patients in a daily pain diary and measured using the 11-point numeric rating scale scored from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). At each week for the first 6 weeks, the numbers of new 30% and 50% responders were determined and the proportion was compared with the total number of patients remaining (ie, those who had not responded in previous weeks or were withdrawn from the trial) was calculated.

Adverse events

AEs were recorded for the full duration of each trial. In this analysis, AEs were assessed weekly where an emerging AE was scored if it appeared for the first time, or if it increased in severity. Data are shown as the percentage incidence at each week for the first 6 weeks, given that the majority of common AEs emerged within this time frame.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^458dc5e4]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Dose pathway groups

To be included in this analysis, patients had to have ≥ 80% compliance on the study drug (calculated by total number of days on a valid dose/duration of treatment), to have remained in their study for at least 28 days, and to have been receiving a stable dose of pregabalin for at least 4 days. Patients were grouped into dose pathways based on the pattern of their pregabalin dose at each week during titration phase and up to 1 week of their maintenance phase. The dose pathway groups were: 150 mg/day only; 150 to 300 mg/day; 150 to 300 to 450 mg/day; 150 to 300 to 450 to 600 mg/day; 150 to 300 to 600 mg/day; and 300 to 600 mg/day. Each patient was included in a single-dose pathway group. Patients who decreased their dose at any visit or who did not remain at the particular dose level for at least 4 days were not included in a dose pathway group.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^34a9e76a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of pain modulators

Pain modulators include the gabapentanoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCI; eg, amitriptyline) and serotonin noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRI; eg, duloxetine). Some indications that may be helpful to guide initial choice of therapy are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Relative indications for choosing a specific pain modulator

Practical approach:
Amitriptyline: Start with 10 mg at night and if necessary escalate the dose weekly by 10–25 mg/day, up to a maximum dose of 50–150 mg/day. The usual dose for pain relief is 25–50 mg/day. Since the analgesic effect is independent of the mood-altering effect, the dose used for pain is lower than the antidepressant dose (100–300 mg).–
Pregabalin: Start low and titrate slowly according to tolerability, initially 25 mg at night, increasing by 25 mg increments every 3 days. Dosing is initially nocté, followed by higher doses, to a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, administered in two divided doses. Some patients prefer to take only a night-time dose.
Gabapentin: Start with a low dose (100–300 mg at bedtime or 100–300 mg three times daily). Because it has nonlinear pharmacokinetics, it requires slow and careful titration, increasing the dose by 100–300 mg three times daily every 1–7 days as tolerated. The maximum dose is 3600 mg per day in divided doses (1200 mg three times daily).
Duloxetine: Start with 30 mg and increase to 60 mg after 1 week. The dose may be increased to 120 mg/day (60 mg twice daily).

Patients with chronic pain have often been taking one of these medications in the past. Lack of efficacy may be consequent to inappropriate dosing or use of monotherapy. Dosing should be optimized and patients generally require combination therapy, which, in comparison with monotherapy, may be more effective and permit lower doses, with improvement in tolerability. However, the potential for additive adverse effects, increased risk of drug interactions and reduced adherence due to increasing complexity of dosing are also important considerations. Once the dose of a single agent has been stabilized at a therapeutic level, if response is not adequate after 2–4 weeks (and treatment is tolerable), then combination therapy may be considered, using any of the other classes of pain modulators.

Compliance should be assessed by asking the patient to bring all of their medications with them to each consultation.

### Gabapentin and pregabalin for the treatment of chronic pruritus [^d3bca54b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus is a distressing symptom that is often refractory to treatment. Patients frequently fail topical therapies and oral over-the-counter antihistamines, prompting the clinician to consider alternative therapies such as neuroactive agents. Herein, the use of gabapentin and pregabalin, 2 medications well known for treating neuropathic pain and epilepsy that are occasionally used for relieving chronic pruritus is explored. The findings from original sources published to date to evaluate the use of gabapentin and pregabalin as antipruritic agents are explored. They are found to be promising alternative treatments for the relief of several forms of chronic pruritus, particularly uremic pruritus and neuropathic or neurogenic itch, in patients who fail conservative therapies.

### Serious breathing difficulties with gabapentin and pregabalin… [^7eff6237]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

12-19-2019 FDA Drug Safety Communication The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that serious breathing difficulties may occur in patients using gabapentin or pregabalin who have respiratory risk factors. These include the use of opioid pain medicines and other drugs that depress the central nervous system, and conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that reduce lung function. The elderly are also at higher risk.
- FDA is warning that serious breathing difficulties may occur when gabapentin or pregabalin is taken with other medicines that depress the central nervous system such as opioids, in those patients who have underlying respiratory problems, or in the elderly.

There is less evidence supporting the risk of serious breathing difficulties with gabapentinoids alone in otherwise healthy individuals, and we will continue to monitor this population for additional evidence.
- FDA is warning that serious, life-threatening, and fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the gabapentinoids, gabapentin and pregabalin. Most cases occurred in association with co-administered central nervous system depressants, especially opioids, in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment, or in the elderly.
- Our evaluation of respiratory depression with the gabapentinoids provides some evidence contrary to the widely held belief that gabapentinoids lack drug interactions and have wide therapeutic indices. Published studies demonstrate these drugs can behave in an additive way to potentiate central nervous system and respiratory depression.
- When co-prescribing gabapentinoids with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or in patients with underlying respiratory impairment, initiate the gabapentinoid at the lowest dose. Pregabalin produced a dose-dependent decrease in respiration rate. A pregabalin bolus given alone depressed mouse minute ventilation to the same extent as a morphine bolus given alone. The respiratory depressant effects of morphine and pregabalin were additive, not multiplicative. Collectively, the published animal studies suggest that gabapentinoids have an independent dose-dependent depressive effect on respiration and can augment the respiratory depression caused by opioids.

### Progressive myeloneuropathy with symptomatic anaemia [^389760ea]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

At first, I was really mad. I wasn't mad at the doctors. I was mad at the people who created the situation. Then I found out that I wasn't the only case. I found out that some people were paralysed from this and that some people have died from this. A lawyer wouldn't touch this case. I was very mad. I had tried to hire a lawyer to file lawsuit, but no one would take this case. I eventually came out on the other side of this and I'm okay with it now… it could be worse. I was one of the lucky ones.

I was mad at Fixodent. Now today whenever I'm at the grocery store and I see somebody pick up a tube of Fixodent, I would tell them my story. There 's no reason for them to put zinc in their product when Polygrip doesn't use it in their product, and it works just fine. I'm using Polygrip now. I have not used Fixodent ever since I was told about the zinc.

It's hard to walk sometimes. When I'm not at work, I'm exhausted. I still have to use the cane when I'm walking longer distances because I wobble. I think my medical care since the diagnosis has been awesome. I feel much better since my diagnosis in the hospital. I had no idea my symptoms were from the denture cream. I remember it started a month after I moved in with my daughter. I could barely walk, I had no energy, I was sleeping most of the day, I had lost a lot of weight.

I am still seeing the neurologist. He has done nerve conduction tests and a biopsy of my nerves in the legs which did confirm neuropathy. Right now I'm managing the neuropathy with lyrica and cymbalta. I used to be on maximum doses of gabapentin but then we switched to lyrica and cymbalta because they work better. I still occasionally see the haematologist. My blood levels are entirely normal but she still likes to see me occasionally about every 6 months just to make sure.

### Delirium following pregabalin discontinuation in an individual with no psychiatric or substance use history [^aae2b59a]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Pregabalin, a γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogue, is approved in the USA for treating fibromyalgia, various forms of neuropathic pain and partial onset seizures. Additionally, it is prescribed off-label for a range of clinical conditions, with recent trends indicating a surge in its off-label utilisation. Review articles and case studies have highlighted the potential for pregabalin abuse, and multiple cases have documented withdrawal symptoms following its sudden cessation. This case emphasises the importance for clinicians to recognise potential misuse of pregabalin to educate patients while prescribing pregabalin and to be cognisant of severe symptoms that might arise from its abrupt discontinuation.

Efficacy analyses.

There was no significant difference between treatments for the results of the primary endpoint, percent change from baseline in 28-day seizure rate during the treatment phase. The Hodges-Lehman estimated median difference (95% CI) during the double-blind phase was 0.0 (−6.0 to 7.0; p = 0.87). Similarly, the observed median percentage change from baseline was −58.65 for pregabalin and −57.43 for gabapentin, and the mean percent change from baseline was −47.7 (SD 48.3) for pregabalin and −45.28 (SD 60.6) for gabapentin.

There were no significant differences between pregabalin and gabapentin for all secondary endpoints. The ≥ 50% responder rates were 56.3% (95% CI 50.0–62.6) and 58.3% (95% CI 52.1–64.6) for pregabalin and gabapentin, respectively, with an odds ratio of 0.92% (95% CI 0.64–1.33; p = 0.662). The ≥ 75% responder rates were 33.6% (95% CI 27.6–39.6) and 34.2% (95% CI 28.2–40.2) for pregabalin and gabapentin, respectively (p = 0.92). The last 28-day seizure-free rates were 30.8% (95% CI 24.1–37.3) and 34.1% (95% CI 27.2–41.0; p = 0.51). The SGTC proportion of responders was comparable with pregabalin (30.8%) and gabapentin (39.8%; p = 0.1881; table 2).

### Negative myoclonus induced by gabapentin and pregabalin: a case series and systematic literature review [^26509230]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Negative myoclonus is a jerky, brief, and sudden interruption of voluntary muscle contraction. Although gabapentin and pregabalin have been reported to induce positive myoclonus in some patients with impaired renal function, there are only a few studies describing pregabalin- or gabapentin-induced negative myoclonus. This study reviewed patients who had developed pregabalin- or gabapentin-induced negative myoclonus.

Methods

We collected the patients with negative myoclonus who were referred to the department of neurology at a university-affiliated hospital and selected pregabalin- or gabapentin-induced negative myoclonus. Then reviewed the literature with respect to pregabalin- or gabapentin-induced negative myoclonus.

Results

A total of 77 patients with negative myoclonus were reviewed. Among them, 21 neuropathic pain patients who were prescribed and developed negative myoclonus induced by pregabalin (9 cases) or gabapentin (12 cases). To prove causality of the drug, probable and certain level of category according to the WHO-UMC criteria were recruited. Of the 21 patients, 3 had impaired renal function, while 18 had normal renal function. Review of the literature identified 7 further cases (6 had normal renal function) with pregabalin- or gabapentin-induced negative myoclonus.

Conclusion

Pregabalin- and gabapentin-induced negative myoclonus can develop even in patients with normal renal function. Physicians should keep in mind the possibility of patients developing negative myoclonus under treatment of pregabalin or gabapentin even in short period of time and with low dosage, and in the normal range of renal function. Further prospective study investigating incidence and risk factors is warranted.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^ae78ab35]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Adjuvant analgesics — gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may lessen neuropathic pain but require caution. They "reduce neuropathic pain by inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels," and "gabapentinoid use decreases opioid requirements in select populations (e.g., in patients with spinal cord injury or burn)," yet "limited evidence exists to support a broad analgesic effect." Safety concerns include that "abuse and misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was reported," the directive to "Use gabapentinoids with caution in patients with or at risk of developing an SUD," and that they "produce additive CNS depression and increase risk of death when used in combination with opioids." Because "both pregabalin and gabapentin are renally eliminated," the page advises to "use lower doses or avoid them in patients with underlying renal disease and in elderly patients."

### Gabapentin dosing in the treatment of epilepsy [^37b87b24]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is considered a safe and well-tolerated antipileptic drug (AED) with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and a broad therapeutic index. However, recent studies have used higher doses and faster titration schedules than those used in the pivotal trials that established the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures.

Objective

The purposes of this review were to assess the gabapentin titration and dosing regimens that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, to develop dosing recommendations to maximize antiseizure efficacy without compromising tolerability, and to formulate guidelines for an adequate therapeutic assessment of gabapentin dosage efficacy.

Methods

In the absence of sufficient placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, a formal evidence-based assessment could not be performed. However, a MEDLINE search using the search terms gabapentin and epilepsy, spanning back to the year 1986, produced numerous published reports from randomized, placebo-controlled and open-label trials, as well as case reports. These were reviewed to assess the range of dosing and titration schedules reported. Reports that employed gabapentin doses and titration schedules were selected for review.

Results

Our review of this literature suggests improved seizure control at higher gabapentin maintenance dosages (≤ 3600 mg/d) than are used today in clinical practice (1800 mg/d) without an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions. Most of the patients who received high dosages (eg, 3600 mg/d) or experienced fast titration rates tolerated gabapentin well. Side effects occurred around the onset of dosing and were reported in some studies to be transient.

Conclusions

Based in the literature here, in most adult patients, gabapentin may be initiated at a dosage of 900 mg/d and titrated to maintenance dosages ≥ 3600 mg/d. Children may be treated with gabapentin 23 to 78 mg/kg per day. Based on controlled and open trials, the majority of patients will tolerate gabapentin well enough for an adequate therapeutic assessment. Titration to effect can be accomplished rapidly, if necessary; however, as with other AEDs, optimal seizure control may take months to achieve.
