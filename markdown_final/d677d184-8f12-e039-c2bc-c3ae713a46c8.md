## Question

Olpasiran dosing for ASCVD management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about olpasiran dosing for ASCVD management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether olpasiran is indicated or investigational. Then, I should verify the phase 2 dose-finding data to identify the most effective and practical regimen. Next, I will review durability and off-treatment kinetics to inform dosing interval. After that, I need to check safety and tolerability, including injection-site reactions. Finally, I will integrate guideline context, current standard of care, and practical considerations for implementation, while clearly stating what is known versus unknown pending outcomes trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication status. Olpasiran is a small interfering RNA targeting apolipoprotein(a) mRNA to lower lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and it is investigational for ASCVD risk reduction. It is not currently FDA-approved for Lp(a) lowering or ASCVD outcomes, and its use should be limited to clinical trials or research settings pending phase 3 outcomes data [^f3da06d3] [^2ecf8e4d] [^40a41732].

> Wait, let me verify the phase 2 dose-finding results to anchor dosing. In OCEAN(a)-DOSE, 281 patients with established ASCVD and Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L were randomized to 10 mg every 12 weeks, 75 mg every 12 weeks, 225 mg every 12 weeks, 225 mg every 24 weeks, or placebo for 36 weeks. The placebo-adjusted Lp(a) reductions at week 36 were approximately 70.5% with 10 mg Q12W, 97.4% with 75 mg Q12W, 101.1% with 225 mg Q12W, and 100.5% with 225 mg Q24W, indicating near-maximal efficacy at 75 mg Q12W and 225 mg Q12W/Q24W with a clear dose-response up to 75 mg and plateau thereafter [^f3da06d3] [^c7d6b36a] [^19a4edff].

> Hold on, I should verify durability and off-treatment kinetics before recommending an interval. The OCEAN(a)-DOSE extension showed that after the last dose at week 36, participants receiving 75 mg Q12W maintained a roughly 40–50% reduction in Lp(a) at 48–96 weeks off therapy, and those receiving 225 mg Q12W maintained a roughly 36–52% reduction over the same period, supporting a prolonged pharmacodynamic effect and supporting Q12W or Q24W dosing intervals in practice if approved [^3aba8a05].

> I need to check safety and tolerability next. Across dose groups, adverse events were similar to placebo, with injection-site reactions (primarily pain) being the most common olpasiran-related events. There were no significant differences in serious adverse events, and no new safety signals emerged in the extension phase, which supports subcutaneous administration and acceptable tolerability profiles at the tested doses [^f3da06d3] [^3aba8a05].

> Let me consider pharmacokinetics and cross-ethnic consistency. Single-dose studies in Japanese and non-Japanese participants showed dose-proportional exposure and similar magnitude and durability of Lp(a) lowering, with no clinically meaningful differences between populations, suggesting no dose adjustment by ethnicity is warranted based on available data [^c693a79e]. A separate phase 1 study in Chinese participants likewise found robust, sustained Lp(a) reductions with 75 mg and 225 mg single doses and a favorable safety profile, reinforcing consistency across populations [^c7e97f70].

> But wait, what about the practical dosing choice if one were to extrapolate from phase 2 to a hypothetical regimen? Given the plateau in Lp(a) lowering beyond 75 mg and the similar efficacy of 225 mg Q12W and 225 mg Q24W, a reasonable regimen would be 75 mg subcutaneously every 12 weeks or 225 mg every 24 weeks, balancing potency, durability, and injection burden. However, I should emphasize again that this is not an approved dose and should not be used outside trials until outcomes and regulatory review are complete [^f3da06d3] [^3aba8a05].

> Next, I should review the current standard of care to avoid overpromising. For patients with established ASCVD and elevated Lp(a), guidelines prioritize aggressive LDL-C lowering with high-intensity statins, adding ezetimibe and then PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C remains above thresholds, while recognizing Lp(a) as a risk enhancer. Lp(a)-directed therapies remain investigational, and lipoprotein apheresis is the only FDA-approved modality for select high-risk patients with very high Lp(a) and LDL-C despite maximally tolerated therapy [^84939dff] [^f0b0a01c].

> I should double-check the status of outcomes trials because that determines when dosing becomes clinically actionable. The phase 3 OCEAN(a)-Outcomes trial is underway to determine whether olpasiran-mediated Lp(a) lowering reduces major adverse cardiovascular events. Until these results are available, any dosing recommendation remains investigational and should not be implemented in routine practice [^40a41732] [^2ecf8e4d].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Based on phase 2 data, olpasiran 75 mg subcutaneously every 12 weeks or 225 mg every 24 weeks achieve robust, sustained Lp(a) reductions of about 97–100% and 100%, respectively, with favorable safety and prolonged off-treatment durability. However, olpasiran is not FDA-approved, and use should be restricted to clinical trials until outcomes and regulatory review are complete [^f3da06d3] [^3aba8a05] [^2ecf8e4d].

---

Olpasiran is administered as a **subcutaneous injection** at 75 mg every 12 weeks or 225 mg every 24 weeks, with the 75 mg every 12 weeks regimen providing the most favorable balance of efficacy and safety [^f3da06d3]. This dosing achieves **greater than 90% Lp(a) reduction** in patients with established ASCVD and elevated Lp(a), with sustained effects and minimal adverse events [^3aba8a05]. Olpasiran is not yet FDA-approved; use is limited to clinical trials until outcomes data are available [^2ecf8e4d].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

The OCEAN(a)-DOSE trial evaluated four dosing regimens, with results summarized below:

| **Dose and frequency** | **Placebo-adjusted lp(a) reduction at week 36** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| 10 mg every 12 weeks | -70.5% (95% CI, -75.1% to -65.9%) | - Less effective <br/> - Dose-dependent response observed [^f3da06d3] |
| 75 mg every 12 weeks | -97.4% (95% CI, -102.0% to -92.8%) | - Highly effective <br/> - Favorable safety profile [^c7d6b36a] |
| 225 mg every 12 weeks | -101.1% (95% CI, -105.7% to -96.5%) | - Slightly greater efficacy <br/> - Similar safety to 75 mg [^f3da06d3] |
| 225 mg every 24 weeks | -100.5% (95% CI, -105.2% to -95.8%) | - Comparable efficacy to 225 mg every 12 weeks <br/> - Convenient less frequent dosing [^19a4edff] |

---

The **75 mg every 12 weeks** regimen is the most favorable, balancing high efficacy with a strong safety profile and sustained Lp(a) lowering [^f3da06d3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

- **OCEAN(a)-DOSE trial**: Demonstrated dose-dependent Lp(a) reduction, with 75 mg every 12 weeks achieving ~97% reduction and 225 mg every 12 or 24 weeks achieving ~100% reduction [^f3da06d3].
- **Durability**: Off-treatment effects persist ~40–50% at 48–96 weeks after the last dose, supporting sustained efficacy [^3aba8a05].
- **Safety**: Adverse events were similar to placebo, with injection-site reactions the most common and generally mild [^f3da06d3].

---

## Comparison with other Lp(a)-lowering therapies

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Lp(a) reduction** | **Current status** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Olpasiran | siRNA targeting LPA mRNA | ~97–100% | Phase 3 trials ongoing [^40a41732] |
| Pelacarsen | Antisense oligonucleotide | ~80% | Phase 3 trials ongoing [^ed7f5a87] |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | Monoclonal antibodies | ~25–30% | Approved for LDL-C lowering [^a10c9340] |

---

Olpasiran achieves **greater Lp(a) reduction** than PCSK9 inhibitors and comparable or greater reduction than pelacarsen [^2ecf8e4d].

---

## Practical considerations for administration

- **Route**: Subcutaneous injection, typically administered in a healthcare setting.
- **Frequency**: 75 mg every 12 weeks or 225 mg every 24 weeks.
- **Monitoring**: Regular Lp(a) measurements to assess response and adjust therapy as needed [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Olpasiran is **not yet approved** by regulatory authorities; current guidelines do not provide specific recommendations. It is considered investigational pending outcomes data from ongoing phase 3 trials [^2ecf8e4d].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

The **OCEAN(a)-Outcomes trial** is evaluating cardiovascular outcomes and will clarify the clinical benefit of Lp(a) lowering with olpasiran [^40a41732]. If outcomes are favorable, regulatory approval and guideline inclusion are anticipated [^0fca11fa].

---

Olpasiran is administered as **75 mg every 12 weeks or 225 mg every 24 weeks**, with 75 mg every 12 weeks offering the best efficacy–safety balance. It achieves robust, sustained Lp(a) lowering in ASCVD patients with elevated Lp(a), but remains investigational until outcomes data are available [^f3da06d3].

### Study design and rationale for the olpasiran trials of cardiovascular events and lipoproteiN (a) reduction-DOSE finding study (OCEAN (a)-DOSE) [^c0d8c58f]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Data support lipoprotein(a) (Lp[Lp(a)]) being a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Olpasiran is a small interfering RNA molecule that markedly reduces Lp(a) production in hepatocytes.

Study Design

The Olpasiran trials of Cardiovascular Events And lipoproteiN(a) reduction-DOSE finding study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding study in 281 subjects with established ASCVD and Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L. Patients were randomly allocated to one of 4 active subcutaneous doses of olpasiran (10 mg q12 weeks, 75 mg q12 weeks, 225 mg q 12 weeks, or 225 mg q24 weeks) or matched placebo. The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of olpasiran dosed every 12 weeks compared with placebo on the percent change in Lp(a) from baseline at 36 weeks. Enrollment is now complete and follow-up is ongoing.

Conclusions

OCEAN(a)-DOSE trial is assessing the Lp(a)-lowering efficacy and safety of olpasiran. These data will be used to determine optimal dosing and design for a cardiovascular outcomes trial.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^7a8f61af]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Addressing the Continuum ofRisk

To fully realize the potential of available and future LDL‐C–lowering therapies, we propose an approach of earlier identification and more aggressive treatment of individuals at the highest risk of ASCVD events. LDL‐C management should consider each patient's risk across the continuum of ASCVD, including subclinical atherosclerosis, the degree of desired LDL‐C lowering, the role of pharmacotherapy, and LDL‐C targets or thresholds (Figure 4). Although statins form the backbone of therapy, achieving a > 50% reduction in LDL‐C levels with high‐intensity statins is often insufficient for patients at the highest risk of ASCVD events; thus, it is key to identify high‐risk patients for whom a statin is only the beginning of a multidrug regimen to lower their ASCVD risk aggressively. For patients at very high risk who require LDL‐C lowering of ≥ 50%, there should be a consideration for early, upfront combination lipid‐lowering therapy and therapy titration every 4 to 12 weeks until LDL‐C goals are achieved. Use of fixed‐dose formulations may circumvent some of the barriers associated with LDL‐C lowering, such as medication adherence and polypharmacy.

Management of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels across the continuum of ASCVD risk to prevent first and subsequent cardiovascular events. PCSK9 indicates proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.

Non–LDL‐C targets, such as lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, pose a residual risk of ASCVD and should also be addressed. Emerging therapies targeting lipoprotein(a) include small interfering RNAs, olpasiran and SLN360, and an antisense oligonucleotide, pelacarsen, which has also been reported to reduce lipoprotein(a) by up to 80% while modestly reducing LDL‐C in phase 2 studies, Evinacumab and the antisense oligonucleotide, olezarsen (IONIS‐APOCIII‐LRx), are being investigated for the reduction of triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins. However, a comprehensive discussion of these novel agents is beyond the scope of this review.

### The off-treatment effects of olpasiran on lipoprotein (a) lowering: OCEAN (a)-DOSE extension period results [^3aba8a05]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA), blocks lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) production by preventing translation of apolipoprotein(a) mRNA. In phase 2, higher doses of olpasiran every 12 weeks (Q12W) reduced circulating Lp(a) by > 95%.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the timing of return of Lp(a) to baseline after discontinuation of olpasiran, as well as longer-term safety.

Methods

OCEAN(a)-DOSE (Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events And LipoproteiN[a] Reduction-DOSE Finding Study) was a phase 2, dose-finding trial that enrolled 281 participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L to 1 of 4 active doses of olpasiran vs placebo (10 mg, 75 mg, 225 mg Q12W, or an exploratory dose of 225 mg Q24W given subcutaneously). The last dose of olpasiran was administered at week 36; after week 48, there was an extended off-treatment follow-up period for a minimum of 24 weeks.

Results

A total of 276 (98.2%) participants entered the off-treatment follow-up period. The median study exposure (treatment combined with off-treatment phases) was 86 weeks (Q1-Q3: 79–99 weeks). For the 75 mg Q12W dose, the off-treatment placebo-adjusted mean percent change from baseline in Lp(a) was -76.2%, -53.0%, -44.0%, and -27.9% at 60, 72, 84, and 96 weeks, respectively (all P < 0.001). The respective off-treatment changes in Lp(a) for the 225 mg Q12W dose were -84.4%, -61.6%, -52.2%, and -36.4% (all P < 0.001). During the extension follow-up phase, no new safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions

Olpasiran is a potent siRNA with prolonged effects on Lp(a) lowering. Participants receiving doses ≥ 75 mg Q12W sustained a ∼40% to 50% reduction in Lp(a) levels close to 1 year after the last dose.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein (a): a review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^afa77238]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Pelacarsen is an ASO that targets the apo(a) messenger RNA and leads to its destruction via ribonuclease H. Phase 2 clinical trial evidence demonstrates a dose‐dependent and up to 80% reduction in Lp(a) with pelacarsen among individuals with Lp(a) > 60 mg/dL and a history of ASCVD, where more than 4 in 5 were taking a statin, one‐half were on ezetimibe, and 1 in 5 were on PCSK9 monoclonal antibody therapy. Pelacarsen is administered via subcutaneous injection and is currently being studied as a monthly 80 mg dose in the Lp(a) HORIZON trial.

Olpasiran is an siRNA therapy that also targets apo(a) messenger RNA and leads to its destruction via RNA‐induced silencing complex. In the OCEAN(a)‐Dose Phase 2 clinical trial, olpasiran led to a mean 70% to 100% reduction in Lp(a) among persons with Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L and a history of ASCVD. Olpasiran is also dosed subcutaneously and is currently being studied as an injection every 3 months in the OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes trial. Similar to olpasiran, lepodisiran is a siRNA therapy that led to a maximal median reduction in Lp(a) level of > 90% over 1 year with a single dose. The ACCLAIM trial is currently enrolling participants with Lp(a) > 175 nmol/L with existing ASCVD, FH or a combination of risk factors. An additional siRNA that targets apo(a) and is currently being investigated is zerlasiran. Beyond subcutaneous therapy, muvalaplin is an oral Lp(a)‐lowering agent that prevents the assembly of Lp(a) in the liver and is associated with a maximum 86% reduction in Lp(a) in Phase 2 clinical trial data.

Beyond Lp(a)‐lowering, siRNA therapies targeting Lp(a) have been shown to lower levels of oxidised phospholipids on ApoB. While targeted Lp(a)‐lowering therapies have minimal effect on inflammatory biomarkers, evidence from phase 2 trials demonstrates a dose‐dependent reduction with interleukin‐6 inhibition and Lp(a) lowering. These results further support the role that inflammation may modulate levels of Lp(a), as there is an interleukin‐6 response element within the promoter region of the LPA gene.

### Fixed-dose combination therapy for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [^fb70a657]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet ASCVD risk factor control and secondary prevention rates remain low. A fixed-dose combination of blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering and antiplatelet treatments into a single pill, or polypill, has been proposed as one strategy to reduce the global burden of ASCVD.

Objectives

To determine the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy on all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal ASCVD events, and adverse events. We also sought to determine the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy on blood pressure, lipids, adherence, discontinuation rates, health-related quality of life, and costs.

Search Methods

We updated our previous searches in September 2016 of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and DARE, HTA, and HEED. We also searched two clinical trials registers in September 2016. We used no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of a fixed-dose combination therapy including at least one blood pressure-lowering and one lipid-lowering component versus usual care, placebo, or an active drug comparator for any treatment duration in adults 18 years old or older, with no restrictions on presence or absence of pre-existing ASCVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data for this update. We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect models when heterogeneity was low (I² < 50%) and random-effects models when heterogeneity was high (I² ≥ 50%). We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the quality of evidence.

Main Results

In the initial review, we identified nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants and four additional trials (n = 2012 participants; mean age range 62 to 63 years; 30% to 37% women) were included in this update. Eight of the 13 trials evaluated the effects of fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapy in populations without prevalent ASCVD, and the median follow-up ranged from six weeks to 23 months. More recent trials were generally larger with longer follow-up and lower risk of bias. The main risk of bias was related to lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was inherent to the intervention. Compared with the comparator groups (placebo, usual care, or active drug comparator), the effects of the fixed-dose combination treatment on mortality (FDC = 1.0% versus control = 1.0%, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.89, I² = 0%, 5 studies, N = 5300) and fatal and non-fatal ASCVD events (FDC = 4.7% versus control = 3.7%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66, I² = 0%, 6 studies, N = 4517) were uncertain (low-quality evidence). The low event rates for these outcomes and indirectness of evidence for comparing fixed-dose combination to usual care versus individual drugs suggest that these results should be viewed with caution. Adverse events were common in both the intervention (32%) and comparator (27%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed-dose combination therapy being 16% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25, 11 studies, 6906 participants, moderate-quality evidence) more likely to report an adverse event. The mean differences in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms was -6.34 mmHg (95% CI -9.03 to -3.64, 13 trials, 7638 participants, moderate-quality evidence). The mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were -0.61 mmol/L (95% CI -0.88 to -0.35, 11 trials, 6565 participants, low-quality evidence) and -0.70 mmol/L (95% CI -0.98 to -0.41, 12 trials, 7153 participants, moderate-quality evidence), respectively. There was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in comparisons of blood pressure and lipids (I² ≥ 80% for all) that could not be explained, so these results should be viewed with caution. Fixed-dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multidrug strategy by 44% (26% to 65%) compared with usual care (4 trials, 3835 participants, moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on all-cause mortality or ASCVD events are uncertain. A limited number of trials reported these outcomes, and the included trials were primarily designed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events, which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials. Fixed-dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, active comparator, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen. Ongoing, longer-term trials of fixed-dose combination therapy will help demonstrate whether short-term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes.

Atherogenic cholesterol lowering — statin therapy and risk factor management emphasizes that moderate- and high-intensity statins are reasonable for most patients, while in hypercholesterolemic patients who are statin intolerant, alternate atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drugs or alternative statin dosing regimens may need to be considered; nonlipid atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus, and therapies to lower cholesterol will reduce ASCVD risk even in the presence of other risk factors, with identified risk factors requiring management to maximize ASCVD risk reduction.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Lp(a) has emerged as a critical yet underrecognised cardiovascular risk factor, with robust evidence demonstrating a causal link between elevated levels and cardiovascular disease. Unlike traditional lipid markers, Lp(a) levels are predominantly genetically determined, relatively stable throughout life and minimally influenced by lifestyle factors. These unique characteristics make Lp(a) an important risk factor for lifelong cardiovascular risk stratification. Importantly, elevated Lp(a) identifies a subset of high‐risk individuals who may remain undetected using conventional risk assessment tools. Effective management in such cases includes optimising traditional risk factors, evaluating for subclinical atherosclerosis, considering statin therapy and, in some instances, exploring the use of PCSK9 inhibitors and aspirin. Given these insights, there is a strong case for routine Lp(a) testing, particularly among high‐risk groups such as individuals with premature ASCVD, a family history of cardiovascular disease, recurrent cardiovascular events despite optimal therapy and populations with inherently higher Lp(a) levels, including those of African and South Asian ancestry. Routine testing would enable earlier identification of at‐risk individuals and inform personalised preventive strategies.

Looking ahead, further research is essential to close existing knowledge gaps. Large‐scale trials such as Lp(a) HORIZON (pelacarsen), OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes (olpasiran) and ACCLAIM (lepodisiran) are poised to provide critical data on whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events. As these and other studies progress, they will play a pivotal role in shaping future guidelines, advancing Lp(a)‐targeted therapies, and ultimately, transforming cardiovascular risk management.

### A review of polypills for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^90c82b16]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a prevalent chronic condition managed through pharmacotherapy targeting modifiable risk factors. However, ASCVD patients often face poor medication adherence due to a high pill burden from multiple oral drugs, contributing to cardiovascular events. Recent evidence indicates that polypills combining antihypertensive and statin medications effectively control risk factors and improve adherence in various ASCVD risk patients. Randomized clinical trials demonstrate polypill efficacy in reducing major cardiovascular events, making them a convenient strategy for both established ASCVD patients and those without ASCVD. These positive results encourage the incorporation of polypills into comprehensive cardiovascular prevention programs, particularly for socio-economically vulnerable populations. Nevertheless, barriers remain, such as unclear regulatory approval pathways and physician hesitancy. Despite challenges, the benefits of fixed-dose combinations are evident and should be encouraged for secondary and primary prevention, especially in high-risk categories. Technological advancements could further support the successful integration of polypills in clinical practice. This review discusses the evidence, challenges, and perspectives of polypills, emphasizing their potential impact on cardiovascular disease management.

### Age and aspirin dosing in secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^3e2e5e24]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, in patients with established ASCVD, there are no age‐related significant differences in cardiovascular events or in hospitalizations for bleeding requiring blood product transfusions between daily doses of aspirin of 81 mg or 325 mg. The optimal antithrombotic regimen in older patients with stable ASCVD according to age remains to be studied in properly powered randomized trials.

4.5 Targeted Lp(a)‐lowering therapeutics

The only Food and Drug Administration approved therapy for Lp(a) lowering is apheresis for individuals with clinical ASCVD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia with Lp(a) ≥ 60 mg/dL and LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid‐lowering therapy. While there is currently no approved Lp(a)‐lowering pharmacotherapy, there are three notable ongoing Phase 3 ASCVD outcome trials involving Lp(a)‐lowering therapy (Table 3). The Lp(a) HORIZON and OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes trials exclusively enrolled individuals with prevalent ASCVD, whereas the ACCLAIM trial includes those with and without clinical ASCVD. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), pelacarsen, is being evaluated in the Lp(a)HORIZON trial, and siRNA agents are being assessed in the OCEAN(a) (olpasiran) and ACCLAIM Trials (lepodisiran).

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^efb5fedd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### An open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of olpasiran in Chinese participants with elevated serum lipoprotein (a) [^c7e97f70]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of premature mortality and disability worldwide, with China ranking among the highest in CVD deaths. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a circulating lipoprotein particle that, when elevated, may increase CVD risk. Reduced Lp(a) levels with existing cardiovascular treatments are modest, and evidence confirming whether lowering Lp(a) leads to cardiovascular benefit is lacking. Olpasiran (AMG 890), a liver cell-targeting small interfering RNA, has been shown to elicit profound Lp(a) reductions with an acceptable safety profile and is being evaluated in clinical trials worldwide. Therefore, investigating olpasiran's treatment potential for cardiovascular risk reduction in the Chinese population is important.

Participants and Methods

This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study in Chinese participants with elevated serum Lp(a). Participants with serum Lp(a) concentrations ≥ 70 nmol/L (or approximately ≥ 27 mg/dL) were randomized 1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous dose of olpasiran (75 or 225 mg). Olpasiran pharmacokinetic (PK) results were the primary endpoints; treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, lipids, and serum Lp(a) concentrations were the secondary endpoints.

Results

Twenty-four participants (12 per dose group) were randomized, and 23 participants completed the study. After reaching maximal serum concentrations (75 mg: 167 ng/mL; 225 mg: 667 ng/mL) in ∼3 hours, olpasiran concentrations in both groups declined rapidly and were predominantly cleared from circulation within 3 days. Sustained reductions in Lp(a) concentrations from baseline were observed for both doses, with maximal reductions seen on day 57 (75 mg: -94.8%; 225 mg: -99.2%). All TEAEs associated with olpasiran were mild/moderate in severity, with four participants in the 225 mg dose group experiencing five mild TEAEs at the injection site. No notable treatment- or dose-related trends in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations, or lipid panel results were identified, and no TEAEs leading to discontinuation or deaths were reported.

Discussion

Results from this study, as well as previous studies, indicate that olpasiran effectively and safely reduces Lp(a) levels in a similar manner across different ethnic populations.

Conclusions

Olpasiran administration (75 and 225 mg) was safe and well-tolerated in Chinese participants, and olpasiran PK and Lp(a) responses are generally consistent with those observed in East Asian/non-East Asian participants. Dose adjustments of olpasiran based on ethnicity are therefore not warranted, and work investigating the effects of olpasiran treatment on long-term cardiovascular risk in East Asian populations should continue.

### Small interfering RNA to reduce lipoprotein (a) in cardiovascular disease [^f3da06d3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lipoprotein(a) is a presumed risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Olpasiran is a small interfering RNA that reduces lipoprotein(a) synthesis in the liver.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial involving patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a lipoprotein(a) concentration of more than 150 nmol per liter. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of olpasiran (10 mg every 12 weeks, 75 mg every 12 weeks, 225 mg every 12 weeks, or 225 mg every 24 weeks) or matching placebo, administered subcutaneously. The primary end point was the percent change in the lipoprotein(a) concentration from baseline to week 36 (reported as the placebo-adjusted mean percent change). Safety was also assessed.

Results

Among the 281 enrolled patients, the median concentration of lipoprotein(a) at baseline was 260.3 nmol per liter, and the median concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 67.5 mg per deciliter. At baseline, 88% of the patients were taking statin therapy, 52% were taking ezetimibe, and 23% were taking a proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor. At 36 weeks, the lipoprotein(a) concentration had increased by a mean of 3.6% in the placebo group, whereas olpasiran therapy had significantly and substantially reduced the lipoprotein(a) concentration in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in placebo-adjusted mean percent changes of -70.5% with the 10-mg dose, -97.4% with the 75-mg dose, -101.1% with the 225-mg dose administered every 12 weeks, and -100.5% with the 225-mg dose administered every 24 weeks (P < 0.001 for all comparisons with baseline). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar across the trial groups. The most common olpasiran-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, primarily pain.

Conclusions

Olpasiran therapy significantly reduced lipoprotein(a) concentrations in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Longer and larger trials will be necessary to determine the effect of olpasiran therapy on cardiovascular disease. (Funded by Amgen; OCEAN[a]-DOSE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04270760.).

### Clinical trial design for lipoprotein (a)-lowering therapies: JACC focus seminar 2 / 3 [^8d645340]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a source of residual risk in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Clinical trials of fully human monoclonal antibodies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 have shown that reductions in Lp(a) concentrations may be a predictor of event reduction with this class of cholesterol-lowering therapy. With the advent of selective therapies targeting Lp(a) such as antisense oligonucleotides, small-interfering RNA-based therapies, and gene editing, lowering of Lp(a) may lead to reduction in ASCVD. The phase 3 Lp(a)HORIZON (Assessing the Impact of Lipoprotein(a) Lowering with TQJ230 on Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients With CVD) outcomes trial is currently testing the effect of pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide, on ASCVD risk. Olpasiran is a small-interfering RNA that is in a phase 3 clinical trial. As these therapies enter clinical trials, challenges in trial design will have to be addressed to optimize patient selection and outcomes.

### Olpasiran, oxidized phospholipids, and systemic inflammatory biomarkers: results from the OCEAN (a)-DOSE trial [^9f982050]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is thought to be the major carrier of oxidized phospholipids (OxPL). OxPL are believed to be a potent driver of inflammation and atherosclerosis. Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA, blocks Lp(a) production by inducing degradation of apolipoprotein(a) messenger RNA. Olpasiran's effects on OxPL and systemic markers of inflammation are not well described.

Objective

To assess the effects of olpasiran on OxPL, high-sensitivity interleukin 6 (hs-IL-6), and hs-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the OCEAN(a)-DOSE randomized clinical trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants

OCEAN(a)-DOSE was an international, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2, dose-finding randomized clinical trial conducted between July 2020 and November 2022. A total of 281 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) levels greater than 150 nmol/L were included.

Intervention

Participants were randomized to receive 1 of 4 active subcutaneous doses of olpasiran vs placebo: (1) 10 mg, administered every 12 weeks (Q12W); (2) 75 mg, Q12W; (3) 225 mg, Q12W; or (4) 225 mg, administered every 24 weeks (Q24W). OxPL on apolipoprotein B (OxPL-apoB), hs-CRP, and hs-IL-6 were assessed at baseline, week 36, and week 48 in 272 patients.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was placebo-adjusted change in OxPL-apoB from baseline to week 36.

Results

Among 272 participants, median (IQR) age was 62 years (56–69), and 86 participants (31.6%) were female. Baseline median (IQR) Lp(a) concentration was 260.3 nmol/L (198.1–352.4) and median (IQR) OxPL-apoB concentration was 26.5 nmol/L (19.7–33.9). The placebo-adjusted mean percentage change in OxPL-apoB from baseline to week 36 was -51.6% (95% CI, -64.9% to -38.2%) for the 10-mg Q12W dose, -89.7% (95% CI, -103.0% to -76.4%) for the 75-mg Q12W dose, -92.3% (95% CI, -105.6% to -78.9%) for the 225-mg Q12W dose, and -93.7% (95% CI, -107.1% to -80.3%) for the Q24W dose (P < .001 for all). These effects were maintained to week 48 (-50.8%, -100.2%, -104.7%, and -85.8%, respectively; P < .001 for all). There was a strong correlation between percentage reduction in Lp(a) and OxPL-apoB for patients treated with olpasiran (r = 0.79; P < .001). Olpasiran did not significantly impact hs-CRP or hs-IL-6 compared with placebo to weeks 36 or 48 (P > .05).

Conclusion and Relevance

In the OCEAN(a)-DOSE multicenter randomized clinical trial, olpasiran led to a significant and sustained reduction in OxPL-apoB but no significant effects on hs-CRP or hs-IL-6.

Inclisiran clinical considerations describe a mechanism of action targeting PCSK9 production and LDL receptor upregulation to reduce LDL-C, an approved role as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH or ASCVD) who require additional LDL-C lowering, a recommended dose of 284 mg administered by a health care professional as a single subcutaneous injection initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months thereafter, and twice a year dosing viewed as attractive for adherence but associated with large costs and additional administrative burdens with potential negative equity impacts; despite LDL-C reduction and FDA approval for lowering LDL-C, limited evidence prevented determining the balance of cardiovascular and mortality benefits versus harms, and longer-term cardiovascular outcomes trials are needed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Nonstatin therapies and BAS — Choice among nonstatin therapies should account for patient population and therapy attributes; considerations include the extent of available scientific evidence for net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit, safety and tolerability, potential for drug-drug interactions, efficacy of additional LDL-C lowering, cost, convenience and medication storage, pill burden, frequency and route of administration, potential to jeopardize adherence to evidence-based therapies, and, importantly, patient preferences. Before initiation of combination therapy or dose adjustments/additions, it is imperative for clinicians and patients to engage in a discussion addressing potential net benefit, absolute ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and potential harms, prescribing considerations, and patient preferences. BAS may be considered as an optional alternative agent for those with ezetimibe intolerance and with triglycerides < 300 mg/dL or due to patient preferences, but there is no evidence for a net cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of BAS in addition to statin therapy.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at very high risk — initial PCSK9 inhibitor selection and inclisiran use: At the current time, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody (PCSK9 mAb) is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice in view of its demonstrated safety, efficacy, and cardiovascular outcomes benefits in FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes. The ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are currently in progress and are anticipated to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those who may be unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran. There is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy in LDL-C lowering or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy with/without ezetimibe or bempedoic acid; therefore, if inclisiran is to be used, it should be used in place of a PCSK9 mAb. If a patient with clinical ASCVD at very high risk has a continued < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C ≥ 85 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe or other adjunctive nonstatin therapies, referral should be made to a lipid specialist and a RD/RDN. Percent LDL-C and absolute LDL-C and non–HDL-C reductions should be the primary treatment considerations for patients with clinical ASCVD at very high risk.

Race/ethnicity-based considerations — statin response, dosing, and trial data: The 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline states that it is reasonable for clinicians to consider race and ethnic features that can influence atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and to adjust the intensity of statin therapy accordingly, noting that whereas race and ethnicity are social constructs, patients with certain ancestries may have differential risks for serious adverse events (SAEs) and that higher rosuvastatin plasma levels have been reported in Japanese, Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian heritage compared with White individuals; in Japanese populations, ASCVD risk reduction was demonstrated with low-intensity pravastatin (10–20 mg daily) versus placebo, and in REAL-CAD, 13,054 Japanese patients randomized to high-dose (4 mg/day) versus low-dose (1 mg/day) pitavastatin had significantly reduced cardiovascular events; the guideline reported no differences in sensitivity to statin dosing in Hispanic/Latino-Americans and Black persons/African Americans versus non-Hispanic White Americans, and although studies report similar LDL-C–lowering efficacy of ezetimibe, alirocumab, and evolocumab regardless of race/ethnicity, minority under-representation means generalizability remains somewhat uncertain.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein (a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^f254834c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, investigational agents have shown promising lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects in clinical studies and several studies are ongoing (Table 4). Pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide currently in phase 3 development, showed lipoprotein(a) reductions of up to 80% in a phase 2 study of patients with established CVD and lipoprotein(a) levels ≥ 150 nmol/L. Adverse events in patients treated with pelacarsen were mostly mild or moderate, with injection‐site reactions the most commonly observed. Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA also in phase 3 development, demonstrated up to 101% placebo‐adjusted lipoprotein(a) reduction in patients with established ASCVD and lipoprotein(a) levels > 150 nmol/L. Similarly, zerlasiran, a small interfering RNA, showed up to 98% lipoprotein(a) reduction in a phase 1 study of adults with lipoprotein(a) levels ≥ 150 nmol/L and without known CVD. Both olpasiran and zerlasiran were generally well tolerated in clinical studies with mostly mild adverse events. Importantly, the potential for off‐target effects with small interfering RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides is generally considered to be low. The next steps for these agents will be to understand whether their lipoprotein(a)‐lowering effects will translate into a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events. Phase 3 trials are ongoing for pelacarsen and olpasiran, with outcome data expected in 2025 and 2026, respectively. An additional small interfering RNA, lepodisiran, is currently under investigation in a phase 2 study, as is muvalaplin, an oral small molecule inhibitor of lipoprotein(a); however, no results have been published to date for either of these agents.

Lp(a) as a target

Elevated Lp(a) levels are an ASCVD risk factor across numerous patient demographics and geographic ancestries, as well as in patients treated with statins and PCSK9 inhibitors. The Lp(a) particle resembles LDL, but is independently regulated and metabolized. Both niacin and serial apheresis treatments were previously recommended to reduce Lp(a) but each has significant drawbacks and neither reduced ASCVD events. PCSK9 inhibitors — both monoclonal antibodies and inclisiran — lower Lp(a) by 26%, but this is insufficient for individuals with very high Lp(a) levels. A GalNAc-linked ASO against Lp(a) (TQJ230, trade name pelacarsen, Novartis) reduces its levels by 80% to 90% with no effect on other variables; this agent is being evaluated in a large randomized of secondary prevention of ASCVD in individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels. An siRNA compound aimed at reducing apo(a) synthesis (AMG 890, trade name olpasiran, Amgen) is also under investigation. Depending on results of outcome trials, these agents could be helpful for patients with elevated Lp(a) levels.

### Biomarkers for cardiovascular-kidney metabolic syndrome: clinical utility in diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^c9584b88]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The paradigm by which Lp(a) informs treatment is evolving. Unlike lipids, Lp(a) levels are not modified by lifestyle interventions. Statins modestly increase Lp(a) but remain important for reduction in overall ASCVD risk. PCKS9 inhibitors have been shown to lower Lp(a) by 25–30% with greater reduction in ASCVD observed in those with the highest Lp(a) levels. Given the pro‐thrombotic properties of Lp(a), aspirin may be considered in those with elevated Lp(a) although this has not been confirmed prospectively.

More recently, specific potent Lp(a) lowering therapies have been developed which include subcutaneous antisense oligonucleotides (pelcarsen) and silencing interfering RNA based agents (olpasiran, lepodisiran, zerlasiran) which inhibit hepatic production. Oral small molecules such as muvalaplin are also under evaluation. Lp(a) specific therapies are now being studied in several cardiovascular outcome trials (HORIZON, OCEAN and ACCLAIM) and the results of these studies will be pivotal in informing our understanding of whether Lp(a) lowering constitutes a modifiable cardiac risk factor. Furthermore, should these trials demonstrate the clinical benefit of Lp(a) directed therapies, the role of monitoring serial Lp(a) levels will warrant further exploration.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^e740b975]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

High levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are associated with greater risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 1 Approximately 85.6 million people in the United States have at least 1 type of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 2 An additional 45 million people in the United States have either a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (33 million) or a > 5% to 7.4% 10‐year risk of a cardiovascular event (12.8 million). 2 For patients at high risk for cardiovascular events or with ASCVD, statins are considered standard first‐line therapy to lower LDL‐C. The appropriate statin dose is important to effectively lower LDL‐C and therefore reduce the risk of ASCVD and cardiovascular events; however, not all patients are able to sufficiently lower their LDL‐C levels, even at the maximally tolerated statin dose. 1 Approximately 40% of patients are unable to adequately lower their LDL‐C levels despite high‐intensity statin therapy. 3 For these patients, treatment regimens may be modified to include a higher statin dose, a switch to a different statin, or combination therapy with other lipid‐lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, or, when appropriate, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

To evaluate longer-term efficacy and safety of evinacumab in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial included a 2-week screening period followed by a 16-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP) for subcutaneous regimens (evinacumab, 450 mg, once weekly [QW]; evinacumab, 300 mg, QW; evinacumab, 300 mg, every 2 weeks; or placebo QW) or a 24-week DBTP for intravenous regimens (evinacumab, 15 mg/kg, every 4 weeks [Q4W]; evinacumab, 5 mg/kg, Q4W; or placebo Q4W); a 48-week open-label treatment period (OLTP) for intravenous treatment only; and a 24-week follow-up period. Patients from 85 sites across 20 countries were recruited for the study; patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (defined as heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or established clinical ASCVD without familial hypercholesterolemia) who entered the 48-week OLTP were included. In addition, the patients' hypercholesterolemia was refractory to maximally tolerated LLTs.

Interventions

All patients entering the OLTP received evinacumab, 15 mg/kg, intravenously Q4W.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Efficacy outcomes included change in LDL-C level and other lipid/lipoprotein parameters from baseline to week 72 (end of the OLTP). Safety outcomes included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

Results

A total of 96 patients (mean [SD] age, 54.4 [11.3] years; 52 female [54.2%]) entered the OLTP, of whom 88 (91.7%) completed the OLTP. Mean (SD) baseline LDL-C level was 145.9 (55.2) mg/dL. At week 72, evinacumab, 15 mg/kg, reduced mean (SD) LDL-C level from baseline by 45.5% (28.7%) in the overall cohort. Evinacumab, 15 mg/kg, reduced mean (SD) apolipoprotein B (38.0% [22.1%]), non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (48.4% [23.2%]), total cholesterol (42.6% [17.5%]), and median (IQR) fasting triglyceride (57.2% [65.4%-44.4%]) levels at week 72 from baseline in the overall cohort. TEAEs occurred in 78 of 96 patients (81.3%). Serious TEAEs occurred in 9 of 96 patients (9.4%); all were considered unrelated to study treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia, evinacumab provided sustained reductions in LDL-C level and was generally well tolerated.

3.1 Maximally tolerated statin therapy

All current guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia in ASCVD risk reduction, including the 2013 ACC/AHA Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, 31 the 2016 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Non‐Statin Therapies for LDL‐Cholesterol Lowering in the Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk, NLA Recommendations for Patient‐Centered Management of Dyslipidemia: Part 1, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) 2017 Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia, uniformly recommend high‐intensity statin therapy for patients with clinical ASCVD, an untreated LDL‐C > 190 mg/dL, HeFH, or HoFH. 32, 33, 34, 35 Moderate‐intensity statin therapy may be considered in high‐risk patients if they are > 75 years of age, have a prior history of adverse effects on statin therapy, or there is a potential for statin‐drug interactions. Maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended prior to consideration of nonstatin therapies.

The fact that maximally tolerated statin therapy and statin intolerance are not well defined in available guidelines contributes significantly to provider and payer inconsistencies when physicians prescribe PCSK9 mab and other nonstatin agents. It is well recognized that following initiation of statin therapy, some individuals may experience unacceptable adverse effects, the most commonly reported being muscle‐related symptoms. Though there is not a universally accepted definition of statin intolerance, most experts make the diagnosis when patients experience intolerable symptoms that resolve with discontinuation of therapy and recur with rechallenge. Typically, at least 2 statins must be tried. 33 Although not studied in RCTs, when the lowest dose of multiple statins cannot be tolerated on a daily basis, alternative‐dosing strategies can be considered. Under such circumstances, many experts advocate using statins with long half‐lives administered 3 times per week, every other day, or even once per week. 33

3.1.1 Recommended definition 1

Maximally tolerated statin therapy is defined as the highest tolerated intensity and frequency of a statin, even if the dose is zero. This is preferably the guideline‐recommended intensity of statin, but may of necessity be a lower intensity dose or reduced frequency of statin dosing, or even no statin at all. Statin intolerance can be defined as unacceptable adverse effects that resolve with discontinuation of therapy and recur with rechallenge of 2 to 3 statins, preferably ones that use different metabolic pathways, with 1 of which being prescribed at the lowest approved dose. 33, 36

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 expert consensus — pre-treatment assessment and lifestyle measures: The clinician and patient should assess statin adherence by assessing the number of missed statin doses per month and evaluating any barriers to adherence. If an adherent patient has not been tried on a high-intensity statin, the dose should be increased to a high-intensity dose. Patients who are unable to tolerate even moderate-intensity statin therapy should be evaluated for statin intolerance and considered for referral to a lipid specialist. The clinician and patient should attempt to intensify lifestyle modifications and may consider the incorporation of soluble dietary fiber and phytosterols as part of this approach, and other major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, including tobacco use, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and obesity, should be addressed as needed and controlled as well.

Inhibitingfor Lipid Lowering

The interaction surface between PCSK9 and the epidermal growth‐factor‐like domain A in the LDLR is challenging to target pharmaceutically. The PCSK9 proteolytic site is not required for its interaction with the LDLR, suggesting that any small molecule inhibitors designed to antagonize PCSK9 catalytic activity would need to enter the endoplasmic reticulum to inhibit PCSK9 cleavage and would not affect the extracellular PCSK9–LDLR interaction.

Antibodies to reversibly neutralize extracellular PCSK9 were shown to successfully disrupt the PCSK9−LDLR interaction and to reduce LDLR degradation in proof‐of‐concept in vitro and animal studies. Following promising results in mice and nonhuman primates,2 anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, alirocumab and evolocumab, were evaluated in clinical trials. These demonstrated LDL‐C reductions of up to 60% to 70%, and in patients with a history of ASCVD, an ≈15% relative reduction in cardiovascular event risk versus standard of care when added to maximally tolerated statins, and were the first approved therapies targeting PCSK9 (Box 1).,

In addition to LDL‐C lowering, anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies reduce levels of lipoprotein (a) (LP(a)), an LDL‐like particle identified as an independent, causal, genetically determined ASCVD risk factor, by ≈25% in clinical trial populations not enriched for patients with elevated Lp(a). There are currently no approved therapies to treat elevated Lp(a), but RNA‐targeted therapies that reduce Lp(a) by inhibiting the synthesis of apolipoprotein(a) are in clinical development, including the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen and the siRNA therapies olpasiran, zerlasiran (SLN360), and lepodisiran (LY3819469).

Despite high rates of adherence to prescribed anti‐PSCK9 monoclonal antibodies in clinical trials, evidence from registry studies has demonstrated poor clinical uptake of anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and high rates of discontinuation in real‐world clinical practice. One study reported that < 1% of patients with dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, or coronary heart disease were prescribed anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies in the United States between 2015 and 2017. Potential historical reasons for poor uptake include burden of self‐administration, high cost, and complex prior authorization processes. Registry studies suggest that up to ≈80% of people with ASCVD are not at LDL‐C goals despite the availability of anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and other oral LLTs, suggesting there remains an unmet need for additional LLTs and strategies to improve patient access to existing LLTs.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^a77b52f7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — NLA definition and recommendations for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk management define statin intolerance as adverse effects that resolve or improve with dose reduction or discontinuation, with complete inability to tolerate any dose or partial intolerance, and to classify a patient a minimum of two statins should have been attempted including at least one at the lowest approved daily dosage; for patients demonstrating non-adherence or lack of persistence with statin therapy, statin intolerance should be evaluated as a potential contributing factor (class I, level B-R). For patients with suspected statin intolerance, clinicians should attempt multiple strategies to identify a tolerable statin regimen (e.g., lower dose, switching statins, non-daily dosing), because complete statin intolerance is uncommon (< 5% of patients) (class I, level B-R). When non-statin therapies are used, those with data from randomized trials showing reduced cardiovascular event risk should be favored (class I, level A). For patients with known or suspected statin intolerance who are at high- or very-high ASCVD risk, non-statin therapy should be considered while additional attempts are made to identify a tolerable statin regimen to avoid excessive delay in lowering atherogenic lipoproteins (class IIa, level B-R). For patients with statin intolerance, it is reasonable to consider the nocebo effect as a possible cause; however, this does not make such symptoms less clinically relevant and ASCVD risk related to elevated atherogenic lipoproteins should be addressed (class IIa, level A). For patients with complete or partial statin intolerance, it is reasonable to consider non-statin therapy to assist in lowering atherogenic lipoproteins (class IIa, level A).

Very high-risk ASCVD — rapid intensification using combination therapy: It may be reasonable to consider the simultaneous addition of 2 agents to reduce the risk of recurrent events more rapidly, and options may include either combination therapy with high-intensity or maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe or maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe and a PCSK9 mAb.

### The promise of PCSK9 and lipoprotein (a) as targets for gene silencing therapies [^09333950]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

High plasma concentrations of LDL and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) are independent and causal risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). There is an unmet therapeutic need for high-risk patients with elevated levels of LDL-C and/or Lp(a). Recent advances in the development of nucleic acids for gene silencing (ie, triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated antisense-oligonucleotides [ASOs] and small interfering RNA [siRNA]) targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and Lp(a) offer effective and sustainable therapies.

Methods

Related articles in the English language were identified through a search for original and review articles in the PubMed database using the following key terms: cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, PCSK9 inhibitors, Lp(a), LDL-cholesterol, familial hypercholesterolemia, siRNA, and antisense oligonucleotide and clinical trials (either alone or in combination).

Findings

Inclisiran, the most advanced siRNA-treatment targeting hepatic PCSK9, is well tolerated, producing a > 30% reduction on LDL-C levels in randomized controlled trials. Pelacarsen is the most clinical advanced ASO, whereas olpasiran and SLN360 are the 2 siRNAs directed against the mRNA of the LPA gene. Evidence suggests that all Lp(a)-targeting agents are safe and well tolerated, with robust and sustained reduction in plasma Lp(a) concentration up to 70% to 90% in individuals with elevated Lp(a) levels.

Implications

Cumulative evidence from clinical trials supports the value of ASO and siRNA therapies targeting the synthesis of PCSK9 and Lp(a) for lowering LDL-C and Lp(a) in patients with established ASCVD or high risk of ASCVD. Further research is needed to examine whether gene silencing therapy could improve clinical outcomes in patients with elevated LDL and/or Lp(a) levels. Confirmation of the tolerability and cost-effectiveness of long-term inhibition of PCSK9 and Lp(a) with this approach is essential.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^44f73ad5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

### Preclinical development and phase 1 trial of a novel siRNA targeting lipoprotein (a) [^d4ac90a9]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Compelling evidence supports a causal role for lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in cardiovascular disease. No pharmacotherapies directly targeting Lp(a) are currently available for clinical use. Here we report the discovery and development of olpasiran, a first-in-class, synthetic, double-stranded, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA) designed to directly inhibit LPA messenger RNA translation in hepatocytes and potently reduce plasma Lp(a) concentration. Olpasiran reduced Lp(a) concentrations in transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys in a dose-responsive manner, achieving up to over 80% reduction from baseline for 5–8 weeks after administration of a single dose. In a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of olpasiran (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03626662), the primary outcome was safety and tolerability, and the secondary outcomes were the change in Lp(a) concentrations and olpasiran pharmacokinetic parameters. Participants tolerated single doses of olpasiran well and experienced a 71–97% reduction in Lp(a) concentration with effects persisting for several months after administration of doses of 9mg or higher. Serum concentrations of olpasiran increased approximately dose proportionally. Collectively, these results validate the approach of using hepatocyte-targeted siRNA to potently lower Lp(a) in individuals with elevated plasma Lp(a) concentration.

Figure 2
Impact of LLT on the proportion of patients with ASCVD per LDL‐C range. Baseline LDL‐C level was reported in 5109 patients, and LDL‐C level following LLT initiation in 6453 patients. Percentages of patients per LDL‐C range are provided.

Among patients receiving LLT, there were 3726 patients with paired LDL‐C values at baseline versus following LLT initiation (Figure 3A). The average treatment duration for these patients was 5 years (mean ± SEM duration of 1896 ± 23 days). They were prescribed a mean ± SEM of 1.50 ± 0.01 molecules (per patient) during this period, including a mean ± SEM of 0.35 ± 0.01 up‐titrations (not shown). The treatment with LLT resulted in a significant decrease in LDL‐C levels (reduced by −33%, from 125.96 ± 0.90 to 84.51 ± 0.60 mg/dL; p < 0.0001). Despite the improvement in LDL‐C levels, only 12.7% (472/3726) of patients with ASCVD were at goal, as defined by LDL‐C levels < 55 mg/dL and an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% versus baseline (Figure 3A).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Nonstatin LDL-cholesterol therapy sequencing and thresholds — It is reasonable to engage in a clinician-patient discussion regarding a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (mAb), including administration by subcutaneous injection and the every 14-day or monthly dosing schedule. In some patients with clinical ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL who require greater LDL-C reduction than any additional agent alone can expect to achieve, it may be reasonable to consider the simultaneous addition of 2 agents. If additional LDL-C lowering is desired (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL) after addition of ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 mAb, it is reasonable to engage in discussion of bempedoic acid; considerations include a mean expected reduction of approximately 17%, and bempedoic acid should be used in caution with patients who have a history of gout or tendon rupture. At the current time, a PCSK9 mAb is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice; the ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are anticipated to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those who may be unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran. There is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy in LDL-C lowering or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran; therefore, if inclisiran is to be used, it should be in place of a PCSK9 mAb. If a patient has a continued < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin with or without ezetimibe and/or bempedoic acid and is considered for prescription of inclisiran, referral should be made to a lipid specialist, and if combination statin and nonstatin therapy with ezetimibe, PCSK9 mAb, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran has been attempted and the patient still meets these thresholds, the writing committee recommends referral to a lipid specialist and RD/RDN.

### Aspirin and cardiovascular risk in individuals with elevated lipoprotein (a): the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^f467226b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Importantly, there is currently no approved medical therapy for treating lipoprotein(a)‐mediated risk, but there is evidence that targeting lipoprotein(a) may result in a reduction in CVD risk. Statins increase lipoprotein(a) 10% to 25%, and CVD risk remains in statin‐treated patients with elevated lipoprotein(a). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors achieve modest lowering of lipoprotein(a), and secondary analyses of clinical trials suggest that this results in a reduction in events, but this has not been assessed in primary prevention, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are not approved for the indication of elevated lipoprotein(a). Antisense oligonucleotides and short interfering RNA produce potent lipoprotein(a) lowering and are in clinical development, including 2 ongoing phase 3 secondary prevention clinical trials, Lp(a) HORIZON (NCT04023552) and OCEAN(a) is Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events and Lipoprotein(a) Reduction ‐ Outcomes Trial (NCT05581303). However, there are no ongoing trials for the use of these drugs in primary prevention. Our study suggests a benefit to aspirin therapy for primary prevention of CHD in people with elevated lipoprotein(a).

### Applying contemporary antithrombotic therapy in the secondary prevention of chronic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^b1d1e29a]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

For 4 decades, antithrombotic therapy with aspirin has been a cornerstone of secondary prevention for patients with chronic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Unfortunately, despite the use of evidence-based therapies, patients with ASCVD continue to have recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, and stroke-at a rate of approximately 2%-4% per year. To combat this continuing risk, several recent trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of more intensive antithrombotic strategies through prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), combining a P2Y12 receptor antagonists and low-dose aspirin, or alternatively applying a dual pathway inhibition approach, combining low-dose non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant and low-dose aspirin. Both combination strategies have been shown to reduce recurrent ischemic events but at the cost of increased bleeding events. The clinical application of these antithrombotic strategies requires clinicians to assess and balance the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in an individual patient. Furthermore, clinicians may also need to adapt their antithrombotic strategies to achieve best patient outcomes, as ASCVD is a progressive disease and the risks of cardiovascular ischemic and bleeding events may shift over time. This state-of-the-art article reviews evidence from the trials and provides a practical approach to the application of DAPT and dual pathway antithrombotic therapy in the long-term management of patients with chronic ASCVD.

Inclisiran

Inclisiran is a first‐in‐class small interfering RNA that uses RNA interference to degrade PCSK9 mRNA, reducing the hepatic synthesis of PCSK9 protein and thereby increasing hepatic LDL receptor expression. It is administered by a health care professional, twice yearly, as a subcutaneous injection, following initial doses at baseline and 3 months. Inclisiran received US Food and Drug Administration approval in December 2021 for the treatment of HeFH or ASCVD as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statins. Practical points on the use of inclisiran are summarized in Figure 3.

The magnitude of LDL‐C lowering with inclisiran is ≈50%, slightly less than the levels achieved with anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies and greater than for bempedoic acid as monotherapy and in combination with ezetimibe. A pooled analysis of phase 3 studies of inclisiran involving patients with HeFH (ORION‐9 trial) or ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents (ORION‐10 and ORION‐11 trials) receiving maximally tolerated statins, with or without ezetimibe, showed that inclisiran reduced LDL‐C levels by 50.7% (95% CI, 48.4%–52.9%; P < 0.0001) versus placebo. Similar to the anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, in addition to reducing LDL‐C, inclisiran was shown to modestly lower lipoprotein(a) and triglyceride levels (median reductions of 19.5% and 13.3%, respectively). LDL‐C lowering was shown to be consistent across a range of statin doses, and safety was similar between treatment groups, although treatment‐emergent events at the injection site were more frequent with inclisiran than with placebo (5.0% versus 0.7%; risk ratio, 7.54 [95% CI, 4.14–13.71]). Other clinical studies have shown that inclisiran is well tolerated; analyses of patients with kidney impairment from the ORION‐1 and ORION‐7 trials concluded that dose adjustment of inclisiran is not required in this population. Moreover, the ORION‐6 trial reported that inclisiran was well tolerated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, although patient numbers were low. Clinical studies of inclisiran are summarized in Table 3.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^f775dd3f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — non-statin therapy options and outcome evidence: Inability to tolerate low doses of 3–4 statins, or not achieving lipid goals on suboptimal statin dosing, is often sufficient to justify initiation of treatment with non-statin therapies. Other non-statin drugs have been proven to reduce cardiovascular events as either monotherapy (cholestyramine, niacin, gemfibrozil), and among these options, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibiting monoclonal antibodies are proven to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. In addition, niacin monotherapy reduced ASCVD events in men with ASCVD, but not in combination with statins. The LDL-C-lowering efficacy is modest, but cholestyramine monotherapy is also proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In some patients treatment with fenofibrate may produce modest LDL-C lowering, but fibrates are primarily indicated for triglyceride-lowering and lack solid evidence of cardiovascular benefit. Management emphasizes achieving LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals while sequentially adding non-statin therapies, because the consequences of not achieving lipid goals are progression of ASCVD and occurrence of cardiovascular events.

Evidence for the Underuse of Lipid‐Lowering Therapies in Clinical Practice

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL‐C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline‐recommended LDL‐C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of > 600 000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid‐lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL‐C goals. A retrospective cohort study of ≈1.5 million patients with a history of ≥ 1 major ASCVD event reported that > 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high‐risk criteria had LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low‐Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a 2‐year period, two‐thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL‐C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received treatment intensification. Recently, an interim report of the European SANTORINI (Treatment of High and Very High Risk Dyslipidemic Patients for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Europe: A Multinational Observational Study) to assess the management of high‐risk and very high‐risk patients after publication of the ESC/EAS 2019 guidelines showed that combination therapy was used in just 27.3% of patients, of whom 17.1% received statin plus ezetimibe, and 4.1% received an anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibody plus oral lipid‐lowering therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) multimorbidity — selected conditions impact ASCVD risk and treatment decisions as follows: Multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs) or recent MI (within the past 2 years) increases ASCVD risk with potential benefit from more aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering; polyvascular ASCVD increases ASCVD risk with potential benefit from more aggressive LDL-C lowering, and more potent antithrombotic strategies and lipid management may improve limb outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD); familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) increases ASCVD risk with potential benefit from more aggressive LDL-C lowering; chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases ASCVD risk, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) can decrease ASCVD risk and CKD progression, and medication doses may need adjustment; diabetes increases ASCVD risk and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and/or SGLT2i therapy can lower ASCVD risk; atrial fibrillation (AF) increases stroke risk, and clinicians should consider embolic risk and select an appropriate anticoagulation dose; heart failure (HF) increases risk of HF hospitalizations and SGLT2i can lower ASCVD risk and HF hospitalizations; safety modifiers include CKD — CKD risk increases with age, certain SGLT2i decrease ASCVD risk and CKD progression, and medication doses may need adjustment; frailty or fall risk may necessitate discontinuation of anticoagulants; and age — ASCVD and CKD risk increase with age with possible medication dose adjustments; competing risks include osteoarthritis — exercise ability may be impaired, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affect blood pressure and HF management and increase bleeding risk when given with anticoagulants; malignancy treatment may have an impact on heart disease; and liver disease may require dose adjustments.

### Lipoprotein (a) and its significance in cardiovascular disease: a review [^de768117]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-like particle bound to apolipoprotein(a). This novel marker of cardiovascular disease acts through induction of vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, calcification, and thrombosis. While an absolute risk threshold remains to be universally accepted, an estimated 20% to 25% of the global population have Lp(a) levels of 50 mg/dL or higher, a level noted by the European Atherosclerosis Society to confer increased cardiovascular risk.

Observations

Compelling evidence from pathophysiological, observational, and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between high Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and calcific aortic valve stenosis. Additional evidence has demonstrated that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with a residual cardiovascular risk despite traditional risk factor optimization, including LDL cholesterol reduction. These findings have led to the formulation of the Lp(a) hypothesis, namely that Lp(a) lowering leads to cardiovascular risk reduction, intensifying the search for Lp(a)-reducing therapies. The ineffectiveness of lifestyle modification, statins, and ezetimibe to lower Lp(a); the modest Lp(a) reduction with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors; the adverse effect profile and unclear cardiovascular benefit of pharmacotherapies such as niacin and mipomersen; and the impracticality of regular lipoprotein apheresis represent major challenges to currently available therapies. Nevertheless, emerging nucleic acid-based therapies, such as the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen and the small interfering RNA olpasiran, are generating interest because of their potent Lp(a)-lowering effects. Assessment of new-onset diabetes in patients achieving very low Lp(a) levels will be important in future trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Epidemiologic and genetic studies suggest a potentially causal association between elevated Lp(a) levels, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and aortic valve stenosis. Emerging nucleic acid-based therapies have potent Lp(a)-lowering effects and appear safe; phase 3 trials will establish whether they improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### PCSK9 inhibitors in lipid management of patients with diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk: a review [^6aa5e549]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are well established to be associated with the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), defined as acute coronary syndrome, a history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease (all presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin). 1 ASCVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes mellitus. 2 Individuals with diabetes mellitus and elevated levels of LDL‐C are at higher absolute risk of cardiovascular disease compared with those with high LDL‐C without diabetes mellitus. 3 Statin therapy is recommended as the first‐line lipid‐lowering drug therapy for the management of dyslipidemia in individuals with diabetes mellitus (unless contraindicated) in current major US guidelines and recommendations (summarized in Table S1). 1, 2, 4, 5 However, some patients with high cardiovascular risk either do not achieve adequate LDL‐C reductions on statins, or are intolerant to statins and therefore receive suboptimal statin doses or discontinue statin therapy, and thus remain at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For such patients, additional and/or alternative nonstatin lipid‐lowering treatment options should be considered. 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^55bb5505]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment "targets" vs "thresholds".

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts, and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations (ie, European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology) have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on guideline organization, and some for a treatment "intensification threshold" (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society). The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead to providers possibly back-titrating the dose or even deprescribing medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value, and did not aim for a specific target level: some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials, and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

### Discovery of potent small-molecule inhibitors of lipoprotein (a) formation [^dd155453]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

At present, there are no therapeutics available in clinical practice that specifically reduce the levels of Lp(a) by itself. Pelacarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide that targets LPA, and olpasiran, an LPA small interfering RNA, are both injectable therapeutics that are currently in phase 3 clinical studies. These interventions have shown a robust Lp(a)-lowering effect, with good tolerability. Results from ongoing phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trials, such as HORIZON and OCEAN(a), will provide much-needed evidence about the therapeutic utility of Lp(a)-lowering treatments. So far, no small molecule that specifically targets apo(a) has been studied in humans; however, the plasminogen inhibitor tranexamic acid was found to reduce the levels of Lp(a) in a small clinical study. The goal of our research was to develop a potent and selective orally delivered small-molecule therapeutic to inhibit the formation of Lp(a) by blocking the first interaction between apo(a) and apoB to reduce the circulating levels of Lp(a). A potent and selective small-molecule Lp(a)-reducing therapeutic could provide a way to decrease the number of primary and/or secondary major adverse cardiovascular events in patients who are at risk of cardiovascular disease because of their high levels of Lp(a).

PCSK9 inhibitor selection and inclisiran use — At the present time, a PCSK9 mAb is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice in view of its demonstrated safety, efficacy, and benefits for cardiovascular outcomes, and the ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are underway with completion anticipated in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran; there is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran when added to statin therapy, so if inclisiran is to be used, it should be used in place of a PCSK9 mAb.

### Lipoprotein (a) and the risk for recurrent Ischemic stroke events [^134eedec]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Determination of whether lowering Lp(a) reduces stroke risk awaits completion of the HORIZON (Randomized Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Trial Assessing the Impact of Lipoprotein (a) Lowering With Pelacarsen [TQJ230] on Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Established Cardiovascular Disease;). This trial enrolled very high-risk patients with either ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. In contrast, the OCEAN(a) Outcomes Trial (Olpasiran Trials of Cardiovascular Events and Lipoprotein(a) Reduction;), another trial of an Lp(a)-lowering therapy, is enrolling patients with coronary heart disease.

Until completion of clinical trials with Lp(a)-lowering therapies, we support screening for Lp(a) molar concentrations in adults with a stroke after resolution of the acute phase response as recommended by the American Heart Association. Interventions to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke events in these patients should include lifestyle modifications, control of cardiovascular risk factors, and lowering LDL-C < 55 mg/dL with a high-intensity statin. For stroke patients with an LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL despite taking maximally tolerated statin therapy who have an Lp(a) level > 125 nmol/L, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies could be considered based on subgroup analyses of FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes that reported this therapy reduces the risk for major cardiovascular events and this risk reduction was larger in patients with high vs low levels of Lp(a) (Figure 1). In patients with LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL, Lp(a) > 125 nmol/L, and LDL-C < 25% above the target, ezetimibe is an option.

Figure 1
Translating SPARCL-Lp(a) into Clinical Practice

Among SPARCL patients taking atorvastatin 80 mg daily, high vs low Lp(a) levels was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease events but not stroke events. Until completion of randomized clinical trials with selective Lp(a) lowering therapies, we advocate a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody inhibitor to lower LDL-C < 55 mg/dL in patients with high Lp(a) levels, particularly when the LDL-C level is > 25% above targeted levels. LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of olpasiran in healthy Japanese and non-Japanese participants: results from a phase I, single-dose, open-label study [^c693a79e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Olpasiran, an N-acetyl galactosamine-conjugated, hepatocyte-targeted, small interfering RNA, is being developed to reduce plasma lipoprotein (Lp)-(a) concentration by directly targeting the LPA gene. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of a single SC injection of olpasiran in healthy, Japanese and non-Japanese participants.

Methods

In this Phase I, open-label, parallel-design study, Japanese participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a single 3, 9, 75, or 225 mg dose of olpasiran. Non-Japanese participants received a single 75 mg dose of olpasiran. The primary end points were pharmacokinetic parameters, including C max, AUC inf, t max, and t 1/2. Tolerability and change in Lp(a) concentration were also assessed.

Findings

A total of 27 enrolled participants had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (12.5) years. Olpasiran C max and AUC inf were increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in the Japanese groups. Mean (SD) C max values were 242 (121.0) and 144 (71.3) ng/mL, and mean (SD) AUC inf values were 3550 (592.0) and 2620 (917.0) h·ng/mL, in the Japanese and non-Japanese groups, respectively, given 75 mg of olpasiran. Median t max ranged from 3.0 to 9.0 hours and mean (SD) t 1/2 ranged from 4.0 (0.3) to 6.9 (1.6) hours across all groups. The maximal Lp(a) reduction occurred at day 57, with mean (SD) Lp(a) percentage reductions from baseline ranging from 56.0% (21.0%) to 99.0% (0.2%). A reductions in Lp(a) was observed as early as day 4. All adverse events were mild in severity, with no serious or fatal adverse events. No clinically important changes in tolerability-related laboratory analytes or vital signs were observed.

Implications

In this population of healthy Japanese participants, dose-proportional increases in exposure and reduced Lp(a) in a dose-dependent manner were found with single 3, 9, 75, and 225 mg doses of olpasiran. The magnitude and durability of Lp(a) reductions were similar between the Japanese and non-Japanese groups. Olpasiran was well tolerated, with no clinically important adverse events or laboratory or vital sign abnormalities.

Figure 4
Impact of LLT type on the proportion of patients with ASCVD per LDL‐C range. For each treatment, the percentages of patients per LDL‐C range type are provided, based on their latest LDL‐C levels. The latest LLT is displayed, including from left to right: statin (monotherapy and combination therapy), statin alone (monotherapy), ezetimibe (monotherapy and combination therapy), a combination of ezetimibe and statins (possibly with other LLTs), and high‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe (possibly with other LLTs).

As per recommended guidelines for patients with ASCVD, LDL‐C goals should be reached with a maximum tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe and intensified with a PCSK9 inhibitor when required. In Belgium, certain PCSK9 inhibitors are reimbursed for patients with established ASCVD and with LDL‐C ≥ 100 mg/dL despite being treated with a maximally tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe. As described in Table 1, there was only a minority of patients with reported use of PCSK9 inhibitors in this cohort (49 patients only). Yet, the LDL‐C reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitors was qualitatively similar to that achieved with high‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe, demonstrating the benefit of this therapy (not shown).

### Alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statins in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^5927df46]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with high-intensity statins is generally recommended. However, alternative approaches considering statin-related adverse effects and intolerance are needed.

Objective

To compare the long-term efficacy and safety of an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD in randomized clinical trials.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and other websites (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Society of Cardiology, tctMD) were systematically searched from inception to April 19, 2024.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD, with presence of cardiovascular events as end points.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Individual patient data were obtained from randomized clinical trials that met the prespecified eligibility criteria: RACING (Randomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lipid-Lowering With Statin Monotherapy vs Statin/Ezetimibe Combination for High-Risk Cardiovascular Disease) and LODESTAR (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol-Targeting Statin Therapy vs Intensity-Based Statin Therapy in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease). The moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy in the RACING trial and the treat-to-target strategy in the LODESTAR trial were classified as alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategies. The primary analysis was based on a 1-stage approach.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was a 3-year composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization. The secondary end points comprised clinical efficacy and safety end points.

Results

Individual patient data from 2 trials including 8180 patients with ASCVD (mean [SD] age, 64.5 [9.8] years; 2182 [26.7%] female; 5998 male [73.3%]) were analyzed. The rate of the primary end point did not differ between the alternative strategy and high-intensity statin strategy groups (7.5% [304 of 4094] vs 7.7% [310 of 4086]; hazard ratio,0.98; 95% CI, 0.84–1.15; P = 0.82). The mean (SD) LDL cholesterol level during treatment was 64.8 (19.0) mg/dL in the alternative strategy group and 68.5 (20.7) mg/dL in the high-intensity statin strategy group (P < .001). The alternative strategy group had a lower rate of new-onset diabetes (10.2% [271 of 2658] vs 11.9% [316 of 2656]; P = 0.047), initiation of antidiabetic medication for new-onset diabetes (6.5% [173 of 2658] vs 8.2% [217 of 2656]; P = 0.02), and intolerance-related discontinuation or dose reduction of assigned therapy (4.0% [163 of 4094] vs 6.7% [273 of 4086]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis suggest that compared with a high-intensity statin strategy, the alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy demonstrated comparable efficacy regarding 3-year death or cardiovascular events in patients with ASCVD, with an associated reduction in LDL cholesterol levels and risk for new-onset diabetes and intolerance.

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^a938edb2]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) have compared statin monotherapy versus placebo, more versus less intense therapy, and combination therapy on a background of standard of care, with some studies reporting effects on LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB alongside cardiovascular outcomes; however, the available data from RCTs supporting the targeting of non-HDL-C and apoB is limited compared to LDL-C, LLT was never adjusted based upon non-HDL-C or apoB concentrations, and there have been no RCTs in which participants at risk of ASCVD were randomized to treatment strategies based on achieving non-HDL-C or apoB therapeutic objectives.

### Lipoprotein (a) is markedly more atherogenic than LDL: an apolipoprotein B-based genetic analysis [^a10c9340]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The findings of the present study have relevance for risk assessment in those with elevated Lp(a), setting thresholds for intervention to prevent disease outcomes, and for the design and interpretation of trials with newly developed Lp(a) lowering agents such as pelacarsen and olpasiran. While we await the results of trials of Lp(a) as a target for intervention, it is useful to consider recent reports of outcome studies in which for the first time Lp(a) was reduced substantially by the drug under investigation. In FOURIER and Odyssey Outcomes, Lp(a) at baseline was a predictor of ongoing CHD risk in subjects with low LDL-C levels, and both evolocumab and alirocumab lowered Lp(a) by an average of 23% to 29% in addition to reducing LDL-C by 50–60%. The higher atherogenicity of Lp(a) relative to LDL as reported in the present study helps explain why in both trials it was observed that the relative risk reduction on a PCSK9 inhibitor tended to be lower in subjects with the lowest baseline Lp(a) levels despite substantial LDL-C lowering, and conversely greater in subjects with the highest baseline Lp(a) who experienced the largest Lp(a) decrease. Further, in FOURIER the investigators estimated the relative risk reduction attributable to the lowering of Lp(a) as 15% per 25 nmol/L decrease. This value is of the same order as the predicted risk reduction from our analysis of the gradient between Lp(a)-apoB and CHD risk. It is noteworthy that the mean absolute decrease in Lp(a) mass concentration in ODYSSEY Outcomes was 5.0 mg/dl (approximately 12 nmol/L) while in FOURIER the median decrease was 11 nmol/L. Considering the earlier predicted responses to Lp(a) lowering, these small changes should have had little impact on relative risk reduction seen in the trials. However, the consistent observation in both outcome studies that a decrease in Lp(a) contributed significantly to the overall benefit suggests that the atherogenicity of the particle is greater, as indicated by our findings.

Looking to the Future: Many Treatment Options, Many Opportunities to Reduce ASCVD Risk

Investigational Lipid‐Lowering Therapies

The safety and efficacy of lipid‐lowering therapies continue to improve as more targeted therapies are developed. PCSK9 inhibition has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for LDL‐C lowering, and several new targeted therapies are currently in clinical development. An oral PCSK9 inhibitor, MK‐0616 (a macrocyclic peptide), demonstrated significant, placebo‐adjusted reductions in LDL‐C of up to 60.9% at week 8 in a phase 2b study. Lerodalcibep, a novel recombinant fusion protein of the PCSK9‐binding domain and human serum albumin, has been shown to lower LDL‐C levels by ≈60% in a phase 2 extension study.

Several studies have examined LDL‐C lowering following CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibition; however, to date, CETP inhibitors have failed to reduce ASCVD events in late‐stage clinical trials with some safety concerns. Obicetrapib, a new‐generation CETP inhibitor, has achieved significant reductions of LDL‐C by 50.8% and is currently under phase 3 development.

Among novel therapeutic targets for LDL‐C reduction is angiopoietin‐like 3, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase. Evinacumab, an anti–angiopoietin‐like 3 monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with homozygous FH, reduced LDL‐C levels by > 50% in a phase 2 study of patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia. However, in the TRANSLATE‐TIMI 70 (Targeting ANGPTL3 With an Antisense Oligonucleotide in Adults With Dyslipidemia) trial of patients on statin therapy, vupanorsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting angiopoietin‐like 3, demonstrated only modest LDL‐C lowering of between 7.9% and 16.0%. Vupanorsen was also associated with a dose‐dependent increase in hepatic fat and more frequent elevations of liver enzymes compared with placebo; therefore, further clinical development of this drug has been halted.

### Two phase 3 trials of inclisiran in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol [^0ad87c0e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study ORION-11 was published by Kausik K Ray and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia and Coronary artery disease. In the ORION-11 study, the trial question was: what is the role of inclisiran in patients with increased LDL-C despite statin therapy? In the ORION-11 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ORION-11 study, the population was: 1617 patients (457 female, 1160 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ASCVD or an ASCVD risk equivalent who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. The key exclusion criteria were any uncontrolled or serious disease; NYHA class IV HF; uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia; uncontrolled severe hypertension; active liver disease; treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed toward PCSK9 within 90 days before screening. In the ORION-11 study, the interventions were: n = 810 inclisiran (284 mg administered SC on day 1, day 90, day 270, and day 450) n = 807 placebo (matching placebo administered SC). In the ORION-11 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510 (45.8% vs. -4%; AD 49.9%, 95% CI 46.6 to 53.1). In the ORION-11 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in time-adjusted LDL cholesterol reduction from day 90 to 540 (45.8% vs. -3.4%; AD 49.2%, 95% CI 46.8 to 51.6) Significant increase in reduction in absolute LDL cholesterol level at day 510 (50.9 mg/dL vs. -1 mg/dL; AD 51.9 mg/dL, 95% CI 48.7 to 55) Significant increase in absolute LDL cholesterol level reduction from day 90 to 540 (48.6 mg/dL vs. 0.3 mg/dL; AD 48.9 mg/dL, 95% CI 46.5 to 51.4). In the ORION-11 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, serious adverse events. significant difference in injection-site adverse events (4.7% vs. 0.5%). In the ORION-11 study, the conclusion was: in patients with ASCVD or an ASCVD risk equivalent who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose, inclisiran was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^84939dff]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a)-directed treatment actions — In adults aged 40–75 y with a 10-y ASCVD risk of 7.5%–19.9%, the finding of an Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL is reasonable to be used as a risk-enhancing factor to favor initiation of a moderate- or high-intensity statin. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, it is reasonable to consider more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering to achieve greater ASCVD risk reduction. In high-risk or very-high-risk patients taking a maximally tolerated statin with Lp(a) ≥ 125 nmol/L or ≥ 50 mg/dL, the addition of ezetimibe is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), and the addition of a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor is reasonable in those with on-treatment LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL). Lipoprotein apheresis is reasonable for high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, and niacin or hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and progesterone, which lower Lp(a), is not recommended to reduce ASCVD risk.

PCSK9 inhibitors — research needs for combination therapy and treatment intensity: There is a need for continued investigation of the long-term safety of treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors combined with statins with or without ezetimibe and the unknown safety of prolonged periods of very low LDL-C; topics include what is the optimal combination of lipid-lowering treatments or achieved LDL-C level for the largest reduction in CV events (e.g., adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to maximally-tolerated statin plus ezetimibe versus moderate-dose statins plus ezetimibe), what is the comparative effectiveness of high-dose statin plus ezetimibe, high-dose statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor, and high-dose statin plus ezetimibe plus PCSK9 inhibitor (triple therapy) in higher risk patients, and what is the optimal duration of more aggressive treatment in higher risk patients including whether ACS patients on high-dose statins should continue indefinitely or be titrated downward after a period of time.

### Clinical staging to guide management of metabolic disorders and their sequelae: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^2a4b21b4]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Dosing schedules for the currently prescribed GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists for Type 2 diabetes and obesity are shown in Table 1. These drugs are mainly administered subcutaneously due to poor oral bioavailability, but an oral daily formulation of semaglutide is available. A recent trial showed that oral semaglutide 50 mg per day promotes similar weight reductions to those observed with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly. In a 68-week trial, oral semaglutide at 25 and 50 mg per day was shown to be safe and more effective in terms of both HbA1c lowering and weight loss compared with the usual 14 mg per day diabetes dose in individuals who were overweight and with diabetes. However, given the global shortage and cost of GLP-1 receptor agonists, the high dose required for oral administration may limit the use of this formulation to treat obesity. A recent development of relevance is the orally available non-peptide GLP-1 receptor agonist orforglipron, which produced dose-dependent weight reductions of up to 14.7% in a Phase 2 trial. In this rapidly evolving field, therapies under investigation also include the so-called 'triple G' receptor agonists (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon)and amylin agonists alone or combined with other gut hormone analogues, with the potential for even greater reductions in weight.

### Two phase 3 trials of inclisiran in patients with elevated LDL cholesterol [^2a0e3986]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study ORION-10 was published by Kausik K Ray and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia and Coronary artery disease. In the ORION-10 study, the trial question was: what is the role of inclisiran in patients with increased LDL-C despite statin therapy? In the ORION-10 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ORION-10 study, the population was: 1561 patients (478 female, 1083 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ASCVD who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose. The key exclusion criteria were any uncontrolled or serious disease; NYHA class IV HF; uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia; uncontrolled severe hypertension; active liver disease; treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed toward PCSK9 within 90 days before screening. In the ORION-10 study, the interventions were: n = 781 inclisiran (284 mg administered SC on day 1, day 90, day 270, and day 450) n = 780 placebo (matching placebo administered SC). In the ORION-10 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510 (51.3% vs. -1%; AD 52.3%, 95% CI 48.8 to 55.7). In the ORION-10 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in time-adjusted LDL cholesterol reduction from day 90 to 540 (51.3% vs. -2.5%; AD 53.8%, 95% CI 51.3 to 56.2) Significant increase in reduction in absolute LDL cholesterol level at day 510 (56.2 mg/dL vs. 2.1 mg/dL; AD 54.1 mg/dL, 95% CI 50.9 to 57.4) Significant increase in absolute LDL cholesterol level reduction from day 90 to 540 (53.7 mg/dL vs. 0.4 mg/dL; AD 53.3 mg/dL, 95% CI 50.8 to 55.8). In the ORION-10 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant difference in injection-site adverse events (2.6% vs. 0.9%). In the ORION-10 study, the conclusion was: in patients with ASCVD who had increased LDL cholesterol levels despite receiving statin therapy at the maximum tolerated dose, inclisiran was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in LDL cholesterol at day 510.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^ae1e158a]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Statins — across guidelines, statins remain first-line therapy for mitigating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–driven atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; although statins do not lower Lp(a) and may slightly increase it, they reduce major adverse cardiovascular events by "approximately 22% for each 1-mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C". Median Lp(a) was not affected by rosuvastatin in JUPITER, and on-treatment Lp(a) increases with statins are minimal on average ("approximate 1.1-mg/dL increase or 0.1% relative increase"). Concerns about Lp(a) elevation "should not be a reason to discourage or discontinue statins".

Risk factors of cardiovascular disease and heart failure

Inclisiran is a siRNA that inhibits the translation of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a serine protease that degrades the LDL receptor, which mediates LDL removal by the liver. Its efficacy in reducing LDL‐cholesterol levels has been demonstrated in the phase 3 ORION‐9 trial in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and in the subsequent ORION‐10 and ORION‐11 randomized controlled trials. A patient‐level analysis of the three ORION randomized controlled trials showed a lower incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients treated with inclisiran compared to placebo.

Furthermore, LDL‐cholesterol levels could be reduced by blocking angiopoietin‐like 3, a circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase, the enzyme that clears triglyceride‐rich lipoprotein from the circulation, and endothelial lipase. Results from the phase 1 AROANG1001 study indicated that angiopoietin‐like 3 silencing with the N‐acetylgalactosamine‐conjugated siRNA ARO‐ANG3 was generally well tolerated and can effectively lower circulating concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins. Phase 2/3 trials are required to confirm the LDL reduction along cardiovascular outcome events.

Lipoprotein(a) is another lipoprotein whose levels strongly correlate with the risk of atherosclerotic CVD and cardiovascular events. The phase 1 OCEAN‐DOSE trial demonstrated that inhibition of hepatic lipoprotein(a) synthesis with the siRNA olpasiran abated lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD. Longer and larger trials are ongoing to determine the effect of olpasiran therapy on CVD outcomes [OCEAN(a)‐Outcomes Trial, NCT05581303].

Finally, knockdown of hepatic angiotensinogen, the precursor of all angiotensins, via the siRNA zilebesiran markedly decreases serum angiotensinogen, the precursor of angiotensin II, and blood pressure for a duration of at least 24 weeks. Zilebesiran is being further evaluated as a potential treatment for hypertension in two phase 2 studies: KARDIA‐1 and KARDIA‐2.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Inclisiran versus PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies — comparative LDL cholesterol lowering and administration considerations are noted as follows: There are no head-to-head comparisons of the PCSK9 mAbs and inclisiran, although when comparing similarly designed trials, the LDL-C–lowering response to inclisiran appears to be approximately 10% less than that seen with the PCSK9 mAbs; the twice-yearly administration by subcutaneous injection after the initial 2 doses at baseline and 3 months is described as a potentially attractive aspect of this therapy, particularly in patients with adherence concerns.

### Revisiting the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^ee3b497e]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic management of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but major guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for its use in primary prevention. Findings from recent randomized trials totaling > 47000 patients called into question the net clinical benefits of aspirin in primary prevention for 3 key populations: patients with diabetes mellitus, community-dwelling elderly individuals, and patients without diabetes mellitus who are at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic events. In the context of increasing emphasis on the use of other treatments for primary prevention in patients with moderate-high future risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the efficacy and safety of aspirin for primary prevention has become uncertain. Key unresolved questions regarding the role of aspirin in primary prevention include the optimal drug formulation, dosing schedule, weight-based dose selection, and interplay between sex and treatment response. In the current era, most patients without established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should not be prescribed aspirin. Rather, aggressive management of comorbidities tailored to the expected cardiovascular risk needs to be emphasized. In this context, informed shared decision making between clinicians and patients regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events is a suitable and laudable approach. In this article, we revisit the role of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by critically reviewing the key scientific literature, highlight key areas of uncertainties for future research, and propose a decisional framework for clinicians to support prescription of aspirin in primary prevention.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^01ea91f7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) recommendations and thresholds for assessment and therapy: Adults (aged ≥ 18 y) measurement of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in all adults is reasonable to refine atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment (COR I, LOE B-NR). For ASCVD risk stratification, it is reasonable to use Lp(a) thresholds of ≥ 125 nmol/L (≥ 50 mg/dL) for high risk, < 75 nmol/L (< 30 mg/dL) for low risk, and values between as intermediate risk (COR IIa, LOE B-NR). The use of an adjustment factor to estimate Lp(a)-cholesterol (Lp(a)-C) for correction of calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is not recommended (COR III [no benefit], LOE C-EO), and because accepted conversion factors to adjust for Lp(a)-C in LDL-C calculation have proven inaccurate, such adjustments should not be used. Lipoprotein apheresis is an FDA-approved therapy for high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and ASCVD whose Lp(a) remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (~150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy (COR IIa, LOE B-NR), and lipoprotein apheresis is the first therapy to receive a FDA indication for Lp(a) reduction.

### Translating guidelines into practice: interpreting the 2016 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of non-statin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^659bef13]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology released a decision pathway, based on expert consensus, to guide use of non-statin agents in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The purpose of this article is to assist practitioners, health systems and managed care entities with interpreting this consensus statement in order to simplify implementation of the recommendations into patient care.

Methods

Major themes from the consensus statement are briefly summarized and explained. Drug therapy recommendations are condensed into a single algorithm, while tables correlate each recommended regimen with the appropriate patient population from both a patient-level and systems-level perspective. Finally, a patient case with evidence-based decision support is explored.

Results

These tools allow practitioners to make appropriate patient-specific decisions about the use of non-statin pharmacotherapy and enable health systems and managed care entities to more readily identify guideline-appropriate use of these agents upon review of patient profiles or prescribing patterns.

Conclusion

This article provides resources for healthcare providers that facilitate uptake of these recommendations into clinical practice.

### Is lower and lower better and better? A re-evaluation of the evidence from the cholesterol treatment trialists' collaboration meta-analysis for low-density lipoprotein lowering [^34d8bc00]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.

### Study details | NCT03814187 | Trial to assess the effect of long term dosing of inclisiran in subjects with high CV risk and elevated LDL-C… [^d3b20ff1]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

In this Phase III extension study, the same study drug of inclisiran sodium 300 mg was administered as a single subcutaneous dose every 180 days from the last dose in previous feeder study until the end of the study. On Day 1, subjects from the previous feeder studies received blinded study medication except subjects from Study ORION-3. Subjects who received placebo in the previous Phase III feeder study received blinded inclisiran and subjects who received inclisiran in the previous feeder study received blinded placebo at this visit, so that subjects previously on placebo received the correct dosing regime, i.e. a dose at Day 1, Day 90 and every 180-days thereafter.

Subjects previously treated with inclisiran did not need a dose of inclisiran to maintain every 180-dosing regime and therefore, were given placebo in order to maintain the blinding of the feeder study. Subjects that moved over from ORION-3 received the first study medication at Day 90, as this study was already open-label. On Day 90, all subjects received inclisiran sodium 300 mg. This is 180 days after the last injection in the previous feeder study for subjects that received inclisiran and was the second dose of inclisiran for the subjects that received placebo in the feeder study. The EOS visit occurred at Day 1080. This extension study allowed subjects continued access to inclisiran treatment and allowed the collection of additional efficacy and safety data for long-term use beyond the end of the feeder studies.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^4d01b19a]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thirty years ago, the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration published the first individual participant data (IPD) overview of 145 randomized trials of prolonged antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (vascular events) in various categories of patients. The most widely tested antiplatelet regimen was 'medium dose' (75–325 mg/day) aspirin, and the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no evidence that either a higher aspirin dose or any other antiplatelet regimen was more effective than medium-dose aspirin in preventing vascular events. At about the same time, I published a review article on aspirin as an antiplatelet drug that concluded 'The present recommendation of a single loading dose of 200 to 300 mg followed by a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg is based on findings that this dose is as clinically efficacious as higher doses and is safer than higher doses'. Moreover, I added 'the efficacy of a cheap drug such as aspirin in preventing one fifth to one third of all important cardiovascular events should not discourage the pharmaceutical industry from attempting to develop more effective antithrombotic drugs, since a sizable proportion of these events continue to occur despite currently available therapy'.

During the past 30 years, we have witnessed several developments in the antiplatelet field, including (i) a large number of trials exploring the role of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;(ii) several attempts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop antiplatelet drugs, more effective and safer than aspirin;(iii) a shift in emphasis from efficacy to safety leading to a strong opinion movement favouring aspirin-free antiplatelet regimens after percutaneous coronary intervention; and (iv) an IPD meta-analysis comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention of coronary events. Moreover, evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other digestive tract) cancer has strengthened, as recently reviewed.

The aim of this article is to revisit the role of aspirin in the prevention of atherothrombosis across the cardiovascular risk continuum, in view of developments in the antiplatelet field. The review will offer a clinical perspective on aspirin's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. This will be followed by a detailed discussion of its clinical efficacy and safety (Graphical Abstract).

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^958232a8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) measurement — Lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) is described as an independent risk factor for ASCVD, yet clinical assays used in patient care are not well standardized; the National Lipid Association recommends an immunochemical assay calibrated against WHO/IFCCLM secondary reference material, with the preferred reporting unit in nmol/L. Reported performance indicates Lp(a) assay variability can be as high as 26% CV and the precision of most Lp(a) assays ranges between 10% to 12%. The 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society guideline classified Lp(a) measurement as a risk enhancer that could help guide care for persons at intermediate ASCVD risk, and measuring Lp(a) may also be valuable in patients with a strong family history of ASCVD, those who do not fully respond to statin therapy, or those with ASCVD events despite evidence-based lipid-lowering therapy.

Nonstatin LDL-C lowering — ANGPTL3 inhibition with evinacumab for HoFH: "Both ANGPTL3 loss-of-function variants and ANGPTL3 pharmacologic inhibition reduce LDL-C levels independently of the LDL receptor. Evinacumab is a fully human mAb that is an inhibitor of ANGPTL3". In the ELIPSE HoFH phase 3 trial, "65 patients… with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of evinacumab (at a dose of 15 mg per kg of body weight) every 4 weeks or placebo", with the primary endpoint "percent change from baseline in LDL-C at week 24" and mean baseline LDL-C "255 mg/dL". Efficacy showed "a 47.1% relative reduction… as compared with an increase of 1.9% in the placebo group", with between-group differences "−49.0 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]: −65.0 to −33.1 percentage points; P < 0.001)" and absolute difference "−132.1 mg/dL (95% CI: −175.3 to −88.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001)". Subgroups with "2 null variants (−43.4% vs +16.2%)" and "non-null variants (−49.1% vs −3.8%)" favored evinacumab; "Adverse events were similar… No patients discontinued… and there were no deaths. Antidrug antibodies did not develop". Evinacumab "received FDA approval… indicated as an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies for… adult and pediatric patients, aged 12 years and older, with HoFH", is dosed "15 mg/kg by IV infusion over approximately 1 hour once monthly (every 4 weeks)", and "current FDA approval includes only HoFH"; "The effects of evinacumab on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been studied".

### Comprehensive evaluation of siRNA therapeutics on Lp (a): a network meta-analysis [^86b47dd6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of siRNA drugs that lower Lp(a) in patients with dyslipidaemia.

Materials and Methods

A network meta-analysis and systematic review were conducted to compare siRNA drugs targeting Lp(a), based on relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (up to October 24, 2024). RCTs with an intervention duration of at least 12weeks were included. Eligible studies compared siRNA drugs that reduce Lp(a), including both Lp(a)-targeted and non-targeted agents, with placebo or other siRNA drugs that reduce Lp(a). The primary outcomes were the percentage reduction and absolute reduction in Lp(a), percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), percentage reduction in apolipoprotein B (apo(B)), adverse events and serious adverse events, including injection-site reactions. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (ROB2), and a random-effects network meta-analysis was performed using the frequentist approach. Confidence in effect estimates was evaluated using the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework.

Results

A total of 14 trials involving 5646 participants were included. Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents, particularly Olpasiran, demonstrated strong efficacy in significantly reducing Lp(a) levels, with the greatest percentage reduction in Lp(a) (mean difference [MD]: -92.06%; 95% CI: -102.43% to -81.69%; P-score: 0.98). Olpasiran also showed the greatest absolute reduction in Lp(a) (MD: -250.70nmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -279.89 to -221.50; P-score: 0.99). Certain non-Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents, such as inclisiran and zodasiran, also showed modest reductions in Lp(a) levels, reducing Lp(a) by approximately 15%. Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents reduced LDL-C by more than 20% and decreased apo(B) by approximately 15%. In terms of safety, most drugs exhibited favourable safety profiles with no significant differences compared to placebo. However, zerlasiran raised concerns regarding injection-site reactions and other adverse events when compared to placebo.

Conclusions

Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents have shown robust effectiveness in substantially reducing Lp(a) levels, including both percentage and absolute reductions, with moderate improvements in LDL-C and apo(B) concentrations. Non-Lp(a)-targeted siRNA agents also demonstrate modest reductions in Lp(a) levels. The safety profile is generally favourable, but zerlasiran and inclisiran may increase the incidence of injection-site reactions.

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) management and lomitapide are outlined with key targets and mechanisms: HoFH is described as a rare disease with loss of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) function and extreme elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from birth, with patients frequently diagnosed late and at markedly elevated risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The current European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on the treatment of HoFH recommends an LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL for adults with ASCVD or major ASCVD risk factors, < 70 mg/dL for adults without ASCVD risk factors, and < 115 mg/dL for pediatric patients without ASCVD; achieving these targets is challenging, necessitating combination lipid-lowering therapy including statins, ezetimibe, lipoprotein apheresis, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i), lomitapide, and evinacumab. Lomitapide is a small molecule inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein that reduces production of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins and whose mechanism of action is independent of LDLR; this review summarizes available evidence for lomitapide use in HoFH.

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^f0b0a01c]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein apheresis for high Lp(a) — Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for treating high Lp(a) is lipoprotein apheresis, based on observational data, and apheresis is now also approved for use in high-risk patients with FH and ASCVD whose Lp(a) level remains ≥ 60 mg/dL (∼150 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy; because it removes apoB-containing lipoproteins, both LDL-C and Lp(a) are substantially reduced acutely but return toward pretreatment levels between procedures, and apheresis is not available at all centers and can be expensive and time-consuming.
