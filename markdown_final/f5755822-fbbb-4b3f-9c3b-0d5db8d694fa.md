## Question

Patient is on meloxicam and needs to be stopped, what other pain medication option can be considered that won't impede Lasix

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which alternative pain medication can be considered for a patient who is stopping meloxicam and is also taking furosemide, with the requirement that the new pain medication should not interfere with the effectiveness of the loop diuretic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of the meloxicam–furosemide interaction and why meloxicam is being stopped. Then, I should verify whether any NSAID can safely be combined with a loop diuretic or if the class effect mandates avoidance. Next, I will evaluate non-NSAID options with attention to renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular safety. Finally, I will outline a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and monitoring plan, and I will double-check for any exceptions or caveats before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and mechanism. NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can blunt the natriuretic response to loop diuretics like furosemide by inhibiting renal prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces renal perfusion and can impair diuretic efficacy; labels advise monitoring diuretic response when NSAIDs are coadministered, and this risk is amplified in older adults, those with volume depletion, or renal impairment [^1158SqMh] [^114bdAhz].

> Wait, let me verify whether any NSAID is acceptable here. I initially wondered if a COX-2–selective NSAID like celecoxib might avoid this issue, but hold on, I should verify the label language. FDA labeling for celecoxib states that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides, so celecoxib carries the same diuretic-interaction risk and is not a safe alternative in this context; thus, switching to another NSAID will not solve the problem and may perpetuate diuretic resistance and volume overload [^115L5Vx2] [^115Hw1ey].

> I need to ensure I am not overlooking a class exception. Let me consider whether short-acting NSAIDs or different pharmacokinetics change this risk. Evidence and labeling consistently show that NSAIDs as a class can impair loop diuretic efficacy, and the magnitude of risk increases with concomitant renin–angiotensin system blockade and in CKD; therefore, no NSAID is preferred when diuretic efficacy is critical, and the prudent path is to avoid NSAIDs altogether in this scenario [^115fJ4ip] [^112FzdNJ] [^1137WjKP].

> Next, I should review non-NSAID options and their safety profile. Acetaminophen is the first-line non-NSAID analgesic for mild to moderate pain; it does not inhibit peripheral prostaglandins at therapeutic doses and therefore does not impair natriuresis or blunt loop diuretics, though I should confirm hepatic dosing limits and avoid exceeding 3,000–4,000 mg/day in adults without liver disease; guidelines endorse acetaminophen as foundational therapy when NSAIDs are contraindicated or undesirable [^111H2XAm] [^115ozYHB].

> For moderate pain unresponsive to acetaminophen, I should consider a short course of a low-dose opioid, recognizing the trade-offs. Opioids do not interfere with renal prostaglandins or diuretic efficacy, but they carry risks of sedation, constipation, and respiratory depression; if used, employ the lowest effective dose, avoid long-acting opioids in opioid-naïve patients, and pair with nonopioid foundation therapy and bowel regimens as indicated [^111H2XAm] [^115ozYHB].

> But wait, what if neuropathic or mixed-mechanism pain is present. In that case, I should add agents like gabapentin or pregabalin, which do not impair natriuresis and can reduce opioid requirements. This aligns with multimodal strategies that layer nonopioid medications with distinct mechanisms to improve analgesia while minimizing opioid exposure and NSAID-related risks [^112eBjjM] [^111H2XAm].

> I should double-check special populations and monitoring. In older adults, those with CKD, heart failure, or on ACE inhibitors/ARBs, the risk of NSAID-induced AKI and diuretic resistance is highest; if NSAIDs were previously used, I need to check renal function and electrolytes after discontinuation and ensure diuretic responsiveness returns, adjusting furosemide as needed to maintain euvolemia and blood pressure control [^115fJ4ip] [^113mghML] [^112FzdNJ].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. Stop meloxicam and avoid all NSAIDs. Initiate acetaminophen 650–1,000 mg every 6 hours to a maximum of 3,000–4,000 mg/day if liver function is normal. If pain remains moderate to severe, add a short course of a low-dose short-acting opioid such as oxycodone 5–10 mg every 4–6 hours as needed with close follow-up. If neuropathic features are present, add gabapentin or pregabalin. Reassess diuretic response, weight, edema, and blood pressure within 1–2 weeks to confirm restored natriuresis and adjust furosemide dosing accordingly [^111H2XAm] [^112eBjjM] [^115fJ4ip].

> Hold on, I should verify there are no overlooked exceptions. Some clinicians consider topical NSAIDs for localized pain; however, systemic absorption can still occur and the safest, guideline-concordant course here is to avoid NSAIDs entirely when diuretic efficacy is paramount and instead rely on acetaminophen, adjuvants, and cautious opioid use if needed, with explicit patient counseling to avoid OTC NSAIDs and salicylates [^111H2XAm] [^112Gu9F5].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the recommendation is explicit and evidence-aligned. Discontinue meloxicam and avoid all NSAIDs due to their class effect of blunting loop diuretic response; use acetaminophen as first-line, add gabapentinoids for neuropathic components, and reserve short-course, low-dose opioids for breakthrough or moderate pain, while monitoring diuretic efficacy and renal function to confirm clinical improvement after NSAID cessation [^1158SqMh] [^111H2XAm] [^115fJ4ip].

For a patient on Lasix (furosemide), **acetaminophen is the preferred alternative** to meloxicam because it does not impair diuretic efficacy or cause renal complications [^113fdahU]. If acetaminophen is insufficient, **low-dose opioids** (e.g. codeine, tramadol) may be used short-term with close monitoring. Avoid NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib) because they can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and increase the risk of renal impairment and electrolyte disturbances [^1158SqMh] [^115L5Vx2]. If an NSAID is absolutely necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and monitor renal function and electrolytes closely [^1126jbP2].

---

## Mechanism of interaction between meloxicam and furosemide

Meloxicam, an NSAID, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, which can reduce renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Furosemide, a loop diuretic, relies on prostaglandin-mediated renal blood flow to achieve natriuresis. Thus, **NSAIDs can blunt furosemide's natriuretic effect**, potentially causing fluid retention, worsening edema, and compromising blood pressure control [^1158SqMh].

---

## Clinical implications of NSAID use with furosemide

NSAID use with furosemide can lead to:

- **Reduced diuretic efficacy**: NSAIDs can diminish the natriuretic response to furosemide, leading to fluid retention and worsening edema [^1158SqMh].

- **Increased risk of renal impairment**: NSAIDs can cause renal ischemia, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, dehydration, or concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^113mghML].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: NSAIDs can cause hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and other electrolyte imbalances, which can be dangerous in patients with heart failure or renal impairment [^113mghML].

---

## Alternative pain medications compatible with furosemide

Given these risks, **acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the preferred alternative** to meloxicam for patients taking furosemide. Acetaminophen does not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis significantly and therefore does not impair renal blood flow or diuretic efficacy. It is also associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events compared to NSAIDs [^113fdahU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the risks of combining NSAIDs with diuretics and recommend **avoiding NSAIDs in patients taking loop diuretics** when possible. If NSAIDs are absolutely necessary, they should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^116Hszgs].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If alternative pain medications are used in patients taking furosemide, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor renal function**: Regularly check serum creatinine and estimated GFR to detect early signs of renal impairment [^114Pi4yz].

- **Monitor electrolytes**: Check serum potassium, sodium, and other electrolytes regularly to detect imbalances early [^115mYtcS].

- **Monitor blood pressure and fluid status**: Regularly assess blood pressure, weight, and signs of fluid retention or edema [^1126jbP2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Pain medication** | **Compatibility with furosemide** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | Compatible | Preferred alternative; minimal renal and gastrointestinal risk |
| Opioids (e.g. codeine, tramadol) | Compatible | Short-term use; monitor for sedation, constipation, and respiratory depression |
| NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib) | Incompatible | Avoid if possible; impairs diuretic efficacy and increases renal risk |

---

Acetaminophen is the **preferred alternative** to meloxicam for patients taking furosemide, as it does not impair diuretic efficacy or increase renal risk. If acetaminophen is insufficient, short-term use of low-dose opioids may be considered with close monitoring. NSAIDs should be avoided due to their potential to reduce diuretic efficacy and increase renal impairment risk [^1158SqMh].

### Clinical implications of nonopioid analgesia for relief of mild-to-moderate pain in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease [^113fdahU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonopioid analgesics, which include acetaminophen, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors (coxibs), are frequently used for the relief of mild-to-moderate pain. Although all of these agents are effective at controlling pain, inhibition of prostaglandins (PGs) by NSAIDs may result in untoward cardiorenal effects, including hypertension, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with an increased risk for cardiorenal effects from NSAIDs (eg, the elderly, and those with hypertension, cardiac disease, or gouty nephropathy) should be monitored for early onset of edema, destabilization of blood pressure control, and/or onset of congestive heart failure when started on NSAID therapy. Because acetaminophen has a different mechanism of action from the conventional NSAIDs, it does not inhibit peripheral PGs at recommended dosing and therefore appears to have a more favorable cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety profile. This review discusses the effects of acetaminophen, traditional NSAIDs, and coxibs on fluid and electrolytes, blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and renal function, as well as their consequences in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It also summarizes information on the mechanisms by which NSAID-induced cardiovascular adverse events develop, and it provides recommendations for the use of nonopioid analgesics for relief of mild-to-moderate pain in patients with or at risk for CVD.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA-approved Medication Guide Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. 17.1 Medication Guide Inform
patients of the availability of a Medication Guide for NSAIDs that
accompanies each prescription dispensed, and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to using MOBIC.

17.2 Cardiovascular Effects NSAIDs including MOBIC may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death.
Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients
should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

17.3 Gastrointestinal Effects NSAIDs including MOBIC, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients
should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding,
and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign
or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and
hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Naproxen (SALLUS pain relief collection with naproxen) [^113zLQQV]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension

NSAIDs, including naproxen and naproxen sodium, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including naproxen and naproxen sodium, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Congestive Heart Failure and Edema

Fluid retention, edema, and peripheral edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Naproxen and naproxen sodium should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention, hypertension, or heart failure. Since each naproxen sodium tablet contains 25 mg or 50 mg of sodium (about 1 mEq per each 250 mg of naproxen), this could be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted.

Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including naproxen and naproxen sodium, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.

### Diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium extended-release) [^117589xh]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see WARNINGS, GI Effects).

Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypertension

NSAIDs can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Congestive Heart Failure and Edema

Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Diclofenac sodium extended-release should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.

### Safety, tolerability, and effect on opioid use of meloxicam IV following orthopedic surgery [^111sPbt2]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Managing pain following orthopedic surgery can be challenging as post-orthopedic surgery patients report high pain scores, likely related to the nature of bone injuries. Effective pain management is important because uncontrolled postoperative pain is associated with several adverse outcomes, including delayed recovery, longer hospital stays, and increased morbidity. Guidelines for the management of postoperative pain strongly recommend an integrative approach, including the use of multimodal analgesia. This approach advocates the use of a variety of medications, routes of administration, and techniques that result in a synergistic and more effective approach to pain relief. Multimodal analgesia regimens are also a central component for enhanced recovery after surgery protocols and procedure-specific pain management initiatives. A major goal of multimodal pain management is the reduction in the need for opioids, which are associated with several well-documented risks (eg, dependence, abuse, diversion, hyperalgesia) and adverse events (AEs), including respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.–

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly recommended for incorporation in multimodal postoperative pain management regimens following orthopedic surgery.–These agents have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and opioid-reducing effects; however, they can be associated with AEs (eg, bleeding, cardiovascular complications, and renal effects) that have the potential to limit their use. Thus, a detailed examination of the safety profile of investigational NSAIDs or new formulations of known NSAIDs is important.

Meloxicam is a long-acting NSAID with preferential cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition that has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. The drug has been available in an oral formulation for many years; however, a limitation of oral meloxicam is poor aqueous solubility that results in slow absorption and a slow onset of action. This is evidenced by an observed peak plasma concentration that occurs 9 to 11 hrs after an orally administered dose of 30 mg. Consequently, oral meloxicam is not suitable for the treatment of acute pain. A novel nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam that can be given by intravenous (IV) bolus injection is being developed for moderate to severe pain management alone or in combination with other analgesics.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^115JwFk4]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Perioperative administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen demonstrated an opioid-sparing effect among subjects who underwent elective primary TKA. Meloxicam IV had a favorable AE profile comparable to that of placebo and was not associated with an increase in AEs associated with NSAIDs. Select measures of health care resource utilization also tended to be lower with meloxicam IV, including 10% lower mean total hospital charges. These results suggest that meloxicam IV has a promising role in multimodal analgesic regimens in this clinical setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design and Subjects

This 2-part multicenter study was approved by an independent ethics committee. All clinical work was conducted in compliance with current Good Clinical Practices as stated in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guideline E6, local regulatory requirements, and principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Before patient enrollment, this multicenter study was registered with(NCT01084161; principal investigators at each site [Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table S1,]; date of registration: March 5, 2010). All study subjects provided written informed consent before participation. The study was performed at 14 sites in 3 countries (Poland, Serbia, and Georgia) from August 6, 2010, to January 4, 2011. Part 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, single-dose study. Part 2 was a multiple-dose, open-label safety extension.

Women 18–65 years of age who were scheduled to undergo open abdominal hysterectomy with an anticipated incision length of ≥ 3 inches, who otherwise were in good health (American Society of Anesthesiology class I or II), were considered for study participation. Subjects were eligible for part 1 of the study if they experienced moderate-to-severe pain in ≤ 6 hours of morphine discontinuation, which took place at ≈6on postoperative day 1 (4-point Likert scale category of moderate or severe and visual analog scale [VAS] score ≥ 45 mm on a scale of 0–100 mm).

Exclusion criteria included active gastrointestinal bleeding or history of peptic ulcer disease; any known bleeding disorder or use of agents affecting coagulation; history of abdominal surgery, with the exception of inguinal hernia repair, lateral-approach appendectomy, or cesarean delivery performed > 1 year before study participation and yielding no postoperative complications; and history of chronic opioid use (> 30 consecutive days of use) for pain in the previous 2 years.

Subjects randomized to receive meloxicam IV in part 1 could be enrolled in the open-label extension (part 2) if they did not take rescue medication in the first 18 hours of the double-blind phase (responders). Subjects randomized to receive placebo or morphine in part 1 could be enrolled in part 2 if they used rescue medication within the first 18 hours of the double-blind phase (nonresponders).

Study Procedures

Per the standard of care in each participating institution, open abdominal hysterectomy was performed with subjects under general anesthesia, and postoperative morphine was administered by bolus IV injection or patient-controlled analgesia.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of meloxicam in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If meloxicam is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^1125eHHz]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

This study demonstrates that the number, intensity, and frequency of AEs reported by subjects in the meloxicam IV arm were similar to, or lower than, those reported by subjects in the placebo arm. The overall incidence of AEs did not differ from that of placebo, and there was no indication of an increased risk of events commonly associated with NSAIDs, such as bleeding, wound healing, and cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, or thrombotic events. Decreased opioid consumption in the meloxicam IV group correlated with a reduction of AEs commonly associated with opioids, particularly nausea and vomiting. Two items on the 7-point OBAS questionnaire were "distress and bother from vomiting" and "distress and bother from itching"; thus, reduction in these opioid-related AEs was coincident with the improvement in OBAS scores. In addition, meloxicam IV was associated with a lower cost of hospital stay.

TKA is among the most painful surgical procedures, and postoperative pain is a major determinant of delayed discharge after TKA. Findings of the present study are consistent with other data indicating that effective pain control reduces health care resource use for subjects who undergo TKA.

The interpretation of the results of this study are limited by the absence of active comparators. This was the first orthopedic study conducted with IV meloxicam initiated preoperatively and in the setting of multimodal therapy; thus, the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of meloxicam IV in this population in a multimodal setting against placebo. Additional studies including active comparators (eg, oral meloxicam, IV NSAIDS) are needed to determine relative efficacy and safety of these agents in this setting.

### Literature review: are NSAIDs harmful and is acetaminophen well tolerated? [^116mPu3s]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On the basis of previous literature, NSAID use is typically avoided in patients at risk for kidney disease, while acetaminophen has generally been considered well tolerated. However, the extent of NSAID effect on the kidneys is not clear, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the concerns about the safety of acetaminophen have been rising. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence of the effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the context of nephrology and hypertension.

Recent Findings

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by NSAIDs is higher with longer courses and in the presence of several factors such as older age, diabetes mellitus, lower eGFR, diuretic use and cardiovascular disease. The timing of NSAID use in relation to the onset of AKI may affect its progression. Regular NSAID use could be associated with an increased incidence of CKD, but the relation between NSAID use and CKD progression is less clear. Regular acetaminophen use was associated with increased SBP, while its use could have a renoprotective effect in certain situations.

Summary

In patients at risk of kidney disease, NSAIDs may be used cautiously after discussing possible adverse effects. Regular acetaminophen use should be reassessed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

In secondary analyses, we assessed whether the risk of acute kidney injury associated with double and triple therapy combinations varied according to half life of NSAIDs and duration of use (that is, length of exposure to double or triple therapy combination). Thus, patients deemed to be current users of such combinations were further categorised according to whether they used NSAIDs with short half lives (< 12 hours: aceclofenac, acemetacin, diclofenac, etodolac, fenbufen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indometacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, tiaprofenic acid, aspirin) or long half lives (≥ 12 hours: azaprazone, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, piroxican, sulindac, tenoxicam), as well as according to duration of exposure (≤ 30, 31–60, 61–90, > 90 days). We assessed effect modification by half life of NSAID and duration of use of double and triple therapy combinations by including interaction terms between those categories and the relevant exposure groups.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^113SWGuT]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients typically report high levels of pain after orthopedic surgery, and managing this pain can be challenging. The importance of effective pain management is underscored by adverse outcomes associated with uncontrolled postoperative pain, which include delayed recovery, longer hospital stays, readmissions, increased morbidity, and decreased quality of life. In an effort to improve the management of postoperative pain, current guidelines strongly recommend an integrative approach, including use of multimodal analgesia and minimization of opioids.

In the past, the limited number of options to treat moderate-to-severe pain led to overreliance on the use of opioids. Given the potential risks associated with opioids, such as addiction, gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs), pruritus, and respiratory depression, among others, there has been an increased emphasis on using alternative medications and decreasing opioid use in patients who undergo elective or nonelective surgical procedures. In general, it is recommended that opioids be used at the lowest possible dose and not in isolation. Therefore, a multimodal analgesic regimen that includes two or more analgesic agents with different mechanisms of action to provide enhanced analgesia is a rational approach. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for this purpose, as they have not only demonstrated efficacy for reducing postoperative pain, but have also demonstrated benefits with respect to patient satisfaction (improved), opioid consumption and related AEs (reduced), systemic inflammation (reduced), and time to recovery (shortened). However, they can lead to serious side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding, exacerbation of respiratory disease, thrombotic events, and renal or hepatic injury, the risk of which may be related to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selectivity. Furthermore, few intravenous (IV) options are currently available.

### Safety, tolerability, and effect on opioid use of meloxicam IV following orthopedic surgery [^111yVp1B]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Although statistical comparisons were not performed, there was a trend toward a decrease in common opioid-related AEs such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and pruritus. This is consistent with other studies suggesting that NSAIDs that have an opioid-reducing effect are associated with a decrease in opioid-related AEs. For example, a meta-analysis of 22-double-blind trials including 2307 patients that evaluated NSAIDs in the treatment of postoperative pain found a positive correlation between the reduction of morphine usage and the incidence of nausea and vomiting. This analysis found that for each milligram of morphine spared by NSAIDs, the incidences of postoperative nausea and vomiting were decreased by 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. The benefit was particularly evident in the subgroup of studies conducted in orthopedic surgery, with NSAIDs associated with a 34% reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting. In the current study, meloxicam IV was associated with a significant reduction in total opioid use of > 25%, which corresponded to a total decrease of 12 IVMED. Thus, the reduction in opioid use in the meloxicam IV group in this study may have contributed to a lower incidence of AEs commonly associated with opioid use. Overall, these results suggest that meloxicam IV is a well-tolerated option for use in pain management in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and its use may contribute to the goal of minimizing the use of opioid medications.

A major limitation of this study is that it is a subgroup analysis of a randomized trial and was not powered to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between treatment groups for the safety variables assessed. An additional limitation is that analgesic needs can be quite different across diverse orthopedic procedures and this study did not assess pain scores as reported by subjects as a measure of analgesic efficacy. Mean opioid consumption was assessed in this study as a surrogate measure of analgesic efficacy.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^115ozYHB]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The approach to patients with acute pain begins by identifying the underlying cause and a disease-specific treatment. The first-line pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain is acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The choice between these two medications depends on the type of pain and patient risk factors for NSAID-related adverse effects (e.g., gastrointestinal, renovascular, or cardiovascular effects). Different NSAIDs have similar analgesic effects. However, cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) must be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and are more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs. If these first-line agents are not sufficient for mild to moderate pain, medications that target separate pathways simultaneously, such as an acetaminophen/opioid combination, are reasonable choices. Severe acute pain is typically treated with potent opioids. At each step, adjuvant medications directed at the underlying condition can be used. Newer medications with dual actions (e.g., tapentadol) are also an option. There is little evidence that one opioid is superior for pain control, but there are some pharmacologic differences among opioids. Because of the growing misuse and diversion of controlled substances, caution should be used when prescribing opioids, even for short-term treatment. Patients should be advised to properly dispose of unused medications.

### Meloxicam (Xifyrm) [^1175YXpC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 2 (Abdominoplasty Surgery) In the second controlled, multiple-dose trial (NCT02678286) of adult patients with postoperative pain who underwent elective abdominoplasty surgery, 219 patients were treated with meloxicam injection 30 mg or placebo administered once daily for two days starting on the day of surgery. An optional third dose was permitted just prior to discharge. A minimum postoperative baseline pain intensity of 4 on the NPRS (range 0–10) and pain categorized as moderate or severe were required for randomization. The majority of patients were female (98%). The average age was 40 years. The mean overall baseline pain intensity on the NPRS was 7.3. A statistically significant difference demonstrating efficacy was observed in the primary efficacy endpoint of the summed pain intensity difference over the first 24 hours (SPID24) as well as over the first 48 hours (SPID48). The average pain intensity over time is depicted for the treatment groups in Figure 3. A generally consistent separation in pain scores between the meloxicam injection and placebo group was observed from time of onset through most of the dosing interval with a narrowing at the end of the first 24-hour dosing interval.

Onset of Meaningful Pain Relief and Use of Rescue Analgesic Medication

The median time to first rescue analgesic use in patients treated with meloxicam injection (2 hours in Study 1 and 1 hour in Study 2) came before the median time to patient-reported meaningful pain relief in both studies (2 hours in Study 1 and 3 hours in Study 2). Fifty percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 49% of patients treated with placebo in Study 1 received rescue analgesia medication in the first 2 hours after the start of dosing. Seventy-eight percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 78% of patients treated with placebo in Study 2 received rescue in the first 3 hours after the start of dosing.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

For intravenous administration only.

The recommended dosage of XIFYRM is 30 mg once daily, administered by intravenous bolus injection over 15 seconds.

When initiating XIFYRM, monitor patient analgesic response. Because the median time to meaningful pain relief was 2 and 3 hours after XIFYRM administration in two clinical studies, a non-NSAID analgesic with a rapid onset of effect may be needed, for example, upon anesthetic emergence or resolution of local or regional anesthetic blocks [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Some patients may not experience adequate analgesia for the entire 24-hour dosing interval and may require administration of a short-acting, non-NSAID, immediate-release analgesic [see Clinical Studies (14)].

To reduce the risk of renal toxicity, patients must be well hydrated prior to administration of XIFYRM.

Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Should the contents appear discolored or contain particulate matter, discard the vial [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)].

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^115Sc2NG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the treatment of degenerative joint disease provides patients with an improved quality of life and better functional status; however, the procedure can result in moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. Historically, opioid medications have been the cornerstone of postoperative analgesia after TKA, but our improved understanding of pain physiology and transmission helped to usher in the era of multimodal analgesia. The premise of multimodal analgesia is to use nonnarcotic medications such as acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), among others, to reduce opioid-related adverse effects while providing improved pain management. For example, the tissue damage during TKA causes the release of arachidonic acid, the precursor to prostaglandins, resulting in a hyperalgesiac response from the peripheral nerves. Because NSAIDs block the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, causing a subsequent reduction in the hyperalgesiac response, NSAIDs can be used to reduce postoperative pain as an alternative to opioid medications.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are categorized based on their ability to selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform that is responsible for the production of prostiglandins. Nonselective NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) provide relatively equivalent inhibition of the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms while selective COX-2 NSAIDs are subcategorized as highly selective (eg, celecoxib) and preferentially selective (eg, meloxicam) COX-2 NSAIDs. Although meloxicam does have a preference for binding with COX-2, it also inhibits COX-1 at the higher dosage regimens of 15 mg daily. Because COX-1 is constitutively expressed throughout the body and plays a role in platelet function, protection of gastric mucosa, and renal function, it resulted in the development of the selective and preferentially selective COX-2 NSAIDs with the intention to limit the negative effect of COX-1 inhibition. Nevertheless, realizing the full benefit of highly selective COX-2 inhibition while avoiding the complications associated with COX-1 inhibition has not come to fruition.

The purpose of this study was to compare the complication rates related to COX-1 inhibition between those who receive either a nonselective (meloxicam 15 mg/d), preferential COX-2 (meloxicam 7.5 mg/d) or a highly selective COX-2 (celecoxib) NSAID after primary TKA and determine whether meloxicam, at a dose of 15 mg/d, is more cost-effective when considering the potential cost of increased complications related to COX-1 inhibition.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113cATr4]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although in vitro COX-2 selectivity is a chemical feature of the NSAID, COX-2 selectivity measured in whole blood following dosing depends on the dose administered.NSAIDs are administered at doses that are not bioequivalent with respect to the extent of inhibition of monocyte COX-2 (which represents a target for drug efficacy) obtained at maximal concentration of drug in the systemic circulation after dosing (C max). In particular, NSAIDs with short half-lives (eg, diclofenac) are often given at higher doses to extend their duration of clinical efficacy (analgesic or anti-inflammatory effect). As shown in Figure 3, diclofenac 50 mg three times daily is associated with a higher inhibitory effect (> 90% inhibition) over 8 hours following dosing compared with other NSAIDs. Different NSAIDs are associated with a differential impact of platelet COX-1 (which represents an index of drug-associated side effects) depending upon their COX isozyme selectivity. Thus, administration of high-dose diclofenac and meloxicam, which have comparable and intermediate COX-2 selectivity in vitro, results in partial inhibition of COX-1. Further, the anti-inflammatory and full analgesic effects of NSAIDs are associated with plasma concentrations that inhibit whole-blood COX-2 activity by 80% (IC 80). Therefore, for drugs such as diclofenac, lowering the dose will lead to circulating concentrations near the COX-2 IC 80 values, which correlate with adequate analgesia while reducing COX-1–mediated side effects.

### Ibuprofen oral (ibuprofen) [^114bdAhz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, ibuprofen should be discontinued.

Drug Interactions

ACE-Inhibitors

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.

Aspirin

Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated interference with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin when ibuprofen 400 mg, given three times daily, is administered with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin. The interaction exists even following a once-daily regimen of ibuprofen 400 mg, particularly when ibuprofen is dosed prior to aspirin. The interaction is alleviated if immediate-release low-dose aspirin is dosed at least 2 hours prior to a once-daily regimen of ibuprofen; however, this finding cannot be extended to enteric-coated low-dose aspirin [see Clinical Pharmacology / Pharmacodynamics].

Because there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to the interference of ibuprofen with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, for patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection who require analgesics, consider use of an NSAID that does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, or non-NSAID analgesics, where appropriate.

As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of IBUPROFEN and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.

Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that ibuprofen can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

### Single dose oral meloxicam for acute postoperative pain in adults [^113qxiH2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used mainly in treating pain associated with arthritis. The usual oral dose for osteoarthritis is 15 mg daily, but lower doses of 7.5 mg are advised in older patients. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study has been used for many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of single dose oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (June 2009); EMBASE (June 2009); the Oxford Pain Relief Database.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral meloxicam for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We planned to use area under the "pain relief versus time" curve to derive the proportion of participants with meloxicam experiencing least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations; to use number needed to treat to benefit (NNT); the proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period; time to use of rescue analgesia; information on adverse events and withdrawals.

Main Results

No studies were identified by the searches that examined oral meloxicam in patients with established postoperative pain.

Authors' Conclusions

In the absence of evidence of efficacy, at present, for oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes, there is no urgent research agenda.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^111trwJh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

After receiving exemption from our institutional review board, we searched our institutional database to identify patients who received a primary TKA between January 2015 and February 2020 who used celecoxib or meloxicam for postoperative analgesia. Because meloxicam acts as a preferential COX-2 inhibitor at lower doses and a nonselective NSAID at higher does, patients taking meloxicam were further stratified into a 15 mg/d meloxicam cohort and 7.5 mg/d meloxicam cohort, and as such, three cohorts of patients were analyzed. A total of 4,994 patients were included in this study who took either celecoxib (n = 3,174), meloxicam 15 mg/d (n = 1,369), or meloxicam 7.5 mg/d (n = 451) for postoperative TKA analgesia. Baseline characteristics between the three groups were similar with the exception of a slightly higher percentage of men in the celecoxib cohort, slightly higher BMI in the meloxicam cohorts, and lower CCI in the meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohort (Table 1); however, the age-adjusted CCI demonstrated similarity among the three cohorts. Patients were either prescribed meloxicam 7.5 mg/d, meloxicam 15 mg/d, or celecoxib because of surgeon preference. Surgeons tended to choose one medication and one dosage regimen and did not switch over to another medication based on perceived risk. Patient pain protocols were otherwise similar among the three groups, and all patients were prescribed with a proton-pump inhibitor as a part of the standard of care at our institution. Patients who did not fill their prescriptions or were found to not be taking the prescription were excluded. After reviewing discharge records and patient charts, a total of 4,994 patients were included in the study.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^116X9ykw]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Meloxicam is an NSAID with a prolonged half-life that has preferential, but not exclusive, inhibition of COX-2, demonstrating a more favorable gastrointestinal AE profile (ie, lower rates of GI-related AEs [dyspepsia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, GI mucosal damage]) than that of nonselective NSAIDs. Intravenously administered meloxicam (meloxicam IV) utilizes a novel nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam and has been evaluated in seven phase 2 and 3 postoperative studies in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain following hard-tissue surgery or soft-tissue surgery.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of perioperative administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg (first dose administered prior to surgery) on opioid consumption in subjects undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In this study, meloxicam IV was used as part of a multimodal pain management regimen to provide pain relief in accordance with generally accepted good practices. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety of meloxicam IV 30 mg and to evaluate its effect on postoperative pain, as well as associated health care resource utilization, compared with that of placebo.

### Novel immediate / sustained-release formulation of acetaminophen-ibuprofen combination (paxerol ®) for severe nocturia associated with overactive bladder: a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm trial [^114iPKHD]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies have shown how modulation of PG pathway impacts nocturia. PG synthesis inhibitors reduce void frequency and volume in enuresis, 12 indomethacin relieves symptoms of BPH, 4 aspirin and diclofenac relieve nocturnal polyuria symptoms, 13, 14 diclofenac improves nocturnal polyuria symptoms, 15 and celecoxib reduces NV and International Prostate Symptom Scores. 16 Tamsulosin and meloxicam combination has been shown to improve symptoms and NQOL scores greater than tamsulosin alone. 17

The current study used ibuprofen and acetaminophen because they have synergy in analgesic effect, 18, 19 which may also alleviate nocturia. Concurrent administrations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen are free of drug‐to‐drug interactions, and show no changes in pharmacokinetics or bioavailability compared to either drug alone. 18, 19, 20, 21

Ibuprofen (150 mg) and acetaminophen (325 mg) combination was formulated into novel immediate:sustained (50%:50%) release (IR/SR) tablets, referred to as Paxerol. One‐half of each tablet is released during the first hour via IR to provide "loading dose" effect, and the other half is released via SR for up to 6 h to coincide with 6‐8 h sleep duration. The current study is the first human study of Paxerol, involving a Phase 2, double‐blinded, randomized, placebo‐controlled design to assess short‐term efficacy and safety of three dose levels of Paxerol in OAB patients with severe nocturia.

Health Care Utilization

With respect to charges associated with hospital stays, the total amount was approximately 10% lower for the meloxicam IV group compared with subjects in the placebo group (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Table S2). The duration of hospital stay was numerically shorter for subjects who received meloxicam IV versus placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.4935) (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Table S2). Findings for other resource utilization parameters (all-cause readmissions, emergency department visits due to pain, physician office phone calls due to pain, and skilled nursing facility admission and duration) were lower for the meloxicam IV group, but statistical comparisons were not performed (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Table S2).

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^114FJH66]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Results of the present study demonstrate that meloxicam IV provided significant analgesic effect and, in general, was well tolerated in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy. The onset of pain relief after the administration of meloxicam IV occurred within 6–8 minutes postdose, and analgesic effects were maintained for 24 hours after dosing. Doses of 5–60 mg produced statistically significant improvements in SPID 24 and TOTPAR 24 relative to placebo; the 30 mg dose produced the greatest treatment effect. Moreover, meloxicam IV doses of ≥ 15 mg significantly improved SPID 24 and TOTPAR 24 relative to morphine. Beneficial effects on secondary outcome measures were also observed, and patient-reported GES suggested a preference for meloxicam IV over morphine for all but the lowest dose of meloxicam IV.

Importantly, meloxicam IV was associated with a significantly reduced need for rescue medication; total rescue opioid consumption was 42%–71% lower with meloxicam IV versus placebo during the double-blind phase. Meloxicam IV doses of 15, 30, and 60 mg were also associated with significantly lower overall rescue opioid consumption versus morphine. Opioid monotherapy has been a mainstay and standard of care for postoperative pain management and has demonstrated adequate pain reduction in a variety of soft-tissue surgical procedures. Morphine was a rigorous comparator in this surgical model; it is highly effective, acts rapidly with clearly defined efficacy, and does not require dose adjustment for renal impairment, unlike other current nonopioid IV analgesics.

Other studies have evaluated the preoperative administration of meloxicam formulations, including suppositories or oral tablets for reducing postoperative pain after hysterectomy. – In these studies, meloxicam appears to provide effective analgesia; however, in some cases, investigators observed that morphine consumption was not significantly reduced for subjects who received meloxicam compared with placebo. The relatively poor solubility and slow absorption rate of these meloxicam formulations, may not provide maximum analgesia in the immediate postoperative period. Bolus IV injections of meloxicam administered postoperatively provided onset of analgesia as early as 6 minutes postdose, and the IV formulation provides a useful alternative in the immediate postoperative period.

### Approaching acute pain in emergency settings; European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) guidelines-part 2: management and recommendations [^111VWKcy]. Internal and Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that COX-2 inhibitors are used only in a few countries across Europe for the management of acute pain, reflecting perhaps the limited evidence for their use in this setting. Recognize that celecoxib 200 or 400 mg has been suggested to be as effective as ibuprofen 600 mg
in patients with musculoskeletal pain, which suggests that its use is limited in preference to ibuprofen; and parecoxib has demonstrated comparable efficacy to ketoprofen in patients with renal colic
, and IV morphine in patients with abdominal pain.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^116Ge6B5]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Analgesia-Based Therapy: Paracetamol

Paracetamol (Tylenol) is another analgesic option for primary dysmenorrhea. Paracetamol has been shown to also effect the COX pathway. However, it predominately acts within the central nervous system and has a weak effect on peripheral anti-inflammatory pathways, making it a second-line option for treating primary dysmenorrhea after NSAIDs. Within the central nervous system, paracetamol activates descending serotonergic pathways and may influence cannabinoid receptors, mediating its analgesic and antipyretic effects. While paracetamol alone may not be as effective as NSAIDs in reducing pelvic pain, it is a good alternative for women who have contraindications or intolerance to NSAIDs. Furthermore, paracetamol in conjunction with either Pamabrom, a mild diuretic agent, or Caffeine, has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of dysmenorrhea with minimal side effects.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^112kKtep]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although the importance of a patient's medical history has been stressed when prescribing NSAIDS, particularly higher doses of meloxicam, it has an equivalent safety profile to celecoxib after primary TKA. Meloxicam usage, particularly at higher doses does not seem to increase the risk of complications potentially related to COX-1 inhibition. Therefore, meloxicam may be considered a safe and low cost alternative to celecoxib for TJA postoperative analgesia.

### Identifying and assessing benefit-risk in primary care – a family physician's perspective [^111hsi9n]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

NSAIDs and other conditions

All NSAIDs can also raise blood pressure and interfere with the blood pressure lowering effects of certain medication classes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The concomitant use of NSAIDs with diuretics increases the likelihood of nephrotoxicity as well as interfering with their blood pressure lowering effects. Electrolyte issues — particularly hyperkalaemia, are also associated with NSAID use. NSAIDs, both traditional and Cox-2 selective inhibitors must, therefore, be used with caution in all patients with renal failure. Congestive heart failure can also be exacerbated by traditional and Cox-2 selective NSAIDs.

### Single dose oral sulindac for acute postoperative pain in adults [^114jTx9w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) licensed for use in rheumatic disease and other musculoskeletal disorders in the UK, and widely available in other countries worldwide. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral sulindac in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study has been used for many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of single dose oral sulindac in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies up to June 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral sulindac for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We planned to use area under the "pain relief versus time" curve to derive the proportion of participants with meloxicam experiencing least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations; to use number needed to treat to benefit (NNT); the proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period; time to use of rescue analgesia; information on adverse events and withdrawals.

Main Results

No studies were identified by the searches that examined oral sulindac in patients with established postoperative pain.

Authors' Conclusions

In the absence of evidence of efficacy, at present, for oral sulindac in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes, there is no urgent research agenda.

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see GI WARNINGS).

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypertension

NSAIDs, including piroxicam capsules, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including piroxicam capsules, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Congestive Heart Failure and Edema

Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Piroxicam capsules should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.

### Safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate to severe pain following laparoscopic abdominal surgery [^11162UMc]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery is one of the major concerns of patients. Improper pain management can be associated with varied respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and psychological complications. Pain after laparoscopic surgery may be transient or persistentand opioids have traditionally been the mainstay treatment for postoperative pain. Increasing evidence exists to support a multimodal treatment approach for postoperative pain that reduces opioid side effects and decreases pain intensity (PI) scores. A proprietary nanocrystal intravenous (NIV) formulation of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam, a long-acting preferential cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, is being evaluated with the aim of providing rapid and sustained analgesia.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Osteoarthritis Pain

The efficacy of VIVLODEX in the management of osteoarthritis pain was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled study comparing VIVLODEX 5 mg or 10 mg taken once daily and placebo in patients with pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The study evaluated 402 patients with a mean age of 61 (range 40 to 87 years). Osteoarthritis pain was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale. The mean baseline WOMAC Pain Subscale Score across treatment groups was 73 mm using a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 12 in the WOMAC Pain Subscale Score. VIVLODEX 5 mg and 10 mg once daily significantly reduced osteoarthritis pain compared with placebo, as measured by changes in WOMAC Pain Subscale Scores. Although both the 5 mg and 10 mg doses significantly reduced pain compared to placebo, the proportion of responders achieving various percentage reductions in pain intensity from baseline to Week 12 is similar for both the 5 mg and 10 mg once daily doses. The proportion (%) of patients in each group who demonstrated reduction in their pain intensity score from baseline to Week 12 is shown in Figure 1. The figure is cumulative, so patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 30%, are also included in every level of pain reduction below 30%. Patients who did not complete the study were classified as non-responders.

### Perioperative opioid-sparing strategies: utility of conventional NSAIDs in adults [^116Pnwr3]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Opioids have long been used to treat acute postsurgical and postprocedural pain; however, opioid-related adverse events (AEs) contribute to poor patient outcomes. In addition, perisurgical exposure to opioids can potentially increase the risk for opioid-use disorder. NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation by a mechanism different from that of opioid analgesics and may be useful in reducing the need for opioid drugs as part of a multimodal analgesia strategy. We conducted this review to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of adjunctive conventional NSAIDs given systemically in the perioperative setting in terms of opioid-sparing effects observed postoperatively.

Methods

Clinical trials published since 2000 that have assessed the opioid-sparing effects of conventional, nonselective NSAIDs were identified by a literature search using the PubMed search engine. Search terms were identified for the treatment of interest, the timing of the intervention, and the drugs of interest (NSAIDs). Data from studies that assessed opioid consumption outcomes with systemic NSAID administration were included in the review; data from studies in which NSAIDs were administered topically or via periarticular injection, local infiltration, or regional block were excluded.

Findings

Upon full-text review of the search results, 32 studies were chosen for inclusion in this literature review. These studies included those that assessed diclofenac, ketorolac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, dexketoprofen, flurbiprofen, lornoxicam, tenoxicam, meloxicam, and piroxicam. In studies in which NSAIDs were associated with opioid-sparing effects within the setting of patient-controlled analgesia, opioid use was reduced by 17%-∼50% with diclofenac, 9%-66% with ketorolac, 22%-46% with ibuprofen, 34%-66% with ketoprofen, 36%-50% with dexketoprofen, 38%-41% with tenoxicam, 36%-54% with lornoxicam, and ∼50% with flurbiprofen. No opioid-sparing effect was noted with meloxicam (1 study). The majority of studies that reported on pain-score changes revealed either pain reductions with NSAIDs versus placebo or similar pain scores between groups, indicating that NSAIDs did not compromise pain control. Although many studies found no difference in the prevalence of AEs in NSAID-treated patients compared with controls, several studies noted lower rates of nausea, vomiting, sedation, and pruritus with NSAIDs versus placebo. Conversely, NSAID-related AEs were few overall but included gastrointestinal bleeding, injection site reactions, transient oliguric renal failure, and dizziness. No surgery-related bleeding complications were observed.

Implications

NSAIDs have the potential to play an important role in reducing postoperative opioid requirements. Reducing the amount of opioids used could be expected to reduce opioid-related side effects and contribute to reversing the opioid epidemic.

Diuretic renal scintigraphy — diclofenac effects and repeat study consideration: Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that blocks the production of prostaglandins, has been shown to inhibit spontaneous ureteric contraction, prolong transit time, and delay the time to peak height of the renogram curve for 99mTc-MAG3 in healthy individuals. Ideally, this drug should be discontinued before the scan to minimize the possibility of an indeterminate or false-positive result. If abnormal drainage suggesting obstruction occurs in a patient receiving diclofenac, consideration should be given to repeating the study after diclofenac has been discontinued.

### Meloxicam-desmopressin drug-drug interaction producing hyponatremia [^114ubetw]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with schizophrenia and medical comorbidities are often on multiple medications to manage their symptoms. Herein we present a case of drug-drug interaction (meloxicam and desmopressin), in a patient also on clozapine, that ultimately resulted in hyponatremia and seizure.

Methods

The patient provided consent to have his case published. We searched PubMed and after reviewing 321 articles, 11 were chosen for relevance.

Results

Meloxicam enhanced the adverse effect (hyponatremia) of desmopressin and was the likely culprit.

Conclusions

In a patient with higher ADH levels, as in our patient taking desmopressin, the addition of an NSAID could further increase water retention and worsen hyponatremia; indeed, meloxicam was the only new medication added to the patient's regimen, and a drug interaction calculator supports the desmopressin-meloxicam drug-drug interaction as the culprit. We urge clinicians to avoid the use of desmopressin in patients with schizophrenia as this can lead to water intoxication. As meloxicam may worsen desmopressin-induced hyponatremia and could result in seizure, one should avoid using NSAIDs in patients with schizophrenia whom are also prescribed vasopressin/desmopressin. Serum sodium levels should be closely monitored in patients with schizophrenia whose regimen includes desmopressin.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Start with 5 mg orally once daily. May increase dose to 10 mg in patients who require additional analgesia (2.1)
Use the lowest effective dose for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (2.1)
VIVLODEX capsules are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral meloxicam even if the milligram strength is the same. (2.2)

2.1 Dosage

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

For management of osteoarthritis pain, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg orally once daily. Dose may be increased to 10 mg in patients who require additional analgesia. The maximum recommended daily oral dose of VIVLODEX is 10 mg.

In patients on hemodialysis, the maximum daily dosage is 5 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.2 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Meloxicam

VIVLODEX capsules have not shown equivalent systemic exposure to other formulations of oral meloxicam. Therefore, VIVLODEX capsules are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral meloxicam even if the total milligram strength is the same. Do not substitute similar dose strengths of other meloxicam products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### Need for a judicious use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid community-acquired acute kidney injury [^112FzdNJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Millions of Americans use over-the-counter analgesics on a daily basis, and nearly 100 million nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescriptions are filled per year. In high-risk patients, these medications can disrupt kidney hemodynamics and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The risk of NSAID-associated CA-AKI increases 3- to 5-fold in patients taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics concurrently. CA-AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or accelerating progression of pre-existing CKD. Importantly, many cases of NSAID-induced CA-AKI may be avoided by identifying high-risk patients and providing patient and provider education on when to avoid these medications and minimize risk.

Question 13: What Peri-Procedural Best Practices are Recommended to Optimize Response to Injectable Biologics?

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and Anti-Platelet Agents

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in the chronic pain patient as an initial adjunct to improve pain control. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder for non-cancer recommends starting these agents first in patients with chronic pain. With the widespread use of these agents, special care should be taken prior to proceeding with injectable biologics.

Various forms of NSAIDS exist, including those that are cyclooxygenase (COX) selective (eg, COX-1 or COX-2) and those that are non-selective. Broadly however, the critical component of NSAID interaction with injectable biologics is the potential ability to disrupt platelet aggregation, which may lead to reduced effectiveness. On a fundamental level, NSAIDs, and more specifically COX-1 specific medications, can disrupt the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) pathway which can lead to reduced platelet aggregation. Many of the injectable biologic agents, such as PRP, heavily rely on the platelet aggregation which stimulates the release of growth factors; however, this process may be impaired in patients who are concurrently receiving NSAID therapy.

For instance, even after limited non-selective NSAID administration, thromboxane production and platelet aggregation have been found to be significantly reduced by greater than 95%. A similar trend has not been observed however with the administration on COX-2 selective inhibitors, such as meloxicam, whereby platelet aggregation was still maintained in healthy adults despite this medication use. This suggests that physicians wishing to utilize injectable biologics should take special caution when patients are on COX-1 selective inhibitors for pain management. In the post-operative phase, similar caution should also be used. Injectable biologics can take upwards of 8 weeks to achieve peak effect. Indeed, it has been found that co-administration of NSAIDs alongside PRP may lead to a reduction in release of growth factors; however, evidence is conflicting with others suggesting no significant decrease in growth factor levels after use.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1134jx7H]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Rescue Medication Use.

Compared with placebo, all active treatments reduced the likelihood of requiring rescue medication in the first 24 hours postdose (P < .001). Relative to placebo subjects, those who received meloxicam IV 60 or 30 mg were 90% less likely to require rescue medication during the first 24 hours, with an HR of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.16) for the meloxicam IV 60 mg group and an HR of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.17) for the meloxicam IV 30 mg group. Those who received meloxicam IV 15, 7.5, or 5 mg were 86% (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09–0.23), 80% (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14–0.30), and 81% (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.12–0.29) less likely to require rescue medication in the first 24 hours, respectively.

Compared with morphine, all meloxicam IV doses reduced the likelihood of rescue medication use within the first 24 hours postdose (P ≤ .010). Relative to morphine, meloxicam IV 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg doses reduced the risk of rescue medication use in the first 24 hours by 72% (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18–0.45; P < .001), 73% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45; P < .001), 62% (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23–0.61; P < .001), 41% (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.88; p = 0.010), and 45% (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85; p = 0.007), respectively.

Discussion

Although protocols for pain management after TKA have improved patient outcomes, a substantial proportion of patients still experience residual pain and functional limitations, with residual pain being a major factor in patient dissatisfaction. Thus, better pain control has the potential to improve patient satisfaction and functionality. Opioids are frequently used for pain control in patients who undergo TKA (> 40% of cases), but there are concerns about the negative consequences of overreliance on these agents, including AEs and the risk of dependence. There are data to suggest that preoperative opioid use is associated with worse patient outcomes after total joint arthroplasty. A meta-analysis of six studies that involved assessment of patient-reported outcomes after TKA demonstrated that preoperative opioid use was linked to significantly worse patient-reported outcome scores relative to nonuse of preoperative opioids. Thus, regimens that reduce the need for perioperative opioids may have potential benefits. For example, effective pain management that minimizes opioid use was shown to improve postoperative rehabilitation and decrease length of stay. In addition, data suggest that NSAID use in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery is associated with reductions in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, with one meta-analysis demonstrating a decrease of approximately 30% in these AEs when NSAIDs were combined with patient-controlled morphine analgesia.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^112RobTq]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A large impediment to the wider adoption of oral NSAIDs for postoperative primary TKA analgesia are concerns regarding the GI and renal adverse effects associated with COX-1 inhibition from nonselective NSAIDs, especially with the increased utilization of postoperative IV ketorolac, IV corticosteroids, and VTE prophylaxis of aspirin. Currently, limited evidence is available regarding the safety profile of nonselective NSAIDs after discharge from primary TJA. In light of the opioid epidemic, a working committee of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Hip Society, Knee Society, and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine have suggested that the safety of nonselective NSAIDs after primary TKA be investigated.

Therefore, we sought to investigate for any potential differences in COX-1 inhibition-related postoperative complications between nonselective NSAID dosing of meloxicam, preferential COX-2 NSAID dosing of meloxicam, or highly selective COX-2 NSAID dosing of celecoxib. Our findings suggest that using meloxicam at either a nonselective (15 mg/d) or preferential COX-2 (7.5 mg/d) dose as a part of a postoperative multimodal TKA pain protocol does not seem to result in an increased incidence of postoperative GI bleeding compared with the usage of celecoxib, P = 0.4, considering that patients in the three cohorts had similar GI risk profiles: 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0% of patients in the celecoxib, meloxicam 15 mg/d, and meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohorts had a history of peptic ulcer disease (P = 1.0). These findings did not agree with our hypothesis because we expected patients on meloxicam, particularly when consuming 15 mg/d, to have a greater incidence of GI bleeding and ulceration based on meloxicam being a nonselective NSAID at higher doses.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen and naproxen are commonly used in both the pre-hospital and emergency department settings for mild-to-moderate pain, particularly with an inflammatory component, and are most commonly administered PO, IV or topically; they remain the preferred analgesic in renal colic, with observed equivalence to opioid or opioid-acetaminophen combined analgesia at 30 minutes

### Review of extended-release formulations of tramadol for the management of chronic non-cancer pain: focus on marketed formulations [^113HQXSf]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Although NSAIDs may be helpful with pain flares, it is recommended in most cases that they should not be used chronically on a daily basis given their associated significant side effects, including end-stage renal disease in two out of every 1,000 patients who use them daily for 5 years or more. The use of analgesic combination products is also associated with significant side effects. Chronic use of NSAIDS, aspirin, or acetaminophen is found be associated with hepatotoxicity, coagulopathy, end-stage renal disease, and death. Ulcer formation occurs in 2%–4% of chronic NSAID users every year.NSAIDs have also been associated with reducing the effectiveness of some antihypertensives (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics) and increasing the effect of sulfonylureas when used in conjunction with these drugs. These effects are generally prostaglandin-mediated and therefore not seen with Tramadol or opioids.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^112VHMhn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Meloxicam IV generally was well tolerated in this study, with a low incidence of AEs, 2 discontinuations (due to "a desire to withdraw from the study"), no deaths, and no serious treatment-related AEs. In the combined treatment phases, the most commonly reported AE was anemia. This outcome likely reflects the procedure for reporting anemia in the study protocol and was not deemed clinically meaningful by the principal investigators.

Potential limitations of this study include the use of only single doses of morphine in the double-blind phase (morphine typically can be administered every 4 hours as needed) and the lack of comparators in the open-label extension. Furthermore, methods of imputation may have influenced the findings. For efficacy analyses, missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward approach. The scores for pain intensity and pain relief for any time points after the administration of rescue medication were imputed using the last score before the rescue dose. For the analyses of time to first perceptible pain relief, time to first meaningful pain relief, and time to first rescue analgesic, data from patients who withdrew prematurely or took rescue medication were right censored. Last, subjects who were nonresponders in the meloxicam IV treatment arms in the double-blind phase and subjects who received morphine or placebo and did not require rescue medication were not eligible to enter the open-label extension phase.

In summary, meloxicam IV at doses of 5–60 mg produced statistically significant improvement in pain intensity and pain relief compared with placebo in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy. Onset of pain relief with meloxicam IV ranged from 6 to 8 minutes and was comparable to that of morphine; analgesic effect was maintained for ≤ 24 hours. Meloxicam IV was generally well tolerated and reduced opioid consumption. Findings of this study support further (phase 3) studies of the efficacy and safety of the IV formulation of meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain.

### A retrospective study on potential drug ‒ drug interactions in patients with severe asthma receiving biological therapy: a single-center experience [^112uHYTy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Potential DDIs with ICSs are minimal due to their low systemic absorption and low plasma concentration. Therefore, most pDDIs, including corticosteroids, are attributed to OCS. The highest level of interactions they encountered was D, with calcium salts, which may reduce the bioavailability of OCS. It is recommended that their application be separated by at least 2 h. OCSs also encountered pDDIs of significance level C with the following medications: diuretics (furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and indapamide), antidiabetics (metformin, insulin aspart, gliclazide, linagliptin, and empagliflozin), acetylsalicylic acid, warfarin, NSAIDs (meloxicam, naproxen, and ibuprofen), carbamazepine, phenobarbital, verapamil, and empagliflozin. The mechanisms and recommendations are available in Supplement 1.

Muscarinic receptor antagonists (MRAs)

The highest level of interactions these drugs encounter is X, either between each other or with antihistamines (bilastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, levocetirizine). In both cases, the mechanism of these interactions is an additive anticholinergic effect. This type of interaction is more significant with LAMAs than with short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs). Although these are inhalation drugs with minimal systemic absorption, they can lead to anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth, increased intraocular pressure, and urinary retention, especially when combined with other anticholinergics. The additive anticholinergic effect is particularly significant for patients who, in addition to SA, suffer from closed-angle glaucoma, prostate hyperplasia, or bladder neck obstruction. The use of LAMAs with systemic anticholinergic drugs is generally recommended. MRAs also encountered interactions of level C restraint with diuretics and tramadol. The mechanisms and recommendations are available in Supplement 1.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).

7.1 ACE-inhibitors NSAIDs
may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This
interaction should be given consideration in patients taking MOBIC concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.

7.2 Aspirin When MOBIC is administered with aspirin (1000 mg three times daily) to healthy volunteers, an increase in the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam was noted. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.
Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in
an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone. MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.

7.3 Diuretics Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and
thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to
inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. However, studies with
furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in
natriuretic effect. Furosemide single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam. Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with
MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of renal failure
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], as well as to ensure diuretic efficacy.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain… [^111H2XAm]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral NSAIDs Oral NSAIDs inhibit COX enzymes, impairing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. 16 Although systematic reviews have shown that NSAIDs are more effective than acetaminophen for acute pain, 21 guidelines suggest that both can improve pain and that NSAIDs are better for functional improvement. 14 NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or a combination is an effective initial treatment approach for acute pain syndromes. Medication selection should be based on minimizing risks for the specific patient. 3, 14, 17, 22. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have a significantly safer GI adverse effect profile but may be cost prohibitive. Relatively selective COX-2 inhibitors inhibit the activity of COX-2 enzymes at low doses but are less selective at higher doses.

29, 30 Even short-term NSAID use is cautioned in patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease; however, selecting an NSAID associated with a lower cardiovascular risk may be considered. 30 Selective COX-2 inhibitors carry a U. S. Food and Drug Administration boxed warning because of a higher incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events; the risk is dose-dependent. 65 Long-acting opioids are not indicated for opioid-naive patients with acute pain. 64 Opioid combinations with NSAIDs or acetaminophen are superior to any agent alone. 70, 71 Patients receiving chronic opioid therapy for pain or opioid use disorder, including buprenorphine and methadone, should continue their current medication with adjunctive nonopioid pain medications. 72, 73 Buprenorphine and methadone can be dosed every eight hours if needed for pain control. 72, 74 Short-acting opioids can be added if required.

For patients taking naltrexone, nonopioid treatment such as ketamine or regional blocks should be attempted before opioids because very high-dose opioids may be required to overcome naltrexone's opioid blockade, especially in patients receiving the long-acting injectable formulation and in patients who decide not to taper because of concerns of relapse. 74.

### Intravenous meloxicam versus ketorolac for pain control following total joint arthroplasty: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113fQtsS]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although joint arthroplasty surgery is considered safe and effective in reducing osteoarthritis-related pain long-term, the surgery is known to be painful in the immediate postoperative period. Therefore, optimal pain management has become a crucial goal for orthopaedic surgeons. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used but can cause adverse effects due to their mechanism of action. Meloxicam, however, has a unique mechanism of action, allowing it to better spare the gut lining, translating to reduced complications. This double-blind randomized controlled trial sought to compare intravenous (IV) meloxicam and IV ketorolac for total joint arthroplasty regarding pain scores, opioid consumption, and lengths of stay.

Methods

All other institutional protocols and medications remained unchanged. A total of 223 patients were randomized. The meloxicam group received 30 mg IV meloxicam preoperatively two hours before primary incision, while the ketorolac group received 15 mg IV ketorolac intraoperatively followed by 15 mg IV every six hours, scheduled for two doses. Pain, opioid consumption, and nausea were recorded at two and 24 hours postoperatively. An a priori power analysis demonstrated a need for 170 total patients. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05291598) and received Institutional Review Board approval.

Results

The IV meloxicam group had increased total opioid consumption 24 hours postoperatively and longer lengths of stay compared to the IV ketorolac group; however, there were no differences in pain scores or nausea.

Conclusion

The use of IV meloxicam as part of a perioperative pain management protocol led to increased opioid consumption, longer lengths of stay, and a lower rate of same-day discharges compared to IV ketorolac.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^116Hszgs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Common analgesics used are opioids, N 2 O, paracetamol or acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The type of analgesics used are tailored according to the type of injury, pain severity, triage system, and patient's clinical features.

A dutch double-blind, randomized, clinical trial including 182 patients treated with acetaminophen, 183 with diclofenac, and 182 with combination treatment, showed that acetaminophen is not inferior to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or the combination of both, in minor musculoskeletal trauma.

Regular intravenous administration of acetaminophen every 6 h, unless contraindicated, is effective in traumatic pain relief. NSAIDs need to be used with caution in elderly patients due to their potential adverse events, such as acute kidney injury and gastrointestinal complication. In the perioperative pain management of elderly patients with hip fractures, NSAIDs are usually not recommended.

However, if NSAIDs are administrated for pain relief in elderly trauma patients a proton pump inhibitor should also be co-prescribed and particular attention should be paid to patients who are on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics or antiplatelets because of drug interactions.

Opioids are the cornerstone in the management of trauma patients and should be considered in moderate to severe pain. They are effective in pain control but associated with serious cardiovascular events, acute dyspeptic syndrome with nausea and vomiting and an increased risk of respiratory failure.

Elderly trauma patients are particularly vulnerable to opioid use disorders and the high risk of morphine accumulation and subsequent over-sedation and respiratory depression.

Oxygenation with assisted ventilation was required in 0.05% of patients treated with ketamine, in 0.02% of patients treated with fentanyl and in 0% of patients treated with morphine. Nausea and vomiting were the main adverse effects of morphine (4.8%), fentanyl (1.5%) and ketamine (0.5%), while hypotension occurred in 1.6% of cases with fentanyl and 0.5% of cases with morphine.

### Hemicrania continua: clinical review, diagnosis and management [^114Pcevh]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Alternative drugs for HC

Indomethacin is not a very safe drug for long-term use. Incidence and prevalence of indomethacin-related side effects in patients with HC vary between 20% and 75%. Various drugs and other interventions have been tried in patients who developed various indomethacin-related side effects.

Table 8 summarizes the various alternative drugs used in HC patients. Various drugs have been found effective in case reports or open-label studies. The COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib,), piroxicam derivative and topiramate are the main drugs found to be effective in patients with HC. However, the effects of all these drugs are not uniform and consistent in each patient. It is difficult to predict which patient will respond to these drugs.

However, celecoxib and rofecoxib should be used with great precaution because of the increased risk of vascular events (myocardial infarction and strokes). Glaucoma, renal stones and depression are some problematic side effects with topiramate, and patients should be monitored for it. Melatonin can also be an option in indomethacin-tolerant patients. In a few patients, it may produce complete relief of pain. However, in other patients, addition of melatonin may allow 45% patients to reduce the dose of indomethacin.

Table 8 included only those cases where response was either complete or excellent. However, there are several cases in the literature where these drugs were partially effective. Apart from these drugs, there are several other drugs (such as lamotrigine, lithium, naproxen and paracetamol with caffeine) that have provided marked (although partial) effect on some patients with HC. It can also be tried before subjecting the patient for interventional therapies.

We know that the reappearance of headache after skipping of indomethacin is a stronger clinical characteristic of HC. Therefore, immediate reappearance of HC will occur even with these effective drugs. A large number of patients with HC may receive these drugs unknowingly (without a correct diagnosis of HC). In clinical practice, we note several patients with strictly unilateral headaches who complain "they got a response as long as the drugs are continued". They may further say "headaches reappear immediately when they stop taking effective drugs". A possibility of HC is here, as no other headache reappears so fast on withdrawal of the effective drugs.

Surgical interventions

Several surgical approaches have been tried in patients with HC who could not tolerate indomethacin for a long term.
