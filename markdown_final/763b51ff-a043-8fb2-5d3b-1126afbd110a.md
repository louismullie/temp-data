## Question

whats the workup for microcytosis without anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for microcytosis without anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true microcytosis and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify the initial laboratory strategy anchored by ferritin and why it matters even without anemia. Next, I will consider how inflammation alters ferritin interpretation and what adjunct tests help. After that, I need to distinguish iron deficiency from thalassemia trait using indices and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Then, I should review less common etiologies and when to escalate to marrow evaluation. Finally, I will tailor the approach by age and risk, and close with a practical algorithm and follow-up plan, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its significance. Microcytosis is typically defined as MCV less than 80 fL in adults, and in the absence of anemia it is often an incidental finding on CBC, but it still signals impaired hemoglobin synthesis and warrants a structured evaluation to prevent progression and to uncover treatable causes, so I should double-check the lab report and, if needed, repeat the CBC to ensure persistence before proceeding [^24d2dc9e].

> Wait, let me verify that I'm not missing a spurious cause. I need to check for pre-analytical issues like RBC agglutination, extreme hyperglycemia, or cold agglutinins that can distort MCV, and I should review the smear if indices are discordant with the clinical picture; if the smear shows microcytosis and hypochromia, that strengthens the case for true microcytosis and guides next steps [^198ebc16].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory evaluation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — even without anemia, ferritin remains the most informative first test because it reflects iron stores; low ferritin is highly specific for absolute iron deficiency, whereas normal or high ferritin requires cautious interpretation in inflammatory states, so I will order ferritin and, if available, add MCH and RDW because MCH is less variable than MCV and RDW tends to be elevated in iron deficiency but not in thalassemia trait, which helps with early discrimination [^7d1c55a5] [^d0f33d72] [^f9164818].

> I need to ensure I account for inflammation. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, so in the presence of inflammation a ferritin up to about 100 ng/mL can still mask iron deficiency; in that scenario, I should add transferrin saturation and, if available, reticulocyte hemoglobin content or soluble transferrin receptor to improve specificity, recognizing that TSAT less than 20% supports inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis even when ferritin is not frankly low [^d0f33d72] [^2be6fbfb] [^eb5d51fe].

> Let me consider the two most common causes next. If ferritin is low, I should confirm iron deficiency and then search for the source of iron loss or malabsorption; in adults, occult gastrointestinal blood loss is common, so I should tailor GI evaluation to age and risk, reserving bidirectional endoscopy for men and postmenopausal women and considering a more selective approach in premenopausal women with plausible menstrual blood loss, while also screening for celiac disease and H. pylori when appropriate [^f50ccba9] [^c75f1a44] [^d926af9f].

> But wait, what if ferritin is normal or high and the indices suggest thalassemia. I should confirm with hemoglobin electrophoresis, ideally after correcting any iron deficiency because iron deficiency can suppress HbA2 and confound interpretation; in patients of appropriate ancestry, electrophoresis helps avoid unnecessary GI investigations, and I should remember that coexisting iron deficiency can coexist with thalassemia, so repeating studies after iron repletion may be necessary to clarify the hemoglobinopathy profile [^141a7c5a] [^d0f33d72] [^0bbef3fc].

> Hold on, I should verify how to separate iron deficiency from thalassemia trait at the bench. Simple indices like the Mentzer index (MCV divided by RBC count) can be helpful — a value less than 13 suggests thalassemia, whereas higher values favor iron deficiency — but I need to remember these are screening tools and not definitive; RDW is typically elevated in iron deficiency and normal in thalassemia, and newer cell-counter derived formulas incorporating microcytic and hypochromic percentages plus RDW can improve discrimination, though they still require confirmatory hemoglobin analysis [^25074e56] [^f9164818] [^ad356562].

> I will now examine less common etiologies if iron studies and electrophoresis are unrevealing. Anemia of chronic disease can be microcytic in a minority of cases and is suggested by low serum iron with low TIBC and low TSAT but normal or high ferritin; sideroblastic anemia, including hereditary and acquired forms, presents with microcytosis and ring sideroblasts on marrow iron stain; and lead poisoning, though rare, can cause microcytosis with basophilic stippling on smear, so I should keep these in mind when the story does not fit the common causes [^d0f33d72] [^25074e56].

> Let me reconsider the need for bone marrow evaluation. If there is persistent, unexplained microcytosis with abnormal counts or cytopenias, or if I suspect a myelodysplastic process, I should proceed to bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with cytogenetics to assess morphology, iron staining, and clonal changes; MDS more often presents with macrocytosis, but acquired microcytosis can occur and a careful timeline of MCV decline can be informative in distinguishing chronic processes from acute deficiencies [^322a30d1] [^e5a4efc6].

> Next, I should review age-specific nuances. In children, iron deficiency is the most common cause of microcytosis, and newborn screening may have already flagged hemoglobinopathies; if microcytosis persists without anemia, I should still evaluate iron status and consider hemoglobin electrophoresis when indices are suggestive, recognizing that MCV thresholds and RBC indices interpretation differ with age and that early iron deficiency may precede anemia [^6ff026bf] [^fc3019e4]. In pregnancy, MCV and hemoglobin are poor screens for iron deficiency, so direct ferritin assessment is preferred to detect deficiency before anemia develops, which can materially affect maternal and fetal outcomes [^46ae6d98] [^97577bf8].

> I should double-check the follow-up cadence. If iron deficiency is confirmed, I will treat and recheck CBC and ferritin in about 4 to 8 weeks to document correction; if iron deficiency is excluded and thalassemia trait is diagnosed, I will provide genetic counseling, especially for family planning; if no cause is identified, I will monitor CBC and indices periodically, because a minority of cases evolve into clonal disorders or reveal themselves over time, and I will lower my threshold for marrow evaluation if cytopenias emerge or MCV continues to fall [^d926af9f] [^322a30d1] [^e5a4efc6].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. First, confirm true microcytosis and exclude artifact. Second, obtain ferritin with MCH and RDW, adding CRP if inflammation is plausible. Third, if ferritin is low, diagnose iron deficiency and evaluate for sources of blood loss or malabsorption tailored to age and sex. Fourth, if ferritin is normal or high, obtain transferrin saturation and consider reticulocyte hemoglobin or soluble transferrin receptor, then proceed to hemoglobin electrophoresis if indices suggest thalassemia. Fifth, if studies are inconclusive or cytopenias appear, broaden to marrow evaluation and consider rare etiologies. Throughout, I will align GI testing with guideline-based risk stratification and avoid low-yield screening in low-risk groups [^c75f1a44] [^f50ccba9] [^d926af9f].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, reference-aware approach: confirm microcytosis, start with ferritin interpreted in clinical context, distinguish iron deficiency from thalassemia using indices and electrophoresis, and escalate thoughtfully when red flags arise; this balances early detection of treatable causes with judicious use of invasive testing and surveillance, and it remains consistent with contemporary primary care and specialty guidelines [^7d1c55a5] [^d0f33d72] [^c75f1a44].

Microcytosis without anemia is most often due to **early iron deficiency** or **thalassemia trait** [^24d2dc9e]. Start with **ferritin** to assess iron stores [^7d1c55a5]; if low, treat iron deficiency and find the cause [^d926af9f]. If ferritin is normal or high, **order hemoglobin electrophoresis** to detect thalassemia [^141a7c5a] [^d0f33d72]. Consider anemia of chronic disease, sideroblastic anemia, or lead poisoning if indices are atypical or history suggests them [^24d2dc9e]. Most patients do not need extensive testing unless anemia develops or there are red flags (e.g. family history, abnormal indices, or symptoms) [^notfound].

---

## Initial evaluation

### Confirm microcytosis

Confirm microcytosis by repeating a **CBC** to verify MCV < 80 fL in adults, and review the smear for microcytosis and hypochromia [^24d2dc9e].

---

### Clinical history and examination

Obtain a focused history and exam to identify risk factors and symptoms: assess diet, menstrual bleeding, GI symptoms, family history, and exposures (lead, medications) [^24d2dc9e].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Step 1: serum ferritin

Serum ferritin is the **most sensitive and specific test** for iron deficiency [^7d1c55a5]; levels < 15 ng/mL indicate depleted stores, and 15–30 ng/mL suggests low stores [^d0f33d72]. In inflammatory states, ferritin may be falsely normal or elevated; interpret cautiously and consider transferrin saturation or CRP [^d0f33d72] [^2be6fbfb].

---

### Step 2: iron studies if ferritin is inconclusive

If ferritin is 30–100 ng/mL or inflammation is suspected, obtain **serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin saturation** [^d0f33d72]. Low iron with high TIBC and low transferrin saturation supports iron deficiency; low iron with low TIBC suggests anemia of chronic disease [^c548bf3f].

---

### Step 3: hemoglobin electrophoresis if iron studies are normal

If iron studies are normal, **obtain hemoglobin electrophoresis** to detect thalassemia trait (elevated HbA2) or other hemoglobinopathies [^141a7c5a] [^d0f33d72].

---

### Step 4: additional tests if indicated

- **Lead level**: if exposure is suspected.
- **Reticulocyte count**: elevated in hemolysis or blood loss.
- **Peripheral smear**: basophilic stippling in lead poisoning; ringed sideroblasts in sideroblastic anemia [^25074e56].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: if sideroblastic anemia or myelodysplasia is suspected [^25074e56].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Causes** | **Laboratory features** |
|-|-|-|
| Iron deficiency | - Early iron deficiency <br/> - Chronic blood loss <br/> - Malabsorption | - Ferritin < 15 ng/mL <br/> - Low iron <br/> - High TIBC <br/> - Low transferrin saturation [^d0f33d72] |
| Hemoglobinopathy | - Thalassemia trait <br/> - Other hemoglobinopathies | - Normal ferritin <br/> - Normal iron studies <br/> - Abnormal electrophoresis [^d0f33d72] |
| Chronic disease | - Anemia of chronic disease <br/> - Chronic inflammation | - Normal or high ferritin <br/> - Low iron <br/> - Low TIBC <br/> - Low transferrin saturation [^c548bf3f] |
| Sideroblastic anemia | - Hereditary <br/> - Acquired (e.g. alcohol, drugs) | - High ferritin <br/> - Ringed sideroblasts on marrow [^25074e56] |
| Lead poisoning | - Environmental exposure | - Basophilic stippling <br/> - Elevated lead level [^notfound] |

---

## Management and follow-up

- **Iron deficiency**: treat with iron and identify the source of blood loss or malabsorption [^d926af9f].
- **Thalassemia trait**: genetic counseling; no iron therapy unless iron deficient [^0bbef3fc].
- **Unexplained microcytosis**: monitor CBC and iron studies; reassess if anemia develops or symptoms arise [^b8526278].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Refer to hematology for **suspected thalassemia**, **sideroblastic anemia**, **myelodysplasia**, or **persistent unexplained microcytosis**. Refer to gastroenterology for suspected GI blood loss or malabsorption [^f50ccba9].

---

Microcytosis without anemia is most often due to **early iron deficiency** or **thalassemia trait**; a focused workup with ferritin and, if needed, hemoglobin electrophoresis usually clarifies the cause. Reserve further testing for atypical cases or evolving anemia.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^24d2dc9e]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^cc1b531e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^46ae6d98]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrate that hemoglobin and MCV are insensitive predictors of iron deficiency in the first trimester and throughout pregnancy. Based on the testing characteristics observed in our cohort, if we screen for first-trimester iron deficiency using microcytosis or anemia, 59 of 100 patients with iron deficiency will go undetected. This screening failure becomes even more concerning as pregnancy progresses and iron deficiency becomes more prevalent.

Given the retrospective study design, iron deficiency could be accurately determined only for the patients with ferritin results in our health care system, meaning that the true prevalence across our population might be obscured by selection bias. However, because sensitivity is an intrinsic test characteristic unaffected by prevalence, our primary hypothesis that hemoglobin and MCV are poor screening tools to detect iron deficiency in pregnancy should remain relatively unaffected by this selection bias.

The 2021 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ practice guidance document for anemia in pregnancy recommends a first-trimester screening CBC but does not recommend evaluating iron status (ferritin) directly in the absence of anemia or microcytosis.However, our study demonstrates that hemoglobin (anemia) and MCV (microcytosis) are poor predictors of iron deficiency throughout pregnancy. Therefore, our institution's iron deficiency screening policy for pregnant women now aligns with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics recommendations.

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^97577bf8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency during pregnancy is associated with detrimental maternal and fetal outcomes, including increased risk for cesarean delivery, transfusion, low birth weight, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, and neurodevelopmental disorders in the child – and maternal fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, restless leg syndrome, and postpartum depression.

Despite the high prevalence of iron deficiency in women of childbearing age, first-trimester screening recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, are limited to a complete blood count (CBC), with iron deficiency evaluation recommended only if the screening CBC demonstrates anemia or microcytosis. In contrast, a 2023 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics position statement recommends direct assessment of iron status (ferritin) along with CBC as early as possible during pregnancy.

To test the hypothesis that CBC parameters are insufficiently sensitive to screen for iron deficiency in pregnancy, we conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of patients seen for prenatal care from 2009 to 2022 at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), obstetric clinics.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^60d17a1b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^440b00ef]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease—CBC interpretation and reticulocyte/erythropoietin testing states that the anemia of CKD is hypoproliferative and generally normochromic and normocytic; erythropoietin levels are not useful for evaluation in most clinical settings and are generally not recommended for measurement. Effective erythropoietic proliferative activity is most simply assessed by determining the absolute reticulocyte count. Abnormal white blood cell or platelet counts are not typical of CKD anemia and should prompt investigation for other processes. Reticulocyte counts obtained with automated CBC testing may be high with active blood loss or hemolysis and low with hypoproliferative erythropoiesis. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency may cause macrocytosis, whereas iron deficiency or inherited disorders of hemoglobin formation may produce microcytosis.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^fc3019e4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

### Anemia in children [^958fac0e]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^195e6fb7]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH)—hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV)—microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV.Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of <15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process.An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice.An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^1713d8a2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^f50ccba9]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2-5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

Investigations

Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged >50 or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged 50 years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over 50 years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged >50 after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged >50 years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B).

Management

All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to upper and lower gastrointestinal investigations, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend invasive investigations in non-anemic patients with iron deficiency unless there are additional indications, but consider obtaining periodic blood count monitoring in these patients.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^6ff026bf]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^e5a4efc6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

When evaluating for the cause of microcytosis, a longitudinal evaluation can be very helpful. The timing and rate of decline of the MCV can be informative in determining the aetiology. Our patient’s microcytosis appears to have developed over the course of almost 4 years. His decline in MCV was slow but consistent, beginning at an MCV of roughly 90 and decreasing to a nadir of 68.5. This very gradual decline in MCV suggests a more insidious and chronic process than an iron deficiency or anaemia of chronic disease. It remains unclear whether the timeline of the development of microcytosis is connected with progression in mutation burden.

Learning points

Microcytosis has several common causes, but an unremarkable initial workup may warrant a more thorough investigation.
Acquired microcytosis has been associated with certain haematological disorders, most commonly myelodysplastic syndromes and most commonly affecting production of alpha-haemoglobin.
Elements of the timeline and severity of microcytosis can offer clues to its aetiology.
Microcytosis is caused by increased nucleic acid synthesis and progenitor divisions relative to haemoglobin production.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism or heme synthesis [^32476418]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of inherited microcytic anemias has gained from the identification of several genes and proteins involved in systemic and cellular iron metabolism and heme syntheses. Numerous case reports illustrate that the implementation of these novel molecular discoveries in clinical practice has increased our understanding of the presentation, diagnosis, and management of these diseases. Integration of these insights into daily clinical practice will reduce delays in establishing a proper diagnosis, invasive and/or costly diagnostic tests, and unnecessary or even detrimental treatments. To assist the clinician, we developed evidence-based multidisciplinary guidelines on the management of rare microcytic anemias due to genetic disorders of iron metabolism and heme synthesis. These genetic disorders may present at all ages, and therefore these guidelines are relevant for pediatricians as well as clinicians who treat adults. This article summarizes these clinical practice guidelines and includes background on pathogenesis, conclusions, and recommendations and a diagnostic flowchart to facilitate using these guidelines in the clinical setting.

### A novel discriminating tool for microcytic anemia in childhood [^007ae81e]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate and timely interpretation of microcytic anemia can be diagnostically challenging in the primary care setting. We sought to develop a novel model for distinguishing iron-deficiency anemia from thalassemia trait in the modern pediatric population. Demographic history and red blood cell indices were retrospectively characterized for 76 children referred to our pediatric hematology clinic for evaluation of microcytic anemia. Statistically significant variables were sequentially added into a logistic regression model to develop the final model. The final discriminating model incorporates red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell values. Favorable predictive performance is seen in the initial (sensitivity 89.2%, specificity 92.3%) and external validation cohort (sensitivity 84.4%, specificity 88.9%). This novel tool may aid in determining the cause of hypochromic, microcytic anemia in the primary care setting. Finally, the study cohort reflects an underrepresented group in the development of screening tools, and thus offers generalizability.

### From microcytosis to macrodiagnosis [^1e4da865]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^a06e018d]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^bf1babca]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with variable propensity for leukemic transformation that can present a diagnostic challenge because they lack hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and at presentation can range from indolent to life threatening. The clinician should have a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be considered higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia (and particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia) should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease—vitamin B12 and folate testing notes these are uncommon but treatable causes of anemia linked to macrocytosis and low red blood cell (RBC) indices, with limited data indicating the prevalence is ≤ 10% of hemodialysis patients and unknown in CKD. Because these deficiencies are easily correctable and vitamin B12 deficiency may signal other disease processes, assessment of folate and vitamin B12 levels are generally considered standard components of anemia evaluation, especially with macrocytosis. Folate deficiency is best detected with serum folate testing, and RBC folate can be measured when serum levels are equivocal or recent dietary intake may obscure deficiency using serum levels alone.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^451b8f98]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^69b79037]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

With the global growing older adult population, clinicians face the common, yet complex challenge of how to evaluate and manage anemia in this population. Older age predisposes to common causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality. Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because anemia may have a single cause, may be multifactorial, or may have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. We believe a systematic approach to diagnosis ensures appropriate testing and avoids the pitfall of undertreatment and overtreatment. In this article we present our recommended approach through common scenarios for the management of anemia in the older adult.

### Abstract (...) [^c548bf3f]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Strategy Figure 1 is a suggested algorithm for diagnosing the cause of microcytosis in adults. 1, 2, 5, 17, 18, 20, 21 After confirmation of microcytosis on CBC, physicians should first order a serum ferritin level. 18–20 If the ferritin level is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, identifying the underlying cause of the anemia is the priority. If the serum ferritin level is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia, the next stage of the evaluation should include measurement of serum iron level, TIBC, and transferrin saturation. Iron deficiency anemia is still probable if the serum iron level and transferrin saturation are decreased and TIBC is increased. On the other hand, if the serum iron level is decreased and the TIBC and transferrin saturation are decreased or normal, anemia of chronic disease is most likely. 7, 25 If the diagnosis remains unclear, hemoglobin electrophoresis can identify beta-thalassemia trait and less common inherited causes of microcytosis.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis may be considered earlier in the evaluation of children and young adults, in whom beta-thalassemia trait is more common. Specific Causes of Microcytosis IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron deficiency anemia occurs when the absorption of iron through dietary intake does not match the needs of the body. The mismatch occurs from inadequate dietary intake or increased needs, which usually cause only mild anemia, or from blood loss or malabsorption, which can lead to more significant anemia. Young children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women have the highest prevalence of the condition. 1 Coexisting iron deficiency anemia can lower hemoglobin A2 levels; therefore, iron deficiency anemia must be corrected before hemoglobin electrophoresis results can be appropriately evaluated.
31. ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE Anemia of chronic disease can be caused by chronic infections or inflammatory processes.

Increased levels of cytokines cause a decrease in erythropoietin production, a decreased response to erythropoietin, and interference with iron metabolism. 25 Although anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic, about one fourth to one third of cases are mildly microcytic. The anemia is usually mild and not progressive. Additionally, although serum iron levels are decreased in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin levels are increased because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. 1.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^f9164818]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10 12 /l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Diagnostic workup of microcytic anemia: an evaluation of underuse or misuse of laboratory testing in a hospital setting using the alinIQ system [^91042b68]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Context.—

Underuse of laboratory testing has been previously investigated in preselected populations, such as documented malpractice claims. However, these numbers might not reflect real-life situations.

Objective.—

To evaluate the underuse and misuse of laboratory follow-up testing in a real-life hospital patient population with microcytic anemia, using laboratory results ordered during routine patient care.

Design.—

From all patients in whom a microcytic anemia was detected during routine diagnostics in 2018, all available laboratory data were collected and screened for appropriateness of diagnostic workup of iron deficiency and thalassemia. Subgroup analysis was performed for patient groups with mean corpuscular volume values 75 to 79 μm3 (group 1), 65 to 74 μm3 (group 2), and <65 μm3 (group 3).

Results.—

A total of 2244 patients with microcytic anemia were identified. Follow-up testing for iron deficiency was not performed in 761 cases (34%). For inconclusive ferritin levels due to elevated C-reactive protein results (n = 336), reticulocyte hemoglobin content or soluble transferrin receptor levels were missing in 86 cases (26%). In patients with suspected thalassemia (n = 127), follow-up testing for hemoglobin variants was not performed in 70 cases (55%). Subgroup analysis showed that the frequency of underuse of iron status as well as thalassemia/hemoglobinopathy testing decreased from group 1 to group 3. When considering relevant preexisting anemia diagnoses, laboratory tests were underused in 904 cases (40.3%).

Conclusions.—

Because 40% (n = 904) of the patients with microcytic anemia were potentially not followed up correctly, laboratory specialists are advised to act by implementing demand management strategies in collaboration with clinicians to overcome underuse of laboratory tests and to improve patient safety.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^25074e56]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In general, microcytosis results from conditions that lead to a disruption of alpha or beta-globin-chain production. Most commonly, microcytosis is the result of decreased iron availability or an underlying inherited haemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia. The Mentzer index is one way of quickly discerning between thalassemia and iron-deficiency, with an MCV/RBC ratio <13 suggesting thalassemia.In our patient, the value of 11.7 in conjunction with his iron studies was consistent with thalassemia.

Decreased iron availability may be due to an absolute lack of iron stores (ie, iron deficiency), or to a functional lack of available iron. A functional iron deficiency can manifest in the setting of a chronic inflammatory state where serum hepcidin levels are elevated or in the setting of sideroblastic anaemia.In this case, the patient’s other comorbidities may have precipitated some chronic inflammation, though his erythrocyte sedimentation rate of only 13 mm/hour argues against an overwhelming inflammatory state.

The exact mechanism by which red blood cells become microcytic is not well documented. The predominant theory is that red blood cells stop dividing once they reach a certain concentration of intracellular haemoglobin. As the production of haemoglobin slows down, more divisions occur before this concentration is reached, resulting in smaller cells.For this reason, microcytosis serves as a loose indicator of decreased haemoglobin synthesis, and macrocytosis an indicator of decreased DNA production.

Diagnosing the aforementioned conditions is fairly standard, with evaluation of the peripheral blood smear, a complete CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate stores, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A bone marrow biopsy is required for identification of ringed sideroblasts in clinching the diagnosis of a sideroblastic anaemia.The haemoglobin electrophoresis is useful in cases of beta-thalassemia and certain cases of alpha-thalassemia (where 3 or 4 copies of the alpha-globin gene are defective resulting in the production of HbH). Alpha-globin and/or beta-globin gene sequencing can also be undertaken, though this is most often done as part of family planning when both parents are suspected of being carriers of a silent mutation.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^eec1e953]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^eb5d51fe]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia—wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin <30 ng/mL and/or TSAT <20%; ferritin <100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb <29 pg or a serum hepcidin level <20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%.Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores.Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency.Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index <2) may help identify likely causes.Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### Microcytosis and possible early iron deficiency in paediatric inpatients: a retrospective audit [^193f83cb]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our work demonstrates that a substantial improvement in the documentation rate or awareness of microcytosis by clinicians (and hence potential early iron deficiency) can be achieved through staff education. Follow-up and treatment rates of these patients remained low in our audit, but there are ways in which this could be improved, primarily involving education of medical staff and the use of a protocol or pathway. It would be interesting to see if our experience with identification and follow-up of these patients is similar at other hospitals in different settings.

### Differential diagnosis and management of anemia in the newborn [^9d9e8c6f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum.Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of anemia, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb’s test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

Down syndrome—macrocytosis and interpretation of mean corpuscular volume notes that children have a similar risk for iron-deficiency anemia as the typical population but it may be missed because of macrocytosis; iron insufficiency may precede anemia and have longer term neurologic effects; macrocytosis, which increases mean corpuscular volume, is present in up to one-third of patients, therefore a low mean corpuscular volume is not a useful screen for iron deficiency/insufficiency, lead toxicity, or thalassemia.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^198ebc16]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements.Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates.Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events.Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

Iron (Fe) status

There are several parameters that can be measured to evaluate the the iron status of an individual, including Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) serum ferritin and transferrin saturation measurements.

The interpretation of all three parameters should be done with some caution.Measurement of iron status in samples with hypochromic, microcytic indices but with normal Hb A 2 and F is useful to distinguish between cases of iron deficiency and those with possible α -thalassaemia trait or certain form of ‘silent' β -thalassaemia trait, the latter of which should have normal iron status. This distinction is useful to prevent unnecessary further investigation as well as inappropriate iron therapy. However, it is important to note that iron deficiency can co-exist with the thalassaemias, which could lead to misinterpretation. If an individual is found to be iron deficient, it is recommended to repeat the haematology screen once the individual is iron replete, although this may not always be practical or feasible in a couple with an on-going pregnancy.

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

• Full blood count (FBC) including—in addition to the Hb concentration:

• red blood cell indices:

• mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

• mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

• mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

• white blood cell count and differential count

• platelet count

• Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

• Test to determine iron status:

• percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

• reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

• combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

• Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

• Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs’ test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^8bd648aa]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children—test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia.The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2. 
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or ‘normal’, although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (=0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time).As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Microcytosis and possible early iron deficiency in paediatric inpatients: a retrospective audit [^a0422c21]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The use of the MCV as a tool for guiding selection of inpatients for further investigation of possible iron deficiency has been questioned, mainly due to its moderately poor sensitivity in detecting iron deficiency despite its apparent high specificity. These studies however were done in a non-paediatric population, and used a cut-off point of 80 fL which may not be applicable to other population groups. One study that was performed on an outpatient population of children aged between one and six years did show much higher sensitivity and specificity values (both close to 100%) for a MCV cut-off value of 75 fL when used for detecting iron-deficiency anaemia, as opposed to iron deficiency without anaemia. One suggested reasoning for this phenomenon is that very early iron deficiency develops prior to any reduction in MCV or Hb. Occasionally, pre-analytical factors can affect the accuracy of the MCV reading by the automated red cell counter; these include auto-reactive red blood cell antibodies leading to red blood cell agglutination, and osmotic effects on red blood cells in the presence of extreme hyperglycaemia.

We were interested to see whether our department was adequately detecting and following up paediatric inpatients that might have iron deficiency, given the important consequences of this condition if allowed to progress to frank iron-deficiency anaemia. The department receives about 3500 inpatient admissions per year from a mixed urban and rural setting in Eastern England. Given that a substantial proportion of these patients will have blood tests, we decided to use the MCV as an indicator of whether a patient might have iron deficiency. The MCV was chosen since other tests commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency are not routinely performed in the inpatient setting at our hospital, whereas nearly every inpatient who has blood taken will have a full blood count performed and will have a MCV readily available. Further tests (including RDW, blood films, serum ferritin levels etc) might then be added to existing blood samples or performed following recovery to further characterise whether an iron-deficient state or alternative explanation for the microcytosis is present.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^85c5484d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a classic early diagnostic sign of gastrointestinal (GI) tract malignant neoplasm. Between 1% and 10% of adult patients with IDA may have undiagnosed GI tract cancer. Prompt and thorough evaluation of IDA is essential. However, retrospective studies have reported that delays in diagnostic evaluation of IDA are common, and can lead to a delayed diagnosis of colorectal cancer. This problem is of increasing importance given the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients outside the age range for which routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended, for whom IDA may be the first diagnostic sign of malignant neoplasm.

Clinical practices related to identification and evaluation of IDA likely vary substantially, with at least 30 different guidelines from 10 specialty societies., However, variation related to testing practices, interpretation of laboratory test results, and diagnostic evaluation of IDA among physicians is not well studied even though these factors may be associated with diagnostic delays, missed cancer diagnoses, and low-value care. For instance, because of a low diagnostic yield, anemia screening is not recommended for adults except during pregnancy, and recommendations about screening during pregnancy are mixed. Inappropriate screening may be associated with health care waste and potential unintended harm (eg, additional downstream diagnostic tests). Inaccurate test interpretation of iron studies (eg, serum ferritin level and iron saturation) can also lead to medical error, with misclassification of patients’ iron level. Interpretation can be complicated because the ferritin level may be elevated in the context of an inflammatory process, potentially masking underlying iron deficiency. Guidelines consistently recommend that men with IDA and postmenopausal women, in the absence of obvious causes, should be evaluated for potential occult GI tract blood loss with colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, older guidelines, which predated the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients observed over the past decade, recommended against initial endoscopic evaluation for premenopausal women with IDA given the more common cause of iron deficiency secondary to menstrual blood loss.Together, these issues introduce ambiguity and complexity to the evaluation of IDA.

Our objective was to understand how primary care physicians (PCPs) approach testing and evaluation of patients for IDA. To do this, we conducted a survey study consisting of a vignette-based assessment of PCPs to examine their practices related to IDA testing and evaluation for male and female patients of different ages. A better understanding of current PCP evaluation and referral patterns for GI endoscopy in the context of IDA may reveal potential opportunities to intervene and promote earlier diagnosis of GI tract cancers.

### The role of automated measurement of RBC subpopulations in differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia and β-thalassemia screening [^ad356562]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Cell counter-based formulas have been used in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia. The measurement of RBC subpopulations is now available on the Sysmex XE 5000 analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). We describe the new formulas: % microcytic - % hypochromic; and % microcytic - % hypochromic - red cell distribution width (RDW), derived from the percentages of microcytic and hypochromic RBCs. The present study aimed to prospectively evaluate the reliability of these new formulas in the differential diagnosis of microcytosis and β-thalassemia screening compared with already published indices. The indices were calculated for a set of 250 iron-deficient patients and 270 β-thalassemia carriers. Independent samples t test and receiver-operating characteristics analysis were applied. The % microcytic - % hypochromic - RDW, % microcytic - % hypochromic, and Green and King indices provided higher areas under the curve. The % microcytic - % hypochromic - RDW was the most reliable index evaluated, with 100% sensitivity and 92.6% specificity. This index can be used to efficiently screen patients with microcytosis for further hematologic studies to confirm β-thalassemia.

Interpretation of Hb pattern analysis when common β -variants interact with α -thalassaemia

In carriers of the most common β -chain variants (Hb S, Hb D-Punjab, Hb E and Hb C) the percentage of the variant haemoglobin is directly dependent on the number of α -globin genes. In the presence of α -thalassaemia it is usually decreased, e.g. to less than ∼35% for Hb S, D-Punjab and Hb C and less than ∼25% for Hb E,although precise measurements may vary depending on the technology used. In the absence of iron deficiency, the percentage of Hb variant may therefore indicate the presence of co-inherited α -thalassaemia and help exclude β -thalassaemia as a cause of red cell microcytosis; it is a particularly useful observation to make in people of ancestral origins where both Hb E and α 0 -thalassaemia are prevalent. However, this information is not reliable enough to definitely exclude the presence of α -thalassaemia because of the possibility of additional co-inheritance of multiple α -globin gene duplications (e.g. triplicated or quadruplicated rearrangements).

It is of note that for some stable β -chain variants that are more negatively charged than Hb A, such as Hb J, the relationship is inversed, as the number of α -globin genes decreases, so the percentage of Hb variant increases in the presence of α -thalassaemia.

Quantification of Hb A 2

Measurements should be carried out on freshly drawn anti-coagulated blood. Methods include,, electrophoresis and elution, microchromatography, HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, Hb electrophoresis (not recommended).

It is important to note that the quantification of Hb A 2 using both HPLC and CE may still be compromised in the presence of common or rare α -chain variants, or δ chain variants, which split the Hb A 2 peak, or coexisting δ thalassaemia, which decreases the Hb A 2 peak.The use of internal controls are recommended as well as adherence to instructions provided by the manufacturers.

Haemoglobin variants which elute with or close to Hb A 2 on HPLC or capillary electrophoresis may affect Hb A 2 quantification.

### Prospective evaluation of a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^b1a57af9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined the effect of introducing an evidence-based clinical guideline on the diagnosis and evaluation of iron deficiency anemia.

Subjects and Methods

The guideline recommended measurement of serum ferritin levels for all anemic patients with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) </=95 fL and endoscopic evaluation for those with a serum ferritin level less than 45 ng/mL. Physicians practicing in the general medicine inpatient and outpatient services of two university-affiliated hospitals were informed about the guideline and the data supporting it. Clinical evaluations during the 9 months before ("control period," n = 3341 patients) and the 9 months after ("intervention period," n = 3173 patients) the introduction of the guideline were compared.

Results

There was a 30% increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22% to 39%) in the proportion of anemic patients who underwent serum ferritin evaluation in the intervention period (41% [n = 1284]) compared with in the control period (31% [n = 1040]), and a 24% increase (95% CI: 4% to 48%) in the proportion with a serum ferritin level <45 ng/mL (8.1% [n = 256] vs. 6.5% [n = 217]). The proportion of anemic patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation within 4 months of measurement of low serum ferritin level in the intervention period (3.3% [n = 106]) was 67% higher (95% CI: 23% to 125%) than in the control period (2.0% [n = 67]), and the proportion with serious gastrointestinal lesions found as a result of endoscopy was 62% (95% CI: 8% to 145%) higher (1.8% [n = 57] vs. 1.1% [n = 37]).

Conclusions

Introduction of a guideline describing appropriate evaluation of iron deficiency anemia led to an increase in the proportions of patients evaluated for iron deficiency anemia and found to have serious gastrointestinal lesions.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^3ecf634f]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate gastrointestinal bleeding, we usually refer for colonoscopy and/or EGD. We frequently recommend FOBT, recognizing that FOBT alone is insufficient for excluding gastrointestinal bleeding, with a sensitivity of 58% at detecting the source of IDA.FOBT is more appropriate for colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic people without anemia.We refer for endoscopic evaluation irrespective of FOBT when IDA is suspected unless another etiology for IDA is established. In frail older adults, the decision to perform an endoscopy is often case-by-case with consideration for the person’s life expectancy.It should be a shared decision with the patient and caregiver; a positive FOBT suggests a higher yield from endoscopy.

Patients with IDA may present with microcytic or normocytic hypochromic RBCs. Nearly 70% of older adults (aged ≥65 years) with IDA present with normal MCV.Laboratory evaluation includes obtaining a CBC, reticulocyte count, serum iron level, TIBC (represents the ability to bind iron to transferrin), TSAT (ratio of serum iron to TIBC), and ferritin (reflects iron stores). Individuals with iron deficiency typically have low serum iron, low TSAT, low ferritin, and high TIBC. Timing and fasted state should be considered when iron studies are collected.A TSAT of <20% suggests that the iron supply is not adequate for RBC production and a very low TSAT of <15% is consistent with iron deficiency. Compared with lower ferritin cutoffs, a ferritin level of <50 ng/mL is suspicious for iron deficiency in older adults because this is a more reliable predicter of iron deficiency in older populations. Intermediate ferritin levels (the range from 30 to 100 ng/mL) pose difficulties, particularly in older adults with chronic diseases. Ferritin levels increase with age and patients with conditions such as chronic heart failure or inflammatory disorders may experience absolute iron deficiency even at ferritin levels of up to 100 μg/L and as high as 300 μg/L if the TSAT is <20%.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^d926af9f]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

6.2 Iron supplementation in pregnancy

Even with optimal diet and absorption, daily iron requirements in pregnancy cannot be met by diet alone, hence the need for iron supplementation.This is more so as up to 40% of pregnant women start pregnancy with depleted iron stores.Available evidence supports routine iron supplementation in pregnancy, to reduce the incidence of maternal iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia at term, and small for gestational age (SGA) and low birth weight babies.All pregnant women should receive daily iron supplementation with 30–60 mg of elemental iron.A higher daily dose of 60 mg is recommended in settings where iron deficiency anemia is a significant public health problem affecting 40% or more of pregnant women, and in women at increased risk of iron deficiency, including those with previous anemia, multiple pregnancy, short interpregnancy interval of less than 1 year, and vegetarians.

Systematic and Cochrane reviews have demonstrated that intermittent oral iron supplementation with 120 mg of elemental iron/week produces similar maternal and infant outcomes as daily supplementation, with fewer side effects.Intermittent supplementation is recommended if daily iron is not tolerated due to side effects and in settings where iron deficiency anemia affects less than 20% of pregnant women.

6.3 Screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy

All pregnant women should be screened for anemia, with a FBC at booking and again at 28 weeks.Screening can also be conducted with a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit test, especially in resource‐limited settings.Women with a hemoglobin concentration below 11.0 g/dL should be evaluated for the etiology of anemia. A serum ferritin level below 30 μg/L is diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.In the absence of a serum ferritin test, especially in resource‐limited settings, a positive response to a therapeutic trial of oral iron, as evidenced by an increase in hemoglobin concentration of at least 1 g/dL after 2 weeks of commencement of treatment is diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.In settings where extensive investigations to determine the cause of anemia may be difficult—in the absence of any concurrent/background illnesses/comorbidities/hemoglobinopathy—iron deficiency anemia can be presumed if the hemoglobin concentration is below 11 g/dL, and treatment with iron should be offered as first‐line therapy.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend to ensure accurate differentiation among the three unique myeloproliferative neoplasm subtypes as well as the exclusion of reactive conditions (in mutation-negative patients only) and disorders, such as myelodysplasia and chronic myeloid leukemia, for appropriate prognosis and treatment decision-making. Do not use the generic diagnostic label 'myeloproliferative neoplasm' alone.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^3cf6fb49]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

In general, anaemia of CKD is normochromic and normocytic and is morphologically indistinguishable from the anaemia of chronic illness. Initial assessment of anaemia in CKD patients should aim at identifying other factors that may influence the response to treatment.

In addition to Hb, other indices of the FBC report may provide important clinical information:
Macrocytosis could be due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency.
In addition to anaemia of CKD, microcytosis could be due to iron deficiency or haemoglobinopathies.
Macrocytosis with leucopoenia or thrombocytopenia could be due to several factors such as alcohol intake, nutritional deficit (vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), or myelodysplasia.
Serum folate is more prone to variation and can be affected by the patient’s diet immediately prior to blood being taken, alcohol, trauma and other factors therefore occasionally red cell folate may need to be measured where serum folate is equivocal.
Haemolysis is suggested by the presence of macrocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase and positive Coombs test.
The normal absolute reticulocyte count ranges from 40,000 to 50,000 cells/μL. Although it has a significant inter-patient variability, this test may be useful as a semi-quantitative marker of erythropoietic activity.

c.) Evaluating Iron Status in Anaemic Patients with CKD

The aim of evaluating iron status is to assess:
Iron level in tissue stores and
The adequacy of iron utilisation for erythropoiesis.

Serum ferritin level is the only available blood marker of storage iron. There are several tests to assess adequacy of iron for erythropoiesis: TSAT, MCV, MCH, percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (HRC) and reticulocyte Hb content (CHr) or Ret-Hb.

### Iron supplementation in pregnant sicklers: an opinion [^3de65fc5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

One may argue for the need to avoid iron supplements in PS in order to prevent iron overload. Indeed, people with SCA are at risk of iron overload, but this usually follows multiple transfusions indicated for haemolytic crisis. Nevertheless, a third of the haemolysis in SCA is intravascular and leads to urinary iron loss. The realisation that iron deficiency anaemia in SCA may be more common than reported and that the risk of iron deficiency anaemia even increases in PS, may suggest that routine supplementation of iron in PS is necessary. Exchange transfusion rather than normal transfusion should be encouraged in non-anaemic indications of transfusion. In case of antecedents of multiple transfusions, iron supplements should be routinely provided, with microcytosis being used as a clue for iron deficiency. In case of recent multiple transfusions, iron supplements should be avoided. Clients with no history of transfusions or with ≤5 units of blood transfusion should be routinely supplemented with iron in pregnancy. In PS with 6 to 20 units of blood transfusions, microcytosis should be used as a clue to suspect iron deficiency while iron supplements should best be avoided in PS with greater than 20 units of blood transfusion. Future studies should focus on comparing iron stores in PS with and without history of transfusion, on measuring efficacy of microcytosis as a marker of iron deficiency anaemia in PS.

1.9 Expert recommendation

There is little focus in the guidelines on how iron deficiency in the absence of anemia should be diagnosed in relation to the underlying chronic disease. Thus, it is of little surprise that physicians may not prioritize iron deficiency treatment. We wish to propose, based on the literature available, the following consensus laboratory test cut‐off values in patients with CHF, CKD or IBD:

Serum ferritin <100 µg L −1 or TSAT <20%

If serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg L −1, a TSAT test will be required to confirm iron deficiency

Furthermore, we also propose the following algorithms for the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, CKD, and IBD (Figures 2, 3, 4). In all conditions, initial workup should incorporate assessment of serum ferritin and TSAT, as well as Hb levels, in order to distinguish between those with normal hematological parameters, those with some form of iron deficiency (iron deficiency: normal Hb and low iron; or iron deficiency anemia: low Hb and low iron), and those with some other form of anemia (where iron levels are normal but Hb is low). In CKD, we must also consider whether the patient is receiving dialysis (Figure 3 A,B). Finally, in IBD, we must further consider whether the underlying condition is in remission or active. For IBD, we therefore also recommend measuring CRP levels or stool markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin at the time of iron markers and hematological workup, in order to appropriately manage iron deficiency in relation to these results. We recommend a CRP threshold of 5 mg L −1 to determine the IBD disease activity. Although laboratory markers are usually sufficient with clinical disease activity markers, other indicators of intestinal inflammation, such as transabdominal ultrasound or endoscopy, may also be used to supplement these assessments.
