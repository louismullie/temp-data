## Question

How do I treat COPD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat COPD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging with spirometry. Then, I should assess symptoms and exacerbation risk to assign a GOLD group. Next, I will select initial pharmacotherapy based on that group, followed by non-pharmacologic measures. After that, I need to plan follow-up and escalation or de-escalation strategies, including ICS decisions and eosinophil-guided therapy. I will then address exacerbation management, special populations, and comorbidities, and finally, I should consider palliative care, implementation barriers, and summarize key principles with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and staging, because I need to ensure we are treating true COPD and not asthma or another process. Post-bronchodilator spirometry with FEV1/FVC less than 0.70 establishes airflow limitation, and I should classify severity by post-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted even though treatment decisions are no longer FEV1-driven, since FEV1 informs prognosis and trial eligibility, and I should also document symptoms and exacerbation history to guide therapy [^22664f95] [^8e9bc9b3].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom and risk assessment step, because misclassification here leads to mismatched therapy. I should use CAT or mMRC for symptoms and count exacerbations in the prior year, recognizing that a history of treated exacerbations is the strongest predictor of future exacerbations; this yields Groups A through D, which direct pharmacologic choices and is a major shift from older FEV1-only staging [^2d17ee22] [^6e4bfc08].

> I will now examine initial pharmacotherapy for Group A, where symptoms are low and exacerbation risk is low. Short-acting bronchodilators are reasonable, but hold on, I should verify whether a single long-acting bronchodilator might be preferable for convenience and adherence; GOLD supports either SABA or SAMA as needed or a single LAMA or LABA if symptoms persist, so I should individualize based on activity and preference while ensuring inhaler technique is taught and checked [^601f56c6] [^034b4931].

> For Group B, with high symptoms but low exacerbation risk, I should confirm that dual bronchodilation is reasonable if monotherapy fails. Initially I thought LAMA monotherapy is always first-line, but wait, let me verify the nuance: GOLD allows LAMA or LABA monotherapy, and many clinicians start with LAMA given its superior effect on exacerbations; if dyspnea persists, escalate to LABA/LAMA dual therapy, and I should double-check inhaler technique before escalating [^601f56c6] [^078af317].

> For Group C, with low symptoms but high exacerbation risk, I need to ensure I prioritize exacerbation prevention. LAMA is a reasonable first choice, and if exacerbations continue, I should escalate to LABA/LAMA; I should also consider ICS if exacerbations persist and, importantly, I should remember that eosinophils can help predict ICS response, though I will come back to that threshold shortly [^601f56c6] [^992a152c] [^992a152c].

> For Group D, with high symptoms and high exacerbation risk, I should confirm that dual bronchodilation is preferred initially, and if exacerbations persist, I should add ICS to create triple therapy; hold on, I should verify the eosinophil threshold — GOLD suggests considering triple therapy when eosinophils are 300 cells/μL or higher in appropriate phenotypes, balancing pneumonia risk against exacerbation reduction [^05ddfb0d] [^601f56c6].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic therapy because these interventions meaningfully change outcomes. Smoking cessation is the most effective disease-modifying strategy and reduces mortality, so I must offer counseling and pharmacotherapy; vaccinations for influenza, pneumococcus, and COVID-19 are essential; pulmonary rehabilitation improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life across severities; and I should reinforce inhaler technique at every visit and simplify regimens to improve adherence [^bc4cb753] [^d6611f5c].

> I need to ensure a structured follow-up plan to reassess control and adjust therapy. Every 3 to 6 months I should review symptoms with CAT or mMRC, exacerbation frequency, inhaler technique, and adherence; if control is inadequate, I should escalate along the treatable traits pathway — either the dyspnea/activity pathway toward dual or triple bronchodilation, or the exacerbation pathway toward adding ICS when indicated by phenotype and eosinophil count, and I should consider de-escalation after 12 months of stability, especially for ICS in low-eosinophil patients [^e8ae03c3] [^2c18b2cd].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of eosinophils and ICS withdrawal. Evidence supports using blood eosinophils to enrich for ICS benefit in exacerbation-prone patients, and in those on triple therapy without recent exacerbations and low eosinophils, ICS withdrawal can be considered with close monitoring; I should also remember that ICS increases pneumonia risk, so I must weigh this carefully and avoid ICS monotherapy in COPD [^601f56c6] [^992a152c].

> Let me consider exacerbation management, because preventing and treating these events alters trajectory. For acute exacerbations, I should use SABA with or without SAMA, a short course of systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics when indicated by increased sputum purulence, dyspnea, or ventilatory support needs; I should confirm that antibiotics reduce treatment failure but not mortality or recurrence, and I should screen for comorbidities and optimize prevention plans during recovery [^27a42c82] [^0236a95a].

> I should double-check special populations and scenarios. In patients with concomitant asthma features, ICS is mandatory and treatment should follow asthma-COPD overlap principles; in older adults, I need to ensure device selection matches inspiratory flow and dexterity; in young COPD, I should consider early-life exposures and family history and maintain a low threshold to diagnose and treat; and in multi-morbidity, I should simplify regimens and treat comorbidities per usual standards while avoiding therapeutic nihilism [^b68ec33c] [^1399b2e2] [^368a4cac] [^71bb36d5].

> But wait, what about disease-modifying claims beyond smoking cessation and oxygen. I initially thought only smoking cessation and long-term oxygen improve survival, and I should confirm that remains largely true; however, newer analyses suggest that optimized inhaled therapy, particularly triple therapy in high-risk patients, may reduce mortality, though this is hypothesis-generating and not as definitive as smoking cessation and oxygen for severe chronic hypoxemia, so I should frame this cautiously and individualize decisions [^1ab974f7] [^fabab145].

> Next, I should review palliative care integration, because symptom burden persists despite optimal therapy. For advanced refractory dyspnea, opioids can be considered in carefully selected patients; I should also proactively discuss goals of care, advance directives, and end-of-life preferences, and I must remember that palliative interventions are appropriate at any stage, not just terminal disease [^bbf5bc35] [^cf458cdf] [^15d20ad4].

> I need to ensure I address implementation barriers, because excellent guidelines often fail in real-world care. Underdiagnosis due to lack of spirometry, poor inhaler technique, and low adherence are common; solutions include embedding spirometry, standardized inhaler training, simplified regimens, and clinical decision support, and I should also remember that screening asymptomatic adults is not recommended by USPSTF, so case-finding should focus on symptomatic smokers and high-risk groups [^90c75fbb] [^1219db6c].

> Let me reconsider the overarching principles to close the loop. Treatment should be individualized to symptoms and exacerbation risk, anchored in shared decision-making; pharmacotherapy reduces symptoms and exacerbations and may modestly slow FEV1 decline, but smoking cessation remains the most impactful intervention; and I should continuously reassess, escalate when needed, and de-escalate when stable, always verifying inhaler technique and adherence before changing therapy [^601f56c6] [^6c4a432f] [^e8ae03c3].

Treat COPD by **confirming the diagnosis with post-bronchodilator spirometry** (FEV1/FVC < 0.70) [^22664f95] and **classifying severity by FEV1% predicted** [^22664f95]. Use **LAMA as first-line maintenance therapy** for symptomatic patients [^cd3db29b]; add LABA if symptoms persist or exacerbatons occur, and consider ICS only for frequent exacerbations or eosinophil ≥ 300/µL [^05ddfb0d] [^992a152c]. Provide smoking cessation support, annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, and pulmonary rehabilitation [^bc4cb753]. Manage exacerbations with SABA/SAMA, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics when indicated [^27a42c82]; use oxygen for severe chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SpO2 ≤ 88%) [^0236a95a]. Individualize therapy to symptoms, exacerbation risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and reassess regularly [^601f56c6].

---

## Diagnosis and severity classification

- **Diagnosis**: Confirm COPD with post-bronchodilator spirometry showing FEV1/FVC < 0.70 [^22664f95].

- **Severity**: Classify by FEV1% predicted: GOLD 1 (≥ 80%), GOLD 2 (50–79%), GOLD 3 (30–49%), GOLD 4 (< 30%) [^notfound].

- **Assessment**: Evaluate symptoms (CAT or mMRC) and exacerbation history to guide therapy [^2d17ee22].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Stable COPD

- **First-line therapy**: LAMA for symptomatic patients; consider LABA if LAMA is not tolerated [^cd3db29b].

- **Combination therapy**: Add LABA if symptoms persist or exacerbations occur [^7d66aeb4].

- **Triple therapy**: Consider LABA/LAMA/ICS for frequent exacerbations or eosinophil ≥ 300/µL [^05ddfb0d] [^992a152c].

- **ICS use**: Not recommended as monotherapy; reserve for exacerbation-prone patients due to pneumonia risk [^992a152c].

---

### Acute exacerbations

During acute exacerbations, **short-acting bronchodilators** (SABA ± SAMA) are first-line [^f310acaf]. Systemic corticosteroids shorten recovery and reduce relapse risk [^notfound]. Antibiotics are indicated for increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or purulence [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Smoking cessation**: Most effective intervention to slow progression [^d6611f5c].

- **Vaccinations**: Annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination [^bc4cb753].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life [^0424f736].

- **Oxygen therapy**: For severe chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SpO2 ≤ 88%) [^0236a95a].

---

## Individualized care and follow-up

Regularly reassess symptoms, exacerbation risk, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^601f56c6]. Adjust therapy based on response and side effects, and **ensure proper inhaler technique and adherence** [^034b4931].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Research targets **novel anti-inflammatory agents** and personalized medicine based on phenotypes and biomarkers [^ef4f7573] [^43b75652]. Digital health tools may improve adherence and remote monitoring [^notfound].

---

Effective COPD care requires **evidence-based pharmacotherapy**, non-pharmacologic interventions, and individualized, regularly reassessed management to reduce symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and improve quality of life [^601f56c6].

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a06ec887]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^011efcbc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^b46bce08]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice. Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those developed through the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, with the aim of providing the basis for local care pathways. The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care. A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function, the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD and that could possibly better categorize and predict outcome in these patients, and the impact of new clinical trial findings. Large ongoing outcome studies may also have an effect on defining best practice within future guideline recommendations.

### Current concepts in targeting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pharmacotherapy: making progress towards personalised management [^ef4f7573]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, complex, and heterogeneous disorder that is responsible for substantial and growing morbidity, mortality, and health-care expense worldwide. Of imperative importance to decipher the complexity of COPD is to identify groups of patients with similar clinical characteristics, prognosis, or therapeutic needs, the so-called clinical phenotypes. This strategy is logical for research but might be of little clinical value because clinical phenotypes can overlap in the same patient and the same clinical phenotype could result from different biological mechanisms. With the goal to match assessment with treatment choices, the latest iteration of guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease reorganised treatment objectives into two categories: to improve symptoms (ie, dyspnoea and health status) and to decrease future risk (as predicted by forced expiratory volume in 1 s level and exacerbations history). This change thus moves treatment closer to individualised medicine with available bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs. Yet, future treatment options are likely to include targeting endotypes that represent subtypes of patients defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Specific biomarkers of these endotypes would be particularly useful in clinical practice, especially in patients in which clinical phenotype alone is insufficient to identify the underlying endotype. A few series of potential COPD endotypes and biomarkers have been suggested. Empirical knowledge will be gained from proof-of-concept trials in COPD with emerging drugs that target specific inflammatory pathways. In every instance, specific endotype and biomarker efforts will probably be needed for the success of these trials, because the pathways are likely to be operative in only a subset of patients. Network analysis of human diseases offers the possibility to improve understanding of disease pathobiological complexity and to help with the development of new treatment alternatives and, importantly, a reclassification of complex diseases. All these developments should pave the way towards personalised treatment of patients with COPD in the clinic.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^27196cb6]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: getting it right. does optimal management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alter disease progression and improve survival? [^1ab974f7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We live in a world where people live longer lives. The standardized mortality rate for many diseases is decreasing. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not following this trend. Over the last 10 years, interventions for COPD have been developed, but have any changed the prognosis or trajectory of this modern epidemic? We review the most recent and classical literature in order to answer this question.

Recent Findings

Recent analyses of data have clarified which interventions are effective in COPD and which are not. New studies have defined what is achievable with the current therapies. Only two interventions have been demonstrated to improve survival: smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy. Other treatments do reduce exacerbations, improve lung function and improve the patient's quality of life, but do not affect physiological disease progression or mortality.

Summary

There is much work to do, not only to improve the treatments we have for this disease, but also to diagnose it early, intervene at the right time, reduce the treatment side-effects and most importantly understand the pathophysiology better. Moreover, we are duty bound to look at each patient and review what we are trying to achieve for each one through appropriate phenotyping as well as sometimes taking a more palliative approach.

### Review of drug development guidance to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US and EU perspectives [^43b75652]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a leading cause of death worldwide, yet only one new drug class has been approved in the last decade. However, resurgence in COPD treatment has been recently fueled by a greater understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease, as well as a growing prevalence and an aging population. Currently, there are nearly 25 novel drug targets in development. Furthermore, the indication has undergone some fundamental changes over the last couple of years, including an updated diagnosis paradigm, validation, and approval of patient-reported outcome questionnaires for clinical trials, and drug development tools, such as a prognostic biomarker for patient selection. In the context of clinical trials, this review aims to summarize recent changes to the diagnosis and evaluation of COPD and to provide an overview of US and European regulatory guidance.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^a5714eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

Background

The ultimate treatment goals in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management remain uniform across the majority of national and international COPD clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and include reduced symptoms, reduced exacerbation risk and improved quality of life. To achieve these goals, CPGs require regular updates with recent and relevant state-of-the-art medical and scientific developments. Guidelines strive to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce variations in the treatment and management of COPD.

Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on patient management based on available evidence and, in certain cases, educated opinion where there is no direct evidence available. The quality of the available evidence and the intended audience of CPGs remain core considerations for their development. In recent years, CPGs have further evolved in response to an increasing recognition of the need for more stringent, systematic approaches when recommending specific therapeutic interventions or strategies. The importance of rigorous processes to ensure that only accurate and appropriate treatment recommendations are made is now well-accepted among professional scientific societies. In fact, standards to guide the preparation of CPGs are now available. However, little attention is afforded to the challenges and pitfalls associated with the development of such documents.

A concerted effort between multiple stakeholders is needed to ensure precise, practical and up-to-date clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal management of COPD. Guidelines must be locally relevant; therefore local expert stakeholders should offer local proposals, while referring to global evidence-based documents.

This review article highlights the challenges associated with the development and implementation of national CPGs for COPD in Europe and Russia.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0aac7041]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^52db5bf4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2019 report defines COPD as a "common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway or alveolar abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases". Pharmacologic treatment for COPD aims to improve quality of life (QOL) and control symptoms while reducing the frequency of exacerbations.

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to address specific clinically important questions regarding the pharmacologic management of COPD. The expert panel, in collaboration with a team of methodologists, prioritized and developed six questions that addressed significant COPD management issues. These questions were rephrased by the methods team using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes (PICO) format, and panel members then compiled and prioritized a list of outcomes that were important for clinical decision-making and particularly important to patients. Evidence syntheses for each PICO question were focused on clinical outcomes deemed "critical" for clinical decision-making. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (see Table 1) for the following clinical questions:
1 In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, is LABA/LAMA combination therapy more effective than and as safe as LABA or LAMA monotherapy?
2 In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite use of dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, is triple therapy with ICS/LABA/LAMA more effective than and as safe as dual therapy with LABA/LAMA?
3 In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) should the ICS be withdrawn?
4 In patients with COPD with blood eosinophilia, should treatment include an ICS in addition to a long-acting bronchodilator?
5 In patients with COPD who have a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, is maintenance oral steroid therapy more effective than and as safe as no maintenance oral steroid therapy?
6 In patients with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy, is opioid-based therapy more effective than and as safe as no additional therapy?

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management — aims, assessment, and therapy review: The aim of COPD management is to reduce symptoms and future risk, COPD patients should have an assessment of the severity of their airflow obstruction, symptoms, history of exacerbations, exposure to risk factors and comorbidities to guide management, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy should be adjusted as necessary with further reviews undertaken.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^2b200b59]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Progress in management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by declining prevalence and expanding therapeutic options: The age-adjusted prevalence has declined since 1999, possibly due to overall population decrease in smoking rates, and COPD is now recognized as a significant public health problem with a greater amount of research being conducted on mechanisms and treatment effectiveness. Pharmacologic therapy is improving with better understanding of the disease process and novel drugs, and non-pharmacologic therapy, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, is becoming increasingly recognized as an effective option; while these treatment methods may not be appropriate for all patients, they allow providers to intervene early with numerous effective treatment options and increasing research and effective management strategies allow optimism that COPD can be managed effectively to provide patients with an improved QoL.

### Clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: review of therapeutic interventions [^d6611f5c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease in which patients experience a progressive decline in lung function. Based on clinical evidence, the management of COPD should focus on (1) earlier diagnosis; (2) risk reduction through smoking cessation, decreased exposure to inhaled irritants, and immunization against respiratory pathogens; (3) symptom reduction with pharmacotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation; (4) decreasing complications by reducing exacerbations and improving pulmonary function; and (5) improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Smoking cessation has been shown to slow lung function decline and to reduce mortality — including deaths due to lung cancer, other respiratory disease (including COPD), and cardiovascular disease. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines advocate interventions according to the severity of COPD and recommend initiation of maintenance long-acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with moderate disease. However, recent evidence from a post hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials of tiotropium suggests that initiation of long-acting bronchodilator therapy at earlier stages of disease may also provide improvements in lung function and HRQOL. The results of ongoing long-term studies may soon provide evidence that in addition to relieving symptoms and improving patient HRQOL, specific pharmacologic therapies may also alter the clinical course of COPD.

### Incidence, treatment options, and outcomes of lung cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^9d1e430a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An associative and mechanistic link between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer has long been suspected. This review describes the current understanding of the incidence, mechanism of association, treatment options, and outcome for lung cancer with COPD.

Recent Findings

COPD patients have an increased risk of lung cancer that is independent of smoking. New evidence suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the severity of airflow obstruction and the risk of lung cancer. Chronic inflammation associated with COPD may play a role in the development of lung cancer, and targeting airway inflammation with inhaled corticosteroids has been suggested as a possible preventive strategy. Although surgical lobectomy remains the standard of care for early stage lung cancer, less invasive approaches such as sublobar resection, stereotactic body radiation therapy, and radiofrequency ablation are promising techniques for patients with limited pulmonary reserve.

Summary

Progress is being made in identifying mechanistic links between COPD and lung cancer, which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for both disorders. Patients with COPD are likely to benefit from less-invasive surgical and nonsurgical treatment strategies for lung cancer, but further study is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these procedures.

### Systemic effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what we know and what we don't know (but should) [^185a0fdb]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with pulmonary and systemic inflammation. The latter is likely to contribute significantly to the pathobiology of numerous extrapulmonary effects of the disease — the so-called systemic effects of COPD. The clinical relevance of these systemic effects has been recently recognized; however, many important questions about its pathophysiology remain unanswered. This article reviews what is known about it and, more importantly, highlights what is not (but should be) known in order to stimulate research in this area, in the hope that a better understanding of this field may lead to better treatment options for patients with COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^22664f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^eeb5b207]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

### An update on pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^8f822698]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread disease process with important clinical and economic implications. This review will summarize new pharmacotherapy for the treatment of COPD.

Recent Findings

Several recent clinical trials have led to the approval of new inhaler therapies for COPD. Many of these are specifically targeting combination long-acting β-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists for late stage COPD.

Summary

Several new bronchodilators are available on the market, especially in combination form. The new drug combinations have positive data though clinical relevance, and comparisons to available and well established therapies are still needed. Specifically, translating improved forced expiratory volume into meaningful clinical outcomes remains challenging.

Implications of Strong and Conditional Recommendations: From the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^d722d5ac]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

Prevention and management of COPD — treatment goals and pharmacotherapy: The main treatment goals are to reduce symptoms and future risk of exacerbations, and the management strategy of stable COPD should be predominantly based on the assessment of symptoms and the history of exacerbations. Pharmacotherapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance, and data suggest beneficial effects on rates of lung function decline and mortality. Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side-effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices, and inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.

End-of-life care in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — research recommendations focus on evaluating communication, education, and symptom management. We recommend studies that demonstrate the impact of palliative care and end-of-life discussions on outcomes in patients with stable COPD; studies of educational approaches and tools to help clinicians better discuss palliative care and end-of-life care with patients with COPD; studies to confirm the importance of symptoms that impact patients with COPD at the end of life; and studies that identify symptoms that occur despite optimized COPD care and require palliation, followed by trials that compare the effects of various treatment options on those symptoms.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^15d20ad4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides clinical recommendations for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It represents a collaborative effort on the part of a panel of expert COPD clinicians and researchers along with a team of methodologists under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society. Methods: Comprehensive evidence syntheses were performed on all relevant studies that addressed the clinical questions and critical patient-centered outcomes agreed upon by the panel of experts. The evidence was appraised, rated, and graded, and recommendations were formulated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: After weighing the quality of evidence and balancing the desirable and undesirable effects, the guideline panel made the following recommendations: 1) a strong recommendation for the use of long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance; 2) a conditional recommendation for the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in patients with COPD and dyspnea or exercise intolerance who have experienced one or more exacerbations in the past year; 3) a conditional recommendation for ICS withdrawal for patients with COPD receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year; 4) no recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom ICS is conditionally recommended as an additive therapy; 5) a conditional recommendation against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations; and 6) a conditional recommendation for opioid-based therapy in patients with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy. Conclusions: The task force made recommendations regarding the pharmacologic treatment of COPD based on currently available evidence. Additional research in populations that are underrepresented in clinical trials is needed, including studies in patients with COPD 80 years of age and older, those with multiple chronic health conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient? [^280ff31e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Pharmacologic therapy: novel approaches for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0678082d]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in the United States and throughout the world. There have been a number of advances in the treatment of this disease within the last several decades, and these improved therapies continue to become available, making the prospects for the future encouraging. Bronchodilation is the treatment of choice, and we point out in this article the potential availability of many new bronchodilators. There will be several options in the beta(2)-agonist and the anticholinergic categories for once-a-day preparations. There will also be a number of products combining these categories of bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, and the combination products will be available in once-a-day preparations. Also under development are several candidates for specific and effective antiinflammatory agents in COPD. It is likely that our ability to control the inflammation underlying COPD will be a reality in the future. Although many new cases of COPD are being diagnosed in former smokers, for patients who smoke, the most important treatment is smoking cessation. A number of new drugs are available, and more will be brought to market in the future. We have highlighted the details of this important area.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Landscape

Despite being a preventable and treatable disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. 1 COPD is characterized by limited airflow due to pulmonary and alveolar abnormalities from significant exposure to noxious particles and gases resulting in chronic respiratory symptoms. 2 The majority of COPD cases are associated with cigarette smoking. However, exposure to biomass fuels or environmental pollutants can also cause COPD. There are nine approved drug categories for COPD maintenance medication. Yet, even with the plethora of treatment options for COPD, these therapies are largely iterations of bronchodilators, which open airways, with only one novel drug class having been approved in the last 25 years (Figure 1). A main barrier facing this indication is that the majority of these medications treat the symptoms of the disease and not the underlying inflammation nor disease progression. Novel investigational products in development targeting immune mediators may show promising results on this front.

This Executive Summary of the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 report focuses primarily on the revised and novel parts of the document. The most significant changes include: (1) the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been refined to separate the spirometric assessment from symptom evaluation. ABCD groups are now proposed to be derived exclusively from patient symptoms and their history of exacerbations; (2) for each of the groups A to D, escalation strategies for pharmacologic treatments are proposed; (3) the concept of deescalation of therapy is introduced in the treatment assessment scheme; (4) nonpharmacologic therapies are comprehensively presented; and (5) the importance of comorbid conditions in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is reviewed.

### Outpatient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: going for the GOLD [^df4d49a8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with a burden of $50 billion in direct health care costs. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines airflow obstruction as spirometry where the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity after bronchodilation is less than 0.70. The guidelines also provided graded recommendations on current therapy for COPD. Treatment can be guided based on severity of disease and severity of symptoms. We review the GOLD guidelines to provide an overview of treatment modalities aimed at improving lung function, reducing hospitalization, and reducing mortality.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITORS Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors reduce pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

Roflumilast, a PDE-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of COPD, reduces moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with severe to very severe COPD who have frequent exacerbations, especially those with a history of hospitalization for acute exacerbation. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis. Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment.

Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit. Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. LONG-TERM OXYGEN THERAPY The American Thoracic Society, U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and U. S. Department of Defense recommend long-term oxygen therapy for patients with COPD and severe resting hypoxemia.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a category of diseases with chronic airflow obstruction and hyperinflation. The GOLD committee and the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society have published detailed, evidence-based reviews of management, providing stepped-care algorithms for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy. Over the past several decades, this has led to numerous nonpharmacologic approaches to ameliorate symptoms in these patients.

### Medical therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2007 [^d7afe420]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Medical treatment for patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has evolved significantly over the past 2 decades. Current World Health Organization recommendations suggest a stepwise approach to therapy depending upon disease severity. As-needed use of short-acting bronchodilators is recommended for patients with mild disease. Scheduled dosing of bronchodilators is recommended for patients with more advanced disease. Inhaled beta-agonists and anti-cholinergic agents in combination have proved to be more effective than either agent alone. Long-acting preparations are associated with better disease control and have not been associated with tachyphylaxis. Inhaled corticosteroids are useful for reducing the frequency of exacerbations in patients who experience one or more episodes per year. Oxygen therapy is clearly beneficial in patients with advanced COPD and chronic respiratory failure, and its potential benefits in less severe disease are currently being studied. Pulmonary rehabilitation benefits patients with mild-to-severe disease, although the greatest benefits have been demonstrated in those with moderate COPD. New ultra-long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and retinoids intended to promote tissue regeneration are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as future therapeutic agents.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^32ef3871]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) kills more than 3 million people worldwide every year. Despite progress in the treatment of symptoms and prevention of acute exacerbations, few advances have been made to ameliorate disease progression or affect mortality. A better understanding of the complex disease mechanisms resulting in COPD is needed. Smoking cessation programmes, increasing physical activity, and early detection and treatment of comorbidities are further key components to reduce the burden of the disease. However, without a global political and economic effort to reduce tobacco use, to regulate environmental exposure, and to find alternatives to the massive use of biomass fuel, COPD will remain a major health-care problem for decades to come.

Expert Opinion

From the perspective of the clinician, COPD seems to have become more challenging to manage in recent years. The increasing prevalence of the disease in an aging population with multiple comorbidities together and the reality that mortality rates are increasing at a time when death rates in other chronic diseases have stabilized or even declined are contributing factors. However, from the earliest use of the term COPD in the late 1960s, this disease was considered as one confined to the lungs, characterized by fixed or partially reversible airflow limitation, and almost exclusively found in smokers. 100 Thankfully, there is now recognition that COPD is more complicated and the oversimplified understanding of the condition is outdated. The rejection of a "one‐size‐fits‐all" approach to therapy and the move toward targeting those at risk of disease exacerbations, considering systemic manifestations of the condition and identifying specific treatable traits are welcome developments. That is not to say that the medicines prescribed for years have not been helpful. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids remain a mainstay of treatment for many patients and do control symptoms and reduce exacerbation risk. However, the degree of efficacy is variable and because current medicines do not reduce mortality or alter the rate of lung function decline there is a clear need for new and more effective pharmacological treatments.

An improved understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for COPD will help move the management of COPD to a more precision‐based approach enjoyed by other specialties. A promising pipeline of novel drug entities is encouraging, but clinicians now need to consider, as experts in treating patients with COPD, how they can become active participants with academia, industry, patient advocacies, and public bodies in realizing the goal of improved pharmacotherapy for patients with COPD.

Exacerbation prevention

In contrast to treatment of acute events, recent years have seen publication of landmark trials in COPD which inform on exacerbation prevention and we now have a wide range of options available, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce exacerbation frequency. These are listed in Table 1, which also includes interventions known to reduce COPD hospitalisation (a closely related concept). Perhaps the greatest remaining challenge is to establish which patient will benefit from which combination of approaches, though there is still the need for novel interventions as current approaches are incompletely effective.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^da2744ac]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Introduction — global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) states that the GOLD Report provides a non-biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people with COPD, with treatment objectives organized into two groups that relieve and reduce the impact of symptoms and reduce the risk of adverse health events in the future. The original FEV1-based staging system is described, but at an individual level FEV1 alone is an unreliable marker of the severity of breathlessness, exercise limitation, health status impairment, and risk of exacerbation. The report highlights that there are simple and reliable questionnaires designed for routine clinical practice, enabling an assessment system that draws together the impact of symptoms and the patient's risk of a serious adverse health event and can be used in any clinical setting anywhere in the world to move COPD treatment toward individualized medicine.

### Adherence to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines in the real world: current understanding, barriers, and solutions [^90c75fbb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides a comprehensive review and guidance for clinicians managing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, adherence to GOLD guidelines has been suboptimal over the years. The current review summarizes the current body of literature addressing the multitude of reasons for the lack of adherence to GOLD guidelines in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

There continue to be several reasons for suboptimal adoption of GOLD guidelines in clinical practice. A primary and recurrent theme appears to be both delayed as well as missed diagnosis of COPD. There are several reasons for this including lack of awareness about current COPD guidelines, lack of availability as well as utilization of office spirometry and improper symptom assessment. Other issues include improper selection of proper pharmacotherapy options, misdiagnosis/mislabeling of COPD phenotypes, lack of smoking cessation counselling as well as enrollment in pulmonary rehabilitation. Potential solutions include adoption of clinical decision support systems, self-care models and careful phenotyping of COPD patients.

Summary

There are currently several barriers for the adoption of GOLD guidelines into routine clinical practice. These barriers are all amenable to systematic solutions that will increase adherence to current GOLD guidelines.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^819d3f86]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines offer important changes to the assessment and management of stable COPD of importance to practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and nurses who care for patients with COPD. Therapies are now chosen based on the burden of symptoms and the history of COPD exacerbations, and inhaler regimens are modifiable based on continual clinical reassessment. Although identifying the degree of airway obstruction remains important for informing the clinical status of the patient with COPD, FEV 1 is no longer used to direct the therapeutic approach. Therapies and modes of inhaled medication delivery for each GOLD grouping have been modified and reflect the need for reevaluation of patient symptoms and COPD exacerbation history as an indicator to add or withdraw therapies. As the knowledge of this important disease continues to expand, exacerbation and symptom prevention in patients with stable COPD will remain as an important target of COPD therapies and research. Novel drug combinations and delivery devices are sure to positively affect the practitioner's approach to patients with stable COPD. The new 2017 GOLD guidelines represent a step toward personalized care of the patient with COPD.

### New therapeutic drugs in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^5ee54396]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains a major health problem for which new and improved treatments are desperately needed. Recent trials strongly suggest that treatments are improving. Longer-acting bronchodilators will be more convenient and may have additional advantages. Combinations of bronchodilators may offer additive effects and, possibly, synergies. Inhaled glucocorticoids, although unable to alter the loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second when used alone, may reduce exacerbation frequency and health status deterioration and improve mortality. These clinically meaningful goals represent end points not previously targeted in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease drug development. Moreover, inhaled glucocorticoids may offer benefits in combination with long-acting beta-agonists. Finally, new classes of agents such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors are on the horizon. The prospect for better treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease looks brighter than ever. Caution is required, however. Much of the excitement has been generated by small studies, presented only in abstract form, and as yet unpublished work. Therapeutic recommendations will require publication of appropriately designed and adequately powered clinical trials.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease activity — Activity of a disease relates to the level of activation of the biological processes that drive disease progression and Disease activity is a different concept than disease severity. Disease progression in established COPD is heterogeneous, ranging from rapid progression to stable or even improved lung function, suggesting that disease activity is also variable. We recommend: Studies that relate potential biomarkers of disease activity to patient-centered outcomes to validate the biomarkers as clinically useful measures of disease activity. We recommend: Studies that evaluate the impact of disease activity on treatment response and, conversely, the effects of treatment on disease activity.

Key Points for Practice
- For stable COPD, LAMAs are the most effective monotherapy.
- For continued symptoms despite LAMA monotherapy, consider adding a LABA, followed by an ICS.
- In COPD exacerbations, adding antibiotics to oral corticosteroids reduces treatment failure but does not reduce repeat exacerbations or mortality.
- Supplemental oxygen is only beneficial for patients with severe resting hypoxemia. From the AFP Editors Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a devastating disease affecting more than 16 million Americans, and the third leading cause of death globally. Mortality from COPD has increased over the past 50 years, and mortality in women has surpassed that in men. The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U. S. Department of Defense published guidelines for the primary care management of COPD.

Stable COPD Treatment Long-acting bronchodilators are the primary maintenance therapy for stable COPD because they decrease dyspnea and exacerbations while improving quality of life. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists reduce exacerbations and hospitalizations more than long-acting beta agonists, with fewer adverse events, and are the most effective monotherapy. No LAMA formulation appears to be more effective than any other. Monotherapy with an inhaled corticosteroid is less effective than either LABA or LAMA monotherapy and increases the risk of candidiasis, hoarseness, and pneumonia. Adding an ICS to LABA/LAMA combination therapy further reduces exacerbations, with a number needed to treat of 38, but increases pneumonia risk with an number needed to harm of 195. After two years of triple therapy without exacerbations, consider withdrawing the ICS if the peripheral eosinophil count is less than 300 cells per μL.

Treating Exacerbations Oral corticosteroids are standard for treating COPD exacerbations, but the benefit of antibiotic therapy is less clear. Although antibiotic therapy reduces treatment failure during the exacerbation, there is no improvement in mortality or reduction of repeat exacerbations. Antibiotic treatment increases the risks of diarrhea and antimicrobial resistance. Using C-reactive protein to guide antibiotic therapy does not improve outcomes. Supplemental Oxygen Supplemental oxygen reduces mortality in patients with chronic stable resting severe hypoxemia, which is defined as an oxygen saturation of 88% or less or partial pressure of oxygen (Pao.

Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: a comprehensive care framework [^0424f736]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals. Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations. In addition to controlled oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, brief courses of systemic corticosteroids and, on occasion, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation may play a role. The role of respiratory therapists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and exacerbations is absolutely essential if the goals of the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines are to be attained.

### The path to personalised medicine in COPD [^ac10fc80]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Our understanding of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has changed dramatically over the past two decades. We have moved from an airflow limitation-centric view to the realisation that COPD is a complex and heterogeneous disease, which leads inevitably to the need for personalising the assessment and treatment of patients with COPD. This review provides a brief perspective of the extraordinary transition that the COPD field has experienced in the last two decades, and speculates on how it should/can move forward in the near future in order to really achieve the goal of personalising COPD medicine in the clinic.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide, yet only one new drug class has been approved in the last decade. However, resurgence intreatment has been recently fueled by a greater understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease, as well as a growing prevalence and an aging population. Currently, there are nearly 25 novel drug targets in development. Furthermore, the indication has undergone some fundamental changes over the last couple of years, including an updated diagnosis paradigm, validation, and approval of patient‐reported outcome questionnaires for clinical trials, and drug development tools, such as a prognostic biomarker for patient selection. In the context of clinical trials, this review aims to summarize recent changes to the diagnosis and evaluation ofand to provide an overview of US and European regulatory guidance.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^1ea72cfb]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with a significant mortality, health and economic burden. Their diagnosis, assessment and management remain suboptimal and unchanged for decades. Recent clinical and translational studies revealed that the significant heterogeneity in mechanisms and outcomes of exacerbations could be resolved by grouping them etiologically. This is anticipated to lead to a better understanding of the biological processes that underlie each type of exacerbation and to allow the introduction of precision medicine interventions that could improve outcomes. This review summarises novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations.

COPD pharmacotherapy research priorities — We recommend: therapeutic trials that analyze outcomes among different COPD subtypes, particularly those subtypes that are at greatest risk for an undesirable outcome; therapeutic trials that compare outcomes among current smokers with former smokers; therapeutic trials that evaluate outcomes using different thresholds for initiating, adding, and withdrawing medications; therapeutic trials that compare outcomes among patients treated with different medications (as opposed to placebo-controlled studies), with examples including comparisons of LAMA therapy with each type of LABA therapy and comparisons of combination LAMA/LABA therapy with LABA/ ICS, LAMA, and LABA therapy; and trials comparing strategies of pharmacological treatment, such as treatment initiation with one single agent and then further step-up if symptoms are not controlled vs. immediate double or triple therapy. We recommend: studies of devices aimed at improving cough, sputum production, and dyspnea; studies assessing how pharmacological treatment complements rehabilitation programs; real-life observational studies (i.e., effectiveness studies) that assess the results of randomized trials (i.e., efficacy trials) may be applied to broader patient populations in usual care settings; studies that determine the risk for pneumonia conferred by each formulation of the LABA/ICS combination as well as the etiology and natural history of pneumonia in patients treated with ICS; studies that evaluate the effects of treating common comorbidities on COPD-specific outcomes as well as the effects of treating COPD on outcomes specific to common comorbidities; studies that identify and validate instruments that objectively determine a patient's response to therapy; studies that compare outcomes among patients managed with various strategies to improve adherence, including inhaler choice and education; studies that compare outcomes among patients who use an inhaler with those who use a nebulizer; and studies of patients who are diagnosed with COPD at an early age to determine if early intervention reduces disease progression.

### Review of drug development guidance to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US and EU perspectives [^6e4bfc08]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the GOLD stages 1–4 are used to describe the severity of airflow limitation and represent important cutoffs for clinical study inclusion/exclusion criteria, this patient characterization based on FEV 1 alone lacks sufficient precision to predict those at risk of adverse outcomes, including disease exacerbations or mortality and to adequately guide treatment decisions. Therefore, the GOLD consortium issued a combined approach for COPD grading in 2017. 2 In this paradigm, patients undergo spirometry to determine severity of airflow limitation (which helps define prognosis) and are assessed for severity of symptoms and history of exacerbations. The best predictor of future exacerbations is a history of treated exacerbations. 14 Frequent exacerbators are defined as those reporting two or more per year or at least one requiring hospitalization or an emergency department visit. Symptoms are assessed by two main tools; the COPD Assessment Test or the modified Medical Research Council questionnaires. COPD Assessment Test is an eight‐item questionnaire with a total score of 40 that captures information regarding health status, 15 and the modified Medical Research Council is a 4‐grade scale for breathlessness. 16 Based on these outcomes, patients are categorized into four GOLD grades A−D reflecting symptom burden and exacerbation risk (Table 1). The GOLD grades are intended to guide clinician treatment decisions as well as pharmacological therapy escalation and de‐escalation if required.

Current Treatment Options

The majority of approved COPD medications are either bronchodilators or anti‐inflammatory therapies, and the following briefly outlines the current treatment options for COPD; there are a number of excellent reviews that summarize the safety and efficacy of these marketed COPD medications. 17, 18, 19

Bronchodilators

Bronchodilators are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of COPD. 20 Two classes of bronchodilators can be distinguished: β2‐adrenoreceptor agonists and muscarinic antagonists. The β2‐adrenoreceptor agonists stimulate airway smooth muscles to induce bronchodilation. Although their anti‐inflammatory properties have been postulated to contribute to their efficacy in COPD treatment, this has not been proven to be relevant for the clinical setting. 21, 22 Muscarinic receptors affect bronchial motor tone and mucus secretion through the cholinergic system by coupling to G‐proteins Gα q/11 (M1, M3, and M5 receptor subtypes) or Gα i/o (M2 and M4 receptor subtypes). Although M2 receptors indirectly affect airway smooth muscle contraction, M3 receptors dominantly contribute to relaxation and dilation of airway smooth muscles. M3 receptors also mediate cholinergic effects on mucus secretion. Selective M3‐muscarinic receptor inhibition improves bronchodilation as well as mucus production. 23, 24

As summarized in Table 1, GOLD class A patients are typically well managed on either a short‐acting or long‐acting bronchodilator depending upon their symptoms. GOLD class B patients may start on a single long‐acting β2‐adrenoreceptor (LABA) or long‐acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). If symptoms of breathlessness persist on monotherapy, they may be escalated to dual therapy with LABA and LAMA treatments. Patients with GOLD class C (currently defined as relatively low symptom burden but high exacerbation risk) often start on an LAMA and advance to LABA + LAMA upon further exacerbations. Combined treatment with LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can also be considered. Finally, LABA + LAMA is a recommended starting therapy for GOLD class D patients. In patients who develop further exacerbations, the guideline recommends considering escalation to triple therapy (LAMA + LABA + ICS or switching to LABA + ICS). 2 Table 2 lists the maintenance COPD medication approved in the United States and the European Union.

COPD maintenance medication

Triple therapy has been shown to have favorable characteristics compared with single LAMA or dual LAMA + LABA or LABA + ICS therapy, and its use is currently also under consideration for patients with less severe COPD or selected phenotypes. 25, 26

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis and management in older adults [^1399b2e2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in older adults is a complex disorder with several unique age-related aspects. Underlying changes in pulmonary lung function and poor sensitivity to bronchoconstriction and hypoxia with advancing age can place older adults at greater risk of mortality or other complications from COPD. The establishment of the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, which can be effectively applied to older adults, has more rigorously defined the diagnosis and management of COPD. An important component of this approach is the use of spirometry for disease staging, a procedure that can be performed in most older adults. The management of COPD includes smoking cessation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, and the use of short-and long-acting bronchodilators. Unlike with asthma, corticosteroid inhalers represent a third-line option for COPD. Combination therapy is frequently required. When using various inhaler designs, it is important to note that older adults, especially those with more-severe disease, may have inadequate inspiratory force for some dry-powder inhalers, although many older adults find the dry-powder inhalers easier to use than metered-dose inhalers. Other important treatment options include pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, noninvasive positive airway pressure, and depression and osteopenia screening. Clinicians caring for older adults with an acute COPD exacerbation should also guard against prognostic pessimism. Although COPD is associated with significant disability, there is a growing range of treatment options to assist patients.

Evolving COPD guidelines

2011 saw a substantial revision of the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for diagnosis, management, and prevention of COPD, which has recently been updated. Recommendations for treatment are no longer based primarily on categorization ("staging") by spirometric assessment, but on categorization by existing symptoms (using validated modified Medical Research Council and COPD Assessment Test questionnaires) and risk (based on severity of airflow limitation and history of exacerbations). This approach acknowledges the importance of consideration of both short- and long-term outcomes when making treatment decisions (Figure 1).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological treatment (Figure 3.9) presents suggested escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy and safety data and can be applied to any patient already taking maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed, and when treatment modification, in particular de-escalation, is considered, patients should be under close medical supervision. The report notes that treatment escalation has not been systematically tested and that trials of de-escalation are limited and only include ICS. If response to initial treatment is appropriate, maintain it; if not, check adherence, inhaler technique and possible interfering comorbidities, evaluate whether dyspnea/activity limitation or prevention of exacerbations is the predominant treatable trait, use the exacerbation pathway if both need to be targeted, then select the corresponding algorithm and identify the box matching the current treatment to follow the suggested algorithm.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^cee1f3bc]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

There is potential for significant alleviation of time and budget constraints through a concerted, collaborative effort between European countries. Who should take the lead during such a collaboration remains to be discussed, but it is likely that the European Respiratory Society (ERS) is in the best position to lead such a project. The ERS is committed to the development of high quality CPGs, and either alone or in concert with sister societies such as the American Thoracic Society (ATS), has also delivered evidence-based CPGs for the management of COPD. Developing a European collaboration would be best achieved through the ERS and national societies, agreeing on a common methodology. Tight links with the GOLD group could also be useful to share retrieved evidence and increase reactivity, allowing a continuous update and adaptation process.

Can COPD guidelines be simplified?

There is an apparent contradiction between the exponential increase in the scientific knowledge of COPD complexity (phenotypes, endotypes, comorbidities etc.) and the need for simplified treatment pathways. Complex raw data needs to be aggregated and translated into meaningful, useful information to support recommendations of new treatments. Algorithms may be helpful to guide COPD therapy in a simple, stepwise and coordinated manner. Such algorithms need to be flexible and continuously evolving in order to remain up-to-date and clinically relevant. Importantly, the availability of algorithms does not negate the need for scientific principles, and the role of clinical judgement should always be acknowledged.

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1219db6c]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible reduction of airflow in the lungs. Progression to severe disease can prevent participation in normal activities because of deterioration of lung function. In 2020 it was estimated that approximately 6% of US adults had been diagnosed with COPD. Chronic lower respiratory disease, composed mainly of COPD, is the sixth leading cause of death in the US.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update that focused on targeted key questions for benefits and harms of screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults and treatment in screen-detected or screen-relevant adults.

Population

Asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms.

Evidence Assessment

Using a reaffirmation process, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults. (D recommendation).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pharmacotherapy — long-acting beta agonist/inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and LABA/LAMA combinations: The LABA/ICS combination improves health-related quality of life and reduces the risk of a COPD exacerbation, reduces the rate of lung function decline when compared with placebo but not when compared with a LABA alone or ICS alone, may have a modest effect on overall mortality, and has an increased risk of pneumonia. The LABA/ICS combination is equivalent to a LAMA in exacerbation prevention, and adding a LAMA to LABA/ICS appears to reduce the rate of severe exacerbations and improve symptoms in patients with moderate or severe COPD. LABA/LAMA combinations appear to increase lung function to a greater degree than a LAMA alone, but their effect on the frequency of COPD exacerbations is less certain. Criteria for adding and withdrawing medications are uncertain; a trial suggested that withdrawal of ICS may not increase the risk of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations, there is an overall paucity of evidence about when COPD medications can be safely withdrawn, and tools are needed to facilitate objective assessment of medication effects. Adherence to inhaled medications has a significant impact on patient-centered outcomes, administrative database analysis suggests that less frequent dosing is a way to improve adherence, other strategies such as method of administration and behavioral approaches have not been confirmed due to insufficient study, a high proportion of patients have poor inhaler technique which appears to negatively affect outcomes, and choosing the right device, educating on inhaler technique, and regularly checking inhaler use are important components of COPD management.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should no longer be seen as a condition for which little can be done. Novel pharmacotherapeutic interventions, surgical and procedural advances, and respiratory assist devices have provided numerous ways to help patients with COPD and treatable traits. For nearly 30 years, non-invasive ventilation, the application of positive pressure through a mask interface placed outside of the airway, has been the cornerstone for treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation. Clinical trials indicate that this intervention could benefit patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in a stable state. This narrative review aims to provide the necessary background for internists to consider this therapeutic option for their COPD patients. We discuss the mechanism of action and implementation, and provide a glimpse into the future of this promising intervention.

Results

Question 1: In Patients with COPD Who Complain of Dyspnea or Exercise Intolerance, Is LABA/LAMA Combination Therapy More Effective than and as Safe as LABA or LAMA Monotherapy?

Recommendation

For patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, we recommend LABA/LAMA combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking hospital admissions, dyspnea, exacerbations, health-related QOL, and treatment-related adverse events as critical outcomes.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 2,543 citations in MEDLINE (n = 1,086), Embase (n = 1,290), and the Cochrane Library (n = 167), with deduplication resulting in n = 1,845 warranting screening. Six additional studies were identified through other means. The majority (98.6%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, and this resulted in screeners identifying 24 studies for final review inclusion. All 24 identified studies were RCTs.

The total sample size for the 24 studies was 45,441 participants; 29,589 (65.4%) of these participants were randomized to the treatment/intervention arms and 15,852 (34.6%) were in the control (comparator) arms.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^f310acaf]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

Main points of the roundtable consensus were as follows: (1) Spirometry is required for the diagnosis and staging of patients with COPD before treatment initiation; (2) all patients with COPD should be counseled to stop smoking, encouraged to start regular physical activity, and given a yearly influenza vaccination; (3) severity-based drug treatment of mild or moderate COPD, which accounts for 95% of all COPD cases, generally involves long-acting ≥ 1 bronchodilator because of their effectiveness and convenience; (4) patient response in terms of dyspnea, exercise ability, and side effects should be the primary guide for monitoring therapy; and (5) proper treatment of COPD can relieve patient symptoms, boost exercise capacity, reduce the number and severity of exacerbations, and improve the overall quality of life. We conclude that implementation of a relatively simple evidence-based treatment algorithm can be applied to that vast majority of the COPD population seen only in primary care.

Current treatment guidelines

A recent review of COPD treatment guidelines published in Europe and Russia in the last 7 years found that although there were differences in some recommended treatments, there was a general agreement on treatment goals and the use of LABD as the cornerstone of COPD treatment.

The GOLD strategy establishes pharmacologic treatment algorithms by groups of different risk and intensity of symptoms. For patients in GOLD group A (low risk and low symptom burden), a bronchodilator should be offered to reduce breathlessness. For patients in GOLD group B (low risk and high symptom burden), the preferred initial therapy should be a LABD. If the symptoms persist, therapy with two bronchodilators may be considered.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines updated in 2010 recommended that patients with FEV1 > 50% predicted with exacerbations or persistent airflow obstruction should be offered LABDs, and in the case of persistence of symptoms, patients should receive either LABA/ICS or LAMA/LABA.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^078af317]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — evidence and caveats for first-line long-acting bronchodilator therapy: Evidence suggests that, in patients with symptomatic COPD, long-acting bronchodilators decrease dyspnea, improve QoL, and decrease exacerbations compared to placebo, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and LABAs do not increase the risk of serious adverse events or total adverse events. Long-acting bronchodilators do not supplant short-acting bronchodilators, which may improve lung function and decrease respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. LAMAs remain the first-line maintenance therapy for symptomatic patients with confirmed COPD, with comparative reviews showing LAMAs were more effective in reducing the risk of acute exacerbations and were associated with less adverse events than LABAs; further supporting LAMAs over LABAs for first-line monotherapy, patients treated with LAMAs had reduced risk of severe exacerbations leading to hospitalization. The guideline update identified two SRs comparing various LAMAs, and neither review found that one LAMA was superior to another in terms of safety or efficacy. For certain patient populations, such as those with glaucoma or urinary retention who may not tolerate a LAMA or may be reluctant to start a LAMA given the perceived risk of an adverse outcome, a LABA could be considered as a first-line agent for symptomatic COPD. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with concomitant asthma and relief medication — if patients with COPD have concomitant asthma they should be treated like patients with asthma, and under these circumstances the use of an ICS is mandatory. Rescue short-acting bronchodilators should be prescribed to all patients for immediate symptom relief.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^fabab145]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to combination therapy, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that LABA/LAMA/ICS triple therapy improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations compared to LABA/ICS, LABA/LAMA, and LAMA monotherapy.
Recognize that recent data suggests a beneficial effect of triple inhaled therapy versus fixed-dose LABA/LAMA combinations on mortality in symptomatic patients with COPD with a history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^293afcfd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Standard pharmacological therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Lung function is improved and the frequency of acute COPD exacerbations is reduced by long-acting β-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), combined LABA/ICS, and long-acting antimuscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), and health-related quality of life is also improved by ICS, LABAs, LABA/ICS, and LAMAs. The rate of decline of lung function might be reduced by inhaled medications based on subgroup analyses, with one analysis suggesting that LABAs alone, ICS alone, and LABA/ICS may reduce the rate of decline but that the effect was modest, as the reduced rate of decline of lung function achieved with inhaled medications was only about half that achieved with smoking cessation and sustained abstinence; another analysis suggested that LAMAs may reduce the rate of decline among patients with moderate COPD (i.e. GOLD stage 2), even though the randomized trial found no such effect among the entire population. Some treatments were found to prevent exacerbations preferentially in patients with a history of chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations, and patients with a history of two or more exacerbations during the previous year responded better to preventative therapy in some studies. As an as-needed inhaled short-acting β-agonist is generally the first medication initiated, often with a standing dose of an inhaled long-acting bronchodilator, the optimal long-acting bronchodilator regimen is unknown. In a systematic review of seven randomized trials directly comparing a LAMA (tiotropium) with LABAs, meta-analyses found that the LAMA had a greater effect on reducing COPD exacerbations, exacerbation-related hospitalizations, and adverse effects, with no differences in mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, symptoms, or lung function, although the meta-analyses were limited by heterogeneity suggesting potential influences of the specific LABA, population studied, or genetic predisposition.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) group E — initial pharmacologic therapy favors dual bronchodilation, as LABA+LAMA is the preferred choice for initial therapy in group E patients provided there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side-effects. Use of LABA+ICS in COPD is not encouraged; if there is an indication for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), then LABA+LAMA+ICS has been shown to be superior to LABA+ICS and is therefore the preferred choice. Consider LABA+LAMA+ICS in group E if eos ≥ 300 cells/μL (practical recommendation); although there are no direct data on initiating triple therapy in newly diagnosed patients, available studies performed mostly in treated patients provide a rationale for considering this option for patients with a high eosinophil count (≥ 300 cells/μL).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Terminology for early and mild COPD: Identifying "early" COPD is difficult, and "we propose to use the term "early COPD" only to discuss the "biological" first steps of the disease in an experimental setting". Regarding severity labels, "we propose that "mild" should not be used to identify "early" COPD and used only to describe the severity of airflow obstruction measured spirometrically".

### Weighing the evidence for pharmacological treatment interventions in mild COPD; a narrative perspective [^c8debbd3]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

There is increasing focus on understanding the nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during the earlier stages. Mild COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage 1 or the now-withdrawn GOLD stage 0) represents an early stage of COPD that may progress to more severe disease. This review summarises the disease burden of patients with mild COPD and discusses the evidence for treatment intervention in this subgroup. Overall, patients with mild COPD suffer a substantial disease burden that includes persistent or potentially debilitating symptoms, increased risk of exacerbations, increased healthcare utilisation, reduced exercise tolerance and physical activity, and a higher rate of lung function decline versus controls. However, the evidence for treatment efficacy in these patients is limited due to their frequent exclusion from clinical trials. Careful assessment of disease burden and the rate of disease progression in individual patients, rather than a reliance on spirometry data, may identify patients who could benefit from earlier treatment intervention.

### Meeting the GOLD standard: COPD treatment in the UK today [^ab9cbe0c]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its first report almost 20 years ago, the Global initiative in chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has had a major effect on COPD management. The GOLD system of classifying COPD has been widely adopted both clinically and academically while the regularly updated treatment recommendations has led to their promotion ahead of more formal evidence-based documents like The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Initially GOLD classified COPD severity by the degree of FEV 1 impairment, but now a more sophisticated (and complex) approach stratifies by symptom intensity (commonly using a cut-point of 2 on the modified MRC dyspnoea scale) and on a history of exacerbations. The resultant 4 × 4 classification of clinical phenotypes from minimal symptoms without exacerbations to severe symptoms and frequent/significant exacerbations is graded A-D and has been linked to both initial and subsequent treatment choices.

GOLD 2025 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) report methodology — program history, update cycle, search strategy, and review process are specified as follows: The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) program was initiated in 1998; the first report was issued in 2001; complete revisions were prepared in 2006 and 2011; and the GOLD Science Committee was established in 2002 to review research and to post yearly updates. This 2025 GOLD Report is the second update of the 2023-revised report, and the 2023 GOLD Report was the 5th major revision. Updates of the 2017-revised report were made in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022; updates of the 2011-revised report were released in January 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Evidence identification used a PubMed search with Committee-defined fields: 1) COPD or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (All Fields) AND 2) Clinical Trials or Meta-analysis (All Fields) OR 3) articles in the top 20 medical or respiratory journals (available on request) or The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; publications not captured by the search could be submitted in English. Each abstract is assigned to two unbiased Committee members, and reviewers answer four specific written questions to assess impact on recommendations and identify modifications; the GOLD Science Committee meets twice yearly to discuss potentially impactful publications, the full Committee reaches a consensus on inclusion or change to the report, and in the absence of consensus disagreements are decided by an open vote of the full Committee.
