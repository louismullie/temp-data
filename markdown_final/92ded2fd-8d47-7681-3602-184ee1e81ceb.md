## Question

Severe aortic stenosis complication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the complications of severe aortic stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define severe aortic stenosis and the baseline natural history. Then, I should categorize complications by organ system and pathophysiology. Next, I will quantify mortality and morbidity where possible, consider special populations, and finally integrate management implications and evidence gaps, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and baseline risk so I don't anchor on outdated thresholds. Severe aortic stenosis is typically defined by a peak aortic jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s, mean gradient ≥ 40 mmHg, and/or valve area < 1.0 cm², with very severe disease around ≥ 5.0 m/s or ≥ 60 mmHg, which carries faster progression and higher event risk, and in symptomatic patients, untreated severe AS has a 2–3 year median survival with high mortality once symptoms appear [^9b9b8de5] [^cb05c131] [^65e72bcb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "complications" without organizing them. I will categorize complications into four buckets: hemodynamic instability, myocardial injury and heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden death, and systemic or procedural complications, and I will try to quantify each where data exist while noting uncertainties [^a5cfda49].

> I will now examine hemodynamic instability and perfusion failure. Severe AS reduces cardiac output and coronary perfusion, leading to syncope, presyncope, and exertional hypotension; in acute settings, bradycardia or tachycardia can precipitate collapse, and patients are exquisitely sensitive to preload and afterload changes, which is why anesthesia and critical care protocols emphasize tight heart rate and blood pressure control to avoid decompensation [^bfe9bb94] [^5c19125e].

> Next, I should review myocardial injury and heart failure progression. Chronic pressure overload drives concentric hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and eventually systolic failure; once LVEF falls below 50%, outcomes worsen and guideline-directed AVR becomes a Class I indication even if asymptomatic, and importantly, myocardial fibrosis and irreversible injury can accrue before symptoms are recognized, limiting recovery after valve replacement [^9ca0bbbe] [^7579aab3] [^2c58483c].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of heart failure risk in moderate disease, because I initially thought severe AS was the only stage with high HF risk. Observational data show moderate AS carries substantial mortality and HF hospitalization, with pooled all-cause mortality around 9 per 100 person-years and HF events around 3.9 per 100 person-years, and risk is amplified by diabetes, CAD, symptoms, and LV dysfunction, supporting closer surveillance and reconsideration of early intervention in selected patients [^4368c642] [^32159d51].

> I need to check arrhythmic complications and sudden cardiac death carefully. Asymptomatic severe AS has a low but real sudden death risk near 1% per year, which rises with very severe hemodynamics; atrial fibrillation is common and worsens outcomes after AVR, and conduction system disease with AV block can occur, particularly after TAVR, necessitating permanent pacing in a meaningful minority [^9b9b8de5] [^c33b8ad9] [^985bf164].

> Let me consider systemic and procedural complications next. In noncardiac surgery, undiagnosed severe AS increases perioperative mortality and MI roughly 10–30%, with severity-dependent risk; in pregnancy, severe AS increases maternal heart failure and arrhythmias and fetal growth restriction; and in the TAVR era, vascular injury, stroke, paravalvular leak, and pacemaker implantation are key procedure-related risks, though contemporary series show improving safety profiles [^682c4da1] [^5356a56e] [^7ad6bd52] [^985bf164].

> But wait, what if the patient is "asymptomatic" — does that truly mitigate risk? I should double-check progression data. Even in asymptomatic severe AS, symptom onset is common within 2–5 years and very severe hemodynamics portend earlier events; exercise testing unmasks symptoms in a substantial fraction, and randomized data suggest early AVR can reduce death, MI, stroke, or HF hospitalization versus watchful waiting in selected asymptomatic patients, reinforcing the need for proactive surveillance and timely referral [^c659cef5] [^9b9b8de5] [^02b1c291].

> Next, I should review special populations where complications and management differ. In women, smaller annuli and vessels increase vascular and bleeding risk with TAVR, yet some data suggest better survival with TAVR than SAVR, prompting dedicated trials like RHEIA; in chronic kidney disease, mortality is higher and referral to AVR is lower, but AVR still confers survival benefit even in dialysis; and in cancer, TAVR is feasible with acceptable short-term outcomes though long-term survival remains limited by oncologic disease [^c7869bd2] [^a7a18a99] [^42554c15] [^facdcc39].

> I should confirm the practical management implications so I don't overgeneralize. Symptomatic severe AS warrants prompt AVR by guideline-directed pathways, with TAVR or SAVR selected via Heart Team and shared decision-making; asymptomatic patients with LVEF < 50%, abnormal exercise test, very severe hemodynamics, or rapid progression should be considered for early AVR; and for noncardiac surgery, symptomatic severe AS should have AVR beforehand when feasible, with balloon valvuloplasty as a bridge in select unstable patients [^9ca0bbbe] [^4fbdf7c2] [^682c4da1] [^6de1a16f].

> Hold on, I should verify evidence gaps and avoid overstating certainty. The optimal timing of intervention in moderate AS and in asymptomatic severe AS without classic triggers remains under active investigation; biomarkers like NT-proBNP and imaging markers such as midwall fibrosis are promising for risk stratification, and ongoing randomized trials like EASY-AS and EVOLVED will clarify whether earlier intervention improves hard outcomes, so current decisions should individualize risk and align with patient preferences [^fd5a92aa] [^c93cceaf] [^2be535b4].

> In summary, severe aortic stenosis complications span hemodynamic collapse, progressive heart failure with potential irreversible myocardial injury, arrhythmias including sudden death, and systemic risks such as perioperative catastrophe; these complications are severity- and stage-dependent, often amplified by comorbidities, and frequently begin before overt symptoms, which is why timely recognition, structured surveillance, and guideline-concordant AVR — increasingly via TAVR across risk strata — are essential to mitigate the high mortality and morbidity of untreated disease [^a5cfda49] [^9ca0bbbe] [^7ad6bd52].

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) leads to **life-threatening complications** if untreated, including heart failure, sudden cardiac death, and syncope [^a5cfda49]. The most critical complication is **heart failure** from chronic pressure overload, with a 2-year mortality > 50% once symptoms appear [^8a169fd9]. Other major complications include **arrhythmias** (notably atrial fibrillation and conduction block), infective endocarditis, and ischemic events from reduced coronary perfusion [^c33b8ad9] [^7ad6bd52]. Perioperative risk is markedly elevated in noncardiac surgery, with 10–30% cardiac complications if severe AS is unrecognized [^682c4da1]. Early aortic valve replacement (SAVR or TAVR) is the only definitive therapy and improves survival and symptoms [^130f8c9e] [^7ad6bd52].

---

## Heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction

- **Pathophysiology**: Chronic pressure overload causes concentric LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and eventual systolic failure [^2c58483c].
- **Clinical impact**: Symptomatic severe AS carries a 2-year mortality > 50% without intervention [^8a169fd9].
- **Irreversibility**: Delayed AVR can result in persistent myocardial dysfunction despite valve replacement [^bc28df02].

---

## Arrhythmias and conduction disturbances

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Common and associated with worse outcomes, higher stroke risk, and decompensation [^c33b8ad9].
- **Conduction block**: Progressive calcification can cause AV block, often requiring pacemaker after TAVR [^985bf164].
- **Sudden cardiac death**: Occurs in ~1% per year in asymptomatic severe AS, rising with symptoms [^9b9b8de5].

---

## Infective endocarditis

Infective endocarditis is a **rare but serious complication** with high morbidity and mortality; calcified valves increase susceptibility, and prevention relies on antibiotic prophylaxis per guidelines.

---

## Ischemic complications

Ischemic complications arise from **reduced coronary perfusion** due to limited diastolic filling time and hypertrophy, leading to angina and increased myocardial infarction risk, especially during stress or surgery [^682c4da1].

---

## Perioperative complications in noncardiac surgery

Perioperative complications in noncardiac surgery are **common and severe** when severe AS is unrecognized, with 10–30% cardiac complications (MI, arrhythmias, heart failure) and a 5-fold increase in risk versus patients without AS [^682c4da1] [^78e6ad4f]. Management should include preoperative recognition and, when feasible, preoperative AVR or a bridge strategy [^682c4da1] [^6de1a16f].

---

## Sudden cardiac death

Sudden cardiac death occurs at approximately **1% per year in asymptomatic severe AS**, with risk rising after symptom onset; early AVR reduces this risk [^9b9b8de5] [^130f8c9e].

---

## Summary of complications and their clinical significance

| **Complication** | **Clinical significance** | **Frequency/impact** |
|-|-|-|
| Heart failure | Major cause of morbidity/mortality | 2-year mortality > 50% if untreated [^8a169fd9] |
| Arrhythmias (AF, conduction block) | Worsen outcomes, increase stroke risk | Common; pacemaker needed in ~10% post-TAVR [^985bf164] |
| Infective endocarditis | Rare but severe | High morbidity/mortality |
| Ischemic events (angina, MI) | Increased risk, especially perioperatively | Higher in severe AS [^682c4da1] |
| Perioperative complications | Major risk in noncardiac surgery | 10–30% if severe AS unrecognized [^682c4da1] |
| Sudden cardiac death | Significant risk in asymptomatic/severe AS | ~1% per year asymptomatic; rises with symptoms [^9b9b8de5] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Early intervention**: AVR (SAVR or TAVR) is the only definitive therapy and improves survival and symptoms [^130f8c9e] [^7ad6bd52].
- **Risk stratification**: Use symptoms, LV function, exercise testing, and biomarkers to guide timing [^4fbdf7c2] [^7579aab3].
- **Perioperative care**: Identify severe AS pre-op; consider preoperative AVR or bridge strategies for high-risk noncardiac surgery [^682c4da1] [^6de1a16f].

---

Severe aortic stenosis causes **heart failure, arrhythmias, ischemia, and sudden death**, with risk escalating once symptoms appear. Early AVR is essential to prevent these complications and improve outcomes [^130f8c9e].

### How should very severe aortic stenosis Be defined in asymptomatic individuals? [^9b9b8de5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is currently defined by an aortic valve area (AVA) < 1.0 cm² and/or a mean transaortic pressure gradient (MPG) > 40 mm Hg and/or a peak aortic jet velocity (V max) > 4 m/s. 1, 2

Symptoms represent the central element guiding the management of severe AS, and US and European guidelines 1, 2 both recommend aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with symptoms clearly related to the valvular obstacle (class I recommendation). The slowly progressive nature of AS combined with the advanced age of the affected population predispose to underreporting and/or underestimation of symptoms. About one third of patients with severe AS considered asymptomatic at diagnosis experience symptoms on exercise testing. Exercise testing should therefore be performed whenever possible to detect patients who are not "truly asymptomatic" and who should undergo AVR when the operative risk is acceptable. The estimated annualized rate of sudden death for asymptomatic patients with severe AS is 1% per year. AS is a lesion that evolves relentlessly, and progression is more rapid when the aortic valve is severely stenotic and calcified. The risk of conservative management must be weighed against the risk of operative mortality associated with AVR (1%–3% in patients < 70 years, and 3%–8% in older patients). In addition, patients with prosthetic valves may incur specific life‐threatening complications. It has also been suggested that some patients with severe asymptomatic AS are operated on at an advanced stage of the disease, when myocardial impairment is partially irreversible, resulting in a high risk of mortality and heart failure after successful AVR.

### Is aortic stenosis a preventable disease? [^f04dd9c3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease requiring valve replacement. Its prevalence increases with age. When the severity of AS is only mild to moderate, it is well tolerated. When it becomes severe, AS confers significant morbidity and mortality. Adverse events can be avoided if it is possible to prevent or retard the progression from mild or moderate AS to severe AS. Progression of AS parallels the progression of sclerotic changes involving the aortic valve, which share histological and immunochemical similarities with the process of atherosclerosis. Far from being just a degenerative process, the development of AS is a complex and highly regulated process with a number of modifiable factors. One of the key factors appears to be lipoproteins, which are intimately involved in several pathways crucial to the development of AS. The importance of lipoproteins is further supported by epidemiological and clinical studies showing a strong association between lipoproteins and AS. The time has come to initiate prospective studies to assess the effect of cholesterol lowering on the progression of AS.

### Aortic stenosis [^a5cfda49]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

In developed countries, aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of all valvular heart diseases. A manifestation of ageing, the disorder is becoming more frequent as the average age of the population increases. Symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal if left untreated yet is consistent with a typical lifespan when mechanical relief of the stenosis is provided in a timely fashion. Management of mild disease, severe asymptomatic disease, and far advanced disease, and the effect of new percutaneous treatments, provide both controversy and exciting promise to care of patients with aortic stenosis. We discuss these issues in this Review.

### Severe aortic stenosis patient risk during the COVID-19 pandemic [^16f4f8d7]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive aortic valve disease that can lead to heart failure, syncope and sudden death if not treated. Severe AS currently affects more than 2 million people over 65 years of age in the USA. The only treatment option for AS is valve replacement by either surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) or the less invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), also called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). AVR requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission, whereas TAVR can be performed in a non-ICU setting. Both procedures are commonly associated with complications, such as stroke. Bleeding and thrombosis are also potential complications of these procedures. Given the considerable morbidity and mortality, patients with these postoperative complications are admitted to the ICU for management.

SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has become a pandemic and has caused high mortality rates among the elderly. Currently, there is no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and there is no effective treatment to treat patients with severe COVID-19. More than 730 000 people worldwide and over 160 000 in the USA have died from COVID-19 as of 10 August 2020 according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center; these figures are expected to continue to rise until there are effective vaccines and therapies. Treating patients with COVID-19 during this pandemic requires many medical resources. Importantly, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failures, believed to be due to systemic and pulmonary thrombosis, are common symptoms of severe COVID-19 that require treatment in the ICU. Therefore, government officials have recommended ceasing almost all elective surgeries until the COVID-19 pandemic is under control. Although many patients with symptomatic AS can delay procedures intended to alleviate their symptoms, some may require life-saving procedures. In cases where life-saving procedures (AVR or TAVR) are required, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be an additional and very dangerous comorbidity. Therefore, I suggest that the following points should be considered:

### Excess mortality and undertreatment of women with severe aortic stenosis [^a8a330f0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease treated in developed countries, 1 and its prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. 2 Although the population burden of AS is similar in men and women and current guidelines do not distinguish between the sexes in regard to AS symptoms, cardiac repercussions, or management, 3, 4 there are increasingly recognized pathophysiological differences between men and women with AS. These involve the role of aortic valvular calcifications in relation to AS severity 5, 6 and the left ventricular (LV) response to AS hemodynamic burden. 7, 8 Conversely, the clinical differences between men and women with AS and their link to management and outcomes remain poorly defined.

Indeed, the mostly studied end point is clinical outcome after aortic valve replacement (AVR), surgical 9, 10 or transcatheter, 11, 12 reported alternatively as similar or different between the sexes although generally considered beneficial in both. 13 However, studies of the outcome after diagnosis have been more tenuous and contradictory. AS hemodynamic progression has been reported most generally similar in men and women 14, 15 but some studies are discordant and suggest a faster progression in women. 16 Conversely, very few data exist regarding clinical outcome after AS diagnosis. Studies in other valve diseases, although remaining quite limited, have suggested remarkable differences between the sexes. Among patients with mitral regurgitation, women tend to receive surgical treatment less frequently and later than men. 17, 18 In patients with AS, potential differences in cardiac surgery indications are undefined, but US national data compile many more cases of AVR in men than women 10 discrepantly from the AS prevalence. 1 Furthermore, potential differences between the sexes in survival after diagnosis have not been clearly analyzed in the major AS outcome studies. 19, 20, 21, 22 Prospective AS cohorts, 16, 19, 23 which enrolled mostly people with mild AS, were not geared toward routine clinical care and reported alternatively similar clinical progression 19, 23 or excess complications 16 in women and therefore did not resolve the issue of sex‐specific outcomes. Previous studies in aortic regurgitation emphasized the importance of accounting for differences between men and women 24, 25 in managing the disease, but in AS, although recent reviews attempt to attract attention toward sex differences, 26, 27 unavailability of sizable data specifically analyzing sex‐specific outcome after severe AS clinical diagnosis prevents evaluating potential gaps in clinical care and remedies.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis in people with low surgical risk [^985bf164]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open-heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow-up). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding.

Main Results

We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short-term outcomes: all-cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). TAVI may reduce the risk of short-term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicates that, in the short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long-term follow-up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population.

### Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis: a review of a disruptive technology in aortic valve surgery [^7ad6bd52]. JAMA Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Medically treated symptomatic severe aortic stenosis has poor outcomes, and in the past 6 decades, it has successfully been treated with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, one-third of patients with indications for SAVR are not offered surgery because of the high risk of complications. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), initially developed as a less invasive treatment for inoperable patients, has successfully been used in healthier patient cohorts. In 2017, TAVR became the most common approach for aortic valve replacement in the United States.

Observations

During the past decade, the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve (PARTNER) trials (for balloon-expandable valves) and the CoreValve trials (for self-expandable valves) investigated the performance of TAVR in progressively lower-risk patient cohorts. The initial trials demonstrated TAVR to be superior (PARTNER B) and noninferior (CoreValve Extreme Risk) to optimal medical therapy in inoperable patients. Subsequent trials showed both balloon-expandable and self-expandable valves to have good results in high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk surgical patients when compared with SAVR. However, owing to the fundamentally different nature of the procedure, some complications have been more prevalent with TAVR, most notably moderate or severe paravalvular leak, conduction abnormalities necessitating permanent pacemaker placement, and vascular complications. When present, these complications have been associated with worse outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of the groundbreaking TAVR trials from the past decade have led to a revolution in the treatment of aortic stenosis. There are now 3 US Food and Drug Administration-approved TAVR devices, and with the encouraging results from the latest low-risk trials, TAVR is likely going to become the dominant treatment for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. New devices on the horizon are looking to improve the complication rates of TAVR, and ongoing trials are looking to further expand the indications of TAVR and answer 1 of the main remaining questions, ie, long-term durability of percutaneously placed devices.

### Morbidity outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement [^543948fa]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common type of valvular heart disease and its prevalence is expected to double in the next two decades. There is no medical therapy to prevent the natural progression of the disease, but aortic valve replacement (AVR) improves survival and relieves symptoms. Left unoperated, patients who eventually become symptomatic face a dismal prognosis of up to 50% mortality over 2 years. American and European guidelinesrecommend AVR in case of severe, symptomatic AS, with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) being the standard approach for patients with a low to intermediate surgical risk. Multiple studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of SAVR on mortality, symptom relief and increased quality of life at subsequent follow-up. However, morbidity outcomes are less often reported. In modern medicine, individualised patient care calls for increased knowledge of outcomes so that patients can have realistic expectations following SAVR. The requirement for knowledge of morbidity outcomes and future physical performance in the process of shared decision-making is imminent. With this study, we aim to provide data on patient-relevant outcomes beyond what is known, in an effort to improve decision-making as a result. We report a broad set of morbidity outcomes and measures of physical performance in patients with severe AS referred for evaluation of AVR, reflecting modern-day clinical practice at a single tertiary centre.

### Timing of intervention in aortic stenosis: a review of current and future strategies [^4a11c1d8]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease requiring surgical intervention in high-income countries. It is characterised by progressive thickening, fibrosis and calcification of the leaflets leading to restriction and valve obstruction. The consequent increase in left ventricular afterload leads to a hypertrophic response of the left ventricle, normalising wall tension and maintaining cardiac output. However, with progressive valvular stenosis, this hypertrophic response eventually decompensates resulting in symptom development, heart failure and death.

With no medications proven to attenuate or reverse stenosis progression, the only available treatment is valve replacement. This should ideally be performed when the risks of the disease process (ie, sudden cardiac death, irreversible functional impairment and heart failure) outweigh those of intervention (ie, procedural risk, long-term complications and potential need for reoperation). However, we frequently lack robust evidence to make accurate assessments of such risk. Deciding on the timing of valvular intervention is therefore difficult in many patients, and contemporary clinical guidelines are often underpinned by historical observational data rather than high-quality randomised controlled trials. This article will review our current understanding of the pathophysiology of AS, describe and examine the evidence behind current guideline recommendations and explore potential future strategies to optimise the timing of valve intervention.

### Introduction to aortic stenosis [^65e72bcb]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is perhaps the most common of all valvular heart diseases in the developed nations of the world. Once primarily caused by rheumatic fever, the most common pathogenesis today is an active inflammatory process with some features that are similar to atherosclerosis. Because of this shift, the age at onset of severe obstruction has changed from the sixth decade 50 years ago to the eighth decade in most individuals today. The onset of symptoms remains a key determinant of outcome, although the later age at onset may make it difficult to discern if aortic stenosis or other age-related comorbidities is the cause of the symptoms. Once symptoms of aortic stenosis develop, life expectancy is shortened to ≈3 years unless the mechanical obstruction to left ventricular outflow is relieved by aortic valve replacement. Traditionally performed during cardiac surgery, aortic valve replacement now may be performed safely and effectively using transcatheter techniques, potentially revolutionizing the approach to this potentially fatal disease.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^e62a7097]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk of TAVR and shared decision-making — the final treatment decision should be individualized using clinical and imaging evaluation, risk category, patient goals and expectations, and futility considerations. If the evaluation indicates that AS is not severe or symptoms are not due to AS, it may be prudent to continue periodic monitoring of AS severity and symptoms, deferring intervention until guideline-based criteria are met. Alternatively, the Heart Valve Team evaluation may conclude that the SAVR is the best option if surgical risk is low, the durability of a mechanical or other tissue valve is preferable in a younger patient, or concurrent procedures such as aortic root replacement or coronary bypass grafting are needed. Even when severe symptomatic AS is present, TAVR is considered futile when the expected benefit from TAVR is less than the expected risk; in these patients, palliative care may be the best option in terms of both quality and length of life. In patients who meet guideline-based criteria for TAVR and whose evaluation indicates the benefit is greater than risk, discussion with the patient and family should again review the likelihood of symptom relief or improved survival, possible complications and the expected recovery process, and alignment of patient goals and expectations with possible procedural outcomes.

### Aortic stenosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^70b81c34]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of aortic stenosis increases with age, affecting up to 10% of the population by the eighth decade. Once symptoms develop, aortic stenosis is rapidly fatal. Proper management requires an understanding of the physiology and criteria used to define disease severity. There is no effective pharmacologic treatment. Surgical aortic valve replacement has been the gold standard treatment for decades. However, over the last 10 years transcatheter aortic valve replacement has emerged as an attractive, less-invasive option for appropriately selected patients. Refinements in valve design and delivery systems have led to widespread use of this breakthrough technology in selected patients. We review the pathophysiology, criteria for valve replacement, and the results of the trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with surgical aortic valve replacement.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high risk for surgical complications: summary assessment of the California technology assessment forum [^f44a7fcb]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The California Technology Assessment Forum is dedicated to assessment and public reporting of syntheses of available data on medical technologies. In this assessment, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was evaluated for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are at high risk for complications.

In this assessment, 5 criteria were used: Regulatory approval, sufficient scientific evidence to allow conclusions on effectiveness, evidence that the technology improves net health outcomes, evidence that the technology is as beneficial as established methods, and availability of the technology outside investigational settings. In this assessment, all 5 criteria were judged to have been met. The primary benefit of TAVR is the ability to treat AS in patients who would otherwise be ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. It may also be useful for patients at high surgical risk by potentially reducing periprocedural complications and avoiding the morbidity and recovery from undergoing heart surgery. Potential harms include the need for conversion to an open procedure, perioperative death, myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, valve embolization, aortic regurgitation, heart block that requires a permanent pacemaker, renal failure, pulmonary failure, and major vascular complications such as cardiac perforation or arterial dissection. Potential long-term harms include death, stroke, valve failure or clotting, and endocarditis. As highlighted at the February 2012 California Technology Assessment Forum meeting, the dispersion of this technology to new centers across the United States must proceed with careful thought given to training and proctoring multidisciplinary teams to become new centers of excellence.

Conclusions

TAVR is a potentially lifesaving procedure that may improve quality of life for patients at high risk for surgical AVR. However, attention needs to be paid to appropriate patient selection, their preoperative evaluation, surgical techniques, and postoperative care to preserve and improve on the results attained in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve trial. Specialty societies are collaborating to ensure that this happens in a rational and comprehensive manner.

### Impact of sex on the management and outcome of aortic stenosis patients: a female aortic valve stenosis paradox, and a call for personalized treatments? [^c7869bd2]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Graphical Abstract
Typical profile of a contemporary aortic stenosis patient with excess mortality.

Over the past decades, it has become clear that aortic stenosis (AS) represents a disease condition that differs in pathophysiology, presentation, and response to treatment between women and men. Even after accounting for body size, women need less valvular calcium than men to develop severe AS, entailing sex-specific thresholds for computed tomography-derived aortic valve calcification used to identify severe AS. Additionally, women with AS display more valvular fibrosis, denser connective tissue, and more concentric hypertrophy for a similar stenosis severity than men. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only treatment option for patients with symptomatic severe AS, but sex-specific data on outcomes remain inconclusive. At the present time, it appears that women display a higher operative and long-term mortality, longer post-operative stay, and a higher stroke rate, after surgical AVR (SAVR) potentially attributable to the more advanced stage of the disease at referral. In transcatheter AVR (TAVR) cohorts, women exhibit a higher incidence of vascular and bleeding complications with a trend towards a survival benefit over men after TAVR. These findings and data from a meta-analysissupport the notion that TAVR appears to be the preferred intervention over SAVR in women when AVR is required — a hypothesis that is currently being tested in the RHEIA trial (NCT04160130). In this multicentre all-comers trial, female patients with severe symptomatic AS eligible for both AVR strategies based on a Heart Team decision are randomized 1:1 to receive TAVR or SAVR. Taken together, the overall impact of sex on the course and outcomes of AS is still under investigation.

### Misconceptions and facts about aortic stenosis [^4568fe81]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease leading to intervention, and it is typically a disease of the elderly. Recent clinical advances have expanded the role of transcatheter aortic valve intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis, making aortic valve intervention feasible and effective even in patients at intermediate, high, and prohibitive surgical risk. With the rapid advances in treatment, proper diagnosis becomes crucial for a wide range of patients with aortic stenosis: from "concordant" high-gradient aortic stenosis to "discordant" low-gradient aortic stenosis. The latter group commonly presents a clinical challenge requiring thoughtful and comprehensive evaluation to determine eligibility for aortic valve intervention. Providers at all levels should be familiar with basic diagnostic caveats and misconceptions when evaluating patients with possible aortic stenosis.

Shared decision-making and Heart Valve Team — the management of patients with severe AS considered for TAVR is 'best achieved by a multidisciplinary, collaborative Heart Valve Team' including cardiologists with expertise in valvular heart disease, structural interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular nursing professionals. Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'. Initial assessment includes evaluation of AS symptoms, disease severity and comorbidities, and 'Echocardiographic measures of AS severity should be reviewed, disease severity confirmed, and additional imaging performed as indicated'.

### The association of aortic stenosis severity and symptom status with morbidity and mortality [^d6ef3b6a]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results shed light on the real-world outcomes for a broad population of patients with AS of varying severity, but, due to the variation in provider assessments of symptoms and many factors involved in clinical decision-making, do not necessarily indicate which populations or subpopulations would clearly benefit from AVR. Randomized trials have recently examined whether AVR improves outcomes for asymptomatic severe AS patients (EARLY TAVR [Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis;]), and are ongoing to assess whether AVR is beneficial for eligible moderate AS patients (PROGRESS [Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial to Assess the Management of Moderate Aortic Stenosis by Clinical Surveillance or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement;]). Though our study suggests significant morbidity and mortality in these patient populations, the findings from these ongoing trials will provide insight whether we can improve outcomes for these vulnerable patients.

### Urgent vs elective transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis [^8a169fd9]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common forms of valvular heart disease in developed countries, with a rising prevalence in the setting of an aging global population. It is characterized by progressive narrowing of the aortic valve, leading to chronic left ventricular (LV) pressure overload, adverse cardiac remodeling, and ultimately heart failure with a high risk of mortality. Once symptomatic, severe AS carries a poor prognosis, with untreated patients experiencing 2-year mortality rates exceeding 50%. Current guidelines recommend prompt intervention with aortic valve replacement, either surgically or via a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), in patients with severe symptomatic AS, as well as in selected asymptomatic individuals with reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

AS typically presents as a slowly progressive chronic disease, and the majority of aortic valve replacements are performed electively. However, a subset of patients present acutely with decompensated heart failure, critical valve stenosis, or cardiogenic shock, necessitating urgent intervention. Historically, these patients — often considered too unstable for surgery — were offered balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) as a bridge to definitive treatment. However, BAV has notable limitations, including a significant risk of procedural complications, high restenosis rates, exposure to multiple interventions, and poor long-term survival, leading to increasing scrutiny of its role in contemporary practice. With advancements in procedural safety and operator experience, TAVR has become a more viable alternative for urgent cases, with emerging evidence suggesting comparable immediate outcomes to BAV but with the advantage of providing a more definitive treatment.

Several studies have evaluated outcomes of patients undergoing urgent vs elective TAVR. However, most existing studies have been small, single-center investigations; lacked long-term follow-up; or were based on historical TAVR cohorts predominantly comprising high-surgical-risk patients, limiting their applicability to modern practice. Furthermore, no studies have specifically examined this issue in the Australian setting. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical characteristics, procedural risks, and outcomes of patients undergoing urgent TAVR in the contemporary era is essential to refine patient selection, optimize procedural strategies, and improve postprocedural care.

In this context, we conducted a retrospective study assessing outcomes of urgent vs elective TAVR in a contemporary Australian cohort with severe AS. Our aim was to evaluate in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes and to determine whether urgent TAVR is independently associated with increased mortality and adverse outcomes.

### Comorbidities and symptom status in moderate and severe aortic stenosis: a multicenter clinical cohort study [^adb43224]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent form of valvular heart disease, and is clinically silent in its earlier forms. By convention, symptoms are thought to only become apparent when the AS is severe enough to provoke ventricular decompensation. At this critical juncture, surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR), or in suitable patients, transcatheter AVR is recommended. However, recent evidence has shown that less severe forms of AS are also associated with high mortality. This creates a clinical conundrum as to the ideal management strategies for these individuals. Recent clinical trial data has supported consideration of AVR in critical asymptomatic AS, associated with a 2- to 3-fold lower cardiovascular mortality among patients who underwent early surgical intervention than those who received conservative care. The current evidence gap relating to valve intervention in various forms of moderate AS is currently the subject of ongoing clinical trials.

Despite conventional clinical wisdom, the true prevalence of symptoms in moderate AS is poorly understood. A recent publicationsuggested just under half of all patients with moderate AS were symptomatic. This included 17% of patients who were highly symptomatic (NYHA functional class III-IV). However, the results were not corrected for the presence of clinical comorbidities and their treatments. Symptoms observed in the setting of moderate and severe AS may be due to comorbidities typically found in those of similar age and with common risk factors. These include coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or hypertension and may result in spurious associations with AS. Further, any symptoms due to AS are likely to be associated with the degree of cardiac damage and its independent association with mortality, indicating late stage disease and a strong determinant of outcome after AVR.

Because of the potential importance of symptoms as a risk marker in AS, we studied a clinical cohort being routinely investigated for heart disease, to assess whether the pattern or association of symptoms typically ascribed to AS remained associated after adjusting for their demographic and clinical characteristics.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^9ee76361]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) benefit from aortic valve replacement (AVR). Management of severe AS in the absence of symptoms is, however, controversial and often challenging. Unselected premature AVR carries the risks of cardiac surgery; delayed AVR due to unrecognized symptoms can result in a dismal outcome. Echocardiography is the standard tool to evaluate and follow patients with AS. Nevertheless, most of the current echocardiographic parameters have limitations in predicting symptom onset and clinical outcome. The same applies to clinical parameters, exercise stress testing, and other imaging modalities used in AS evaluation and serial follow-up. Predictors of outcome could, however, help to identify asymptomatic patients who would benefit from expedited AVR with the goal to reduce mortality. This review will discuss the most relevant clinical studies and guidelines on management of asymptomatic severe AS, with an emphasis on providing concise information for identifying patients at high risk.

### Moderate aortic valve stenosis is associated with increased mortality rate and lifetime loss: systematic review and meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data of 409 680 patients [^32159d51]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent valvular heart disease, imposing a substantial burden on global public health. AS frequently coexists with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three decades ago, it was recognized that the pivotal aspect in managing patients with AS lies in the timely decision to refer for intervention.

Contemporary guidelines currently advocate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in those with severe symptomatic AS and, by extension, in those who are asymptomatic but experience reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 55% by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, class of recommendation IIa; and LVEF < 50% by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, class of recommendation I). The latter is owed to the adverse impact of elevated afterload on the already diseased left ventricle. On the contrary, in those with moderate AS, both guidelines advocate for a "watchful waiting approach" with frequent surveillance echocardiograms (yearly by European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery guidelines, and every 1–2 years by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines) to detect any disease progression. The rationale behind the contrasting recommendations concerning the timing of intervention in AS remains a matter of discussion. Recent large‐scale observational studies found the prognosis of patients with moderate AS may be more unfavorable than previously thought, particularly when concurrent systolic dysfunction is present. Moderate AS has been associated with an ≈2‐fold increased risk of all‐cause death, which increases to ≈3‐fold among those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Consequently, specific factors such as systolic dysfunction or coronary artery disease contribute to adverse outcomes, while the mortality risk solely attributable to isolated moderate AS remains incompletely characterized.

### Aortic stenosis: insights on pathogenesis and clinical implications [^5b199f10]. Journal of Geriatric Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on aortic stenosis:

- **Definition**: AS is a chronic fibrocalcific disease that results in narrowing of the aortic valve.
- **Pathophysiology**: AS is caused by the interplay of structural (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve), hereditary (e.g., genetic polymorphisms of lipoprotein A gene), and acquired (e.g., progressive age-related calcification, rheumatic valve disease) factors. Turbulent flow through a stenotic aortic valve causes endothelial damage, with subsequent subendothelial inflammation and accumulation of oxidized lipoproteins, and leads to deposition of calcium on the valve with progression of stenosis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AS in the US is estimated at 400 persons per 100,000 population. The incidence of AS-related admissions in the US is estimated at 9.5–26 cases per 100,000 patient-years.
- **Disease course**: AS results in obstruction to the ejection of blood the left ventricle, with resultant signs and symptoms of left-sided HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall survival of elderly patients with severe AS is 3 years from the onset of symptoms. In patients with severe, symptomatic AS who are at prohibitive risk for aortic valve replacement, the 1-year and 5-year mortality rates are 50% and > 90%, respectively.

### How should very severe aortic stenosis Be defined in asymptomatic individuals? [^a8db0d3e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Currently, asymptomatic patients with severe AS associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 50%) or undergoing other cardiac/ascending aortic surgery present a class I indication for AVR. 1, 2 However, this recommendation is rarely applicable, because overt LV dysfunction is uncommon in asymptomatic patients with severe AS (< 2% of patients). 3 AVR should be considered (class IIa recommendation) for asymptomatic patients with severe AS and abnormal blood pressure response on exercise stress testing, 1, 2 or for patients with severe valve calcification and rapid (peak velocity rate > 0.3 m/s per year) progression (class IIa recommendation in European guidelines, IIb recommendation in US guidelines). AVR is considered reasonable in asymptomatic patients with high V max presenting a low surgical risk (class IIa recommendation), 1, 2 although the V max cut‐off currently used remains controversial (≥ 5 m/s in US guidelines and > 5.5 m/s in European guidelines). Finally, the latest European guidelines add markedly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and severe pulmonary hypertension at rest (systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 60 mm Hg) as incentives for AVR in severe asymptomatic AS with low surgical risk. 2

### Rationale and design of the early valve replacement in severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis trial [^c93cceaf]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis is controversial. The Early valve replacement in severe ASYmptomatic Aortic Stenosis (EASY-AS) trial aims to determine whether early aortic valve replacement improves clinical outcomes, quality of life and cost-effectiveness compared to a guideline recommended strategy of 'watchful waiting'.

Methods

In a pragmatic international, open parallel group randomized controlled trial (NCT04204915), 2844 patients with severe aortic stenosis will be randomized 1:1 to either a strategy of early (surgical or transcatheter) aortic valve replacement or aortic valve replacement only if symptoms or impaired left ventricular function develop, or other cardiac surgery becomes nessessary. Exclusion criteria include other severe valvular disease, planned cardiac surgery, ejection fraction < 50%, previous aortic valve replacement or life expectancy < 2 years. The primary outcome is a composite of cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization. The primary analysis will be undertaken when 663 primary events have accrued, providing 90% power to detect a reduction in the primary endpoint from 27.7% to 21.6% (hazard ratio 0.75). Secondary endpoints include disability-free survival, days alive and out of hospital, major adverse cardiovascular events and quality of life.

Results

Recruitment commenced in March 2020 and is open in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Serbia. Feasibility requirements were met in July 2022, and the main phase opened in October 2022, with additional international centers in set-up.

Conclusions

The EASY-AS trial will establish whether a strategy of early aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis reduces cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization and improves other important outcomes.

What Are the Possible Reasons for Our Observations?

Several potential explanations can be explored. First, it is conceivable that individuals presenting with moderate AS may experience a higher rate of death while still in this stage of the disease due to an independent association between moderate AS and death.

Second, it is also plausible to suggest that a significant proportion of those initially classified as having moderate AS may have experienced progression of the disease to severe AS (following their last documented echocardiogram) with its ensuing higher mortality risk. We agree that some patients with moderate AS would develop severe AS during the follow‐up and would die after reaching the severe range if left untreated. However, waiting for patients to develop severe AS and then excluding them from the analyses might create a survival bias, since they must survive to reach the stage of severe AS before they could be excluded. Patients with moderate AS who would die still in the moderate range would not have had the opportunity to develop severe AS. By studying their last recorded echocardiogram, none of the patients had developed severe AS to the knowledge of the authors, although we cannot exclude the possibility some may have transitioned to severe without having had a repeat echocardiogram performed. Furthermore, when we analyzed early stages of the follow‐up at 1 and 5 years (Figure S5; when patients did not have time enough to transition to a state of severe AS), we found that the risk associated with moderate AS was already present for the overall population (at 1 year: HR, 2.25 [95% CI, 2.14–2.37]; P < 0.001; at 5 years: HR, 2.54 [95% CI, 2.45–2.63]; P < 0.001) and those with HFrEF (at 1 year: HR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.62–2.01]; P < 0.001; at 5 years: HR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.69–2.01]; P < 0.001).

### Pregnancy complicated by valvular heart disease: an update [^5356a56e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Specific Valve Lesions and Therapies

Treatment of a specific valvular lesion during pregnancy may be required in the presence of heart failure, arrhythmia, or hemodynamic deterioration, in order to prevent significant maternal or fetal morbidity or mortality. However, the optimal treatment pathway to improve maternal and fetal outcomes, whether medical or interventional, remains unclear. A brief review of the medical therapies used during pregnancy for heart failure symptoms can be found in Table 3. A more comprehensive review of medical therapies used in pregnancy is discussed in the most recent ESC guidelines on the management of cardiovascular disease during pregnancy. Often, recommendations are made with level of evidence C. Factors independently associated with maternal complications are the presence of left heart obstruction, mechanical valve replacement, and systemic or pulmonic atrioventricular valve regurgitation, among others.

Table 3.
Medical Management of Heart Failure in Pregnancy

Aortic stenosis

The most common etiology of aortic stenosis (AS) in women of childbearing age is a congenital bicuspid aortic valve, often with an associated aortopathy. If provided with a timely diagnosis and appropriate follow up, carefully chosen aortic stenosis patients can tolerate pregnancy well when the obstruction is of mild or moderate severity (aortic valve area > 1.0 cm²). Recent data suggests that the overall maternal mortality is < 1% even in patients with severe aortic stenosis –; however, the incidence of other complications for both mother and fetus rises dramatically with increasing severity of aortic stenosis. Nearly a third of mothers with aortic valve area < 1.5 cm² require hospitalization, while also experiencing an increased incidence of unfavorable outcomes for the fetus, including fetal growth restriction, respiratory distress, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Studies in this population of patients have had small sample sizes but estimates suggest that heart failure occurs in ≈7% to 17% of pregnant women with severe aortic stenosis, while arrhythmias occur in 3% to 33%. – This phenomenon highlights the need for preconception counseling, as well as careful monitoring and follow‐up in this particular subset of patients. Interestingly, some patients with severe AS can sustain a pregnancy well, particularly if they remain asymptomatic during exercise testing prior to pregnancy.

### The association of aortic stenosis severity and symptom status with morbidity and mortality [^93fcc36c]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent heart valve condition globally, and its prevalence is expected to rise significantly in the upcoming decades due to aging populations. Currently, there are no pharmaceutical treatments available for AS, and the primary management is through surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The widespread adoption of the minimally invasive TAVR procedure has broadened the pool of individuals with AS eligible for AVR by reducing the risk of treatment and has opened the possibility of extending treatment to patients with less severe disease based on grade and/or symptom status. Simultaneously, diagnosing AS has become more complex, with newly identified clinical phenotypes beyond high-gradient severe AS.,

Taken together, these advancements and recent work, have challenged the original AS paradigm born from the landmark studies of Braunwald and Ross, which suggested that mortality for asymptomatic AS patients was similar to the general population but declined precipitously once symptoms attributed to AS surfaced. Thus, treatment for AS has historically necessitated the presence of severe disease plus AS-related symptoms. Although recent work has demonstrated that mortality from untreated AS may be significant even at lower disease severity levels, the complex relationship between AS severity and symptoms attributed to AS has been less well studied. This includes a gap in understanding: 1) the prevalence of documented potential AS-related symptoms across the spectrum of AS severity; and 2) the association between symptom status with subsequent morbidity and mortality at different levels of AS severity. Understanding this relationship could help improve risk stratification of AS and support more personalized approaches to AS management.

Using a previously validated database of AS patientswithin a large, integrated health care delivery system, we examined the prevalence of documented potential AS-related symptoms surrounding the time of AS diagnosis and the association of symptoms with clinical outcomes including AS-related hospitalization and all-cause death.

### Management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the TAVI-era: how recent recommendations are translated into clinical practice [^55f5d33c]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present results illustrate that almost one-quarter of patients with symptomatic severe AS with guideline indications for AVR did not undergo valve replacement, despite the poor prognosis associated with a lack of intervention. In contrast, over one-third of asymptomatic patients were assigned to AVR, with very few specific characteristics associated with this choice. We conclude that there may be a considerable discrepancy between guideline-based recommendations and clinical practice decision-making in the treatment of AS. It appears as if guidelines may not fully capture the clinical spectrum of AS presentation and the individual patient need for an intervention or that unrequired AVRs may be being performed.

### Sex-associated disparities in surgical and percutaneous management of aortic stenosis with severe features: retrospective analysis from the national readmission database [^d615a350]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspectives

Aortic stenosis (AS) represents an increasing social and economic burden worldwide and poses a relevant future challenge for health care systems. Historically, female patients with severe AS have been more frequently rejected for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), mainly because of a greater risk of perioperative complications. The recent insurgence of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has allowed improved therapeutic delivery to a broader population, representing an important treatment paradigm shift.

Both European and US guidelines for the management of valvular heart diseases give a class Ia recommendation for intervention in adults with documented severe AS and symptoms of dyspnea, heart failure, angina, and syncope. Nevertheless, emerging evidence suggests continued disparities in the use of treatment strategies between male and female patients. Although much of the previous literature has focused on the imbalance in the prevalence of men and women treated with TAVR, it is not clear whether such differences are merely a reflection of sex‐related differences in the indication for aortic interventions or related to systematic disparities in referral for those with an indication for intervention. Different underlying mechanisms have been previously outlined to explain such management disparities. On one hand, advanced age at presentation, lower body surface area, and smaller vessels portend women at higher risk for procedural bleeding and vascular complications. On the other hand, several studies have highlighted the potential underreferral of female patients compared with male patients indicating potential sex‐related barriers to treatment provisiondespite proven favorable outcomes. Yet, the literature lacks robust contemporary data in this field to determine the existence of sex‐associated referral disparities in the real‐world population with severe symptomatic AS.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate a nationally representative population‐based sample for the presence of actual sex‐associated disparities in referral to AVR therapy, either surgical or transcatheter, in patients with AS hospitalized with guideline‐recommended indications to intervention.

Aortic stenosis (AS) diagnostic testing — exercise testing is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with severe AS (Stage C1) to assess physiological changes with exercise and to confirm the absence of symptoms (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). Exercise testing should not be performed in symptomatic patients with severe AS (Stage D1, aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg) because of the risk of severe hemodynamic compromise (COR 3: Harm, LOE B-NR). Reported safety data show low complication rates in asymptomatic patients; in a prospective survey of 20 medical centers in Sweden with 50000 exercise tests over 18 months, the complication rate was 1.8 per 10000 tests, morbidity 5.2 per 10000 tests, and mortality 0.4 per 10000 tests, with 12 of the 92 complications occurring in patients with AS.

### Calcific aortic stenosis: a disease of the valve and the myocardium [^2c58483c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Although aortic stenosis is a common condition associated with major morbidity, mortality, and health economic costs, there are currently no medical interventions capable of delaying or halting its progression. Re-evaluation of the underlying pathophysiology is therefore required so that novel therapeutic strategies can be developed. Aortic stenosis is characterized by progressive aortic valve narrowing and secondary left ventricular hypertrophy. Both processes are important because in combination they drive the development of symptoms and adverse events that characterize the latter stages of the disease. In this review, the authors examine the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis with respect to both the valve and the myocardium. In particular, the authors focus on the role of inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification in progressive valve narrowing and then examine the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, its subsequent decompensation, and the transition to heart failure. Finally the authors discuss potential therapeutic strategies on the basis of similarities aortic stenosis shares with other pathological conditions.

### Trends in transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement outcomes in patients with low-surgical risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^05b3cbc4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valvular heart disease, especially prevalent in the elderly population, and symptomatic severe AS is associated with a poor prognosis. Conventionally, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the gold standard for treating severe AS. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a less invasive alternative, initially indicated for patients with high surgical risk. Over time, TAVR has demonstrated promising short‐ to intermediate‐term outcomes in both efficacy and safety, prompting consideration of its use in a broader patient population, including those at lower surgical risk, defined by a Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality (STS‐PROM) score of < 4%.

The annual number of TAVR interventions surpassed SAVR in the United States in 2019 and rapidly expanded worldwide. This trend is likely to continue because of the aging population and the expanding role of the procedure to include intermediate‐ and low‐risk populations. Nevertheless, the use of TAVR in patients at low surgical risk has raised concerns because of their relatively younger age, greater life expectancy, and potential TAVR‐specific complications. A thorough understanding of temporal trends in complications following TAVR and SAVR is critical to guide individual treatment decisions for patients with severe AS. Currently, 7 clinical trials focusing on low‐surgical risk patients often used varied primary composite end points, with only 3 trials — Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION), Evolut low risk, and Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 3 (PARTNER 3) — having follow‐up durations of > 1 year. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis, integrating recent evidence from clinical trials targeting low surgical‐risk patients with severe AS to evaluate the trends in outcomes after TAVR compared with SAVR.

### Severe aortic stenosis and chronic kidney disease: outcomes and impact of aortic valve replacement [^42554c15]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with severe AS, the presence of moderate or severe CKD is associated with increased all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, decreased referral to AVR, and increased perioperative mortality. AVR is associated with a marked reduction in all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, regardless of the CKD stage, even among dialysis patients. Therefore, moderate and severe CKD should not discourage physicians from considering AVR.

### Aortic valve replacement versus conservative treatment in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: the AVATAR trial [^02b1c291]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The study AVATAR was published by Marko Banovic and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the AVATAR study, the trial question was: what is the role of early SAVR in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis? In the AVATAR study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the AVATAR study, the population was: 157 patients (67 female, 90 male). The inclusion criteria were asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. The key exclusion criteria were exertional dyspnea; syncope or presyncope; angina; LVEF < 50%; aortic regurgitation ≥ 3+; dilatation of the ascending aorta requiring replacement of aortic root or ascending aorta; significant mitral valve disease; previous cardiac surgery; life expectancy < 3 years. In the AVATAR study, the interventions were: n = 78 early SAVR (aortic valve replacement surgery within 8 weeks after randomization) n = 79 conservative management (conventional drug treatment and watchful waiting till symptom onset). In the AVATAR study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for HF (15.2% vs. 34.7%; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.9). In the AVATAR study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes (9.5% vs. 20.1%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.27) No significant difference in HF hospitalization (4% vs. 12.9%; HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.19) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.5% vs. 9.1%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.58). In the AVATAR study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse event. In the AVATAR study, the conclusion was: in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, early SAVR was superior to conservative management with respect to death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned hospitalization for HF.

### Optimal threshold of left ventricular ejection fraction for aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dae29fc8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common condition with an estimated prevalence of 12.4% across all ages and a prevalence of 3.4% for severe AS among those 75 years or older. 1 Although the presence of any degree of AS is associated with an increased risk of mortality, the risk of sudden cardiac death is considered relatively low until the onset of symptoms from severe AS. 2, 3 The treatment option for AS, aortic valve replacement (AVR), has inherent risks with both surgical and transcatheter approaches. Thus, the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines generally recommend that asymptomatic patients with high‐gradient severe AS be managed conservatively, reserving AVR for those patients who become symptomatic. 4, 5, 6 Nevertheless, both guidelines give a Class I recommendation for AVR in asymptomatic patients with severe AS when the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is < 50%. These recommendations primarily are based on clinical experience and expert opinion. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines cite only 2 observational studies, one showing acceptable surgical risk in patients with AS and severely reduced LVEF < 35% and the other suggesting that AVR was beneficial in patients with low‐flow, low‐gradient severe AS. 7, 8 although the recommendation applies to patients with high‐gradient severe AS. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines does not reference any specific studies evaluating AVR outcomes in patients with severe high‐gradient AS and a low LVEF.

### Impact of moderate aortic stenosis on long-term clinical outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4368c642]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical course of patients with moderate aortic stenosis (AS) remains incompletely defined.

Objectives

This study sought to analyze the clinical course of moderate AS and compare it with other stages of the disease.

Methods

Multiple electronic databases were searched to identify studies on adult moderate AS. Random-effects models were used to derive pooled estimates. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. The secondary endpoints were cardiac death, heart failure, sudden death, and aortic valve replacement.

Results

Among a total of 25 studies (12,143 moderate AS patients, 3.7 years of follow-up), pooled rates per 100 person-years were 9.0 (95% CI: 6.9 to 11.7) for all-cause death, 4.9 (95% CI: 3.1 to 7.5) for cardiac death, 3.9 (95% CI: 1.9 to 8.2) for heart failure, 1.1 (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.5) for sudden death, and 7.2 (95% CI: 4.3 to 12.2) for aortic valve replacement. Meta-regression analyses detected that diabetes (P = 0.019), coronary artery disease (P = 0.017), presence of symptoms (P < 0.001), and left ventricle (LV) dysfunction (P = 0.009) were associated with a significant impact on the overall estimate of all-cause death. All-cause mortality was higher in patients with reduced LV ejection fraction (< 50%) than with normal LV ejection fraction: 16.5 (95% CI: 5.2 to 52.3) and 4.2 (95% CI: 1.4 to 12.8) per 100 person-years, respectively. Compared with moderate AS, the incidence rate difference of all-cause mortality was -3.9 (95% CI: -6.7 to -1.1) for no or mild AS and +2.2 (95% CI: +0.8 to +3.5) for severe AS patients.

Conclusions

Moderate AS appears to be associated with a mortality risk higher than no or mild AS but lower than severe AS, which increases in specific population subsets. The impact of early intervention in moderate AS patients having high-risk features deserves further investigation.

### Impact of selected comorbidities on the presentation and management of aortic stenosis [^9c8eb58e]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent native valve disease worldwide, affecting approximately 3.4% of elderly individuals in Europe and the USA. Patients with severe AS who do not undergo timely aortic valve replacement (AVR) face an extremely poor prognosis; this is particularly true following symptom onset, at which point average survival is just 2–3 years. Consequently, rapid, effective management is paramount.

Current European guidelines recommend that AVR be performed in patients with AS that are symptomatic, experience symptoms/hypotension during exercise testing, and/or that have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%. However, despite the ever-growing availability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a minimally invasive alternative to surgical AVR (SAVR), studies suggest that up to 40% of patients with severe AS still do not receive either of these life-saving interventions. The reason for this appears to be multifactorial, though a high comorbidity burden has been suggested as a key driver. Furthermore, certain comorbidities may have clinical presentations resembling those of AS. To the best of our knowledge, no formal investigations into such effects have been carried out to date.

The aim of this analysis therefore was to assess the impact of comorbidities on disease presentation and management decisions in patients with severe AS.

### Managing patients with moderate aortic Stenosis [^fd5a92aa]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that clinical surveillance for patients with moderate aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) may be considered if there is an indication for coronary revascularization. Recent observational studies, however, have shown that moderate AS is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Whether the increased risk of adverse events is caused by associated comorbidities, or to the underlying moderate AS itself, is incompletely understood. Similarly, which patients with moderate AS need close follow-up or could potentially benefit from early AVR is also unknown. In this review, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the current published reports on moderate AS. They first provide an algorithm that helps to diagnose moderate AS correctly, especially when discordant grading is observed. Although the traditional focus of AS assessment has been on the valve, it is increasingly acknowledged that AS is not only a disease of the aortic valve but also of the ventricle. The authors therefore discuss how multimodality imaging can help to evaluate the left ventricular remodeling response and improve risk stratification in patients with moderate AS. Finally, they summarize current evidence on the management of moderate AS and highlight ongoing trials on AVR in moderate AS.

### Dysglycaemia and incident aortic stenosis: a cohort study [^1766330a]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of aortic stenosis is expected to increase with an ageing population, with previous studies showing a prevalence of 12.4% among individuals aged 75 years or above. Severe aortic stenosis has a poor prognosis, with a 5-year mortality of > 60%, with valve replacement as the only treatment. It is projected that by 2050 the number of patients in Europe with indication for valve replacement due to aortic stenosis will have more than doubled. Globally, rheumatic fever and endocarditis as causes of aortic stenosis remains high but is decreasing, whereas in high-income countries the main cause is degenerative and due to progressive stenosis through calcification. The pathophysiology of aortic stenosis is biphasic, with an initial stage of endothelial damage and lipid infiltration followed by calcification and partly self-sustaining inflammation.

Known risk factors for aortic stenosis include age, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, kidney diseaseand low socioeconomic status.

In addition, persons with established diabetes are at increased risk of aortic stenosis. However, risk factors for aortic stenosis are more prevalent among patients with diabetes, which may explain part of this observation. Whether elevated fasting glucose levels affects the risk of aortic stenosis remains uncertain.

Several cardiovascular complications of diabetes slowly progress over time, with initial onset several years before diabetes diagnosis. Whether this is also true for aortic stenosis is of interest, especially for guiding possible future preventive actions. The hypothesis of this study was that the risk for aortic stenosis may be present even at glucose levels below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): recent updates [^c6bd0b3f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Within the last two decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the management of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). Newer generations of transcatheter valve design, optimized imaging planning, growing operator experience, and technical refinements have driven enhancements in safety and reduction of procedural complications over time. These improvements have allowed expansion to lower risk patients, in which TAVR confirmed favorable outcomes compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Based on current evidence, the 2020 AHA/ACC guidelines provided updated recommendations on indications for TAVR, with several clinical indications remain with SAVR. As TAVR expands to younger, low-risk patients with longer life expectancies, different issues of utmost importance have emerged, such as long-term durability, bioprosthetic valve performance, coronary reaccess, prognostic impact of conduction disturbances and paravalvular leak, reintervention after TAVR, and optimal pharmacological management after the procedure. In this review, we provide an update of recent clinical guidelines and available data from clinical trials and registries, and highlight novel strategies to further reduce procedural complications.

### Association of guideline adherence for serial evaluations with survival and adverse clinical events in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^8b276d25]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

For patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function, current practice guidelines empirically recommend serial evaluations every 6 to 12 months. The benefit of this clinical monitoring is unknown.

Objective

To determine the association of guideline adherence with clinical outcomes in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study involved 300 patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis who were seen in the ambulatory Minneapolis Heart Institute at Abbott Northwestern Hospital. Rates of survival and adverse clinical events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization, were compared between patients who adhered to serial evaluation guidance and those who did not. Medical records were reviewed from July 25, 2007, to December 6, 2012. Data analysis took place from February 4, 2017, to July 10, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and major adverse clinical events during follow-up.

Results

The study population of 300 comprised 143 men (47.7%) and had a mean (SD) age of 78.6 (11.5) years. There were no differences in age, race/ethnicity, sex, comorbidities, insurance status, left ventricular function, and aortic stenosis severity between patients with (n = 202) and patients without (n = 98) guideline adherence. Aortic valve replacement (surgical or catheter based) was performed more frequently (54.0% vs 19.4%; P < .001) and the median (interquartile range) time for this performance was earlier (2.2 [1.2–3.6] years vs 3.5 [2.0–5.8] years; P < .001) in patients with guideline adherence. All-cause mortality was higher for nonadherent patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.07–2.30; P < .001), and these patients also had a higher rate of hospital admission for heart failure decompensation in follow-up (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27–2.18; P < .001). Four-year survival that is free from death and heart failure hospitalization was higher for adherent patients than for nonadherent patients (38.7% vs 23.3%; P < .001), and this difference remained significant in models adjusted for baseline variables (adjusted HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.04–2.29; P = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this study support the need for close monitoring of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and help to validate current guidelines for serial evaluations. These findings also support initiatives to improve guideline adherence in clinical practice.

### Patient-and process-related contributors to the underuse of aortic valve replacement and subsequent mortality in ambulatory patients with severe aortic stenosis [^cbe8d7c0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in the Western world and is the most frequent indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Current clinical practice guidelines recommend deferring AVR until symptom onset or overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Left untreated, 50% of patients with severe AS die within 1 to 2 years of symptom onset. Although potentially lifesaving, past studies have estimated that up to a third of patients with an indication for AVR do not undergo treatment; ultimately, these patients have a higher rate of hospitalization, are intensive users of health care resources, and cost the US Medicare program an estimated ≈$1.3 billion per year, all despite their limited long‐term survival.

Until recently, data on AVR use in patients with severe AS were primarily driven by surgical AVR (SAVR), because this was the sole treatment option for AS. With the advent of transcatheter AVR (TAVR), patients normally ineligible for SAVR because of high mortality risk, advanced age, or comorbid conditions can be eligible for a less‐invasive treatment option for AS with lower procedural morbidity and mortality. Because of this, TAVR was anticipated to improve adherence to guideline‐based use of AVR in patients with symptomatic severe AS. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that a substantial number of patients with symptomatic severe AS still do not undergo AVR.

The evaluation and management of patients with severe AS has become increasingly complex and heavily relies on provider referral upon detection of AS. The presence of discordant imaging measures of AS severity has been previously documented and is estimated to occur in up to 40% of patients with AS. Moreover, the rapid evolution of TAVR devices and procedural techniques mandates an intimate knowledge of the field to inform the difficult risk–benefit analysis that surrounds treatment decisions. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology practice guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease recommend that providers refer patients with severe valvular heart disease to a multidisciplinary heart valve team for further evaluation when intervention is being considered. However, recent data suggest that medically managed patients with an indication for AVR are not consistently referred to a multidisciplinary heart valve team or valve specialist for evaluation. Thus, factors beyond a patient's biology and more inherent to the patient referral process may affect AVR usage rates and, in turn, postprocedural outcomes in patients with severe AS.

### Imaging and impact of myocardial fibrosis in aortic stenosis [^7579aab3]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most common valvular diseases in the Western world, with an estimated prevalence as high as 12.4% in the elderly. Aortic stenosis is characterized not only by progressive valve obstruction, but also by the left ventricular remodeling response. Narrowing of the valve causes pressure overload of the left ventricle and triggers a hypertrophic response that maintains myocardial performance for many years, if not decades. However, with time, this process decompensates as patients transition from hypertrophy to heart failure, a change that is heralded clinically by the development of symptoms and adverse events, leading to consideration of aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Aortic stenosis progresses inexorably. Although the early stages are asymptomatic and associated with a good prognosis, advanced disease is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite much research, to date there are no proven medical therapies that slow disease progression. The only definitive treatment for severe aortic stenosis remains AVR, either by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) approaches. The uptake of TAVR has grown exponentially, as interventions that were initially offered only to elderly, inoperable patients are now being performed in younger, lower-risk patients with excellent results. Decisions about if, when, and how to intervene have therefore become increasingly complex, requiring careful assessment of individual patients within a multidisciplinary heart team.

Current guidelines recommend intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis and evidence of left ventricular decompensation. Most commonly this is in the form of development of typical symptoms, but other markers include a reduction in ejection fraction < 50%, an abnormal exercise tolerance test, or a rise in brain natriuretic peptide levels. Unfortunately, symptoms are often difficult to identify in the elderly comorbid patients encountered in clinical practice, and many of the other changes appear only late in the course of the disease after irreversible myocardial damage has become established. European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide a Class 1 recommendation, Level of Evidence: B, for intervention in the most common scenario — symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis. However, intervention in asymptomatic patients with a reduction in ejection fraction < 50% or an abnormal exercise test is only Level of Evidence: C (i.e. expert opinion). The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines are largely in alignment. This highlights the need for more robust data to better risk-stratify patients and optimize management strategies before the onset of symptoms and heart failure.

### Diagnosis and management of aortic valve stenosis in patients with heart failure [^a31c50b6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent degenerative valvular heart disease in Western countries and its prevalence increases in parallel with the ageing process of the population. Heart failure (HF), defined by the presence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, may be present in up to a quarter of patients with severe AS, posing diagnostic and management challenges. The present article reviews the prevalence of HF in severe AS patients, discusses the diagnostic challenges and the advances in multimodality imaging to identify the patients that may benefit from surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and summarizes the current evidence on management for this group of patients.

### Association between the malnutrition status and all-cause mortality in patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis: a Prospective cohort study [^c9f48e48]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) was the third most frequent cardiovascular disease after coronary artery disease and systemic arterial hypertension in developed country. Currently, aortic valve replacement (AVR) remains the only effective treatment for severe AS. Some patients have a poor prognosis even with AVR. Thus, more risk assessment and interventions for patients with AS are needed.

Recent evidence has shown a high prevalence of malnutrition in patients with AS and are associated with an increased risk of all‐cause mortality, readmission, and prolonged hospital stay after AVR. Previous studies have shown that malnutrition is an important adverse prognostic factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, and peripheral artery disease. Thus, aside from the well‐known risk factors, such as advanced age, multiple comorbidities, or cardiac‐related factors, malnutrition may be a modifiable prognostic intervention for patients with AS. In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on malnutrition in AVR surgical populations, and all of these studies have consistently demonstrated that malnutrition is independently associated with increased mortality, complications, readmission rates, and resource use. However, the prognostic value of malnutrition status in patients with moderate‐to‐severe AS was unclear.

### Rationale and design of a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter heart valve replacement in female patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis requiring aortic valve intervention (randomized researcH in womEn all comers wIth aortic stenosis [RHEIA] trial) [^a7a18a99]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data suggest that transcatheter (TAVR) as compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) may be more effective in female than male patients. To date, most evidence is derived from subgroup analyses of large trials, and a dedicated randomized trial evaluating whether there is a difference in outcomes between these interventions in women is warranted. The RHEIA trial will compare the safety and efficacy of TAVR with SAVR in women with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis requiring aortic valve intervention, irrespective of surgical risk.

Methods/Design

The RHEIA trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled study that will enroll up to 440 patients across 35 sites in Europe. Women with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, with any but prohibitive surgical risk status, will be randomized 1:1 to undergo aortic valve intervention with either transfemoral TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra device or SAVR and followed up for 1 year. The objective is to determine whether TAVR is non-inferior to SAVR in this patient population and, if this is fulfilled whether TAVR is actually superior to SAVR. The primary safety/efficacy endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality, all stroke, and re-hospitalization (for valve or procedure-related symptoms or worsening congestive heart failure) at 1 year post-procedure. Other outcomes (assessed at 30 days and/or 1 year) include all-cause mortality; bleeding, vascular, cardiac, cerebrovascular and renal complications; aortic valve prosthesis and left ventricular function; cognitive function, health status, and quality of life.

Discussion

The RHEIA study has been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAVR compared with SAVR specifically in women with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, irrespective of the level of surgical risk. The results will be the first to provide specific randomized evidence to guide treatment selection in female patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.

### Multiple biomarker panel to screen for severe aortic stenosis: results from the CASABLANCA study [^bc28df02]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in the Western world, present in > 20% of older adults. As the proportion of elderly Americans grows, so too will the prevalence and socioeconomic burden of AS. AS progresses via an indolent process with symptoms developing at a late stage of the disease. Once symptoms occur, AS portends a dismal prognosis unless the aortic valve is replaced; without aortic valve replacement (AVR), only half of patients will survive 1 year.

Current clinical practice guidelines recommend deferring AVR until AS severity reaches the severe stage and until onset of clinical symptoms or the occurrence of overt left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Classic teaching suggests that survival normalises after AVR; however, evidence is mounting that survival, symptom improvement and quality of life are diminished when valve replacement is performed late. With progressive valve narrowing, compensatory LV remodelling mechanisms fail and become maladaptive, in turn resulting in irreversible myocardial injury and fibrosis. For example, we have demonstrated that the absence of LV ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement within 1 month after transcatheter AVR is associated with a tripling of the risk of 1-year all-cause mortality and fivefold increase in 1-year cardiac death, and persistent LV hypertrophy is similarly associated with increased mortality. Myocardial fibrosis, a late sequela of AS, has also been associated with markedly increased risk of mortality, regardless of whether the stenotic aortic valve is replaced.

Early recognition of severe AS is important for maximising health and survival after valve replacement. While clinical history is important, symptoms caused by severe AS are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions or simply to advanced age, delaying appropriate diagnosis and therapy. Physical examination may be useful to identify AS and grade its severity, yet skills in such evaluation may be limited in clinical practice. Echocardiography is the gold-standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis and grading of AS severity, yet several inconsistencies with the echocardiographic assessment of AS exist that may hinder appropriate clinical management decisions. Echocardiography is also time-consuming, potentially costly and requires specialised interpretation.

Together, the aforementioned observations highlight the detrimental impact of delayed intervention for severe AS and highlight the need for clinical tools to assist in the rapid identification of severe AS. We therefore sought to develop a biomarker panel to identify patients with severe AS within the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) study. Such a blood-based biomarker panel may serve as a convenient and low-cost method of screening for severe AS.

### Expanding the indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^3803f5fa]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. Current guidelines recommend TAVI in patients at increased operative risk of death. Advanced imaging planning, new transcatheter valve platforms, procedure streamlining and growing operator experience have improved procedural safety and bioprosthetic valve performance. As a result, TAVI has been explored for other indications. Two randomized trials published in 2019 to assess TAVI in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at low operative risk have set the stage for a new wave of indications. In younger and low-risk patients, TAVI had an early safety benefit over surgical aortic valve replacement and was associated with faster discharge from hospital and recovery and fewer rehospitalizations. In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, TAVI has now been explored across the entire spectrum of operative risk, from inoperable to low-risk populations, in properly designed, randomized clinical trials, although data on the long-term durability of these valves are lacking. The use of TAVI in severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, moderate aortic stenosis in combination with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and isolated pure aortic regurgitation is now under investigation in clinical trials. In this Review, we provide our perspective on these evolving indications for TAVI, discuss relevant available data from clinical trials, and highlight procedural implications and caveats of new and future indications.

### Evaluation and management of aortic stenosis for the emergency clinician: an evidence-based review of the literature [^bfe9bb94]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is a common condition among older adults that can be associated with dangerous outcomes, due to both the disease itself and its influence on other conditions.

Objective

This review provides an evidence-based summary of the current emergency department (ED) evaluation and management of aortic stenosis.

Discussion

Aortic stenosis refers to significant narrowing of the aortic valve and can be caused by calcific disease, congenital causes, or rheumatic valvular disease. Symptoms of advanced disease include angina, dyspnea, and syncope. Patients with these symptoms have a much higher mortality rate than asymptomatic patients. Initial evaluation should include an electrocardiogram, complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, coagulation studies, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, type and screen, and a chest radiograph. Transthoracic echocardiogram is the test of choice, but point-of-care ultrasound has been found to have good accuracy when a formal echocardiogram is not feasible. Initial management should begin with restoring preload and ensuring a normal heart rate, as both bradycardia and tachycardia can lead to clinical decompensation. For patients with high blood pressure and heart failure symptoms, nitrate agents may be reasonable, but hypotension should be avoided. Dobutamine can increase inotropy. For hypotensive patients, vasopressors should be used at the lowest effective dose. The treatment of choice is valve replacement, but extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and percutaneous balloon dilatation of the aortic valve have been described as temporizing measures.

Conclusion

Aortic stenosis is an important condition that can lead to dangerous outcomes and requires prompt recognition and disease-specific management in the ED.

### Aortic stenosis: an underestimated risk factor for perioperative complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^78e6ad4f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the incidence of perioperative events in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Methods

We studied 108 patients with moderate (mean gradient, 25 to 49 mm Hg) or severe (mean gradient, ≥ 50 mm Hg) aortic stenosis and 216 controls who underwent noncardiac surgery between 1991 and 2000 at Erasmus Medical Center. Controls were selected based on calendar year and type of surgery. Details of clinical risk factors, type of surgery, and perioperative management were retrieved from medical records. The main outcome measure was the composite of perioperative mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Results

There was a significantly higher incidence of the composite endpoint in patients with aortic stenosis than in patients without aortic stenosis (14% [15/108] vs. 2% [4/216], P < 0.001). This rate of perioperative complications was also substantially higher in patients with severe aortic stenosis compared with patients with moderate aortic stenosis (31% [5/16] vs. 11% [10/92], P = 0.04). After adjusting for cardiac risk factors, aortic stenosis remained a strong predictor of the composite endpoint (odds ratio = 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 17.0).

Conclusion

Aortic stenosis is a risk factor for perioperative mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and the severity of aortic stenosis is highly predictive of these complications.

### Rationale and design of the aortic valve replAcemenT versus conservative treatment in asymptomatic seveRe aortic stenosis (AVATAR trial): a randomized multicenter controlled event-driven trial [^b935ca75]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic valve replacement (AVR) therapy is an obvious choice for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients as it improves symptoms, left ventricular function, and survival. The treatment decisions and indication for AVR in asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal left ventricular ejection fraction are less well established and the subject of ongoing debate. Many efforts have been made to define the best treatment option in asymptomatic AS patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Retrospective and observational data imply that elective AVR for asymptomatic severe AS may lead to improvement in outcomes in comparison to surgery performed after onset of symptoms. The AVATAR trial will aim to assess outcomes among asymptomatic AS patients randomized to either elective early AVR or medical management with vigilant follow-up. In the latter group, AVR would be delayed until either the onset of symptoms or changes in predefined echocardiographic parameters. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it will be the first large prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of elective AVR in this specific group of patients.

### Complications associated with nitrate use in patients presenting with acute pulmonary edema and concomitant moderate or severe aortic stenosis [^8e371da2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the incidence of complications associated with the use of nitrates in patients presenting with acute pulmonary edema and concomitant moderate or severe aortic stenosis compared with patients without aortic stenosis. Nitrates are contraindicated in severe aortic stenosis because of the theoretical yet unproven risk of precipitating profound hypotension.

Methods

A cohort design with retrospective chart review study was conducted at two Canadian hospitals. Patients with aortic stenosis (moderate or severe) and without aortic stenosis were included if they presented with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, received intravenous or sublingual nitroglycerin, and had an echocardiography report available. The primary outcome was clinically relevant hypotension, defined as hypotension leading to any of the following predefined events: nitroglycerin discontinuation, intravenous fluid bolus, vasopressor use, or cardiac arrest. The secondary outcome was sustained hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and lasting greater than or equal to 30 minutes.

Results

The cohort consisted of 195 episodes of acute pulmonary edema, representing 65 episodes with severe aortic stenosis (N = 65) and an equal number of matched episodes with moderate aortic stenosis (N = 65) and no aortic stenosis (N = 65). Nitroglycerin was administered intravenously only in 70% of cases, intravenously and sublingually in 25%, and sublingually only in the remaining 5%. After adjustment for sex, initial systolic blood pressure, furosemide dose, and use of noninvasive ventilation, moderate and severe aortic stenosis were not associated with clinically relevant hypotension after receipt of nitroglycerin (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 2.37 for moderate aortic stenosis; adjusted OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.41 for severe aortic stenosis). The incidence of clinically relevant hypotension was 26.2% for moderate and severe aortic stenosis and 23.1% in the no aortic stenosis reference group. The secondary outcome of sustained hypotension occurred in 29.2% of patients with severe aortic stenosis, 16.9% with moderate aortic stenosis, and 13.8% in the no aortic stenosis group (adjusted OR for severe aortic stenosis 2.34; 95% CI 0.91 to 6.01).

Conclusion

In this retrospective study, neither moderate nor severe aortic stenosis was associated with a greater risk of clinically relevant hypotension requiring intervention when nitroglycerin was used for acute pulmonary edema. Future studies should investigate safety and efficacy of nitroglycerin for patients with aortic stenosis because this study was limited by a small sample size and design limitations. Cautious use of nitroglycerin in patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis and presenting with acute pulmonary edema may be a safer strategy than traditionally thought.

### Quality of life after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement using the toronto aortic stenosis quality of life questionnaire [^ce391b46]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are often elderly with multiple comorbidities. The symptom burden from severe AS can disrupt their ability to participate in daily activities and adversely affect their quality of life (QoL). The primary aim of treating AS is to prolong survival while considering the effect of interventions on QoL when assessing the risks and benefits of treatment. Aortic valve (AV) replacement using either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) improves survival in patients with severe symptomatic AS, and evidence suggests these procedures also improve QoL.

The Toronto Aortic Stenosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (TASQ) is a validated QoL instrument for patients undergoing TAVR or SAVR. This questionnaire reflects AS-specific symptoms and how they affect a patient's physical and mental well-being, as well as evaluates patients' assessment of their general health. It is short, convenient to use and specific to patients with AS, providing an accurate picture of QoL in patients with severe AS, before and after treatment.

We performed a multinational prospective study to evaluate health status outcomes, based on the TASQ, in patients with severe symptomatic AS treated with either TAVR or SAVR. The study's principal results have been reported previously.TAVR and SAVR may be used in different patient populations and can be associated with different procedure-related complications, which may result in differences in health status. Therefore, separate analyses of patients who had TAVR and SAVR may provide additional relevant information on QoL outcomes in patients with AS undergoing different interventions. TASQ-based health status outcomes for study patients with severe AS are now reported separately for patients who underwent TAVR and SAVR.

Aortic stenosis (AS) risk categories for TAVR candidates — individual patient risk assessment combines the STS risk estimate, frailty, major organ system dysfunction, and procedure-specific impediments. The STS risk score predicts 30-day SAVR risk and serves as a starting point, with three STS strata: < 4% (low risk), 4% to 8% (intermediate risk), and > 8% (high risk). The AHA/ACC scheme classifies severe AS into 4 global risk categories: Low risk (STS < 4% with no frailty, no comorbidity, and no procedure-specific impediments), Intermediate risk (STS 4% to 8% with no more than mild frailty or 1 major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively, and minimal procedure-specific impediments), High risk (STS > 8%, or moderate-severe frailty, no more than 2 major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively, or a possible procedure-specific impediment), and Prohibitive risk (preoperative risk of mortality and morbidity > 50% at 1 year, ≥ 3 major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively, severe frailty, or severe procedure-specific impediments).

Major cardiovascular comorbidity — coronary angiography is indicated in all patients because coronary artery disease is common in patients undergoing TAVR (40% to 75%); concurrent coronary revascularization may be needed, particularly if multivessel or left main coronary disease is present, although it is unclear if 30-day mortality is influenced by revascularization status; until more definitive randomized data are available, the Heart Valve Team should decide whether to revascularize before TAVR on a case-by-case basis; in a post hoc analysis of the PARTNER 2A trial, revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft in addition to TAVR did not increase the risk of death or disabling stroke at 2-year follow-up compared with TAVR or SAVR alone; other conditions that might increase procedural risk or limit benefit include LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension, and low flow — defined as stroke volume index less than 35 mL/m² — may also be associated with poor outcomes post-TAVR regardless of EF.

### Rationale and design of the randomized, controlled early valve replacement guided by biomarkers of left ventricular decompensation in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (EVOLVED) trial [^2be535b4]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal timing of aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis is uncertain. Replacement fibrosis, as assessed by midwall (nonischemic) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, is an irreversible marker of left ventricular decompensation in aortic stenosis. Once established, it progresses rapidly and is associated with poor long-term prognosis in a dose-dependent manner.

Trial Design

The objective of this multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial is to determine whether early aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis can improve the adverse prognosis associated with midwall LGE. Patients will be screened for likelihood of having LGE with electrocardiography or high-sensitivity troponin I. Those at high risk will proceed to CMR imaging. Approximately 400 patients with midwall LGE will be randomized 1:1 to early valve replacement or routine care. Those who do not exhibit midwall LGE will continue with routine care and be randomized to a study registry or no further follow-up. Follow-up will be annual for approximately 3 years until the number of required outcome events is achieved. The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality and unplanned aortic stenosis-related hospitalization. The expected event rate is 25.0% in the routine care arm and 13.4% in the early intervention arm over the first 2 years; 88 observed primary outcome events will give 90% power at 5% significance level. Key secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death, stroke, and symptomatic status.

Conclusion

The EVOLVED trial is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare early aortic valve replacement to routine care in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and midwall LGE.

### Contemporary issues in severe aortic stenosis: review of current and future strategies from the contemporary outcomes after surgery and medical treatment in patients with severe aortic stenosis registry [^bc35cae0]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Contemporary Outcomes after Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis (CURRENT AS) registry was a large Japanese multicentre retrospective registry of consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) before introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. We sought to overview the data from the CURRENT AS registry to discuss the three major contemporary issues related to clinical practice in patients with severe AS: (1) under-referral/underuse of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in symptomatic patients with severe AS, (2) management of asymptomatic patients with severe AS and (3) management of patients with low-gradient severe aortic stenosis (LG-AS). First, despite the dismal prognosis of symptomatic patients with severe AS, SAVR, including those performed during follow-up, was reported to be underused. In the CURRENT AS registry, overall 53% of symptomatic patients underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) during follow-up. Second, we reported that compared with conservative strategy, initial AVR strategy was associated with lower risk of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalisation in asymptomatic patients with severe AS. Although current recommendations for AVR are mainly dependent on the patient symptoms, some patients may not complain of any symptom because of their sedentary lifestyle. We also reported several important objective factors associated with worse clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients with severe AS for risk stratification. Finally, initial AVR strategy was associated with better long-term clinical outcomes than conservative strategy in both patients with high-gradient AS and patients with LG-AS. The favourable effect of initial AVR strategy was also seen in patients with LG-AS with left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥ 50%.

### Reasons for nonadherence to guidelines for aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis and potential solutions [^0c4325c9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The official guidelines for the treatment of patients with valvular heart disease have given a class I indication for aortic valve replacement in patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS). However, many patients with symptomatic, severe AS do not undergo AVR. We sought to determine the proportion and characteristics of patients with severe AS who do not undergo AVR in a university hospital and to identify the reasons for the lack of surgical referrals, despite the class I guideline indications. We retrospectively studied consecutive patients from an academic hospital with severe AS, as determined by echocardiographic criteria. The records were reviewed for clinical presentation, co-morbidities, surgical intervention, and outcomes. Of the 106 patients with severe AS, 33 (31%) had undergone AVR and 73 (69%) had not. Of those patients without AVR, 31 (42%) were symptomatic. The most common reason the patients with symptomatic, severe AS did not undergo AVR was their symptoms were thought to be unrelated to AS. Of the 42 patients (58%) who were deemed asymptomatic, only 4% had undergone exercise stress testing. With an average follow-up of 15 months, 15 (14%) of the 73 patients who did not undergo AVR died. In patients with severe AS, physicians commonly underrecognize symptoms and overestimate the operative risk. The exercise stress tests were underused in determining which patients with severe AS were symptomatic. As a result, many patients with a class I indication for AVR, who would benefit from this life-saving intervention, do not receive it.

High risk is STS-PROM > 8% or moderate-severe frailty or ≥ 2 major organ system compromises not to be improved postoperatively or a possible procedure-specific impediment. Prohibitive risk includes PROMM > 50% at 1 year or ≥ 3 major organ system compromises not to be improved postoperatively or severe frailty or severe procedure-specific impediments.

### Aortic stenosis: complications in noncardiac surgery… [^a59fa5f6]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis, one of the most common valvular heart diseases in patients 65 years and older, occurs in approximately 2 to 9 percent of persons in this age group and may be a risk factor for perioperative cardiac complications in noncardiac surgery. Results from recent studies have been inconsistent as to whether aortic stenosis increases perioperative cardiac complications after surgery. In one recent study, increased peak aortic gradients were found to be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. Kertai and associates evaluated perioperative mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction over time in patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis who were undergoing noncardiac surgery. The study was a retrospective examination of charts from patients who underwent noncardiac surgery between January 1991 and December 2000 at one medical center.

All patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis were included in the study. Patients without aortic stenosis undergoing noncardiac surgery during the study period were selected as control patients. Mortality and nonfatal MIs were recorded if they occurred before discharge from the hospital or within 30 days after the procedure. Data collected included clinical risk factors, type of surgery, and perioperative management. There were 108 patients who met the criteria for moderate or severe aortic stenosis during the period. These patients were compared with 216 control patients. Patients with aortic stenosis were significantly more likely than control patients to die or have an acute MI during the perioperative period. Patients with severe aortic stenosis also were more likely than patients with moderate stenosis to die or have an acute MI.

After adjusting for cardiac risk factors, aortic stenosis remained a strong predictor for perioperative acute MI or death. The authors conclude that aortic stenosis is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction and mortality during the perioperative period of noncardiac surgery. In addition, the more severe the aortic stenosis, the more predictive of complications it is. These findings must be considered when assessing patients before noncardiac surgery.

Aortic stenosis — supportive evidence for intervention and natural history: In symptomatic patients with severe high-gradient AS (Stage D1), ample evidence demonstrates the beneficial effects of AVR on survival, symptoms, and LV systolic function, and surgical series demonstrate improved symptoms and exercise tolerance after AVR. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal LV systolic function, survival is similar to age-matched controls, with a low risk of sudden death (< 1% per year) when prospectively followed and when symptoms are promptly reported; however, in patients with a low LVEF and severe AS, survival is better after AVR than with medical therapy, and LV function improves after AVR when depressed LVEF is due to excessive afterload.

Aortic stenosis (AS) remains one of the most common valvular heart diseases, with enormous impact on patient survival. Over the past years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a reality worldwide, offering a less invasive method to treat AS. Apart from the classical indications for aortic valve disease, recent studies tried to address unanswered questions for TAVI - asymptomatic severe AS, bicuspid aortic valves and moderate AS in patients with heart failure. This review discusses the rationale of those possible indications, pitfalls and current evidence in the medical literature.

Aortic stenosis (AS) and other lesion-specific considerations before noncardiac surgery — Noncardiac surgery patients with symptomatic severe AS have the highest risk of cardiac complications; the estimated rate of cardiac complications in patients with undiagnosed severe AS undergoing noncardiac surgery is 10% to 30%. AVR (SAVR, TAVI) performed before elective elevated-risk noncardiac surgery in symptomatic patients with severe AS will prevent hemodynamic instability during, as well as after, noncardiac surgery. In AS patients who are undergoing noncardiac surgery, there is lack of data on the efficacy or safety of TAVI, but TAVI is a reasonable option to avoid delay of semi-urgent noncardiac surgery. In hemodynamically unstable patients at high to prohibitive surgical risk for AVR, balloon aortic valvuloplasty as a bridging strategy may be an option. Symptomatic patients with rheumatic MS or patients with pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 50 mm Hg benefit from valvular intervention before elective noncardiac surgery according to recommendations for rheumatic MS. Left-sided regurgitant lesions also convey increased cardiac risk during noncardiac surgery, and in patients with MR and AR who are undergoing elective elevated-risk (ie, intermediate- or high-risk) noncardiac surgery and who meet standard indications for intervention, mitral or aortic valve surgery (repair or replacement) optimally should be performed before noncardiac surgery.

### Management of aortic stenosis and chronic heart failure: a clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) and the European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) of the ESC [^8ef5e603]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is common and can cause heart failure (HF) or contribute to the progression of pre-existing HF. The management of patients with concomitant AS and HF poses specific clinical challenges. Optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy for HF may be difficult in patients with AS, especially in case of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the evidence-based treatment of choice for patients with severe AS and HF. However, advanced cardiac damage, concomitant conditions that can cause HF in addition to AS, as well as some procedure-related factors, may contribute to persistence or worsening of HF after AVR. A multidisciplinary management involving an HF specialist is crucial in this setting and should include a dedicated pre-procedural HF and AS assessment, as well as a careful post-procedural follow-up, including monitoring of HF status. The aim of this clinical consensus statement is to summarize current knowledge on AS and HF, with a focus on pre-procedural and post-procedural management of patients with HF undergoing AVR.

Aortic stenosis — Routine follow-up of asymptomatic disease and progression rates: When severe AS is present (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s), the rate of progression to symptoms is high, with an event-free survival rate of only 30% to 50% at 2 years. With moderate AS (aortic velocity 3.0–3.9 m/s), the average annual rate of progression is an increase in velocity of 0.3 m/s, increase in mean pressure gradient of 7 mm Hg, and decrease in valve area of 0.1 cm². In patients with aortic sclerosis, defined as focal areas of valve calcification and leaflet thickening with an aortic velocity < 2.0 m/s, progression to severe AS occurs in about 10% of patients within 5 years.

### Atrial fibrillation is associated with mortality in intermediate surgical risk patients with severe aortic stenosis: analyses from the PARTNER 2A and PARTNER S3i trials [^c33b8ad9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Four major conclusions from this analysis add to our understanding of the impact of AF on clinical outcomes following aortic valve intervention in patients with severe AS at intermediate surgical risk. First, those patients in AF at the discharge time point, including patients with SR/AF, experienced worse outcomes after undergoing either TAVR or SAVR. In particular, 1‐ and 2‐year all‐cause mortality, as well as rehospitalization rates, were increased in patients with TAVR and SAVR with AF. Second, the development of AF at discharge occurred more frequently in patients with SAVR than in patients with TAVR, though at a lower than expected rate based on prior literature. Nevertheless, the impact on 2‐year mortality of AF at discharge for patients with baseline SR is higher for patients with TAVR versus SAVR (HR, 2.73 post‐TAVR versus 1.93 post‐SAVR), possibly owing to the more transient course of AF after SAVR. Third, advanced heart failure symptoms were more common in patients with AF at discharge, though only the specific subgroup of patients with TAVR with AF/AF were more likely than patients with SR/SR to have advanced heart failure symptoms at long‐term follow‐up. Fourth, bleeding complications were increased in patients with TAVR but not SAVR discharged in AF, and in particular in patients with SR/AF, a high percentage of whom were treated with DAPT therapy as well as anticoagulation.

### Predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with moderate aortic stenosis: implications for aortic valve replacement [^fec7938d]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the prognosis and management of severe aortic stenosis has been extensively studied, the risk stratification and outcomes of patients with moderate aortic stenosis remain elusive.

Methods

This study included 674 patients from the Cleveland Clinic Health System with moderate aortic stenosis (aortic valve area, 1–1.5 cm²; mean gradient, 20–40 mmHg; and peak velocity < 4 m/s) and an NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) level within 3 months of index diagnosis. The primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as the composite outcome of progression to severe aortic stenosis requiring aortic valve replacement, heart failure hospitalization, or death) was extracted from the electronic medical record.

Results

The mean age was 75.3 ± 12 years, and 57% were men. During a median follow-up of 316 days, the composite end point occurred in 305 patients. There were 132 (19.6%) deaths, 144 (21.4%) heart failure hospitalizations, and 114 (16.9%) patients underwent aortic valve replacement. Elevated NT-proBNP (1.41 [95% CI, 1.01–1.95]; P = 0.048), diabetes (1.46 [95% CI, 1.08–1.96]; P = 0.01), elevated averaged mitral valve E/e' ratio (hazard ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.18–2.10]; P < 0.01), and presence atrial fibrillation at the time of index echocardiogram (hazard ratio, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.15–2.91]; P = 0.01) were each independently associated with an increased hazard for the composite outcome and when taken collectively, each of these factors incrementally increased risk.

Conclusions

These results further elucidate the relatively poor short-medium term outcomes and risk stratification of patients with moderate aortic stenosis, supporting randomized trials assessing the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in this population.

### Prevalence, mechanisms, and prognostic impact of effort intolerance in patients with asymptomatic / minimally symptomatic aortic stenosis [^19f1df67]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Valvular disease is increasing with the aging population. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a serious condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the standard AS treatment; however, less invasive transcatheter AVR has become more widespread, reducing procedural risks and increasing treatment options for older adult patients. AVR has traditionally been considered only in hemodynamically severe diseases with clinical symptoms. Specifically, it is included in current guidelines as a Class I recommendation for patients with symptomatic severe AS and asymptomatic severe AS with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% or other indications for open heart surgery. However, asymptomatic severe and even moderate AS in symptomatic patients has growing evidence of adverse clinical consequences. Moreover, the timing and indications for surgical intervention in asymptomatic patients remain debatable. Although guidelines prioritize symptom presence or absence when considering AVR indications, we often encounter patients with poor symptoms in practice. Exercise testing is recommended for assessing symptoms and hemodynamics in patients with AS in class I and class IIa in the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for valvular disease. However, implementation rates are low. Moreover, effort intolerance was associated with long‐term mortality in patients with asymptomatic severe AS and preserved LVEF. It is, therefore, important to assess accurate effort intolerance. Recently, the concept of cardiac damage, where AS cardiac load adversely affects the left ventricle, left atrium, pulmonary circulation, and right ventricle in a retrograde manner, has been proposed, raising concerns about its effect on irreversible extra‐aortic cardiac injury. In addition to AS, there are reports on the need for exercise tolerance and its mechanisms in, for example, poorly symptomatic organic mitral regurgitation.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic impact of effort intolerance in patients with minimally symptomatic moderate or asymptomatic severe AS, using exercise‐stress echocardiography with cardiopulmonary exercise test (ESE‐CPET) and to study the factors associated with effort intolerance in patients with AS.

### Aortic valve disease, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and the Heart Failure patient: a state-of-the-art review [^0ae74875]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Concomitant aortic stenosis (AS) in heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Current guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement in patients with severe symptomatic AS and asymptomatic AS with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% and during other cardiac surgeries. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has now allowed for the treatment of severe AS in previously inoperable or high-surgical-risk patients. Leveraging multimodality imaging techniques is increasingly recognized for reinforcing the rationale for intervening early, thus mitigating the risk of ongoing progression to advanced HF. There are increasing data in favor of TAVR in diverse clinical scenarios, particularly asymptomatic AS and moderate AS. Limited information is, however, available regarding the advantages of HF medical therapy before and after intervention. This review aims to comprehensively examine the phenotypes of AS in the context of HF progression, while exploring the evolving role of TAVR in specific populations.

Integrated benefit–risk and decision-making pathways — guided actions for aortic valve replacement (AVR) selection are organized as: No current indication for AVR lists periodic monitoring of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and symptoms and re-evaluation when AS is severe or symptoms occur. When AVR is indicated but surgical AVR (SAVR) is preferred over TAVR, the document states 'SAVR recommended in lower-risk patients', notes valve durability considerations in younger patients, and that a concurrent surgical procedure may be needed. For a TAVR candidate with expected benefit > risk, actions include discussion with patient and family and proceeding with TAVR imaging evaluation and procedure. For severe symptomatic AS but benefit < risk (futility), thresholds include life expectancy < 1 year and chance of survival with benefit at 2 years < 25%, with actions including discussion with patient and family, palliative care inputs, and palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty in selected patients.

Regarding surgical interventions for aortic stenosis, more specifically with respect to aortic valve replacement, indications, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to perform aortic valve replacement in adult patients with severe high-gradient AS (stage D1) and symptoms of exertional dyspnea, HF, angina, syncope, or presyncope by history or on exercise testing.

Furthermore, studies focusing on US and Australian clinical cohorts revealed a distinct dichotomy in the adjusted risk of death, with mild AS having a risk similar to that observed in patients without AS, and moderate and severe AS having a profile with higher risk. A previously published meta‐analysis verified this risk signal and demonstrated an incidence rate of ≈9 events per 100 person‐years, and an ≈1.7‐fold increased incidence rate ratio in those with moderate AS. Given the publication of more recent large‐scale studies and the potential to now accommodate censored observations, we sought to perform an updated systematic review with meta‐analysis based on reconstructed time‐to‐event data comparing outcomes of patients with moderate AS with patients with no/mild AS. We further explored the association in the subgroup of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Radiation-induced heart disease — echocardiographic grading considerations specify that mitral stenosis is graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on mitral valve area, diastolic Doppler gradient, and pulmonary hypertension, with planimetry potentially infeasible in severe calcification and diastolic dysfunction causing overestimation by pressure half time. Aortic stenosis is graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on aortic valve area, mean Doppler gradient, and peak systolic velocity, and when left ventricular ejection fraction is reduced, dobutamine stress echocardiography can help differentiate pseudo-severe from fixed severe aortic stenosis. Mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation is graded as mild, moderate, or severe using combined quantitative and qualitative parameters, the calculation of regurgitant volume and effective regurgitant orifice area should be attempted on all patients, and grading of right-sided valve disease should also follow the guidelines on the assessment of valvular regurgitation and stenosis.

Aortic stenosis — percutaneous aortic balloon dilation has limited durability and potential complications. The postdilation valve area rarely exceeds 1.0 cm², and serious acute complications, including acute severe AR, restenosis, and clinical deterioration, occur within 6 to 12 months in most patients. In patients with AS, percutaneous aortic balloon dilation is not a substitute for AVR, though it can serve as a temporary "bridge" to TAVI or SAVR for some symptomatic patients. This approach is used less frequently given the availability and success of immediate TAVI even in very high‑risk patients.

### Impact of cancer in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a single-center study [^facdcc39]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

TAVR, when indicated, can be safely performed in patients with severe aortic stenosis and cancer, with similar periprocedural complications in patients with or without cancer. Furthermore, cancer patients have similar short-term survival, but reduced long-term survival in the AC group compared with SC and controls. This study brings increased evidence to inform decision making in patients with cancer and severe aortic stenosis. Future studies are needed to identify cancer-specific variables that are important to consider as prognostic factors in patients with cancer being evaluated for TAVR and to develop algorithms to inform the management of this growing population.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: TAVR appears to be safe in patients with severe aortic stenosis and active cancer, with similar periprocedural complications and 30-day survival as stable cancer patients and in control patients without cancer. Patients with active cancer had reduced long-term survival rates compared with stable cancer and control patients.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies are needed to identify cancer-specific variables that are important to consider as prognostic factors in patients with cancer being evaluated for TAVR and to develop algorithms to inform the management of this growing population.

### Management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the TAVI-era: how recent recommendations are translated into clinical practice [^7f2d192f]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Approximately 3.4% of adults aged > 75 years suffer from aortic stenosis (AS). Guideline indications for aortic valve replacement (AVR) distinguish between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic severe AS. The present analysis aims to assess contemporary practice in the treatment of severe AS across Europe and identify characteristics associated with treatment decisions, namely denial of AVR in symptomatic patients and assignment of asymptomatic patients to AVR.

Methods

Participants of the prospective, multinational IMPULSE database of patients with severe AS were grouped according to AS symptoms, and stratified into subgroups based on assignment to/denial of AVR.

Results

Of 1608 symptomatic patients, 23.8% did not undergo AVR and underwent medical treatment. Denial was independently associated with multiple factors, including severe frailty (p = 0.024); mitral (p = 0.002) or tricuspid (p = 0.004) regurgitation grade III/IV, and the presence of renal impairment (p = 0.017). Of 392 asymptomatic patients, 86.5% had no prespecified indication for AVR. Regardless, 36.3% were assigned to valve replacement. Those with an indexed aortic valve area (AVA; p = 0.045) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; p < 0.001) below the study median; or with a left ventricular end systolic diameter above the study median (p = 0.007) were more likely to be assigned to AVR.

Conclusions

There may be considerable discrepancies between guideline-based recommendations and clinical practice decision-making in the treatment of AS. It appears that guidelines may not fully capture the complete clinical spectrum of patients with AS. Thus, there is a need to find ways to increase their acceptance and the rate of adoption.

### Optimal threshold of left ventricular ejection fraction for aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^205f1b0a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines were followed for this review. This review was registered at(registration number: reviewregistry1005) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses checklist is provided in Table S1.

Criteria for Considering Studies for This Review

Published observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. We included studies on adults (18 years of age or older) of both sexes with asymptomatic severe AS. Severe AS was defined according to both American and European guidelines (peak aortic velocity ≥ 4 m/s and/or mean aortic valve gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg and/or calculated aortic valve area < 1.0 cm² or an indexed valve area < 0.6 cm²). 4, 6 Asymptomatic status was defined per individual studies' definitions and exercise testing was not required to confirm asymptomatic status. Studies that included patients with asymptomatic very severe AS (typically defined as aortic valve area < 0.75 cm² and peak velocity > 4.5 m/s or mean gradient > 50 mm Hg) were included and the difference in effect size between severe and very severe AS was analyzed as described later.

We included studies that compared either surgical or transcatheter AVR with conservative management. We preferentially included studies that compared an early AVR strategy (typically defined as within 3 months of diagnosis) versus a watchful waiting strategy (AVR upon development of symptoms). We also included studies that compared AVR at any time versus no AVR. Given the substantial difference in study design between these 2 types of comparisons, the pooled effect size was separately calculated and represented in the forest plot for our main meta‐analysis.

The primary outcome analyzed all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, sudden cardiac death, and HF. Included studies were required to report the primary outcome but not the secondary outcomes.

Severe aortic stenosis can pose a serious hazard for noncardiac surgery as patients with this condition have a high risk for developing perioperative cardiac complications. We describe the anesthetic management of a patient with a malignant brain tumor who was found to have severe aortic stenosis during preanesthetic evaluation. She underwent palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty prior to surgery, and this combined with appropriate monitoring and drug therapy resulted in a satisfactory outcome. Adverse intraoperative events like hypotension and left ventricular failure occurred; however, these events were transient and responded to treatment.

Significant AS: definition of severe AS in the TAVR era

This study showed the potential advantage of earlier intervention for symptomatic patients with AS classified as less than severe. However, moderate AS includes a wide range of valve haemodynamics. In fact, the patients evaluated in this study had borderline severe AS (so-called moderately-severe AS); with a baseline mean AVA of 1.1 cm², peak velocity 3.7 m/s and MG 32.7 mm Hg. Our findings suggest that the current definition of severe AS or criteria for AVR may need to be relaxed or extended to a lower severity than currently recommended. In longitudinal data investigating the natural history or progression of AS, LV systolic function and SV were shown to significantly deteriorate when the AVA reached 1.2 cm². From a large dataset of AS patients from Australia, a lower SVI in patients with severe AS compared with those with moderate AS was demonstrated (41.9 ± 13.9 vs 49.8 ± 14.6 mL/m²). Similarly, this study showed that patients with severe AS had a lower SV and SVI at baseline compared with those with moderate to severe AS (table 1). An AVR procedure may be reasonable for those symptomatic patients with an AVA ≤ 1.2 ± 0.1 cm²; as LV dysfunction was found to deteriorate more precipitously at that severity. Prognostic data are necessary to support this hypothesis and further work is required.

Future directions

In this study, the possible benefit of earlier AVR in symptomatic patients with less than severe AS was evaluated. Since the current definition of moderate AS is extremely wide, it is difficult to apply our findings to the entire moderate AS population. However, this study challenges us to identify such a population who can benefit from AVR among patients with less than severe AS. When AS is not severe, symptoms may be related to an underlying myocardial disease rather than to the stenotic aortic valve alone, thus, there is a need to investigate objective cardiac parameters to guide patient management. Can AVR benefit patients with combined myocardial disease and less than severe AS? According to our data, further investigations and randomised clinical trials that compare the benefit with adverse events related to earlier AVR in patients with less than severe AS are needed.
