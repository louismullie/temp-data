## Question

How is pediatric migraine differentiated from tension-type headache?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate pediatric migraine from tension-type headache. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and which criteria to apply in children. Then, I should verify the core clinical discriminators that separate migraine from tension-type headache. Next, I will examine pediatric-specific modifiers and why many children remain unclassifiable. After that, I should review comorbidities and red flags that can bias diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical bedside approach and note limitations and follow-up needs, ensuring I anchor each point to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. I need to ensure I'm using the most appropriate pediatric-adapted criteria, which in practice means ICHD-3 with pediatric modifications that shorten migraine attack duration to 2–72 hours and allow bilateral pain, while still requiring associated symptoms for migraine and absence of nausea/photophobia/phonophobia for tension-type headache, and I should double-check that these pediatric adaptations are reflected in the AAN/AHS guidance and contemporary pediatric reviews [^111ByCto] [^111PFw8K].

> Now, I will examine the core clinical discriminators. Migraine in children typically lasts 2–72 hours untreated, is often pulsating or throbbing, and is aggravated by routine physical activity, whereas tension-type headache lasts 30 minutes to 7 days, is pressing or tightening, bilateral, and not aggravated by activity; importantly, migraine requires at least two of those pain features plus nausea/vomiting or photophobia/phonophobia, while tension-type headache lacks nausea and has at most one of photophobia or phonophobia, so I should confirm these distinctions at the bedside and avoid overcalling tension-type when associated symptoms are present [^111ByCto] [^114Zzdmr].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric-specific modifiers that complicate diagnosis. Younger children often have shorter attacks, sometimes less than 1 hour, which can make them fail adult-duration thresholds; they also report bilateral pain more often and may have difficulty articulating associated symptoms, leading to a high rate of unclassifiable cases when strict ICHD criteria are applied, so I should consider probable migraine or probable tension-type when one feature is missing and plan reassessment over time rather than forcing a label that doesn't fit [^113DKFQA] [^111PFw8K] [^1141Xt3N].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about associated symptoms. I initially thought "mild nausea" might still be compatible with tension-type, but wait, I should correct that: any nausea or vomiting pushes the diagnosis toward migraine, and tension-type should have neither; likewise, photophobia and phonophobia, when both are present, strongly favor migraine, so I need to ask explicitly about these features and document them carefully because they are the most reliable discriminators in children [^111ByCto] [^111PFw8K].

> Next, I should review comorbidities and psychosocial context that can blur the picture. Children with tension-type headache more often have internalizing symptoms and psychosocial stressors, whereas those with migraine may have more organic comorbidities such as atopy or iron deficiency; anxiety and mood symptoms are common in both and should be screened, but I need to ensure I don't let psychiatric comorbidity alone steer the headache diagnosis, as both entities can coexist with psychopathology [^116vsCf2] [^1164muvN].

> I will now examine red flags and when to image, because missing secondary causes would be a critical error. Papilledema, abnormal neurologic examination, progressive or changing headaches, occipital pain, or systemic features warrant MRI; otherwise, routine neuroimaging is not indicated for stable primary headaches, and I should confirm that this principle is consistent with AAN/Child Neurology Society parameters and primary care guidance before ordering scans [^111J6n3i] [^115nWFsE].

> Let me consider the spectrum concept and longitudinal stability, because this affects counseling. About 20–25% of children cross from migraine to tension-type or vice versa over several years, and many have mixed features, so I should explain to families that diagnoses can evolve and that periodic reassessment is part of best practice rather than a sign of misdiagnosis [^113nmBzu] [^116YUYoJ] [^112hVveM].

> But wait, what if the child is under 6 years old? I should double-check that ICHD criteria are particularly restrictive in preschoolers, with many attacks shorter than 1 hour and limited ability to report associated symptoms; in this group, I should prioritize clinical pattern recognition, family history, and observation over rigid criteria, and document probable categories with plans to reclassify as the child matures and can provide more reliable history [^113DKFQA] [^115YGVfs].

> Next, I should review a practical bedside approach. I need to ensure a structured history covering attack duration, pain quality, location, activity aggravation, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, frequency, disability, triggers, family history, and medication use; a focused neurologic exam and funduscopy for papilledema are essential, and I should use a headache diary to track features over time, especially when the diagnosis is uncertain or mixed [^111ByCto] [^111J6n3i] [^111NwnCM].

> I should confirm treatment implications briefly, because they reinforce diagnostic thinking. For pediatric migraine, ibuprofen or acetaminophen are first-line acute therapies, with triptans considered in selected cases, and preventive strategies considered for frequent or disabling attacks; for tension-type headache, simple analgesics and stress management are appropriate, and the absence of nausea or light/sound sensitivity supports the diagnosis and guides simpler acute strategies [^1148i6tX] [^114Zzdmr] [^112Xk7c4].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties and follow-up plans. Given the high rate of unclassifiable cases in children and the bidirectional crossover over time, I should schedule reassessment, maintain diagnostic humility, and educate families to track evolving features; this aligns with pediatric headache best practices and helps avoid premature labeling that could misdirect treatment [^1141Xt3N] [^113nmBzu] [^114XkXht].

Pediatric migraine is best distinguished from tension-type headache by **pain quality and associated symptoms**: migraine is typically **pulsating/throbbing**, unilateral or bilateral, lasts 2–72 hours, and is accompanied by nausea/vomiting and photophobia/phonophobia, with aggravation by routine activity [^111ByCto]; tension-type headache is **pressing/tightening**, bilateral, lasts 30 minutes to 7 days, lacks nausea, and has at most one of photophobia or phonophobia, without activity aggravation [^114Zzdmr]. Younger children may have shorter migraine attacks and bilateral pain, so **applying pediatric-adapted ICHD-3 criteria** and reassessing over time improves accuracy [^111PFw8K] [^113nmBzu]. Red flags (e.g. abnormal neurologic exam, nocturnal awakening, or progressive pattern) warrant neuroimaging to exclude secondary causes [^111J6n3i] [^115nWFsE].

## Clinical features distinguishing pediatric migraine from tension-type headache

| **Feature** | **Pediatric migraine** | **Tension-type headache** |
|-|-|-|
| Pain quality | Pulsating or throbbing | Pressing or tightening |
| Pain intensity | Moderate to severe | Mild to moderate |
| Location | Unilateral or bilateral | Bilateral |
| Duration | 2–72 hours (untreated) | 30 minutes–7 days |
| Associated symptoms | - Nausea/vomiting <br/> - Photophobia <br/> - Phonophobia <br/> - Aggravation by routine activity | - No nausea <br/> - At most one of photophobia or phonophobia <br/> - No activity aggravation |
| Aura | Present in ~25% (typically visual) | Absent |
| Frequency | Episodic; can be chronic | Episodic or chronic |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and guidelines

The **ICHD-3 criteria**, adapted for pediatrics, require at least five attacks lasting 2–72 hours, with two of pulsating quality, unilateral/bilateral location, moderate/severe intensity, or aggravation by activity, plus at least one of nausea/vomiting or photophobia/phonophobia [^111ByCto]. For tension-type headache, ICHD-3 requires at least 10 attacks lasting 30 minutes–7 days, with two of pressing/tightening quality, bilateral location, mild/moderate intensity, and no aggravation by activity, plus no nausea and at most one of photophobia or phonophobia [^notfound].

---

## Challenges in pediatric diagnosis

- **Shorter attack duration**: Many children have attacks < 2 hours, complicating ICHD application [^113DKFQA].
- **Bilateral pain**: Common in pediatrics, reducing specificity of unilateral pain for migraine [^111PFw8K].
- **Limited symptom reporting**: Younger children may not reliably report photophobia/phonophobia or nausea [^1176JA9S].
- **Overlap**: Some children meet criteria for both, reflecting a spectrum rather than discrete entities [^111eb9jA].

---

## Clinical approach and diagnostic tools

- **Detailed history**: Document pain quality, location, duration, associated symptoms, triggers, and family history [^111mHmcp].
- **Physical and neurologic examination**: Identify red flags (e.g. abnormal exam, nocturnal awakening, progressive pattern) [^115nWFnp].
- **Headache diary**: Track frequency, duration, symptoms, and triggers over time [^111NwnCM].
- **Pediatric-adapted criteria**: Use modified ICHD-3 thresholds (e.g. 1-hour minimum duration) to improve sensitivity [^111PFw8K].

---

## Role of neuroimaging

Routine neuroimaging is **not indicated for typical primary headaches**; reserve MRI or CT for red flags or abnormal neurologic findings [^111J6n3i] [^113kyoVc]. The most common incidental MRI finding is an arachnoid cyst, which is usually benign and does not explain headache [^115ZP1ei].

---

## Prognostic considerations

Migraine and tension-type headache can transform into each other over time, so **regular reassessment is essential** [^113nmBzu] [^116YUYoJ]. Early, accurate diagnosis and management can reduce disability and improve quality of life [^113Av279].

---

Pediatric migraine is best identified by **pulsating pain with nausea/photophobia/phonophobia and activity aggravation**, whereas tension-type headache is pressing, bilateral, mild/moderate, and lacks nausea; pediatric-adapted criteria and longitudinal reassessment improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Tension-type headache in childhood and adolescence [^114Zzdmr]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of non-migrainous headache is 10–25% in childhood and adolescence. Although tension-type headache and migraine are the two most common types of headache in children and adolescents, most articles address migraine headache. The distinction of tension-type headache from migraine can be difficult; use of The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria helps. However, these criteria might be too restrictive to differentiate tension-type headache from migraine without aura in children. The pathophysiology of tension-type headache is largely unknown. The smaller genetic effect on tension-type headache than on migraine suggests that the two disorders are distinct. However, many believe that tension-type headache and migraine represent the same pathophysiological spectrum. Some indications of effective treatment exist. For children with frequent headache, the antidepressant amitriptyline might be beneficial for prophylaxis, although no placebo-controlled studies have been done. Restricted studies have suggested the efficacy of psychological and cognitive behavioural approaches in the treatment of childhood tension-type headache.

Headache represents one of the most common reasons why children and adolescents are referred to pediatric neurology practices where the most common headache syndromes diagnosed are migraine and its variants, and chronic daily headache. The bulk of recent literature regarding headache in children has focused on these two clinical entities even though large epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that tension-type headache may be two to three times more common in children. Why has so little attention been given to these other disorders? The purpose of this review is to examine the "other" primary headache disorders in children and adolescents.

### Migraine and tension-type headache among children and adolescents: application of international headache society criteria in a clinical setting [^1141Xt3N]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The International Headache Society criteria were written in order to help physicians establish a headache diagnosis. However, sometimes children with headache do not seem to fit any diagnosis. The purpose of our study was to assess the application of the criteria in a clinical setting.

Methods

Medical records of children referred for primary headache to the pediatric neurology clinic at Bnai Zion Medical Center from 2008 to 2017 were assessed.

Results

A total of 989 patients (range 6–18 years; 53% female) were assessed at our neurology clinic. Twenty-four percent (n = 241) were diagnosed with tension-type headache, 26% (n = 256) with migraine, and 4.5% (45) with mixed headache. In 41.5% (410), we were unable to reach a specific diagnosis. No differences in gender or age were found between the groups. Children in the migraine group used more analgesic treatments to stop the headache attacks compared with the tension-type headache group (50% vs 38%, P = 0.001). Patients diagnosed with tension-type headache reported having more emotional difficulties (P = 0.001). No significant differences were found in headache characteristics (ie, location, sidedness, character), frequency, or intensity between the younger children (ages 6–11) and the adolescents (ages 12–18) within either the tension-type headache or migraine groups.

Conclusions

Retrospective application of International Headache Society criteria in a large cohort of children with headaches failed to diagnose a specific type of headache in 41.5% of children. Migraine and tension-type headache were equally prevalent, and both constituted a major burden on our patients' everyday lives. We found no major differences in frequency, intensity, and characteristics of pain between younger children and adolescents.

### Classification criteria and distinction between migraine and tension-type headache in children [^111uDUmg]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The International Headache Society (IHS) classification system (1988) was developed primarily for headache disorders in adults and its validity for paediatric age is currently under discussion; in 1995 Seshia et al. proposed a revision of the criteria for migraine without aura to make diagnostic criteria more applicable to children. The purposes of the current study were to: (1) compare the IHS classification with the Seshia proposal, (2) compare the children affected by migraine without aura (MO) with the children affected by tension headache (TH) as defined by Seshia, for characteristics which are not included in the classification. The patients are a series of 320 children (mean age 9.9, SD 2.6 years; 144 males, 176 females) with recurrent or chronic headaches referred to a headache clinic in Milan, Italy. Using the Seshia criteria instead of the IHS criteria a higher number of children were included in the MO category: bilateral pain and family history of migraine were the most important factors which allowed a shift of children into this category. However, with the Seshia classification there was no reduction in the number of unclassifiable children. The reason why some children could not be classified was a short duration of attacks; the majority of unclassifiable children were 6 years old or less. No relevant difference was found between children with MO and children with TH for the following variables: occurrence of attacks in the afternoon or evening after school, reduction of attacks during school holidays, full-time schooling, after-school activities on school days, disordered daily life. On the contrary children with MO when compared with those with TH showed a higher number of precipitating factors and for the following factors a significant difference was found: exposure to TV or a computer, sleep deficiency, and strong emotions. Furthermore, children with MO showed a greater severity of attacks.

For both migraine and tension-type headache, a peak in prevalence and YLD rate occurred between ages 35 and 39 years (Figure 3, Figure 4). In both sexes, the percentages of all YLDs were highest in the group aged 15–49 years (migraine 8.2%, tension-type headache 1.3%), but was also high in children aged 5–14 years (migraine 4.5%, tension-type headache 0.6%), in individuals aged 50–69 years (migraine 4.2%, tension-type headache 0.7%), and in the elderly (ie, ≥ 70 years; migraine 1.3%, tension-type headache 0.3%). In women between ages 15 and 49 years, migraine caused 20.3 million (95% UI 12.9–28.5) and tension-type headache caused 2.9 million (95% UI 1.8–4.2) YLDs in 2016, which together were 11.2% of all YLDs in this age and sex group.

### Clinical features, classification and prognosis of migraine and tension-type headache in children and adolescents: a long-term follow-up study [^113nmBzu]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

We performed a long-term follow-up examination in children and adolescents with migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) in order to investigate the evolution of clinical features and headache diagnoses, to compare International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-I and ICHD-II criteria and to identify prognostic factors. We re-examined 227 patients (52.4% female, age 17.6 ± 3.1 years) 6.6 ± 1.6 years after their first presentation to a headache centre using identical semistructured questionnaires. Of 140 patients initially diagnosed with migraine, 25.7% were headache free, 48.6% still had migraine and 25.7% had TTH at follow-up. Of 87 patients with TTH, 37.9% were headache free, 41.4% still had TTH and 20.7% had migraine. The number of subjects with definite migraine was higher in ICHD-II than in ICHD-I at baseline and at follow-up. The likelihood of a decrease in headache frequency decreased with a changing headache location at baseline (P < 0.0001), with the time between baseline and follow-up (P = 0.0019), and with an initial diagnosis of migraine (P = 0.014). Female gender and a longer time between headache onset and first examination tended to have an unfavourable impact. In conclusion, 30% of the children and adolescents presenting to a headache centre because of migraine or TTH become headache-free in the long-term. Another 20–25% shift from migraine to TTH or vice versa. ICHD-II criteria are superior to those of ICHD-I in identifying definite migraine in children and adolescents presenting to a headache centre. The prognosis is adversely affected by an initial diagnosis of migraine and by changing headache location, and it tends to be affected by an increasing time between headache onset and first presentation.

### Episodic and chronic migraine in children [^114sxFJ2]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Migraine is the most common acute and recurrent headache syndrome in children. This condition has unique clinical characteristics in the pediatric population, that can evolve with age, and significantly impact a child's quality of life, affecting their education, socialization, and family life. The purpose of this review is to describe the varied clinical features of migraine seen in children, and discuss potential treatment options for pediatric migraine, including chronic migraine. In many patients a multifaceted approach involving lifestyle changes, treatment of comorbid conditions, and pharmacological treatments are needed for optimal headache control. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Migraine presents as various phenotypes in children, sometimes evolving as the child ages. An expanded range of treatment options exists for the challenging chronic migraine patient.

### Analysis of the international classification of headache disorders for diagnosis of migraine and tension-type headache in children [^1176JA9S]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

In 2004, the revised International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) was published. This study evaluates: (1) the results obtained from applying ICHD-II to children with primary headaches to distinguish between migraine without aura (MO) and tension-type headache (TTH); and (2) the results obtained from introducing modifications of the classification criteria for MO as suggested by various authors. There were 200 participants (93 males, 107 females; age range 3–17 y, mean 9 y 8 mo [SD 2 y 7 mo]). According to the ICHD-II, MO compared with TTH was characterized by: higher intensity of pain; higher frequency of associated symptoms; and higher number of precipitating factors. The significant difference found between patients with MO/probable MO and those with TTH/probable TTH for the variables used in the ICHD-II shows that these variables describe the two forms well. However, 15.5% of children proved to be unclassifiable, mainly because they could not give information for some criteria; other reasons for this were too short a duration of episodes and the possible overlap of criteria describing probable MO and probable TTH. The frequency of one variable, pulsating pain, significantly increased with age. Reduction of duration to 1 hour for MO produced a statistically non-significant increase in the number of children with MO. Behaviour during attacks was found to be simple to apply in evaluating intensity and therefore was introduced as a new criterion. Severe intensity was related to MO, whereas moderate or low-intensity was related to TTH.

### Comparison of thrombocyte count between pediatric patients with migraine or tension-type headache: a retrospective cohort study [^1168mpKg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypercoagulability may explain the increased risk of thromboembolic cerebrovascular events in patients with migraine. Thrombocytes play a crucial part in the coagulation process, and some studies have demonstrated hyperaggregation of thrombocytes in adult migraineurs. We aimed to compare thrombocyte count between pediatric patients with migraine or tension-type headache and to evaluate the correlation of thrombocyte count with headache parameters. The electronic database of a tertiary pediatric headache clinic was retrospectively searched for all children and adolescents diagnosed with migraine or tension-type headache in 2016–2018. Data on thrombocyte counts were collected from the medical files and compared between the groups by parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. The cohort included 299 patients, 176 girls (59.0%) and 123 (412.0%) boys, of mean age 12.2 ± 3.4 years; 198 had migraine and 101 had tension-type headache. Among the laboratory parameters evaluated, a significantly lower mean thrombocyte number was found in the migraine group than in the tension-type headache group (282 ± 60 vs 304 ± 71 ×10³/μL, P = 0.004). Within the migraine group, there was a significant negative correlation between the thrombocyte count and the duration of headache attacks in hours (P < .05). No significant between- or within-group differences were found in other laboratory parameters. The low relative thrombocyte count in pediatric headache clinic patients with migraine and its negative correlation with duration of migraine suggest that migraine may be associated with a different underlying pathogenesis from tension-type headache.

### Association of pediatric obesity and migraine with comparison to tension headache and samples from other countries [^1119hUqW]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The link between body weight and headache has hardly been examined in children. The aim was to evaluate the association of obesity and migraine in selected pediatric patients and compare the findings with the literature. Data on clinical symptoms, headache type, and body mass index standard deviation score were derived from the medical files of 245 patients with migraine and 87 with tension headache. Comparison of the 3 subgroups of migraine patients of normal weight, overweight, and obese with the corresponding body mass index standard deviation score subgroups of patients with tension-type headache yielded no statistically significant differences in frequency of headache attacks per month, or duration of headache attacks in hours. These results call into question earlier reports linking headache and obesity in children. Differences in findings between our study and those in the literature highlight several factors that should be addressed in further studies. A larger sample size may reveal more significant results.

### MRI findings in children with migraine or tension-type headache [^115nWFsE]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Headache is common complaint in children. It is important to evaluate the headache correctly in children, which is worrisome for the family. Although primary headache is more frequent in children as in adults, the possibility of secondary headache is frightening for families and even physicians because of underlying disease such as central nervous system infection, brain tumors or vascular disorders. Diagnostic criteria for primary headache have been developed and the International Classification of Headache Disorders of the International Headache Society guidelines have been published. Migraine and tension-type headaches are main primary headaches of childhood. The role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in headache is controversial. MRI for each headache is costly, so studies are underway to understand whether a headache is primary or secondary without using tools of neuroimaging. Warning red flags have been developed for neuroimaging in secondary headaches. Data on the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches are discussed. Evaluation of pediatric patients with headaches is based on an adequate medical history as a first step and focused on looking for so-called red flags, warning signs suggestive of secondary headache. Among these red flags, some are considered to be at higher risk, such as pain that wakes the child from sleep or that occurs upon awakening, worsening of headaches with supine and/or straining, coughing. Red flags developed to differentiate primary and secondary headaches are of great importance. However, what could be the symptom or finding that could be a clue in case of secondary headache that may develop in a patient who has already been diagnosed with primary headache. There is always a risk that a secondary headache may develop over time in children with primary headache. Moreover, since it is a diagnosis of primary headache, the attention of the clinician or caregiver may make it difficult to understand the headache feature and may lead to ignoring potentially dangerous etiologies. However, the clinician's approach to headache may also be more rigorous or anxious, resulting in the use of costly MRI. The aim of this study is to evaluate MRI findings in children with known as migraine or tension-type headaches.

### Management of children and young people with headache [^113vrTeN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Headache is very common in children and young people. The correct advice and treatment requires consideration of a wide differential diagnosis between primary and secondary headaches, and also of the different types of primary headache. The International Classification of Headache Disorders gives useful descriptions and diagnostic criteria that are especially useful for primary headaches. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline 150 provides evidence-based recommendations on treatments for adults and young people from age 12years. However, the same principles can be applied to younger children when a specific diagnosis can be made. Key recommendations from the NICE Quality Standards include, establishing a precise diagnosis if possible, avoiding, diagnosing and treating medication overuse headache, and combining a triptan with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or paracetamol as the first-line acute/rescue treatment for migraine with or without aura. Although rare in children and young people, it is important to diagnose new daily persistent headache, as it responds poorly or not at all to medication; and paroxysmal hemicrania as it responds very well to indomethacin but not to other commonly used analgesics. When faced with difficulties in reaching a precise diagnosis or in finding effective therapies, further advice should be sought from a children's headache clinic or specialist.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for children with headaches: will an app Do the trick? [^116Cvsok]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Headaches are one of the most frequently reported health concerns among children, with 5% to 15% of youth suffering from migraine and 15% to 25% from tension-type headache. – Although the prevalence of frequent or severe headaches has been largely constant over the years, headache-related disability, particularly school absenteeism, has increased. Children with headaches also suffer from poor sleep quality, increased rates of anxiety and depression, and overall lower quality of life.

Pharmaceutical approaches for the prophylactic treatment of pediatric migraine and tension-type headache have traditionally been based on agents that are not headache-specific and have low efficacy in the pediatric age group, including amitriptyline, propranolol, and topiramate. More recent pharmacologic approaches such as CGRP inhibitors have not yet been approved in pediatric age groups. Nonpharmacologic therapies have shown similar effects to drug therapies for headache prevention; however, they are potentially more accessible and at times less expensive. Success of migraine therapy is influenced by a number of factors including anxiety surrounding headache events, and psychological comorbidities. Factors contributing to the efficacy of nonpharmacologic interventions include patient preference, poor tolerance or negative side effects from medications, inability to cope with stress or pain, and comorbid psychological conditions.

### Psychopathological symptoms in child and adolescent migraine and tension-type headache: a meta-analysis [^113n6j3n]. Cephalalgia (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

After decades of research, the importance of psychological factors in child and adolescent headache is no longer in doubt. However, it is not clearly understood whether different types of headache are comorbid with specific kinds of psychopathology. To address this issue, we set out to establish whether young patients with migraine do or do not show significant levels of psychopathological symptoms compared with age-matched healthy controls and patients with tension-type headache (TTH).

Methods

Ten studies were selected on the basis of a widely used psychodiagnostic tool (the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)) and by applying rigorous criteria: The studies were compared in a meta-analysis in order to evaluate the presence of Internalizing (mainly anxiety and depression) and Externalizing (mainly behavioral problems) symptoms in different types of headache (and versus healthy controls).

Findings

Patients with migraine showed more psychopathological symptoms than healthy controls. TTH patients also had more psychopathology than controls, although the difference was more marked in the area of Internalizing disorders. Finally, no differences emerged between migraine and TTH.

Discussion and Conclusion

Psychopathological symptoms affect children with migraine, but also children with TTH. Biological, pathophysiological and clinical links need to be established. Effective treatment of affected children and adolescents is imperative in order to prevent chronic evolution. In this context, the CBCL may be a good screening instrument with a view to developing a tailored clinical approach.

### Symptoms associated with headache in youth [^111eb9jA]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We applied exploratory factor analysis to a cross-sectional sample of patient survey data to determine the underlying relationships between headache-associated symptoms in youth. We found that the cardinal symptoms of migraine cluster. There were additional symptom clusters that consisted of nonspecific global neurologic dysfunction (lightheadedness, trouble thinking, blurry vision), and symptoms associated with vestibular and brainstem dysfunction (vertigo, balance problems, ear ringing, double vision). We also found that a greater number of headache-associated symptoms correlated with greater headache burden. Our approach differs from prior exploratory factor analysis of headache features because it focuses specifically on the relationships between headache-associated symptoms across a wide range of symptom types. This difference fundamentally shifts the focus from head pain to the constellation of neurologic symptoms associated with head pain, which is related to greater headache-related disability, and is of similar importance to alleviate as head pain from the perspective of individuals with migraine.

Tension-type headache, probable migraine, and migraine, a spectrum?

We found an abundance of headache-associated symptoms consistently correlated with other metrics indicating higher headache burden, which also differed across ICHD-3 headache diagnoses. Most respondents with tension-type headache reported no headache-associated symptoms while those with migraine reported the most headache-associated symptoms. Notably, those with probable migraine demonstrated a distribution of MCA dimension 1 factor loadings with a long tail that overlapped substantially with the migraine group. Of those with probable migraine, nearly 14% could have met full criteria for migraine if a broader range of headache-associated symptoms were considered. Our findings are consistent with the proposal that these primary headache disorders exist across a gamut of severity, but we cannot confidently differentiate between the 'spectrum' and 'continuum' theory. Specifically, whether tension-type headache is its own entity and probable migraine and migraine exist along a spectrum of disease, or tension-type, probable migraine, and migraine exist along the same continuum. Our findings do indicate that assessing a broader range of headache-associated symptoms, and the overall number of symptoms reported, could help define the spectrum of severity in migraine.

Pediatric headache — establishing a specific diagnosis: When evaluating children and adolescents with headache, clinicians should diagnose a specific headache type (primary, secondary, or other headache syndrome) (Level B), and clinicians should ask about premonitory and aura symptoms, headache semiology, associated symptoms, and pain-related disability to improve diagnostic accuracy for migraine and appropriately counsel patients (Level B). Diagnostic criteria for pediatric migraine include at least 5 headaches over the last year that last 2–72 hours when untreated, with 2 of 4 additional features and association with at least nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia; auras typically occur in about one third of older children and adolescents and precede the headache by 5–60 minutes.

### Recent developments in pediatric headache [^114sD9i8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will focus on some of the recent findings in pediatric headache including headache characteristics, epidemiology, comorbid associations and treatment updates.

Recent Findings

Pediatric headache remains a frequent health problem for children and their families, yet there remain many gaps in our knowledge. This review will broadly address some of the recent findings and highlight the gaps in our understanding and treatment of pediatric headache. There will be a focus on pediatric migraine as this has been the best characterized and studied.

Summary

Our understanding of pediatric headache is improving with increased recognition of the characteristics and associated symptomology. This should further guide the individualized treatment approaches for improved outcome and reduction of progression into adulthood.

### Comparison of comorbidities of migraine and tension headache in a pediatric headache clinic [^116vsCf2]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To compare comorbidities between migraine and tension headache in patients treated in a tertiary pediatric headache clinic. Methods Files of patients with migraine or tension headache attending a pediatric headache clinic were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of organic comorbidities. Additionally, patients were screened with the self-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to identify nonorganic comorbidities. If necessary, patients were referred to a pediatric psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker for further evaluation. Results The study cohort comprised 401 patients: 200 with migraine and 201 with tension headache. The main organic comorbidities were atopic disease, asthma, and first-reported iron-deficiency anemia; all occurred with statistical significance more often with migraine than with tension headache (Familial Mediterranean fever was six times more frequent in the migraine group than in the tension headache group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Nonorganic comorbidities (psychiatric, social stressors) were associated significantly more often with tension headache than with migraine (48.3% versus 33%; p = 0.03). Conclusions Children and adolescents with migraine or tension headache treated in a dedicated clinic have high rates of organic and nonorganic comorbidities. In this setting, patients with migraine have significantly more organic comorbidities, and patients with tension headache, significantly more nonorganic comorbidities.

### Migraine equivalents as part of migraine syndrome in childhood [^115g4ZpD]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine equivalents are common clinical conditions without a headache component, occurring as repeated episodes with complete remission between episodes. They include abdominal migraine, cyclical vomiting, benign paroxysmal vertigo, and benign paroxysmal torticollis. Other clinical entities, such as motion sickness and limb pain have been associated with migraine. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of migraine equivalents in a large population of children referred to a pediatric headache center and to analyze the possible relationship between migraine equivalents and headache features.

Methods

A total of 1134 of children/adolescents (73.2% with migraine and 26.8% with tension-type headache) were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to the episode frequency (high and low). Pain intensity was rated on a three-level graduate scale (mild, moderate, and severe pain).

Results

Migraine equivalents were reported in 70.3% of patients. Abdominal migraine (48.9%), limb pain (43.9%), and motion sickness (40.5%) were the most common migraine equivalents. Although headache type (migraine or tension-type headache) did not correlate with migraine equivalents presence (χ² = 33.2; P = 0.27), high frequency of headache episodes correlated with the occurrence of migraine equivalents. Moreover, migraine equivalents indicated a protective role for some accompanying feature of the headache episode.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that migraine equivalents should not be considered merely as headache precursors, but they as part of the migrainous syndrome. Thus, their inclusion among the diagnostic criteria for pediatric migraine/tension-type headache is useful.

### Brain diffusion abnormalities in children with tension-type and migraine-type headaches [^1138ZvnP]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Tension-type and migraine-type headaches are the most common chronic paroxysmal disorders of childhood. The goal of this study was to compare regional cerebral volumes and diffusion in tension-type and migraine-type headaches against published controls.

Materials and Methods

Patients evaluated for tension-type or migraine-type headache without aura from May 2014 to July 2016 in a single center were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-two patients with tension-type headache and 23 with migraine-type headache at an average of 4 months after diagnosis were enrolled. All patients underwent DWI at 3T before the start of pharmacotherapy. Using atlas-based DWI analysis, we determined regional volumetric and diffusion properties in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, brain stem, and cerebral white matter. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to test for differences between controls and patients with tension-type and migraine-type headaches.

Results

There were no significant differences in regional brain volumes between the groups. Patients with tension-type and migraine-type headaches showed significantly increased ADC in the hippocampus and brain stem compared with controls. Additionally, only patients with migraine-type headache showed significantly increased ADC in the thalamus and a trend toward increased ADC in the amygdala compared with controls.

Conclusions

This study identifies early cerebral diffusion changes in patients with tension-type and migraine-type headaches compared with controls. The hypothesized mechanisms of nociception in migraine-type and tension-type headaches may explain the findings as a precursor to structural changes seen in adult patients with chronic headache.

### Stability of pediatric migraine subtype after a 5-year follow-up [^112EJR8p]. Journal of Child Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The study assessed the 5-year follow-up outcome and possible prognostic factors of migraine subtypes with onset in childhood or adolescence. A total of 343 patients meeting the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-II criteria for migraine without aura (MO), migraine with aura (MA), or both MO+MA (ie, 1.1, 1.2) were contacted by phone and underwent structured follow-up headache interviews. Of the original sample patients, 22.7% were headache-free at follow-up, 14.1% had a transformed headache diagnosis (tension-type headache: 8.2%, chronic daily headache: 5.8%), and 63.3% still had migraine fulfilling the criteria for ICHD-II 1.1. or 1.2, but those who were still migraineurs at follow-up were older at baseline (respectively 12.93, 9.99, and 11.02 years for MO, MA and MO+MA, P = 0.0005). The probability of having the same migraine subtype diagnosis at baseline and at 5-year follow-up was 55.2%, 95.1%, and 31.1% for ICHD-II 1.1, 1.2, and both 1.1 and 1.2, respectively.

### Migraine pathophysiology in children and adolescents: a review of the literature [^111ao4Qj]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although migraine in adult and pediatric patients are overall very similar to each other, differences in prevalence, presentation, and treatment efficacy may reflect slight differences in the pathophysiological processes underlying migraine in these patient groups, perhaps because of ongoing development of the nervous system during childhood and adolescence. Although major gains have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of migraine in adults in recent years, equivalent research on migraine in pediatric patients continues to lag behind. In this review, we will describe the current state of migraine research in pediatric patients with regard to presentation and frequency of prodromal and postdromal symptoms, ictal and interictal calcitonin gene-related peptide elevation, and evidence for cortical spreading depression, thus covering all phases of migraine, and discuss how the findings seen here may relate to possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine. We aim to elucidate possible differences between migraine in children and adults, and the need for further research specific to pediatric patients with migraine in order to improve treatment in this patient group.

### Clarify headache type and… [^116gfcmx]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

1–4 Together, these changes result in increasingly frequent — and often daily — headache and related symptoms. Each year, 3% to 4% of patients with episodic migraine or tension-type headaches escalate to chronic forms. 5, 6.
11. Definitions of chronic migraine and TTH specify that symptoms be present on at least 15 days per month, but central sensitization may occur at lower frequencies. 5 Migraine may have a threshold for central sensitization of four episodes per month. 1, 11 Symptoms predictive of migraine escalation are pulsating quality, severe pain, photophobia, phonophobia, and attacks lasting longer than 72 hours. 12 Long attack duration and nausea are predictive of development of chronic TTH. 13 Cutaneous allodynia is strongly associated with chronification and may be a marker of central sensitization. 13, 14 The highest medication-associated risk is with opioids, followed by triptans, ergotamines, and nonopioid analgesics. 7, 11.

5 MOH develops almost exclusively in patients with migraine or TTH. Nonopioid analgesics are the most commonly implicated medications because of their widespread use in headache treatment; however, triptans are an increasingly common cause of MOH in the United States. The estimated mean critical dose and duration of use for triptans are 18 doses per month and 1. 7 years, compared with 114 doses per month and
4. 8 years for simple analgesics. 37 Although not recommended and less commonly used for headache, opioids present the greatest risk of MOH and the most difficult type to treat. 35, 36 MOH has no classic features. Symptoms vary among patients and over time. Patients often describe insidious onset of increasingly frequent headaches on awakening or early in the day. Headaches are of variable quality, intensity, and location. Neck pain is common, and autonomic and vasomotor symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, and vasomotor instability are reported.

35, 36 Patients with MOH often have sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders, especially depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. These disorders usually predate MOH and may contribute to the progression to chronic headaches. 35, 36, 38 Diagnosing MOH depends on an accurate and detailed medication history. Patients may underestimate their use of nonprescription analgesics or be unwilling to disclose opiate use.

### Symptoms associated with headache in youth [^111PFw8K]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symptoms associated with head pain are integral to the diagnosis of headache disorders. One hallmark distinction between tension-type headache and migraine is the respective absence and presence of light and sound sensitivity and nausea/vomiting. Yet, many symptoms commonly associated with head pain are not considered in diagnostic criteria. This is for good reason – the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) has been simplified over multiple iterations, to aide clinician diagnosis. However, current diagnostic criteria may not capture the full range of symptomatology associated with headache disorders. This is important for two reasons. First, the exploration of headache-associated symptoms has provided insight into the underlying pathophysiology of migraine and has supported its description as a sensory processing disorder. Second, criteria are used to determine which patients are included in clinical trials, and thus what therapies are available.

Formal diagnostic criteria were initially based on expert consensus of headache presentation in adults, followed by efforts to adapt the criteria to improve their sensitivity and specificity in children. A study evaluating 260 children diagnosed with migraine by a headache specialist found that adding additional associated symptoms (lightheadedness, fatigue, and trouble thinking) did not increase the sensitivity of a migraine diagnosis. However, decreasing the required duration and allowing for bilateral head pain did increase the sensitivity of making a migraine diagnosis, which is now reflected in the ICHD-3. These changes have improved diagnosis of migraine in children to best match the experiences of headache experts, however basing diagnosis on expert opinion is also a limitation. Large symptom databases may allow us to determine underlying relationships between headache-associated symptoms in youth that are agnostic to existing diagnostic categories and clinical judgement.

We performed a cross-sectional study of standardized patient-entered headache intake questionnaires from general neurology and headache clinics. We employed multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) — a form of exploratory factor analysis — to determine the underlying relationships between 13 headache-associated symptoms: light, sound, and smell sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, trouble thinking, room spinning, balance problems, ear ringing, blurry vision, double vision, and neck pain.

### Psychiatric symptoms in children with primary headache [^113jAdVC]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association of psychiatric symptoms with migraine and tension-type headache in children.

Method

A questionnaire completed by 1,135 Finnish children in the sixth grade identified 154 children with migraine, 138 with tension-type headache, and 407 children who were headache-free. Seventy children were randomly selected from each group and evaluated by a structured interview to confirm headache type, resulting in a sample of 59 children with migraine, 65 with tension-type headache, and 59 without headache. The children completed the Children's Depression Inventory, and the parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and General Functioning scale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device.

Results

Children with migraine had significantly higher levels of total, internalizing, and somatic symptoms, as well as social and family problems, than those without headache and had higher levels of somatic symptoms than children with tension-type headache. Children with tension-type headache had significantly higher levels of somatic symptoms and family problems than those without headache.

Conclusions

The association between psychiatric symptoms and headaches shows differences between different headache types. However, a minority of children with migraine or tension-type headache have high levels of psychiatric symptoms.

### Headache and facial pain in children and adolescents [^117PKZNB]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Headaches commonly affect children and adolescents. Proper diagnosis and management is dependent on thorough history taking and a comprehensive physical and neurological examination. Additional diagnostic testing is indicated in some cases. The second edition of the headache classification system by the International Headache Society has recently become available. The classification system is primarily based on adults, but we discussed the subtle distinctions made regarding children. In addition to the primary headache types of migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches, we discussed selected symptomatic headaches. Emphasis was placed on migraine and tension-type headaches because these are the most common pediatric headache types. We briefly discussed genetic aspects of headaches. Genetic factors have been hypothesized for chronic tension headache and other forms of migraine, but genetic linkage has only been established for familial hemiplegic migraine. We reviewed the nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies, including abortive and prophylactic medications for various age groups. Unlike headaches, facial neuralgias are rare in otherwise healthy children. Facial pain may be neurological, vascular, or dental in origin. We focused on trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, and Bell's palsy as neurological causes of facial pain in children.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^1128baiL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Comparison of migraine, tension-type, and cluster headache symptoms in adults — key diagnostic features include duration, location, pain quality, associated symptoms, and effect of activity. Duration is 4–72 hours for migraine, 30 minutes–7 days for tension-type, and 15–180 minutes for cluster, which may occur once every other day or up to eight times a day, with cluster recurrences weeks to years apart. Migraine location is typically unilateral (40% bilateral), tension-type is bilateral, and cluster is unilateral with orbital, supraorbital, temporal, or any combination. Pain is pulsating for migraine, pressing or tightening (nonpulsating) for tension-type, and stabbing, nonpulsating for cluster, with intensity moderate to severe, mild to moderate, and severe to excruciating, respectively. Nausea or vomiting is yes for migraine and no for tension-type and cluster; photophobia or phonophobia is one or both for migraine, none or one for tension-type, and none for cluster but may have ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, eyelid edema, or facial sweating. Routine physical activity is aggravated by migraine, has none for tension-type, and none for cluster, although patients may appear restless or agitated.

### Age-and sex-related differences in the presentation of paediatric migraine: a retrospective cohort study [^113XZeMP]. Cephalalgia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction Although migraine is a common headache complaint in children and adolescents there remains a significant gap in understanding the unique aspects of the disease in these age groups and their evolution with development. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to identify migraine features that are influenced by age and sex. Methods The headache characteristics of 359 paediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of migraine from a tertiary paediatric headache clinic were assessed. Patients retrospectively reported headache characteristics during a structured intake interview and clinical exam. Headache characteristics, description and associated symptoms were compared between children (age ≤ 12 years) and adolescents (age > 12 years), and between male and female migraineurs. Results Several migraine features differed significantly with age and/or sex, including: (i) a marked change from a 1:1 sex ratio in children to a 2:1 predominance of girls in adolescents; (ii) a higher frequency of headache attacks per month in adolescents and female migraineurs; (iii) a higher proportion of adolescents endorsed a 'throbbing' pain quality; (iv) a higher proportion of children reporting nausea and vomiting; and (v) a higher proportion of adolescents, particularly female migraineurs, had a diagnosis of a co-morbid anxiety. Conclusion The presentation of migraine, both in terms of its headache characteristics and associated symptoms, appear to vary as a function of age and sex. Given that migraine symptoms have a neural basis, it is not surprising that during the key period of neurodevelopment from childhood to adolescence this may impact their presentation.

### Electroencephalogram variations in pediatric migraines and tension-type headaches [^114qHgGw]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

This study evaluates specific electroencephalogram abnormalities in pediatric migraine and tension-type headaches, and demonstrates the clinical value of these abnormalities. We studied 50 migraine patients and 50 tension-type headache patients. Their mean age ± SD was 10.62 ± 3.21 (range, 5–16) years in the migraine group, and 13.00 ± 2.37 (7–16) years in the tension-type headache group. Diagnoses were rendered according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition, First Revision, of the International Headache Society. All patients underwent two waking-state electroencephalograms, one during a headache, and the other when headache-free. Thirty-six percent (18/50) of migraine patients and 12% (6/50) of tension-type headache patients revealed specific electroencephalogram abnormalities in headache attack electroencephalograms (P < 0.05). In headache-free period electroencephalograms, 16% (8/50) of the migraine group and 2% (1/50) of the tension-type headache group revealed abnormalities (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that electroencephalogram abnormalities are particularly prevalent in migraines, especially during headache attacks. This study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, on electroencephalographic evaluation of pediatric migraine and tension-type headache patients during both headache attacks and headache-free periods.

### Recurrent headache in Chinese children: any agreement between clinician diagnosis and symptom-based diagnoses using the international classification of headache disorders (second edition)? [^112Ba8Fd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

There has been a lack of published data on the pattern of recurrent headache in Chinese children. The validity of the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria has not been evaluated in Chinese children. We performed a retrospective medical record review of 124 children aged < 18 years with an International Classification of Diseases coding of headache followed up in a general outpatient clinic in a university-based hospital over a 3-year period (2000–2002). The aims of our study were to (1) study the pattern of recurrent headache in Chinese children and (2) study any agreement between clinical diagnoses made by our board-certified pediatricians and symptom-based diagnoses using the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (International Classification of Headache Disorders-II). The most common type was unclassified headache (70.2%), followed by infrequent episodic tension-type headache (24.2%) and migraine without aura (5.6%). A family history of headache or migraine was more commonly found in children with infrequent episodic tension-type headache or migraine without aura (P = 0.0109). The co-occurrence of abdominal pain with infrequent episodic tension-type headache was 30%; for unclassified headache, it was 19.5%. Dysmenorrhea occurred in 7.1% of girls with infrequent episodic tension-type headache and 8.6% of girls with unclassified headache. However, migraine without aura was not associated with abdominal pain or dysmenorrhea. Children with migraine without aura were more frequently referred to child neurologists (P = 0.0207) and admitted (P = 0.0000). Neurologic investigations, including electroencephalography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, were performed in less than 30% of cases. Abnormal results were found in only seven cases; with two referred to a neurosurgeon and none requiring surgical intervention. Thus, by using the clinical diagnosis of our board-certified pediatricians as the standard, the sensitivity and specificity of International Classification of Headache Disorders-II-based definition of migraine without aura was 23.1% and 93.4%, respectively, and for infrequent episodic tension-type headache, it was 37.5% and 76%, respectively. The typical characteristics of migraine tend to emerge later and might have led to underdiagnosis of the younger age group, with a higher rate of referral and inpatient management. The new edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria is still restrictive in clinical practice and might not be able to reflect current pediatric practice. Further studies with a defined study period or recurrent headache might be more useful in analyzing the use of these new International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria in the diagnosis of recurrent headache in children.

### Magnitude, impact, and stability of primary headache subtypes: 30 year prospective Swiss cohort study [^112hVveM]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Stability and crossover

One of the most important findings from this study was the substantial magnitude of overlap between the predominant subtypes of headache that occurred at each interview. Nearly all (84%) of the participants with migraine with aura at one or more interviews also reported migraine without aura at another interview, and nearly half of those with migraine without aura or with tension-type headache also had the other subtype longitudinally. Patterns of overlap in headache subtypes were quite similar to the findings of follow-up studies of clinical and population based samples of children and adults. A nearly identical pattern of bi-directional crossover between migraine and tension-type headache of 20–25% was reported in a seven year follow-up study of a clinical sample of children and adolescents. However, our study is the first to do simultaneous follow-up of all three common subtypes of headache.

Despite the lack of longitudinal stability of the predominant headache subtype and the large proportion of people in whom migraine is time limited, about 21% of those with migraine (with or without aura) and 7% of those with tension-type headache continued to have headaches for more than half of the follow-up period. These findings are remarkably similar to those of the Danish follow-up study that reported remission in about 40–45% of people with previous headaches, intermittent headache in 38%, and chronic severe headache in 20%.

The substantial overlap across headache subtypes coupled with the gradient of the magnitude of distress, impairment, family history, and service use across the subtypes suggests that migraine and tension-type headache may share some common causative factors. However, evidence for a spectrum of subtypes of headache has been inconsistent. Although some evidence exists for specificity of familial transmission of migraine with and without aura and tension-type headache, the results of several twin studies show equal heritability of combinations of headache subtypes and symptoms, and others support an underlying continuum of features of headache with different subtypes distinguished by severity rather than by qualitative features. A clear-cut gradient of severity exists across headache subtypes from migraine with aura to tension-type headache in terms of clinical correlates, severity, treatment, and impact. However, the lack of a unidirectional pattern of onset of tension-type headache and migraine among people who exhibited both subtypes over time suggests that tension-type headache and migraine do not represent progressively more severe manifestations of the same underlying continuum of severity.

### Pediatric headache [^115xEToT]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Headaches occur frequently in the pediatric population and have a significant impact on both the patient and their family. Migraine, the most common headache disorder for which patients see a physician, still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Recent studies have revealed the increasing incidence of migraine and chronic migraine in the pediatric population.

Recent Findings

Limitations of the present diagnostic criteria for migraine are presented, and the proposed modifications to these criteria may assist you with early recognition and ultimate treatment. New acute and preventive migraine treatment data demonstrating statistically significant benefit for the primary endpoints will be reviewed in detail. The clinically relevant impact of migraine on the pediatric patient documented by the use of the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory will be discussed.

Summary

A comprehensive management approach blending the most current acute, preventive, and biobehavioral treatments will be reviewed. Further research, with novel study designs, in pediatric headaches is needed to help reveal additional pathophysiological mechanisms, improve diagnostic criteria, and advance optimal treatment. Prospective studies are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of preventive management in this population and to establish whether early intervention might slow this disease progression.

### A 3-year follow-up of headache diagnoses and symptoms in Swedish schoolchildren [^116YUYoJ]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Information is sparse concerning the incidence and prognosis of headache in children from the general population, especially of tension-type headache. In this study, headache diagnoses and symptoms were reassessed in 122 out of 130 schoolchildren after 3 years. Nearly 80% of those with headache at first evaluation still reported headache at follow-up. Although the likelihood of experiencing the same headache diagnosis and symptoms was high, about one-fifth of children with tension-type headache developed migraine and vice versa. Female gender predicted migraine and frequent headache episodes predicted overall headache at follow-up. The estimated average annual incidence was 81 and 65 per 1000 children, for tension-type headache and migraine, respectively. We conclude that there is a considerable risk of developing and maintaining headache during childhood. Headache diagnoses should be reassessed regularly and treatment adjusted. Girls and children with frequent headache have a poorer prognosis and therefore intervention is particularly important in these groups.

### MRI findings in children with migraine or tension-type headache [^115mbrfC]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study was conducted in a tertiary healthcare center, including patients with migraine or tension-type headaches under the age of 18, who have been followed up in the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic with regular office visits for at least two years and had MRI in the last year. The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria of the International Headache Society were taken as the diagnostic criteria for migraine and tension-type headaches. Demographic information such as age, gender and findings of MRI were taken as data. The request for MRI were divided into 3 groups. These groups are;

Group 1: Patients with abnormal findings in neurological examination (papilledema, focal neurologic finding or deficit),

Group 2: Patients with red flags (systemic symptoms, acute onset, occipital zone, precipitated by Vasalva, positional, progressive, < 6 years old).

Group 3: Patients with no abnormal neurologic findings or with no red flags.

Ethics committee approval was obtained from the local ethics committee for the study.

Statistical analysis

SPSS 23.0 statistical package program was used in the analysis of the data. Descriptive statistics of evaluation results; number and percentage for categorical variables; are given as mean and standard deviation (ss) for metric variables. The conformity of the measurement data to the normal distribution was examined with the One-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov Test. Comparisons of the measurement data of two independent groups; Since the normal distribution condition was not met, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Chi-square test was used to analyze the differences between categorical ratios. Statistical significance level was accepted as p < 0.05.

### Headache symptoms consistent with migraine and tension-type headaches in children with anxiety disorders [^115BFnWJ]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the incidence of headache symptoms consistent with migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) in children with anxiety disorders.

Method

Parents of children with anxiety disorders (n = 27) and children without anxiety disorders (n = 36) completed a headache questionnaire based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (2nd edition) criteria.

Results

Children with anxiety disorders had a higher incidence of headache symptoms consistent with migraine and TTH compared to children without anxiety disorders. Girls with anxiety disorders and children with separation anxiety disorder had a higher incidence of headaches compared to girls without anxiety disorders and children with other anxiety disorders respectively. Children with anxiety disorders and headaches had higher self-reported anxiety symptom severity compared to children with anxiety disorders without headaches and children without anxiety disorders.

Conclusion

Findings highlight an overlap in anxiety and headaches in children and warrant further research on factors that contribute to the etiology and maintenance of these co-occurring problems.

### Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels in children and adolescents with primary headache disorder [^116tz2Yt]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in children and adolescents with primary headache. MethodsAll patients underwent blood sampling regardless of their headache state (ictal or interictal) on the day of examination. The patients were grouped based on their headache diagnosis (migraine, tension-type headache, or mixed). ResultsNinety-two patients aged 5–18 years were included (29 diagnosed with migraine and 31 with tension-type headache). In the comparisons between the patients with migraine and the patients with tension-type headache, interictal CGRP levels in blood from the cubital vein showed no significant difference. Ictal samples were collected in the tension-type headache group only, and no significant difference was observed between the ictal and interictal phases. Variables such as headache diagnosis, sex, age, family history with primary headache, headache frequency, time since last headache, medication usage, and body mass index did not significantly influence CGRP levels. ConclusionNo significant difference in interictal CGRP levels between patients with migraine and patients with tension-type headache were found. In patients with tension-type headache, there were no significant differences between CGRP levels in the ictal and interictal state. We were not able to draw conclusions about differences in ictal levels of CGRP in patients with migraine compared with patients with tension-type headache, or in differences between ictal and interictal levels in patients with migraine. Future studies should aim to replicate these results in a larger study cohort.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

### Current approaches to the diagnosis and management of paediatric migraine [^113Av279]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Headache is a common complaint in childhood with up to 75% of children reporting a notable headache by the age of 15 years. Paediatric migraine is the most frequent recurrent headache, occurring in up to 28% of older teenagers. Migraine can have a substantial effect on the life of the child, as well as their family, leading to lost school days and withdrawal from social interactions. Early recognition can lead to successful treatment, improved outcome, and reduced disability. The treatment strategy needs to be multipronged and can include acute therapy (which can vary depending on the severity of the headache), preventive therapy (when the headaches are frequent or causing substantial disability), and biobehavioural therapy (to assist with coping with recurrent headaches). Additional factors can contribute to exacerbations of headaches, including comorbid disorders and pubertal changes, which might lead to the development of menstrual migraine. When all these factors are effectively managed, there should be an improvement in long-term outcome and prevention of disease progression.

### Chronic daily headache, medication overuse, and obesity in children and adolescents [^111TVDtB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity and headaches are common in children and adults. Adult studies suggest obesity is a risk factor for chronic daily headache and increased migraine frequency and severity. Pediatric studies have suggested a relationship between obesity, increasing headache frequency, and disability. The authors retrospectively evaluated 925 children from their Pediatric Headache Clinic between July 2004 and July 2008, assessing headache frequency, medication overuse, and body mass index compared to population-based norms. The pediatric headache group as a whole had a greater percentage of overweight than the general population. This was also true with the subgroup of patients with chronic tension-type headache, although the numbers were small. Data did not show increased incidence of overweight in children with medication overuse or chronic migraine. This contrasts with adult data, which have suggested a closer link between chronic migraine and obesity and have not supported a link with chronic tension-type headache.

### Primary headaches in childhood – a population-based study [^115rzWuy]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of primary headaches in pre-adolescent children, as well as headache frequency and days of treatment in this population. Sample consisted of 1994 children (aged 5–12 years). Parents were interviewed by a paediatric headache specialist using a questionnaire that allowed the classification of headaches using the criteria of the Second Edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. The most severe headache type was classified (mutually-exclusive diagnoses). Prevalence and prevalence ratios were calculated overall, as well as by age, gender and race. The overall prevalence of migraine was 3.76%, non-significantly higher in boys (3.9%) than in girls (3.6%). Prevalence of probable migraine was significantly higher than the prevalence of migraine for all ages (overall prevalence of 17.1%). Chronic migraine (CM) happened in 0.8% (girls, 1.15%; boys, 0.5%). Infrequent episodic tension-type headache (ETTH) happened in 2.3% of the sample while prevalence of frequent ETTH was 1.6%. Probable TTH happened in 13.5%. Most children with migraine had consulted a medical doctor because of their headaches, and the proportion was higher among children with CM (93.7%). Prevalence of primary headaches is high in young children. Probable diagnoses are more common than full diagnoses. Consultation rates are elevated.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood headache [^113dYgUF]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2016). Low credibility.

Headache is one of the most common chief complaints seen in the pediatrician's office. Oftentimes, identifying the etiology of headache and differentiating primary and secondary causes can present a diagnostic conundrum. Understanding the most common causes of primary and secondary headache is vital to making a correct diagnosis. Here we review the typical presentations of the most common primary headache disorders and the approach to evaluation of the pediatric patient presenting with headache. Diagnostic workup, including the key features to elicit on physical examination, when to order head imaging, and the use of other ancillary tests, is discussed. Current treatment modalities and their indications are reviewed. We will also describe some of the new, emerging therapies that may alter the way we manage headache in the pediatric population. Headache can, at times, be a frustrating symptom seen in the pediatrician's office, but here we hope to better elucidate the approach to evaluation, management, and treatment as well as provide some hope in regards to more effective upcoming therapies.

### Clinical features of migraine: a cross-sectional study in patients aged three to sixty-nine [^116Q63Ry]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

We investigated 260 consecutive patients classified as migraine cases aged 3–69 at two tertiary headache centres, one for children and adolescents and the other for adults to evaluate the relationship between age and clinical features of migraine cross-sectionally. We only included subjects with definite migraine without or with aura and we excluded subjects with coexisting tension-type headache, medication overuse and/or other clinically relevant disorders. The percentage of males decreased markedly from childhood to adulthood and this affected the evaluation of age-related changes in male patients, as only large differences reached the level of statistical significance. In females, the headache duration and the prevalence of unilateral, pulsating pain, photophobia and phonophobia increased, whereas the prevalence of aggravation by physical activity decreased with age. In conclusion, this cross-sectional, clinic-based study on a strictly defined sample of 260 consecutive patients with definite migraine covering a wide range of age from the very young to the old suggests marked age-related differences of the clinical features of migraine in females and failed to demonstrate similar differences in males due to the small number of adult male migraineurs.

### Diagnosis of primary headache in children younger than 6 years: a clinical challenge [^113DKFQA]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background Criteria defined by the International headache Society are commonly used for the diagnosis of the different headache types in both adults and children. However, some authors have stressed some limits of these criteria when applied to preschool age. Objective Our study aimed to describe the characteristics of primary headaches in children younger than 6 years and investigate how often the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria allow a definitive diagnosis. Methods This retrospective study analysed the clinical feature of 368 children younger than 6 years with primary headache. Results We found that in our patients the percentage of undefined diagnosis was high when either the ICHD-II or the ICHD-III criteria were used. More than 70% of our children showed a duration of their attacks shorter than 1 hour. The absence of photophobia/phonophobia and nausea/vomiting significantly correlate with tension-type headache (TTH) and probable TTH. The number of first-degree relatives with migraine was positively correlated to the diagnosis of migraine in the patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions Our study showed that the ICHD-III criteria are difficult to use in children younger than 6 years. The problem is not solved by the reduction of the lowest duration limit for the diagnosis of migraine to 1 hour, as was done in the ICHD-II.

Results

The general characteristics of the patients according to the presence of headaches are shown in Table 1. Of the 224 participants, 125 were clinically diagnosed with headaches, of whom 53 were boys and 72 were girls. Of the 104 pubertal subjects, 56.7% were diagnosed with headaches, compared to 60% in the prepubertal group. Both daytime and nighttime noise levels were significantly higher in the diagnosed headache group than in the non-diagnosed group.

Table 2 shows the characteristics of headaches in different subgroups. Boys were more likely to be diagnosed with headaches during puberty (54.2%), whereas girls were more likely to be diagnosed with headaches during prepuberty (68.2%). Age differences were also observed in headache types (migraine: girls 61.4%, boys 38.6%; and tension-type: girls 54.4% and boys 45.6%, p -value 0.4308). Further, a statistically higher proportion of patients experienced migraines in prepubertal and tension-type groups than in pubertal group. There were no significant differences in lateralization between each group, but frontal and temporal areas were the majority of headache area (Fig. 2).

### Headache care [^116ZBosS]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary headache disorders are common within the pediatric population and often lead to disruption in multiple areas of life. It is important to systematically approach patients presenting for the evaluation of headaches to determine if the symptoms originate from a primary or secondary headache disorder. Once a diagnosis is established, patients should be offered treatment to adequately address the headache disorder. Over the last 6 years, multiple new treatment options have emerged, with growing selections available for children and adolescents. In this review, we discuss the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment approach to primary headache disorders.

### MRI findings in children with migraine or tension-type headache [^115ZP1ei]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

It was found that 840 children and adolescents with the diagnosis of migraine or tension-type headaches had regular office visits. The average follow-up period of the patients is 32 months (min: 25, max: 47 months). Of these patients, 280 patients (187 female patients) were identified from the files of the patients who had undergone MRI in the last year. Of the patients, 91 (% 61 female) were with migraine and 189 (%67 female) with tension-type headaches. Female gender (67%, 66.7%) was dominant in both groups, and there was no difference between groups (p > 0.05). The age of patients with migraine was found to be 13.6 ± 3.2 (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographic characteristics patients are shown

When the MRI requests of the patients were evaluated, there is no abnormal neurologic findings or no red flags in 40.7% of the patients with migraine and 68.8% (n: 130) of the patients with tension-type headache (Table 2). Three of the children with migraine and one child with tension-type headache had abnormal neurological examination findings. These findings were papilledema in one child with tension-type headache and one had temporary vision loss in one child with migraine, and two had one-sided temporary paralysis. Although children with migraine and neurological symptoms did not have their first appointment and these findings were known to be temporary, MRIs were requested by the doctor in the emergency rooms they applied to.

Table 2
Comparison of magnetic resonance imaging findings of children with migraine and tension-type headache

There was no abnormal MRI report in migraine patient. One (0.5%) patient with tension-type headache had abnormal MRI report. The patient has been followed up with tension-type headache for about 3 years, had a normal MRI 4 years ago This patient was a 12-year-old boy with a tumor located in the unilateral posterior thalamus. The tumor had a mass effect. The patient had headache, vomiting and papilledema on neurological examination. Incidental MRI findings found 7.7% and 12.7% in migraine and tension-type headache, respectively. Arachnoid cyst was found to be the most common MRI finding (Table 3). The percentage of patients with arachnoid cyst is found 5%.

Overview

The main elements of the GBD methods, both general and pertaining to migraine and tension-type headache, are described in the appendix. In the main text of this Article, we concentrate on methods pertaining to estimation of the burden of migraine and tension-type headache. A flowchart of the different steps in these methods is shown in the appendix.

In the GBD cause hierarchy, migraine and tension-type headache are individual disorders on Level 3, under neurological disorders (Level 2) and non-communicable diseases (Level 1). No further subdivision exists for headaches, so each reappears at Level 4. In GBD 2013 and GBD 2015, medication overuse headache was treated as a separate disorder, but in GBD 2016 it was considered a sequela of either migraine or tension-type headache. The burden of medication overuse headache was therefore added to the burdens estimated for these headache types according to a meta-analysis of three studies reporting the proportions of medication overuse headache resulting from migraine (73.4%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 63.9–82.0) or tension-type headache (26.6%, 18.0–36.1).

Pediatric migraine versus all headaches — based on pooled data from 219 children with migraine and 929 with all headaches there was no significant difference in EEG abnormalities, and 44% of the all-headache group were diagnosed with migraine; even if differences existed, there was no evidence that EEG findings would have sufficient specificity or sensitivity to be clinically useful in an individual patient.

### Primary headaches in preschool age children: clinical study and follow-up in 163 patients [^115YGVfs]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Although headache frequency is increasing in preschool age children, an extensive evaluation of the clinical features in affected patients has yet to be achieved. This retrospective study examined 243 patients who were separately analysed in two distinct groups according to the age of onset and the age of first clinical evaluation. Group 1 included preschool age children, while Group 2 consisted of pubertal age patients. In all the patients the importance of a positive family history for headache as a risk factor was confirmed. In addition, when compared with Group 2, Group 1 showed greater male gender prevalence and earlier onset of the attacks. Regarding clinical features, in Group 1, compared with Group 2, the attack duration was shorter with lower symptom association such as photo- or phonophobia, nausea and no pain increase during physical activity. In the same group, tension-type headache was the predominant diagnosis, in contrast to the high migraine prevalence of Group 2. This study also showed that the International Headache Society 1988 classification criteria are not fully adequate for juvenile headaches. In fact, the headaches of more than 10% of patients in Group 1 still remained unclassifiable, while those of all the subjects in Group 2 were properly classifiable.

### Management of headaches in children and adolescents [^114XkXht]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric headache impacts up to 80% of children, many recurrently, by the time they are 15 years old. Preventing the progression of episodic to chronic headache results in less truancy, staying current with schoolwork and improves children's quality of life. Lifestyle choices can play an important role in headache treatment. Early effective treatment of episodic headache can prevent transformation into a chronic form. While details of a child's headache are critical for making a proper diagnosis; patient education is critical and effective rescue and preventive treatment strategies enable patients to focus on enjoying activities of daily living. Recognizing "red flags" that may suggest a serious underlying etiology is critical in the early stages of diagnosing and preparing to treat children with headaches. Finally directing patients to manage their headaches at home and when to proceed to an emergency department, urgent care or infusion unit can lower the economic burden of acute headache management.

Regarding specific circumstances for tension-type headache, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, evaluation, AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain evaluation to distinguish urgent or emergent causes (such as meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage) from common preexisting conditions (such as sinusitis, tension-type headache, or migraine) in pregnant patients with new-onset headaches or a new type of headache. Assess for preeclampsia if headaches occur after 20 weeks of gestation.

1. Introduction

Migraine often begins in childhood, and roughly 20% of sufferers experience their first attack before 5 years of age. Early intervention can decrease migraine frequency, with those receiving earlier interventions more likely to achieve remission. However, treatment strategies for children are limited, in part due to limited knowledge about pediatric migraine biology. Migraine is often managed similarly in children as adults, despite evidence that children with migraine present with different symptoms. Standard medications to prevent migraine in adults have shown to be no more effective than placebo in children, and may carry side effects. To improve treatments for children, we need to understand the underlying biology of pediatric migraine.

There is compelling evidence that adult migraine results from an imbalance of excitation/inhibition in the brain, which changes cyclically until a migraine occurs (known as the migraine cycle). During the interictal period, cortical excitability increases proportionally with time until the next attack. During the ictal period, or shortly thereafter, the brain returns to baseline activity and begins the cycle again. Neurophysiological studies suggest this cortical hyperexcitability results from abnormal thalamic control, resulting in altered communication in thalamocortical networks, which underlie important processes in multisensory integration; this altered communication is associated with clinical migraine symptoms. Excitability of the sensory cortices is set by activity in these thalamocortical loops. Between attacks, there is evidence that adults with migraine have reduced function in thalamocortical connectivity, resulting in increased excitability in sensory and visual cortices. For example, the sensorimotor cortex of migraineurs shows enhanced responses to sensory stimuli, and the degree of enhancement correlates with headache frequency. Similarly, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies involving adults with migraine indicate visual cortex hyperexcitability.

In GBD, DisMod-MR 2.1 makes it possible to adjust results of studies that were done using suboptimal case definitions or methods. However, an important aspect that has not yet been taken into account in the model is the distinction between definite and probable diagnoses of migraine and tension-type headache. People with a definite diagnosis fulfil all ICHD diagnostic criteria for the disorder, whereas those with probable diagnoses do not meet one of them; the probable diagnosis is not meant to signify a separate nosological entity. In a clinical setting, probable diagnoses are useful for patients for whom there is diagnostic uncertainty, but confirmation (or refutation) of the diagnosis is expected later. However, this will not be the case in epidemiological studies and, unless the large number of probable cases are included for either migraine or tension-type headache as appropriate, these people will not be counted, despite experiencing headache-related disability. Several studies have investigated, in more detail, participants in epidemiological studies who received probable diagnoses. In the great majority, a definite diagnosis of migraine was withheld because attacks reportedly lasted less than 4 h (the minimum allowed by the criteria). Otherwise, the diagnosis resembled migraine closely, and was associated with considerable disability. Until 2000, the majority of studies reported only definite migraine, and not both definite and probable diagnoses. After 2000, more studies reported both types, and these studies indicate that the prevalence of probable migraine is almost as high as that of definite migraine. Future iterations of GBD should therefore find a reasonable and consistent way to deal with probable migraine because it is a common cause of disability that otherwise will be unaccounted for. Similar arguments can be made for probable tension-type headache, although knowledge of this headache type is far less, and the YLDs missed by omitting this are fewer because of the much lower disability weight of tension-type headache compared with migraine.
