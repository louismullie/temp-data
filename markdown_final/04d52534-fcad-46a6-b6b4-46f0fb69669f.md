## Question

Telopeptide how to use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use telopeptides (CTX and NTX) as bone turnover markers in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what telopeptides are and which assays are preferred. Then, I should verify pre-analytical conditions and sources of variability. Next, I will consider baseline measurement strategy and interpretation. After that, I need to outline monitoring during therapy and thresholds for response. I will then examine special scenarios like drug holidays, Paget's disease, and CKD. Finally, I should review limitations, pitfalls, and a concise decision algorithm to synthesize this into a practical approach.

> Let me first confirm the biology and the preferred analytes. CTX and NTX are telopeptide fragments released during osteoclastic resorption of type I collagen; CTX is typically measured in serum or plasma (preferably the β-isomerized form), whereas NTX is classically measured in urine as a ratio to creatinine, with serum NTX assays less responsive to antiresorptives and therefore less favored clinically [^114KeMGk] [^116ymRJG]. I should double-check guideline preferences: the Endocrine Society and AACE endorse serum CTX as the preferred resorption marker and PINP as the preferred formation marker, which aligns with IOF/IFCC reference-marker recommendations [^115hFkfw] [^116RJGJ7] [^1146tBda].

> Wait, let me verify pre-analytical conditions because these markers are notoriously variable. For CTX, I need to ensure fasting morning sampling at the same time of day to mitigate diurnal variation and feeding effects; NTX in urine is less diurnal but still benefits from first-morning collection and creatinine adjustment, and both markers should be interpreted using the same assay over time to avoid analytical drift [^115hFkfw] [^114ScA79] [^111Twk2g]. Hold on, I should also consider other modifiers: recent fracture, acute illness, exercise, pregnancy/lactation, and some drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors) can elevate markers, so I need to document these when interpreting results [^111Twk2g] [^112Tk6ve].

> Next, I should review when to obtain baseline measurements. I need to ensure I am not over-ordering; BTMs are not diagnostic for osteoporosis and are not universally required, but a baseline can be useful when I anticipate needing early feedback on adherence or suspect secondary causes of high turnover, and in Paget's disease to quantify activity before therapy [^115hFkfw] [^116UmedF] [^1165MgyM]. Let me consider interpretation: in untreated patients, markedly high CTX/NTX should prompt evaluation for secondary causes such as hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or myeloma, whereas values within age-appropriate ranges are less concerning but still contextual [^116UmedF] [^112jZKPj].

> I will now examine monitoring during antiresorptive therapy. For oral bisphosphonates, I should recheck CTX (or NTX) at 3–6 months to confirm biochemical response; a drop exceeding the least significant change (LSC) of about 30–56% for CTX and about 38% for PINP indicates a meaningful treatment effect, and failure to suppress should trigger adherence review, malabsorption assessment, or a change in therapy [^114ScA79] [^115hFkfw] [^113vtpat]. Hold on, I should verify expected magnitudes: alendronate typically reduces CTX by roughly 80% and PINP by about 60% within months, and denosumab produces even faster and deeper CTX suppression, often within days, which can be useful when rapid confirmation is needed [^114ScA79] [^115f8DVU] [^116xxUkF].

> Let me think about anabolic therapy monitoring. With teriparatide or abaloparatide, I should track a formation marker such as PINP; early rises in PINP (often peaking around 1 month) followed by later increases in resorption markers reflect the anabolic-coupling pattern, and the absence of a PINP rise suggests nonadherence or a biological nonresponse that warrants reassessment [^notfound]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse PINP as the preferred formation marker for this purpose, which they do [^115hFkfw] [^116RJGJ7].

> Now, I need to check drug holiday management. During a bisphosphonate holiday, measuring CTX at 6–12 months helps detect loss of antiresorptive effect; a rise back to pretreatment baseline or an increase greater than about 30% from end-of-treatment levels suggests excessive bone loss and supports earlier re-treatment in higher-risk patients, although I should acknowledge that high-quality trial data are limited and this remains an expert-informed approach [^11472FPr] [^111NfYtU]. But wait, what if the patient was on denosumab? Discontinuation of denosumab leads to a rebound increase in resorption with CTX rising 40–60% above baseline within months, so I should plan a bridging antiresorptive (usually a bisphosphonate) to mitigate this rebound phenomenon [^115f8DVU] [^116xxUkF].

> Next, I should review Paget's disease, where telopeptides behave differently. In active Paget's, α-CTX from newly synthesized collagen predominates and can be disproportionately elevated, so assays capturing non-isomerized or α-CTX may be more sensitive to disease activity and treatment response than standard β-CTX assays; rapid post-treatment falls in resorption markers (sometimes within 10 days) can confirm efficacy when clinical urgency exists [^114KeMGk] [^117MfGYL] [^115xhVeX]. I need to ensure remission targets are explicit: aiming for turnover in the lower half of the reference range is associated with longer biochemical remission, and total ALP remains a cost-effective routine marker, with PINP or telopeptides added when liver overlap or subtle disease is suspected [^112jYpkq] [^117Ffs7r] [^1165MgyM].

> Hold on, I should verify CKD considerations. In CKD stages 3–5D, routine measurement of telopeptides is discouraged because renal clearance and non-bone sources confound interpretation; instead, PTH and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are preferred to estimate turnover, reserving biopsy when results are inconclusive and management hinges on turnover classification [^115ZAQpa] [^115wrgzW]. I need to ensure I do not overinterpret a high CTX/NTX in advanced CKD without corroborative clinical and laboratory context [^115ZAQpa].

> I should double-check limitations and pitfalls so I don't overstate utility. BTMs are not diagnostic for osteoporosis, do not reliably predict fracture risk in individuals, and should not replace DXA for diagnosis or longitudinal assessment; they complement, not substitute, BMD monitoring and clinical risk assessment [^116UmedF] [^114MMB42] [^115hFkfw]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied CTX could predict hip fracture — large observational data do not support that, reinforcing that BTMs are for treatment monitoring rather than fracture prediction in untreated cohorts [^111s16jh]. I also need to remember that assay-specific reference ranges and LSCs must be used, and that recent fracture or acute illness can transiently elevate markers, risking misinterpretation if timing is ignored [^113eSPsx] [^111Twk2g].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm. Before therapy, consider a baseline CTX (and/or PINP) if early feedback on adherence or secondary causes would change management; ensure pre-analytical conditions are standardized and document confounders. During antiresorptives, recheck CTX at 3–6 months and confirm a decrease exceeding the LSC; if unchanged, reassess adherence, absorption, and secondary causes, and consider switching route or agent. During anabolics, track PINP for an early rise. For drug holidays, monitor CTX at 6–12 months and restart if thresholds are exceeded; after denosumab, always bridge to avoid rebound. In Paget's, use sensitive markers (consider α-CTX) and aim for suppression into the lower half of the reference range. Avoid routine telopeptide use in CKD and interpret any abnormalities in that context with caution [^115hFkfw] [^114ScA79] [^11472FPr] [^111NfYtU] [^1165MgyM] [^115ZAQpa].

> Finally, I should confirm that my key thresholds and timelines are evidence-aligned. The LSC estimates of ~56% for CTX and ~38% for PINP derive from clinical trials and are appropriate for interpreting individual patient changes, while the 3–6 month early check-in is supported by guidelines and reflects the faster kinetics of resorption marker suppression relative to BMD changes; denosumab's rapid and profound CTX suppression within days is well-characterized in labeling and underpins its utility when rapid confirmation is desired [^113vtpat] [^115hFkfw] [^115f8DVU] [^116xxUkF].

Telopeptides (CTX, NTX) are **bone resorption markers** used to monitor osteoporosis therapy and assess bone turnover in metabolic bone diseases [^114WyUXr]. For CTX, collect fasting morning serum samples [^115hFkfw] to reduce diurnal and feeding variability; for NTX, use **second-morning urine** with creatinine correction [^111Twk2g]. Interpret results using assay-specific reference ranges and the least significant change (LSC) [^113eSPsx] to judge response: a CTX decrease > 30% from baseline indicates effective antiresorptive therapy [^11472FPr]; a rise > 30% during a drug holiday suggests resumption of therapy [^11472FPr]. Telopeptides are not diagnostic for osteoporosis and should be interpreted alongside clinical context and BMD [^114MMB42].

---

## Clinical indications for telopeptide measurement

Telopeptides are **primarily used** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Monitoring osteoporosis therapy**: Telopeptides, particularly CTX, are used to monitor the effectiveness of antiresorptive therapies such as bisphosphonates and denosumab [^114ScA79]. A significant reduction in CTX levels (> 30% from baseline) typically indicates effective suppression of bone resorption [^11472FPr].

- **Assessing bone turnover in metabolic bone diseases**: Telopeptides are useful in evaluating bone turnover in conditions such as Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism, and metastatic bone disease [^1165MgyM] [^116ExWVe].

- **Identifying secondary causes of osteoporosis**: Elevated telopeptide levels may indicate secondary osteoporosis due to conditions such as hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or glucocorticoid therapy [^116UmedF].

---

## Sample collection and preparation

Proper sample collection and preparation are **critical** for accurate telopeptide measurement:

| **Marker** | **Sample type** | **Collection conditions** | **Preparation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| CTX | Serum | - Fasting <br/> - Morning (8–10 am) | - Centrifuge within 2 hours <br/> - Freeze at -20°C if not analyzed immediately |
| NTX | Urine | Second morning void | - Centrifuge <br/> - Freeze at -20°C if not analyzed immediately |

---

Diurnal and feeding effects: CTX exhibits significant diurnal variation, with **higher levels in the morning** and lower in the afternoon; therefore, samples should be collected consistently in the morning [^111Twk2g]. Feeding transiently suppresses CTX; fasting samples are recommended to minimize variability [^115hFkfw].

---

## Analytical methods

Telopeptides are **typically measured** using immunoassays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and automated chemiluminescent immunoassays [^111A4ffd]. These methods are widely available and standardized, but results may vary between assays; therefore, it is essential to use the same assay consistently for longitudinal monitoring [^114ScA79].

---

## Interpretation of results

Interpretation of telopeptide results **should consider**:

- **Reference ranges**: Assay-specific reference ranges should be used, as values vary between assays and populations [^113eSPsx].

- **Least significant change (LSC)**: The LSC is the minimum change required to indicate a true biological response. For CTX, the LSC is approximately 30% [^11472FPr].

- **Clinical context**: Results should be interpreted alongside clinical factors, medication use, and other laboratory tests, such as bone mineral density (BMD) measurements [^115hFkfw].

---

## Clinical applications and limitations

### Clinical applications

- **Monitoring antiresorptive therapy**: CTX is useful for monitoring response to bisphosphonates and denosumab, with significant reductions indicating effective therapy [^114ScA79] [^116xxUkF].

- **Drug holidays**: CTX can guide decisions regarding bisphosphonate drug holidays, with rising levels indicating the need to resume therapy [^11472FPr].

- **Metabolic bone diseases**: Telopeptides are valuable in assessing disease activity and treatment response in Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism, and metastatic bone disease [^1165MgyM] [^111Twk2g] [^113uZt8v].

---

### Limitations

- **Variability**: Telopeptides are subject to biological and analytical variability, necessitating standardized collection conditions and consistent assay use [^111Twk2g].

- **Limited predictive value**: Telopeptides are not reliable predictors of fracture risk or bone loss in individuals [^116UmedF].

- **Not diagnostic**: Telopeptides cannot be used to diagnose osteoporosis and should be interpreted alongside clinical and radiological findings [^114MMB42].

## Practical use of telopeptides

| **Clinical scenario** | **Marker** | **Sample** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Monitoring antiresorptive therapy | CTX | Serum | Decrease > 30% indicates effective therapy |
| Drug holiday monitoring | CTX | Serum | Rise > 30% indicates need to resume therapy |
| Assessing bone turnover in metabolic bone diseases | CTX, NTX | Serum, urine | Elevated levels indicate high bone turnover |
| Identifying secondary osteoporosis | CTX, NTX | Serum, urine | Elevated levels suggest secondary causes |

---

Telopeptides are **useful for monitoring bone resorption** and therapy response, but results must be interpreted in context and with consistent methodology [^111NfYtU].

Essential points

Some bone turnover markers reflect bone formation (serum bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and procollagen I N-propeptide [PINP]) while others (serum C-telopeptides of type I collagen [CTX], tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 b [TRACP5b], and urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen [uNTX]) reflect bone resorption
Bone turnover markers are usually measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or automated immunoassay analyzers and correlate with other methods of assessing bone turnover, such as bone biopsies and radiotracer kinetics
Several sources of variability should be considered while interpreting bone turnover markers; some are uncontrollable such as age and gender but set conditions for sample collection such as fasting state and time of the day can reduce variability
Bone turnover markers can be used in the diagnosis and management of several bone diseases and systemic diseases affecting the skeleton
Bone turnover markers can be used in the management of osteoporosis and mineral bone disorder associated with chronic kidney disease

The use of bone turnover markers (BTMs) is widespread, both for research and for clinical practice. Much of the development of the markers commonly used today was completed more than 20 years ago. Since this time, a lot of experience has been gained on the sources of variability of these markers and their clinical utility. This review will consider the most used markers and how they compare with other approaches to studying bone turnover. The review will also consider how BTMs are best measured, the key sources of variability and how BTMs can be used in clinical practice.

The article begins with some considerations of bone physiology that are critical to an understanding of the clinical interpretation of bone turnover markers.

BTMs, such as C‐terminal telopeptide (CTX), also can be used in monitoring the effectiveness of osteoporosis therapy and guiding decisions about drug holidays or treatment reinitiation. CTX reflects the rate of bone resorption, and its levels typically decrease with effective antiresorptive treatment, such as bisphosphonates. A significant drop in CTX from pretreatment levels, defined as more than the least significant change of 30%, suggests that an antiresorptive therapy is effective in suppressing bone turnover. CTX levels also can be used to monitor drug holidays. A common approach involves comparing baseline (predrug holiday) levels with those during the drug holiday. Two potential thresholds for interpretation include a return to baseline levels (pretreatment) or an increase of more than 30% from the end‐of‐treatment levels. Our approach to these two thresholds can be summarized as follows: (1) a return to pretreatment baseline levels or higher (ie, before any bone active drug has been started), indicating complete loss of antiresorptive effect or (2) an increase of more than 30% (above the least significant change of most BTMs) from end‐of‐treatment levels, suggesting excessive bone loss. Measuring BTMs at 6 to 12 months after stopping bisphosphonates might allow clinicians to determine whether therapy should be restarted earlier than BMD alone would suggest, particularly in high‐risk patients. Other BTMs, including urinary N‐telopeptide, can be used in similar ways, albeit urinary turnover markers are more subject to diurnal variations.

CKD-MBD bone-derived turnover markers — collagen synthesis and breakdown — are addressed as follows: "In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, we suggest not to routinely measure bone-derived turnover markers of collagen synthesis (such as procollagen type 1 C-terminal pro-peptide) and breakdown (such as type 1 collagen cross-linked telopeptide, crosslaps, pyridinoline, or deoxypyridinoline) (2C)".

Objective: The development of these guidelines is sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres with published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Methods: Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of the clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines for guidelines protocols. Results: The Executive Summary of this 2020 updated guideline contains 52 recommendations: 21 Grade A (40%), 24 Grade B (46%), 7 Grade C (14%), and no Grade D (0%). These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuance-based clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world care of patients. The evidence base presented in the subsequent Appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update contains 368 citations: 123 (33.5%) evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 132 (36%) EL 2 (intermediate), 20 (5.5%) EL 3 (weak), and 93 (25%) EL 4 (lowest). New or updated topics in this CPG include: clarification of the diagnosis of osteoporosis, stratification of the patient according to high-risk and very-high-risk features, a new dual-action therapy option, and transitions from therapeutic options. Conclusion: This guideline is a practical tool for endocrinologists, physicians in general, regulatory bodies, health-related organizations, and interested laypersons regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis.

### Use of bone turnover markers in postmenopausal osteoporosis [^116UmedF]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Bone turnover comprises two processes: the removal of old bone (resorption) and the laying down of new bone (formation). N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) and C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) are markers of bone formation and resorption, respectively, that are recommended for clinical use. Bone turnover markers can be measured on several occasions in one individual with good precision. However, these markers are subject to several sources of variability, including feeding (resorption decreases) and recent fracture (all markers increase for several months). Bone turnover markers are not used for diagnosis of osteoporosis and do not improve prediction of bone loss or fracture within an individual. In untreated women, very high bone turnover marker concentrations suggest secondary causes of high bone turnover (eg, bone metastases or multiple myeloma). In people with osteoporosis, bone turnover markers might be useful to assess the response to anabolic and antiresorptive therapies, to assess compliance to therapy, or to indicate possible secondary osteoporosis. Much remains to be learnt about how bone turnover markers can be used to monitor the effect of stopping bisphosphonate therapy (eg, to identify a threshold above which restarting therapy should be considered). More studies are needed to investigate the use of bone turnover markers for assessment of the bone safety of new medications.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114MSuXa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Monitoring therapy — We suggest that clinicians monitor bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the spine and hip every 1–2 yr to assess the response to treatment, and if BMD appears to reach a plateau the frequency of BMD measurements may be reduced (2|⊕⊕○○). We suggest that clinicians consider measuring a bone turnover marker (BTM) at 3–6 months after initiation of treatment using a bone resorption marker [such as serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) or serum or urine N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX)] for antiresorptive therapy and a bone formation marker [such as serum procollagen I N-propeptide (PINP)] for anabolic therapy (2|⊕⊕○○).

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^116RJGJ7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Monitoring during osteoporosis therapy — In postmenopausal women with a low bone mineral density and at high risk of fractures who are being treated for osteoporosis, we suggest monitoring the bone mineral density by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at the spine and the hip every 1 to 3 years to assess the response to treatment. Monitoring bone turnover markers (serum C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide for antiresorptive therapy or procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide for bone anabolic therapy) is an alternative way of identifying poor response or nonadherence to therapy.

Denosumab — dosing interval, discontinuation effects, and hypocalcemia risk are characterized as follows: Doses "should not be delayed and should be administered on an every-6-month basis", and "Injections should be given every 6 (± 1) months". After discontinuation, "levels of serum C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide (CTX) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) increase above baseline values within 3 to 6 months", with bone mineral density returning "to pretreatment levels within 24 months", and "BMD declines by 18 to 24 months after treatment discontinuation"; missed dosing is "to be strictly avoided". The guideline quantifies hypocalcemia as a "decline in serum calcium to < 1.88 mmol/L or 7.6 mg/dL" with an estimated frequency of "∼0.05%… (2 of 4050 patients)" in large trials and "14% to 25%" in small studies of at‑risk subjects; "underlying CKD", "Vitamin D deficiency at baseline", and "higher rates of baseline bone turnover" may increase risk.

Laboratory workup — prediction

Ideally, predictive laboratory tests, such as bone turnover markers and genetic markers, may help with stratifying the risk for MRONJ, which in turn may help to determine whether to proceed with surgery and when, but there is insufficient evidence for current clinical application.
Since bone turnover markers may change over time, studies intended to assess the use of these tests as predictors for MRONJ are meaningful only if tested at the time of the tooth extraction in a prospective manner. Secondly, the sample size should have sufficient power to reflect the prevalence of MRONJ per the patient population (cancer versus osteoporosis). Readers are advised to carefully interpret the results of clinical trials or of systematic reviews that include mixed methodology studies in respect to the study design described above.
The bone turnover marker C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) has been reported to predict MRONJ development. CTX values lower than 150 pg/mL reportedly correlate with a higher risk for MRONJ development in patients treated with bisphosphonates.
There is no evidence for the potential of CTX as a MRONJ predictive tool in patients treated with denosumab.
The search for predictive tools continues, including research on serologic tests, salivary proteomics, and biogenetic markers. The translation of these findings into practical tools is challenging and relies on the commercialization of these tests.

CTX is usually measured (in the beta form) in plasma (or serum) as the form in urine shows very large day-to-day variability. NTX is usually measured in urine and expressed as a ratio to creatinine to adjust for urinary dilution. The assay for serum NTX shows smaller changes in response to antiresorptive therapy given for osteoporosis and so it has not been widely adopted. Plasma (or serum) CTX has been recommended by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) as a reference marker. It correlates modestly with osteoclast surface by bone histomorphometry in the endocortical bone (r = 0.35) and the cancellous bone (r = 0.24).

The urinary excretion of the urinary pyridinium crosslinks have been widely used for the study of bone resorption. Deoxypyridinoline is more specific to bone than pyridinoline, although it is less abundant. The total deoxypyridinoline correlates well with bone resorption measured using radiotracer techniques. It is less used today as the assay is cumbersome; it requires acid hydrolysis of urine followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and so it is a difficult and time-consuming assay. The free form of deoxypyridinoline and pyridinoline can be measured in the urine by ELISA. However, this free form does not respond as expected to antiresorptive treatment of osteoporosis, perhaps because bisphosphonates affect renal handling of peptide-bound crosslinks and their conversion to the free crosslink forms.

There are other analytes that have been used to assess bone resorption that are based on the degradation of type I collagen. Hydroxyproline assays were the first to be introduced but are no longer used (see above). Galactosyl hydroxylysine can be measured in the urine or serum but it is not widely used as it requires HPLC. Cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) is also called CTX-MMP; it is a cross-linked fragment of collagen like CTX but it is generated by metalloproteinases rather than by cathepsin K, as is CTX. ICTP has not become widely used as it does not respond to most antiresorptive therapies and the assays are no longer available.

CTX and NTX

There is crosslinking between adjacent collagen molecules during the synthesis of type I procollagen, as noted above (under PINP). These crosslinks are usually the pyridinium crosslinks, pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline. The crosslinks form between 2 chains of the helix and 2 chains of the telopeptide region (Fig. 7). The telopeptide region is the end of the collagen molecule and there are a N-telopeptide and a C-telopeptide regions. There are 2 sites on the helix which undergo such crosslinking. At position 87 on the helix, the crosslink joins to the C-telopeptide region. At position 930 on the helix, the crosslink joins to the N-telopeptide region.

Figure 7.
Type I collagen breakdown products as markers of bone resorption. Type I collagen molecules in the bone matrix are linked by pyridinoline crosslinks (pyridinoline [Pyr] or deoxypyridinoline [D-Pyr]) in the region of N- and C-telopeptides, Pyr differs from D-Pyr by the presence of an hydroxyl residue shown in italics. During osteoclastic bone resorption, pyridinoline crosslinks are released the circulation and then excreted in urine as a free form or linked to C- (CTX) or N-telopeptides (NTX) of type I collagen Free Pyr, free D-Pyr, CTX, and NTX can be measured in urine and serum using specific immunoassays. Reprinted from Ballieres Clin Rheumatol, vol 11, Bone Markers, pages 517–37, © 1997 Elsevier, with permission from Elsevier.

When CTX and NTX are first formed, the amino acid sequence is linear and in the usual alpha configuration. After a few months, the CTX undergoes beta-isomerization which means peptide backbone originally linked to the alpha carbon of the aspartic acid residue moves (non-enzymatically) to the beta-carbon. This isomerization does not happen with NTX. During bone resorption by the osteoclast, the type I collagen is digested by enzymes such as cathepsin K and CTX and NTX are released and can be measured in the circulation or the urine. The alpha and beta forms can both be measured in the urine by ELISA. The alpha reflects newly synthesized collagen, as is found in high turnover states such as Paget's disease or malignant bone disease or in children. The beta form reflects more mature collagen and is more abundant in disorders such as osteoporosis or in healthy adults.

These approaches were evaluated in the TRIO study, where the effect of 3 oral bisphosphonates (ibandronate, alendronate, and risedronate) on postmenopausal osteoporotic women was studied. In this clinical trial, at least 70% of women achieved a good response for CTX and PINP. The magnitude of response was greater for alendronate and ibandronate than for risedronate. The LSC used was 56% for CTX and 38% for PINP (Fig. 21).

In everyday clinical practice, it has been suggested that patients having a decrease in PINP values of more than 10 μg/L (LSC) or to below 35 μg/L (geometrical mean) are considered as responders. As regards to CTX, the respective values should be 100 ng/L or 280 ng/L. The benefit of using PINP, as mentioned above, is that the sample can be taken at any point in the day and fasting is not required. On the other hand, CTX changes seem to occur earlier during the treatment course. When using these thresholds, patients can be divided into responders and nonresponders. In the case of nonresponders, the clinician should check the adherence to treatment, carry out investigations for secondary osteoporosis, and consider conditions of poor drug absorption. In some cases, change to an intravenous medication like zoledronate or ibandronate might be more appropriate. An algorithm suggested was to measure BTMs at baseline, check compliance at month 1, and repeat the BTM measurement at month 6. If there is a response (as defined above), then further monitoring is advised at year 5 (BMD measurement), to consider a pause in treatment.

### Inhibitory characteristics of citrullinated telopeptides of type I and II collagens for autoantibody binding in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^113cUFCh]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To study how soluble citrullinated telopeptides of type I and II collagens inhibit the binding of autoantibodies to the respective antigens immobilized onto solid phase, and to use modifications of previous methods to re-analyse rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and control serum samples.

Methods

Autoantibody binding was inhibited with normal or citrullinated carboxytelopeptides using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Serum samples were available from 120 patients with RA and 81 controls.

Results

Autoantibodies that bind normal C-telopeptides were not inhibited with soluble normal or citrullinated telopeptides. However, the antibodies that bind only citrullinated telopeptides could be inhibited with corresponding citrullinated telopeptides. Thus, it is not necessary to study the binding of autoantibodies to normal collagens if the specificity of their binding is assessed by immunological inhibition. For type I telopeptide, there are two arginines, the latter of which, when citrullinated, is important for binding. For type II telopeptide, there is one arginine, which is important when citrullinated. The other amino acids, e.g. the last alanine, have only a slight effect on binding. These improved methods differentiate better between RA patients, who have specific citrullinated autoantibodies, and controls than previous ELISA methods.

Conclusions

Based on inhibition assay, it is possible to measure the autoantibodies binding specifically to citrullinated telopeptides of type I and II collagens. When only one assay is involved, variance is decreased and the overall performance is easier than before.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^116uHWyN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-estrogens

Anti-estrogen therapy (aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen) is used in breast cancer treatment. Despite their common anti-estrogen activity, aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen have opposite effects on bone turnover. Aromatization is a key step in estrogen production and aromatase inhibitors reduce estrogen levels by 90%. This results in bone loss and an increase in bone turnover. Data from clinical trials have shown that aromatase inhibitors are effective in the secondary prevention of breast cancer, but this effect is associated with an increase in the risk of fractures, especially at the spine. In a trial with nonosteoporotic postmenopausal women, 1 year of anastrozole use resulted in an increase in CTX (26%), uNTX (15%), PINP (18%), and bone ALP (20%). In contrast, tamoxifen use was associated with a decrease in BTMs. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has anti-estrogen effects on the breast tissue but estrogen-like effects on bone. Therefore, tamoxifen leads to a decrease in bone turnover and favorable effects in BMD. In the same trial, treatment with tamoxifen was associated with a decrease in BTMs; CTX was decreased by 56%, uNTX by 52%, PINP by 72%, and bone ALP by 16%. The decrease in BTMs was also observed in the group that received the combined therapy (anastrozole and tamoxifen) (Fig. 19).

### Reference values of bone stiffness index and C-terminal telopeptide in healthy European children [^113J9fsz]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Quantitative ultrasound measurements and bone metabolic markers can help to monitor bone health and to detect impaired skeletal development. Population-based reference values for children may serve as a basis for preventive measures to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures in later life. This is the first paper providing age-, sex- and height-specific reference values for bone stiffness index (SI) and serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) in healthy, apparently prepubertal children.

Subjects/Methods

In the population-based IDEFICS baseline survey (2007–2008) and follow-up (2009–2010), 18,745 children from eight European countries were newly recruited. A total of 10,791 2–10.9-year-old and 1646 3–8.9-year-old healthy children provided data on SI of the right and left calcaneus and serum CTX, respectively. Furthermore, height and weight were measured. Percentile curves were calculated using the General Additive Model for Location Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) to model the distribution of SI and CTX depending on multiple covariates while accounting for dispersion, skewness, and the kurtosis of this distribution.

Results

SI was negatively associated with age and height in children aged 2–5 years, whereas a positive association was observed in children aged 6–10 years. The dip in SI occurred at older age for higher SI percentiles and was observed earlier in taller children than in smaller children. The CTX reference curves showed a linear-positive association with age and height. No major sex differences were observed for the SI and CTX reference values.

Conclusion

These reference data lay the ground to evaluate bone growth and metabolism in prepubertal children in epidemiological and clinical settings. They may also inform clinical practice to monitor skeletal development and to assess adverse drug reactions during medical treatments.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1165MgyM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — monitoring response, remission targets, relapse assessment, and monostotic disease guidance includes that if there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, we suggest the use of short-term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely; we suggest that patients who have osteolytic lesions have a repeat x-ray approximately 1 year after radiological diagnosis, with subsequent x-rays considered in the event of persistent elevations of biochemical markers of bone turnover or the presence of bone pain and to determine when there is resolution of the lesion; to maximize the duration of remission, we suggest that bone turnover should be reduced below the midpoint of the reference range for the chosen monitoring bone turnover marker; in patients with increased bone turnover, we recommend that biochemical follow-up be used as a more objective indicator of relapse than symptoms; and for untreated monostotic disease, we suggest that amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) or bone-specific ALP (BSAP) and βCterminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (βCTx) or N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx) should be used for assessing activity, although these may be normal when evidence of disease activity is still clearly demonstrated on scintigraphy.

### Biochemical assessment of Paget's disease of bone [^1162duFs]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2006). Low credibility.

Biochemical measurements of bone turnover provide an objective assessment of disease activity and the response to treatment. Alkaline phosphatase is the best characterized of the bone turnover markers and reflects the extent and activity of Paget's disease. However, in addition to bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (Bone ALP), there is also osteocalcin (OC) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) as formation markers. A variety of telopeptides (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, [CTX], N-telopeptide of type I collagen [NTX]) or cross-link breakdown products of type 1 collagen can be used to assess bone resorption. Total alkaline phosphatase (Total ALP), Bone ALP, and P1NP all perform similarly in diagnosis and in evaluating the response to treatment, but the general availability, low interassay variation, and inexpensiveness of Total ALP makes it the best test for routine use. Measurement of the biological variability of the different markers in stable, untreated Paget's disease indicates how great a change (critical difference) is needed to define a true alteration in disease activity. Bone ALP, P1NP, and NTX show the highest therapy induced change/critical difference ratio during antiresorptive treatment. Some of the resorption markers show more complex changes in response to treatment. Pyridinoline (PYD) or deoxypyridinoline (DPD) cross-links of type 1 collagen are excreted in urine either as free or as peptide bound moieties, but it is the latter which decrease by the greatest amount in response to bisphosphonate therapy. Newly formed type 1 collagen contains an aspartyl-glycine motif (alphaCTX), which undergoes spontaneous isoaspartyl formation to betaCTX as the bone ages. In untreated Paget's disease, the alphaCTX is raised proportionately more (16-fold) than betaCTX (3-fold) and decreases in response to bisphosphonate therapy to a greater extent than betaCTX (measured in the sCTX assay). As bisphosphonates have become more potent, the aim of treatment has shifted toward the achievement of a rate of bone turnover in the lower part of the reference range. This is important because the duration of remission of disease activity is strongly determined by the post treatment nadir bone turnover.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111CWfb9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — biochemical markers for monitoring (Appendix): Analytical and biological variation and the least significant change (LSC) guide interpretation of serial markers; automated platforms perform better than manual methods and serum markers show lower within-subject variability than urine. The best marker shows a substantial decrease with treatment when expressed as a ratio to the LSC, and BSAP, PINP, and NTx show the largest ratio of change/LSC ratio during antiresorptive treatment. Total ALP is a cost-effective test for routine monitoring, with any additional marker use depending on patient characteristics, local availability, and cost. During treatment of monostotic disease, sensitivity is best assessed by expressing the decrease in turnover as a ratio to the LSC; in this respect, BSAP shows a much better response than total ALP, P1NP may be useful for monitoring with a ratio of > 2, and current resorption markers are less useful, with only NTx having a ratio > 1 while hydroxyproline, serum CTx, and urinary CTx had ratios less than unity. Treatment-induced changes in biochemical measurements, often within the reference range, require understanding of measurement precision and reproducibility for proper evaluation.

### A prognostic index model for predicting overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone acetate after docetaxel [^11612HKY]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Applications of the model include the homogenization of the risk of death of patients to be enrolled in clinical trials and may be a useful tool in addition to treatment guidelines to help physicians determine appropriate follow-up and monitoring of patients with poor prognosis. The St Gallen conference guidelines recommend baseline examinations that measure the readily available factors that were included in our analysis. Some factors, such as duration of initial androgen-deprivation therapy and established prognostic factors, like hemoglobin, LDH and ALP, could potentially aid in prognostic stratification of patients with mCRPC, but their value in guiding treatment decisions is not well established. Prospective studies are needed to determine the utility of the model for selecting therapies for patients with mCRPC and poor prognostic factors.

We purposefully developed this model using continuous variables dichotomously and weighting each risk factor equally in order to facilitate ease of use in the clinic. Prognostic models employing an index design similar to that developed here have seen widespread application in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer to classify patients into prognostic risk groups and in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to classify risk of death, complete response and relapse risk. These prognostic indices have evolved over time to incorporate changes in treatment and contemporary outcomes. Armstrong et al. and Halabi et al. developed prognostic nomograms in the post-docetaxel and first- and second-line chemotherapy mCRPC settings, and identified several similar pretreatment clinical prognostic factors that are associated with survival. More recent studies of docetaxel for mCRPC report greater survival than previous studies; however, these do not account for the introduction of recent life-prolonging therapies. Other prognostic factors warranting further study include bone-associated biomarkers, bone-specific ALP and urinary N-telopeptide, although these factors are not usually obtained in routine practice. Enumeration of circulating tumor cells with the Veridex system and of androgen levels as determined by ultrasensitive assays have also been identified as independently prognostic in patients with mCRPC treated with abiraterone–prednisone; these tests were not included in the development of this model because they are not routinely carried out or widely available.

conclusion

We have developed a contemporary prognostic index model, composed of six routinely available and readily assessable factors, that categorizes patients with mCRPC treated with abiraterone–prednisone into distinct risk groups. Further external validation of our model is required. This model could be useful in clinical practice to aid in the determination of patient prognosis so that follow-up and monitoring may be planned accordingly, and may aid in patient stratification in clinical trials.

### Traditional and novel bone remodeling markers in premenopausal and postmenopausal women [^114vK2cu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Bone turnover markers (BTMs) may identify changes in bone remodeling within a relatively short time interval before changes in bone mineral density can be detected. New markers such as osteoprotegerin, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, and sclerostin have emerged, but there is little information about their potential use in clinical practice.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of several BTMs to predict bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women and to monitor the efficacy of treatment in osteoporotic women.

Design, Patients, and Setting

We performed an observational prospective study in pre- and postmenopausal ambulatory women (n = 72 and n = 152, respectively).

Intervention

Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (n = 18) were treated with risedronate and calcium. Women filled out a questionnaire and underwent bone mineral density measurement using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the time of enrollment and after 1 year of follow-up. BTMs were measured at baseline, at 6 months, and after 1 year.

Results

Increased levels of N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP) and β-type I collagen telopeptides (CTXs) were associated with low bone mineral density in the premenopausal (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively) and postmenopausal (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02) groups. The best analytical performance to diagnose osteoporosis was for β-CTX, osteocalcin, and P1NP, with areas under the curve of 0.70 (P = 0.005), 0.64 (P = 0.048), and 0.71 (P = 0.003). A significant decrease was found in P1NP, osteocalcin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b, β-CTX, and bone alkaline phosphatase after 1 year of treatment (all P < .05).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that measurement of β-CTX and P1NP shows adequate analytical performance and could potentially be included in algorithms for the screening of osteoporosis. Furthermore, these two markers, along with osteocalcin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b, are useful to monitor the response to risedronate.

### Developing a toolkit for the assessment and monitoring of musculoskeletal ageing [^111eNd97]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical biomarkers of musculoskeletal ageing

Biochemical biomarkers are markers measurable in situ or ex vivo in biofluid samples and tissue biopsies (e.g. precursor, product, enzyme, metabolite or regulatory molecule such as non-coding RNA) that are produced in, or released from, a tissue and that are reasonably specific for a characteristic process or cell in that tissue.

Bone biochemical biomarkers

Bone biochemical biomarkers — recommendations for the toolkit

Two well-established serum markers of bone turnover are recommended for the toolkit:
N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), which has little diurnal rhythm and shows a large increase during fracture healing.
C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of collagen type I (CTX, also known as CTX-I), which shows a marked diurnal rhythm with highest concentrations in the early morning and a nadir in the afternoon.

Five further markers of bone turnover are potential future candidates: osteocalcin; bone alkaline phosphatase; N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of collagen type I (NTX); carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen generated by matrix metalloproteinases (ICTP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRACP5b, also known as TRACP5b).

Bone turnover markers

There are no biochemical markers of bone mass or density per se. Bone turnover markers comprise markers of bone formation: the osteoblast matrix protein, osteocalcin; the C- and N-terminal pro-peptides of type I procollagen (PICP, PINP), and the enzyme, bone alkaline phosphatase; and markers of bone resorption: the collagen degradation products, pyridinium cross-links of collagen, deoxypyridinoline (DPD), CTX-I, NTX-I, and ICTP, and the enzyme TRACP5b.

In older women, high levels of these markers are associated with greater fracture risk, faster rates of bone loss, and a greater response to anti-resorptive and anabolic treatment, while in both men and women they decrease with anti-resorptive therapy and increase with anabolic therapy. They may also be used in assessing growth, adaptation of the maternal skeleton to pregnancy, and the effects of drugs and of metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis, Paget's disease and osteomalacia.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116ehLjD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — leptin and metreleptin clinical data: In a small study of women with FHA, subcutaneous recombinant human leptin (n = 8) vs no treatment (n = 6) for 2 to 3 months in participants with stable weight within 15% of ideal body weight for 6 months or more prior to enrollment increased mean LH levels and pulse frequency after 2 weeks and improved ovarian parameters and E2 by 3 months, with three patients experiencing an ovulatory cycle; leptin increased several anabolic and bone markers without increasing cortisol, corticotropin, or urinary N-terminal telopeptides, but subjective reductions in appetite with significant decreases in weight and fat mass were reported, while controls had no significant changes. In a follow-up trial of exercise-associated FHA, seven of 10 women recovered menses after a 9-month metreleptin period vs two of nine on placebo, BMD differences were not found though bone mineral content increased in the treatment group; after a 3-month washout, six subjects continued open-label metreleptin for another 12 months, and lumbar spine BMD and bone mineral content increased with ranges 2.2% to 10.8% and 1.4% to 6.5% from baseline in the four subjects completing the 2-year intervention.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114ML4ck]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — bone turnover marker (BTM) monitoring during therapy notes that BTM response may account for 30–75% of fracture risk reduction with standard treatments and that the magnitude of the BTM response is associated with the level of compliance. Some experts recommend measuring a BTM before and 3–6 months after starting treatment. Urine NTX or serum CTX can be used to monitor antiresorptive treatment; PINP or b-ALP can be used to monitor anabolic treatment. If the change in markers exceeds the least significant change (~40%; see 4.2, Remarks), then the goal has been met. Because publications on the association of BTMs and fracture risk reduction are in women (and not in men), there is some disagreement among experts; in women, low fracture risk on treatment is associated with BTMs below the median of the reference interval for young women, which could be a target for men, but has not yet been studied. If markers do not change, options include questioning medication compliance, considering causes of secondary osteoporosis, or changing the medication or its route of administration.

### The use of biochemical markers of bone remodeling in multiple myeloma: a report of the international myeloma working group [^112jZKPj]. Leukemia (2010). Low credibility.

Lytic bone disease is a frequent complication of multiple myeloma (MM). Lytic lesions rarely heal and X-rays are of limited value in monitoring bone destruction during anti-myeloma or anti-resorptive treatment. Biochemical markers of bone resorption (amino- and carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX and CTX, respectively) or CTX generated by matrix metalloproteinases (ICTP)) and bone formation provide information on bone dynamics and reflect disease activity in bone. These markers have been investigated as tools for evaluating the extent of bone disease, risk of skeletal morbidity and response to anti-resorptive treatment in MM. Urinary NTX, serum CTX and serum ICTP are elevated in myeloma patients with osteolytic lesions and correlate with advanced disease stage. Furthermore, urinary NTX and serum ICTP correlate with risk for skeletal complications, disease progression and overall survival. Bone markers have also been used for the early diagnosis of bone lesions. This International Myeloma Working Group report summarizes the existing data for the role of bone markers in assessing the extent of MM bone disease and in monitoring bone turnover during anti-myeloma therapies and provides information on novel markers that may be of particular interest in the near future.

North American Menopause Society position statement — biochemical markers of bone turnover explains that bone turnover markers are serum tests reflecting resorption (fasting serum C‑telopeptide of type I collagen) or formation (bone‑specific alkaline phosphatase or serum procollagen type I N‑terminal propeptide); these markers cannot diagnose osteoporosis and have varying ability to predict.

### Circulating cardiac biomarkers in diabetes mellitus: a new dawn for risk stratification – A narrative review [^112gJUJh]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although conventional cardiac biomarkers, such as NPs, sST2, cardiac troponins and galectin-3, can be useful for ascertaining CV risk in patients with prediabetes and T2DM, there are confusing reports regarding their ability to be prognostically relevant among patients without known CV disease. There have been many cohort clinical studies with small sample sizes in which the higher predictive power of these biomarkers for CV death and MACEs in patients with metabolic diseases was determined, but large clinical trials have not demonstrated significant results in this context. This is perhaps related to mixed patient cohorts (having and not having CV diseases) enrolled in the studies for which positive predictive values of biomarkers were sufficiently distinguished. Another cause is the significant difference in the quality of the studies. Therefore, numerous results were obtained from post hoc data analyses, and they were not given during prospective observation even when a large sample size was presented. Most positive findings regarding independent prediction of CV death, MACEs and HF in prediabetes and T2DM populations were obtained for NPs and hs-cTn I/T, whereas other cardiac biomarkers did not frequently show independent power in individuals without known CV disease. These discrepancies urged investigations of new biomarkers, such as GDF15, H-FABR, CT-1, carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type 1, apelin and miRNAs as well as multiple biomarker predictive scores. Finally, NPs and hs-cTnT continue to be the most important tools with an affordable price as well as high sensitivity and specificity to predict clinical outcomes among patients with pre-DM and DM in routine clinical practice, but other circulating biomarkers need to be carefully investigated in large trials in the future.

### Definition of reference ranges for β-isomerized carboxy-terminal telopeptide collagen type I for children and adolescents [^116Z1nxm]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bone metabolism involves many complex pathways that are disturbed by several bone diseases. The literature shows some limitations concerning pediatric reference intervals to bone markers, mainly because of the low number of patients included in the studies, the heterogeneity of methods, beyond the fact that it is time-consuming and expensive. The aim of this study was to determine reference values for β-isomerized carboxy-terminal telopeptides collagen type I (β-CTX), a marker of bone resorption, for children and adolescents.

Methods

Blood samples from 246 patients were collected and β-CTX was measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLI).

Results and Conclusions

We propose reference ranges for β-CTX concentration from the 2.5 percentile and 97.5 percentile for each age group. The reference values obtained, concerning children and adolescents, might be useful in the evaluation of diseases such as osteosarcoma and anorexia in both childhood as adolescence.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115xhVeX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — bone turnover markers for assessing treatment response: If there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, we suggest the use of short- term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely. (2|⊕⊕◯◯) Resorption markers such as βCTX fall rapidly with potent bisphosphonates, reaching a nadir value at 10 days, whereas formation markers such as total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are slower, reaching a nadir at about 2 to 3 months, and the short-term (10-d) reduction in markers such as urinary NTX correlates with the final post-treatment ALP. For most patients, measurement of total ALP or other baseline disease activity markers at 6 to12 weeks is an acceptable and cost-effective option, and maximal suppression of high bone turnover may require measurement at 6 months.

### Potential usefulness of BMD and bone turnover monitoring of zoledronic acid therapy among women with osteoporosis: secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial data [^11125RH4]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the clinical validity and the detectability of response of short-term changes in bone mineral density (BMD; hip and spine) and bone turnover markers (serum PINP and CTX) through secondary analysis of trial data. We analyzed data on 7765 women with osteoporosis randomized to 5-mg once-yearly infusions of zoledronic acid or placebo in the Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence with Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly Pivotal Fracture Trial (HORIZON-PFT; trial ran from 2002 to 2006) and the first extension trial (trial ran from 2006 to 2009). We assessed the clinical validity and detectability of response for 1-year measurements of the following monitoring tests: total hip and lumbar spine BMD, serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (sPINP), and serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen (sCTX; 6-month measurement used). Clinical validity was assessed by examining prediction of clinical fracture in Cox models; detectability of response to treatment was assessed by the ratio of signal to noise, estimated from the distributions of change in zoledronic acid and placebo groups. Baseline measurements were available for 7683 women with hip BMD, 558 with spine BMD, 1246 with sPINP, and 517 women with sCTX. Hip BMD and sPINP ranked highly for prediction of clinical fracture, whereas sPINP and sCTX ranked highly for detectability of response to treatment. Serum PINP had the highest overall ranking. In conclusion, serum PINP is potentially useful in monitoring response to zoledronic acid. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of monitoring PINP on treatment decisions and other clinically relevant outcomes. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Bone loss and the aromatase inhibitors [^113ZPvTC]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Small short-term studies have shown that letrozole has an impact on markers of bone turnover.found that C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), a marker of bone resorption, increased from a mean of 2300 to 2828 after 3 months of letrozole therapy (P < 0.005). Over a 12-week period, found that letrozole therapy reduced the bone formation marker, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), by 20.1% while the bone resorption marker CTX increased by 11.4%. The study also investigated the impact of exemestane on bone turnover as discussed below.

The ZOFAST study is presently recruiting postmenopausal breast cancer patients with normal bone density. Patients are treated with letrozole and randomised to either immediate intravenous zoledronate or to a delayed phase of treatment based on changes in BMD. Subsequent DXA scans will determine if zoledronate can prevent bone loss in these patients and when they should be considered for treatment with a bisphosphonate. Initial results from the study were reported at the end of 2004, with 587 patients having baseline BMD data. At that point, there was a 3.33% difference in lumbar spine BMD in favour of upfront treatment with zoledronate and a 2.42% difference in favour of upfront treatment with total hip BMD.

### Denosumab treatment of prostate cancer with bone metastases and increased urine N-telopeptide levels after therapy with intravenous bisphosphonates: results of a randomized phase II trial [^1136ZE5P]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with bone metastases have high rates of RANKL driven bone resorption and an increased risk of skeletal morbidity. Osteoclast mediated bone resorption can be assessed by measuring urine N-telopeptide and can be inhibited by denosumab, a fully human antibody against RANKL.

Materials and Methods

Eligible patients (111) had bone metastases from prostate cancer, other solid tumors or multiple myeloma, 1 or more bone lesions and urine N-telopeptide greater than 50 nM bone collagen equivalents per mM creatinine (urine N-telopeptide greater than 50) despite the use of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients were stratified by cancer type and screening urine N-telopeptide, and randomized to continue intravenous bisphosphonates every 4 weeks or receive 180 mg subcutaneous denosumab every 4 weeks or 180 mg every 12 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with urine N-telopeptide less than 50 at week 13. We report the efficacy results for the subset of patients with prostate cancer.

Results

Patients with prostate cancer represented 45% (50 of 111) of the study population. At week 13, 22 of 32 (69%) patients in the denosumab arms had urine N-telopeptide less than 50 vs 3 of 16 (19%) in the intravenous bisphosphonates cohort. At week 25, 22 of 32 (69%) denosumab treated patients continued to have urine N-telopeptide less than 50 vs 5 of 16 (31%) treated with intravenous bisphosphonates. Grade 4, asymptomatic, reversible hypophosphatemia, possibly related to denosumab, was reported in 1 patient.

Conclusions

In patients with prostate cancer related bone metastases and increased urine N-telopeptide despite intravenous bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab normalized urine N-telopeptide levels more frequently than ongoing intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Denosumab (Jubbonti) [^115f8DVU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Denosumab products bind to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Denosumab products prevent RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In clinical studies, treatment with 60 mg of denosumab resulted in reduction in the bone resorption marker serum type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) by approximately 85% by 3 days, with maximal reductions occurring by 1 month. CTX levels were below the limit of assay quantitation (0.049 ng/mL) in 39% to 68% of patients 1 to 3 months after dosing of denosumab. At the end of each dosing interval, CTX reductions were partially attenuated from a maximal reduction of ≥ 87% to ≥ 45% (range: 45% to 80%), as serum denosumab levels diminished, reflecting the reversibility of the effects of denosumab on bone remodeling. These effects were sustained with continued treatment. Upon reinitiation, the degree of inhibition of CTX by denosumab was similar to that observed in patients initiating denosumab treatment.

Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [P1NP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of denosumab. After discontinuation of denosumab therapy, markers of bone resorption increased to levels 40% to 60% above pretreatment values but returned to baseline levels within 12 months.

### Bone turnover markers are not associated with hip fracture risk: a case-control study in the women's health initiative [^111s16jh]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and serum procollagen type 1 aminoterminal propeptide (PINP), measured by standardized assays, be used as reference markers in observational and interventional studies. However, there are limited data to determine whether serum CTX and PINP are associated with hip fracture risk among postmenopausal women. We determined the associations of serum CTX and serum PINP with hip fracture risk among postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years at baseline. We performed a prospective case-control study (400 cases, 400 controls) nested in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, which enrolled participants at 40 US clinical centers. Cases were women with incident hip fracture not taking osteoporosis medication; hip fractures were confirmed using medical records. Untreated controls were matched by age, race/ethnicity, and date of blood sampling. Serum CTX and serum PINP were analyzed on 12-hour fasting blood samples. The main outcome measure was incident hip fracture risk (mean follow-up 7.13 years). After adjustment for body mass index, smoking, frequency of falls, history of fracture, calcium and vitamin D intake, and other relevant covariates, neither serum CTX level nor serum PINP level was statistically significantly associated with hip fracture risk (CTX p trend = 0.22, PINP p trend = 0.53). Our results do not support the utility of serum CTX level or PINP level to predict hip fracture risk in women in this age group. These results will inform future guidelines regarding the potential utility of these markers in fracture prediction. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Denosumab (Conexxence) [^115RFsCH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

In a study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers (n = 73, age range: 18 to 64 years) following a single subcutaneously administered denosumab dose of 60 mg, the mean area-under-the-concentration-time curve up to 16 weeks (AUC0–16 weeks) of denosumab was 316 mcg⋅day/mL (standard deviation [SD] = 101 mcg⋅day/mL). The mean maximum denosumab concentration (Cmax) was 6.75 mcg/mL (SD = 1.89 mcg/mL). No accumulation or change in denosumab pharmacokinetics with time is observed with multiple dosing of 60 mg subcutaneously administered once every 6 months.

### Bone resorption predicts for skeletal complications in metastatic bone disease [^116ExWVe]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Relationships between the rate of bone resorption (measured by urinary N-telopeptide (Ntx) excretion) and a range of skeletal complications have been evaluated in patients with metastatic bone disease. A total of 121 patients had monthly measurements of Ntx during treatment with bisphosphonates. All skeletal-related events, plus hospital admissions for bone pain and death during the period of observation, were recorded. Data were available for 121 patients over the first 3-month period of monitoring (0–3 months) and 95 patients over the second 3-month period (4–6 months). N-telopeptide levels were correlated with the number of skeletal-related events and/or death (r = 0.62, P < 0.001 for 0–3 months and r = 0.46, P < 0.001 for 4–6 months, respectively). Patients with baseline Ntx values ⩾100 nmol mmol −1 creatinine (representing clearly accelerated bone resorption) were 19.48 times (95% CI 7.55, 50.22) more likely to experience a skeletal-related event/death during the first 3 months than those with Ntx < 100 (P < 0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression model, Ntx was highly predictive for events/death. This study is the first to indicate a strong correlation between the rate of bone resorption and the frequency of skeletal complications in metastatic bone disease. N-telopeptide appears useful in the prediction of patients most likely to experience skeletal complications and thus benefit from bisphosphonate treatment.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^111LNEjD]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute Charcot arthropathy and osteomyelitis — diagnostic approach emphasizes that in a warm, edematous, erythematous, insensate foot, plain radiographs are invaluable in ascertaining presence of osteoarthropathy and, in most cases, no further imaging studies are required, but with a concomitant wound it may be difficult to differentiate acute Charcot arthropathy from osteomyelitis using plain radiographs alone; laboratory studies note that the white blood cell count with a left shift will often be elevated in acute osteomyelitis, whereas erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are often nonspecific; technetium bone scans are generally nonspecific while indium scanning has been shown to be more specific, and additional studies include Tc HMPAO-labeled whole blood cell scans, MRI, and PET scanning; bone biopsy is the most specific method to distinguish osteomyelitis from osteoarthropathy, and a biopsy consisting of multiple shards of bone and soft tissue embedded in deep synovium is pathognomonic for neuropathic osteoarthropathy; other serologic support includes that 1CTP (carboxyterminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen) is elevated without increased PICP, but maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion in a neuropathic patient with a swollen or deformed foot remains most important.

### Rechallenge of patients who had discontinued alendronate therapy because of upper gastrointestinal symptoms [^115hcYPB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2000). Low credibility.

Background

There have been reports from physicians in clinical practice that up to 30% of patients taking bisphosphonate therapy develop upper gastrointestinal (UGI) symptoms, many or most of which they assume to be related to the drug. However, in several large placebo-controlled clinical trials of bisphosphonates, the incidence of UGI symptoms has been ≥ 30%, even among patients receiving placebo, perhaps reflecting a high background incidence of UGI events in osteoporotic patients.

Objective

To assess the relationship between alendronate treatment and UGI complaints in patients who had discontinued treatment with alendronate in clinical practice because of UGI symptoms, we compared the incidence of such events on rechallenge with alendronate or placebo.

Methods

This was a multicenter, double-blind trial in which postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who had previously discontinued alendronate therapy because of a UGI adverse experience were randomized to daily treatment with either alendronate 10 mg or matching placebo (1:1 ratio) for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of discontinuations due to any UGI adverse experience. Secondary end points were the incidence of any clinical adverse experiences and the percentage change from baseline in urinary N-telopeptide adjusted for urinary creatinine at week 8.

Results

A total of 172 women were included in the study. They were a mean of 20.9 years past menopause, ranging in age from 41 to 90 years (mean, 67.0 years); 90.7% were white. On rechallenge, 14.8% (13/88) of patients in the alendronate group and 16.7% (14/84) in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of UGI adverse experiences.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that many UGI adverse experiences reported during therapy with alendronate may reflect a high background incidence of UGI complaints and an increased sensitivity to detection of such complaints, rather than a causal relationship to therapy.

### Zoledronic acid (reclast) [^116jfZRH]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Reclast is a bisphosphonate and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously administered zoledronic acid rapidly partitions to bone and localizes preferentially at sites of high bone turnover. The main molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. The relatively long duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its high binding affinity to bone mineral.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In the osteoporosis treatment trial, the effect of Reclast treatment on markers of bone resorption (serum beta-C-telopeptides [b-CTx]) and bone formation (bone specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP], serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen [P1NP]) was evaluated in patients (subsets ranging from 517 to 1246 patients) at periodic intervals. Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of Reclast reduces bone turnover markers to the pre-menopausal range with an approximate 55% reduction in b-CTx, a 29% reduction in BSAP and a 52% reduction in P1NP over 36 months. There was no progressive reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114zS9PS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Bone turnover marker (BTM) monitoring — collection and interpretation remarks include that samples for bone resorption markers should be collected with the patient in the fasting state, in the morning, and changes can be compared only if the lab continues to use the same assay. Variability appears similar for bone resorption markers for men and women, and in women with osteopenia the least significant change is between 14% (for b-ALP) and 37% (for urinary NTX) in the short term. In all of the studies above, in more than half of men receiving standard treatments for 1–2 yr, BTM changes would appear to exceed the least significant change, with responses identifiable as early as within 3 months of starting treatment.

### Markers of bone formation and resorption identify subgroups of patients with clinical knee osteoarthritis who have reduced rates of cartilage loss [^116ArR4i]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether serum markers of bone formation and resorption, used individually or in combination, can be used to identify subgroups who lose cartilage volume at different rates over 2 years within a knee osteoarthritis (OA) population.

Methods

Changes in cartilage volume over 2 years were measured in 117 subjects with knee OA using magnetic resonance imaging. We examined relationships between change in cartilage volume and baseline serum markers of bone formation [intact N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) and osteocalcin] and resorption [N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX-I), C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), and C-telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP).

Results

The baseline markers of bone formation, PINP and osteocalcin (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, respectively), and the baseline markers of bone resorption, CTX-I and NTX-I (p = 0.02 for both), were significantly associated with reduced cartilage loss. There were no significant associations between baseline ratios of bone formation to resorption markers and cartilage loss. However, when subjects were divided into subgroups with high or low bone formation markers (based on levels of marker ≥ mean or < mean for the population, respectively), in the subgroup with high PINP there was a significant association between increasing bone resorption markers CTX-I and NTX-I and reduced cartilage loss (p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively). Similarly, in the subgroup with high osteocalcin, there was a significant association between increasing CTX-I and NTX-I and reduced cartilage loss (p = 0.02, p = 0.003, respectively). In contrast, in subgroups with low bone formation markers, no significant associations were obtained between markers of bone resorption and cartilage loss.

Conclusion

Overall, the results suggest that higher bone remodeling (i.e., higher serum levels of bone formation and resorption) is associated with reduced cartilage loss. Considering markers of bone formation and resorption together, it is possible to identify subgroups within the OA population who have reduced rates of cartilage loss.

### Screening for osteoporosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease by using urinary N-telopeptides [^112mxiGw]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of osteoporosis.

Design and Methods

We carried out a prospective study of bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone metabolism like osteocalcin and urinary N-telopeptides in 72 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and evaluated if one of these markers detects osteoporosis. In addition, bone mineral density and N-telopeptides were analysed retrospectively in a second series of 93 patients with inflammatory bowel disease in order to assess predictive values found in the first patient group in an independent sample.

Results

Multiple linear regression showed that N-telopeptides (P < 0.0001) and total white blood cell count (P = 0.006) correlated negatively with the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and only N-telopeptides (P = 0.005) correlated negatively with the bone mineral density of the femoral neck. Using receiver operator characteristic curves N-telopeptide concentrations of > 40 (30) nmol N-telopeptides/mmol creatinine were chosen as best cut-off values to exclude osteoporosis at the lumbar spine (femoral neck). Using these cut-off values a negative predictive value of 100% (100%) and a positive predictive value of 37.5% (27.9%) were found in the first group, and a negative predictive value of 95.2% (96%) and a positive predictive value of 15.6% (23.3%) in the second, independent group of patients.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that N-telopeptide levels could be used as a tool for the screening of osteoporosis and for selecting those inflammatory bowel disease patients where bone mineral density measurement is indicated.

### Effect of vitamin D on serum markers of bone turnover in SLE in a randomised controlled trial [^1161PcW3]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Poor bone health is common in SLE due to disease and treatment. Patients with SLE have twice the fracture risk of individuals without SLE, and patients with SLE with nephritis are at even greater risk. Systemic inflammation, glucocorticoid use, lupus nephritis, premature menopause and vitamin D deficiency all have deleterious effects on bone health. Numerous studies have demonstrated that lower vitamin D levels are associated with higher SLE disease activity, although trials of vitamin D supplementation for reducing SLE disease activity have had conflicting results. Data on vitamin D supplementation for bone health in SLE are mostly derived from observational studies, raising concerns about confounding by indication; patients with SLE perceived to be at highest risk for fracture may be more likely to receive vitamin D.

Circulating vitamin D affects bone metabolism through direct effects on bone and by influencing intestinal calcium absorption and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts are coupled, such that an increase in bone resorption is followed by an increase in bone formation. The dynamic processes of bone resorption and formation can be measured using biomarkers of bone turnover. The International Osteoporosis Foundation recommends using N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) as a marker of bone formation and C-telopeptide (CTX) as a marker of bone resorption in clinical research. In the setting of vitamin D deficiency, calcium absorption decreases and PTH level increases, leading to increased bone resorption paired with increased bone formation. Vitamin D repletion is expected to increase calcium absorption and decrease PTH level, thereby decreasing both bone resorption (eg, decreasing the level of CTX) and formation (eg, decreasing the level of P1NP).

Limited data from cross-sectional studies in SLE suggests that higher vitamin D levelsand lower SLE disease activityare associated with higher levels of bone formation markers. Due to their observational nature, past studies that focused on vitamin D deficiency in SLE have been unable to test whether vitamin D repletion decreases bone turnover.

We investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on changes in bone turnover markers in a randomised controlled trial in vitamin D-deficient patients with SLE. We hypothesised that vitamin D supplementation would lead to a greater decrease in P1NP and CTX levels compared with placebo.

### Sensitivity and specificity of autoantibodies binding to citrullinated carboxyterminal telopeptides of types I and II collagens in an early arthritis series [^115FTXiv]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the specificity and sensitivity of autoantibodies binding to citrullinated carboxyterminal telopeptides of types I and II collagens in an early arthritis series.

Methods

A cohort of 146 patients from the Kuopio 2000 Arthritis Survey having RA, AS, PsA, ReA, uSpA or undifferentiated arthritis were studied. Autoantibodies binding citrullinated types I and II carboxytelopeptides were measured in two different inhibition ELISA assays. Sera from 135 adult persons were used as controls.

Results

In RA, the sensitivities were 0.83 with long type I telopeptide and 0.78 with long type II telopeptide and the respective specificities were 0.94 and 0.93, while the corresponding values in other inflammatory joint diseases were much lower. The likelihood ratio in RA increased with longer peptides from 4.20 to 14.06 for type I telopeptide and from 2.74 to 11.67 for type II telopeptide.

Conclusion

The antibody assay using long telopeptide from type I collagen was the most specific and sensitive method in every diagnostic category, although in the arthritides other than RA, binding was much less abundant and possibly citrulline-independent.

### Factors influencing bone loss in anorexia nervosa: assessment and therapeutic options [^113iGpeT]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Bone remodelling markers

Bone remodelling markers can be used to explore both bone formation and bone resorption. In the literature, the most frequently used markers of bone formation are osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatases (BAP). Commonly used bone resorption markers include deoxypyridinoline, C-terminal extension peptides (CrossLaps or CTX) or N-terminal extension peptides (NTX), and telopeptides (carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of type one collagen). These markers are mainly used in postmenopausal women, but their interpretation in young women and adolescent girls is more difficult since growth (modelling) impacts on their values. In the literature, results vary widely, group sizes are often small, and a distinction needs to be made between those studies involving adolescent girls and those involving adult anorexia patients. Like postmenopausal women, anorexia patients exhibit an increase in bone resorption, but studies have reported that they also exhibit a significant decrease in bone formation. This results in greater bone loss than in women of the same age with hypogonadism. This decrease in bone formation probably depends on the severity of the disease and the age at onset. The underlying mechanism is probably a decrease in IGF-1, a factor that stimulates osteoblast differentiation and therefore bone formation. However, the decrease in bone formation markers is not found in all of the studies. Indeed, in a studycomparing young adult anorexia patients (n = 113) to controls, we found no significant difference between the groups where bone remodelling markers were concerned. Furthermore, some authors have reported low levels of bone formation markers and similar levels of bone resorption markers in adolescents with AN compared with healthy controls, while in adult women with AN compared with healthy controls, they observed decreased levels of bone formation markers and elevated levels of bone resorption markers. The difference may be due to the fact that physiological oestrogen levels are low in prepubertal adolescents, whereas most adult women with AN are hypoestroegenaemic relative to healthy controls.

### Denosumab-bmwo (Stoboclo) [^117XpncD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Denosumab products bind to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Denosumab products prevent RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In clinical studies, treatment with 60 mg of denosumab resulted in reduction in the bone resorption marker serum type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) by approximately 85% by 3 days, with maximal reductions occurring by 1 month. CTX levels were below the limit of assay quantitation (0.049 ng/mL) in 39% to 68% of patients 1 to 3 months after dosing of denosumab. At the end of each dosing interval, CTX reductions were partially attenuated from a maximal reduction of ≥ 87% to ≥ 45% (range: 45% to 80%), as serum denosumab levels diminished, reflecting the reversibility of the effects of denosumab on bone remodeling. These effects were sustained with continued treatment. Upon reinitiation, the degree of inhibition of CTX by denosumab was similar to that observed in patients initiating denosumab treatment.

Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [P1NP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of denosumab. After discontinuation of denosumab therapy, markers of bone resorption increased to levels 40% to 60% above pretreatment values but returned to baseline levels within 12 months.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

In a study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers (n = 73, age range: 18 to 64 years) following a single subcutaneously administered denosumab dose of 60 mg, the mean area-under-the-concentration-time curve up to 16 weeks (AUC0–16 weeks) of denosumab was 316 mcg∙day/mL (SD = 101 mcg∙day/mL). The mean maximum denosumab concentration (Cmax) was 6.75 mcg/mL (SD = 1.89 mcg/mL). No accumulation or change in denosumab pharmacokinetics with time is observed with multiple dosing of 60 mg subcutaneously administered once every 6 months.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1119XmYr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Monostotic Paget's disease — biochemical assessment: We suggest that PINP or BSAP and βCTX or NTX should be used for assessing the activity of untreated monostotic Paget's disease, although these may be normal when evidence of disease activity is still clearly demonstrated on scintigraphy. In limited disease, BSAP seems most sensitive and was increased in 60% of patients with limited disease activity/extent although total ALP was normal, and either βCTX or NTX with a bone formation marker should provide the best chance of providing biochemical evidence of responsiveness to treatment. If baseline biochemical tests are normal, a follow-up radionuclide scan may determine a significant response to treatment.

### Maternal type 1collagen N-terminal telopeptide levels in severe hyperemesis gravidarum [^113cxShS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting occur 50–90% during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, patients with hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) may be hospitalized at an incidence rate of 0.8–2% before the 20th week of gestational age. The symptoms generally start during the 5–6th gestational weeks, reaching the highest degree during the 9th week, and decline after the 16–20th weeks of gestation. Clinical findings are proportional to the severity of the disease and severe HG is characterized with dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and nutritional deficiency as a result of vomiting. Deficiencies in certain vitamins that work as catalyzers in the human body can lead to metabolic disorders.

Bone turnover is a dynamic and complex procedure, with bone resorption and bone formation being seen sequentially due to many different substances and factors. Biochemical markers, including protein and enzyme measurements, can be used to define bone resorption and formation. Telopeptides are tiny protein particles found particularly in type I collagen that include 15–20 amino acids. Telopeptides bound to the ends of these amino acids are removed from the body through the urine as a result of collagen metabolism. During resorption, amino and carboxyl terminal fragments, called telopeptides, are bound to collagens with cross links and can be released into the circulation and excreted in the urine. Some recent studies have demonstrated that the type 1 collagen N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) level is more specific to bone tissue than any other resorption markers, showing more specificity if established earlier. It can be used as a specific and stable indicator in the measurement of bone resorption.

It is well documented that sHG characterized by nutritional deficiency. We hypothesized that inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake may cause increased calcium mobilization from the maternal skeleton. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to determine the presence of maternal bone resorption in women with severe HG using the NTx levels in the maternal urine.

Dark line indicates the median, and dotted line indicates the baseline marker level. ICI, immune checkpoint inhibitor.

A total of 37 serum samples were collected prior to each drug administration at the prespecified timepoints, and bone marker concentrations were assessed (table 1, figure 1). In eight out of nine patients, we observed a rapid but transient decrease in serum levels of the bone resorption marker CTX after 1 month of treatment (median change (range) −23% (−37, 20%), r = 0,8, p = 0.01). At later timepoints, CTX levels returned to baseline in most patients (median change (range) 6.7% (−35, 65%), r = 0,03, p = NS) (figure 1B). In contrast, serum levels of the bone formation markers PINP and OCN gradually increased from baseline after 4 months of ICI treatment in six of the seven evaluable patients (median change (range) +8.4% (0, 53%), r = 0,8, p = 0.02) and five of the seven patients (median change (range) +30% (−71, 139%), r = 0, 3 p = NS), respectively (figure 1C, D). No relevant changes in the levels of bone metabolism markers (PTH, 25(OH) Vit D, and calcium) were observed.

Levels of bone biomarkers at prespecified timepoints

Taken together, the gradual increase of the markers of bone formation after the transient decrease of the bone resorption marker suggests a potentially favorable impact of ICIs on bone turnover.

### Towards a toolkit for the assessment and monitoring of musculoskeletal ageing [^114zwBVL]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical biomarkers of musculoskeletal ageing

Biochemical biomarkers are markers measurable in situ or ex vivo in biofluid samples and tissue biopsies that are produced in, or released from, a tissue and that are specific for a characteristic process or cell in that tissue. Two well-established serum markers of bone turnover were recommended for the toolkit i.e. N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of collagen type I (CTX, also known as CTX-I). Five further markers of bone turnover viz. osteocalcin; bone alkaline phosphatase; N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of collagen type I (NTX); carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen generated by matrix metalloproteinases (ICTP); and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRACP5b) are potential future candidates. Urinary type II collagen C-telopeptide fragment (CTX-II) and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) are two possible biomarkers of cartilage ageing but they have not been shown to be reliable markers of collagen ageing per s e, independent of osteoarthritis. Serum creatinine may be a reliable biomarker of skeletal muscle mass (with appropriate dietary control). Potential next generation muscle biochemical biomarkers include: 3-methylhistidine, type VI collagen, the N-terminal peptide of procollagen type III (P3NP), agrin and growth differentiation factors.

### Low bone turnover associates with lower insulin sensitivity in newly diagnosed drug-Naïve persons with type 2 diabetes [^1146tBda]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Bone is a dynamic organ that is resorbed and formed in a continuous, coupled, and tightly regulated process known as bone remodeling, which conserves skeletal integrity and maintains calcium homeostasis. With age, bone resorption surpasses bone formation resulting in bone loss and higher risk of osteoporosis in men and women. Circulating levels of bone turnover markers (BTMs), including serum N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) as a reference marker of bone formation and serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) as a reference marker of bone resorption, recommended by the International Osteoporosis Foundation and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry, reflect overall bone resorption and formation. Also, measures of BTMs are commonly used clinically to assess the response to antiresorptive therapies in persons with osteoporosis.

Although a reduction in BTMs following initiation of antiresorptive treatment in persons with osteoporosis indicates a favorable effect, lower levels of BTMs may not uniformly associate with a lower fracture risk. In spite of lower BTMs in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), persons with T2D have a 1.3-fold increased risk of hip fractures and a 1.3 times higher risk of incident vertebral fractures. The higher fracture risk is not explained by accelerated age-related bone loss or by low bone mineral density (BMD) considering that BMD is normal or even high in persons with T2D. Even though BTMs do not predict fracture risk in persons with T2D, long-term suppressed bone turnover in T2D may negatively affect bone quality by impairing microdamage repair resulting in accumulation of bone microcracks. The mechanisms explaining the diminution in bone turnover in T2D remain unsettled. Preclinical investigations show that hyperglycemia promotes adipogenesis rather than osteogenesis, impairs osteoblast growth and apoptosis, and inhibits osteoclastogenesis, corresponding to a state of low bone turnover. Also, high levels of sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted endogenous inhibitor of bone formation, may in part explain the lower levels of bone formation markers in persons with T2D.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^1179Y6Wk]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The performance of various biochemical markers of bone turnover in patients with PDB was studied by Alvarez in 51 patients who had not received treatment in the previous 6 months. This showed that of the markers studied, procollagen type I N‐terminal propeptide (PINP) showed the highest proportion of increased values among bone formation markers when compared with BALP and total ALP (94%, 82%, and 76%, respectively). 80 In the same study, urinary cross‐linked N‐terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (uNTX) values were increased in 96% of patients with PDB compared with urinary pyridinoline (uPYD) (69%), urinary deoxypyridinoline (uDPD) (71%), and urinary cross‐linked beta C‐terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (uβCTX) (65%). Osteocalcin (OC) was increased in only 34% of patients. Another study by the same group of researchers 81 evaluated total ALP and bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) in a series of 59 patients with PDB who had been untreated for at least 6 months, along with various other markers including the carboxy‐terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PICP), tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), telopeptide carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), urinary pyridinoline (PYD), and deoxypyridinoline D‐PYR) and hydroxyproline (HYP). Total ALP values were elevated in 74.5% of patients, but BALP was elevated in 90%. The best‐performing resorption marker was D‐PYD, which was elevated in 73%. Of the 15 subjects with normal total ALP, serum BALP was increased in 60%.

### Denosumab (Prolia) [^116xxUkF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Prolia binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Prolia prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In clinical studies, treatment with 60 mg of Prolia resulted in reduction in the bone resorption marker serum type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) by approximately 85% by 3 days, with maximal reductions occurring by 1 month. CTX levels were below the limit of assay quantitation (0.049 ng/mL) in 39% to 68% of patients 1 to 3 months after dosing of Prolia. At the end of each dosing interval, CTX reductions were partially attenuated from a maximal reduction of ≥ 87% to ≥ 45% (range: 45% to 80%), as serum denosumab levels diminished, reflecting the reversibility of the effects of Prolia on bone remodeling. These effects were sustained with continued treatment. Upon reinitiation, the degree of inhibition of CTX by Prolia was similar to that observed in patients initiating Prolia treatment.

Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [P1NP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of Prolia. After discontinuation of Prolia therapy, markers of bone resorption increased to levels 40% to 60% above pretreatment values but returned to baseline levels within 12 months.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

In a study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers (n = 73, age range: 18 to 64 years) following a single subcutaneously administered Prolia dose of 60 mg, the mean area-under-the-concentration-time curve up to 16 weeks (AUC0–16 weeks) of denosumab was 316 mcg ∙ day/mL (SD = 101 mcg ∙ day/mL). The mean maximum denosumab concentration (Cmax) was 6.75 mcg/mL (SD = 1.89 mcg/mL). No accumulation or change in denosumab pharmacokinetics with time is observed with multiple dosing of 60 mg subcutaneously administered once every 6 months.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^115hFkfw]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Bone turnover markers (BTMs) — initial evaluation and follow-up of postmenopausal osteoporosis — are described as useful for skeletal assessment but not diagnostic; clinicians might use them for early treatment feedback, with specific markers and measurement conditions noted, and they are not required for all patients. Bone turnover markers (BTMs) provide a dynamic assessment of skeletal activity and are useful modalities for skeletal assessment, yet they "cannot be used to diagnose osteoporosis". For measurement, "Serum CTX must be measured in the fasting state and ideally at the same time in the morning every time". Regarding monitoring of oral bisphosphonates, clinicians "might use the results of BTMs obtained after 3 to 6 months… rather than waiting 2 years for a DXA result". For preferred analytes, "the preferred resorption marker is CTX and the preferred formation marker is PINP". BTMs "may be helpful in determining the reason for bone loss", elevations after an acute fracture "should not be interpreted as treatment failure", and loss of bone mineral density with well-suppressed BTMs "might raise concern" for DXA confounders. During a bisphosphonate drug holiday, suppressed turnover may indicate continued effect, but "there are no peer-reviewed trials supporting or refuting this approach". Overall, "BTMs do not need to be assessed in all osteoporosis patients".

### Ibandronate sodium [^111yYQFv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, most commonly at the spine, hip, and wrist. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis indicative of vertebral fracture. While osteoporosis occurs in both men and women, it is most common among women following menopause. In healthy humans, bone formation and resorption are closely linked; old bone is resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone. In postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fracture. After menopause, the risk of fractures of the spine and hip increases; approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture during their remaining lifetimes.

Ibandronate sodium produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases of biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked C-telopeptide of Type I collagen) in the daily dose range of 0.25 mg to 5 mg and once-monthly doses from 100 mg to 150 mg in postmenopausal women.

Treatment with 2.5 mg daily ibandronate sodium resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary C-terminal telopeptide of Type I collagen (uCTX) and serum osteocalcin, to levels similar to those in premenopausal women. Changes in markers of bone formation were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and formation. Treatment with 2.5 mg daily ibandronate sodium decreased levels of uCTX within 1 month of starting treatment and decreased levels of osteocalcin within 3 months. Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of approximately 64% below baseline values by 6 months of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years. Following treatment discontinuation, there is a return to pretreatment baseline rates of elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

In a 1-year, study comparing once-monthly vs. once-daily oral dosing regimens, the median decrease from baseline in serum CTX values was -76% for patients treated with the 150 mg once-monthly regimen and -67% for patients treated with the 2.5 mg daily regimen. In a 1-year, prevention study comparing ibandronate sodium 150 mg (ibandronate) once-monthly to placebo, the median placebo-subtracted decrease in sCTX was -49.8%.

### Effect of denosumab or alendronic acid on the progression of aortic stenosis: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113t1Nc4]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Trial Intervention

Compliance was similar between placebo and active drug for each method of administration (proportion of participants receiving > 70% expected dose: denosumab 94%, placebo injection 92%, alendronic acid 88%, placebo capsule 84%). Baseline serum C-terminal telopeptide concentrations were similar between treatment arms (Table) and halved from baseline to 6 months with denosumab (0.23 [0.18–0.33 µg/L] to 0.11 µg/L [0.08–0.17 µg/L]) and alendronic acid (0.20 [0.14–0.28 µg/L] to 0.09 µg/L [0.08–0.13 µg/L]) but were unchanged with placebo (0.23 [0.17–0.30 µg/L] to 0.26 µg/L [0.16–0.31 µg/L]; Figure 2).

Figure 2.
C-terminal telopeptide concentrations. A, C-terminal telopeptide concentrations at baseline and 6 months for each trial arm (placebo: P > 0.5, denosumab: P < 0.001, alendronic acid: P < 0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). B, Six-month change in C-terminal telopeptide for each trial arm (P < 0.001 for both denosumab and alendronic acid compared to placebo; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

Primary End Point

The primary end point was calculated in 136 participants (46 placebo, 46 denosumab, 44 alendronic acid; Figure 1) with a median time to final scan of 784 days (770–793 days), in whom the overall aortic valve calcium score at baseline was 1110 AU (622–1998 AU). Compared with placebo, there were no differences in the 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score for either denosumab or alendronic acid (denosumab: 343 [198–804 AU] versus placebo 354 AU [76–675 AU], P = 0.41; alendronic acid: 326 [138–813 AU] versus placebo 354 AU [76–675 AU], P = 0.49; Figure 3 A;).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^113FLutA]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

LPV/r in children — metabolic and bone effects versus EFV — children treated with LPV/r may have less robust weight gain and smaller increases in CD4 percentage than children treated with NNRTI-based regimens, although one study did not observe this difference in the effect of LPV/r on CD4 count and another study found that the difference did not persist after a year of therapy. Switching to an EFV-based regimen at or after age 3 years removed the risk of LPV-associated metabolic toxicity, with no loss of virologic control. Bone mineral density improved when children were treated with EFV-containing regimens instead of regimens that contained LPV/r; among 212 children randomized to either remain on an LPV/r-based regimen or switch to an EFV-containing regimen, osteocalcin was higher in the EFV group than the LPV group at both 8 weeks and 2 years post-randomization, while levels of C-telopeptide of type I collagen and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide did not differ. In a separate study, among 220 children with HIV (mean age 6.38 years), lower bone mass was observed in children on LPV/r-based regimens than those with EFV-based regimens over 2 years of follow-up.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^1179p17u]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical response markers are reported as follows: in a prospective study of 37 patients undergoing reinstatement of LT4 therapy, LT4 therapy was associated with significantly increased concentrations of FT4, FT3, ACE, soluble interleukin-2 receptors, carboxyl-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, and bone GLA protein; FT3 concentration positively correlated with soluble interleukin-2 receptors, carboxyl-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, and bone GLA protein, and the soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration was suggested as a useful monitoring parameter because it was unaffected by concomitant therapy with growth hormone, sex steroids, and glucocorticoids, although no long-term studies have evaluated use of these parameters to adjust therapy.

### Effect of selenium supplementation on musculoskeletal health in older women: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112FK7bB]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2021). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was between-group difference in the ratio of urine N-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) to creatinine at 26 weeks. Bone turnover markers change much more rapidly than BMD, so can determine more quickly and cost-effectively if an intervention is likely to work. We chose NTx because the relationship between change in NTx and change in fracture risk is known. With bisphosphonate treatment, a 30% decrease in NTx is associated with a 40% reduction in spine fracture, and 66% of the vertebral fracture risk reduction at 3 years is explained by change in NTx. Also, NTx was the marker most strongly related to selenium status in the previous observational study.

The secondary endpoints were: serum selenium and selenoprotein P; other bone turnover markers (procollagen type I N propeptide [PINP], osteocalcin, C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen [CTx]), BMD of the lumbar spine and total hip by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, muscle function (short physical performance battery and hand grip strength); antioxidant and inflammatory markers (glutathione peroxidase activity [a selenium-containing antioxidant that is increased in postmenopausal women with osteopenia], IL-6, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein).

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^112Tk6ve]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Gender

During childhood, BTMs are similar in boys and girls. During puberty, there is a sharp increase in BTMs. This peak of BTMs levels is around 2.5 years later in boys and is followed by a decrease to adult levels in both males and females. Adult males have higher BTMs than females, up to the menopause in women. The increase in bone turnover observed after the menopause leads to an increase in BTMs in women, which is not observed in men. Thus, postmenopausal women have higher BTMs than same-age men, due to higher bone turnover.

Menstrual cycle

Small variations (less than 20%) on BTMs during the menstrual cycle have been reported. Several studies did not report variation for OC or bone ALP. However, a 10% to 20% increase for bone ALP, CTX, and uNTX were reported in the follicular phase. Therefore, some variation has been reported on BTMs in the menstrual cycle, but it does not seem to be clinically significant.

Pregnancy

BTMs vary with pregnancy and lactation. Bone resorption markers (CTX, uNTX) increase gradually with pregnancy. The increase is significant from 14 weeks of gestation, with a marked increase in the last trimester (Fig. 15). In contrast, no significant change in bone ALP was observed before 36 weeks.

### Relationship of early changes in bone resorption to the reduction in fracture risk with risedronate [^113dbgfN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in the level of biochemical markers of bone resorption with risedronate treatment for osteoporosis were examined as a surrogate for the decrease in fracture risk. Greater decreases in bone resorption markers were associated with greater decreases in vertebral (and nonvertebral) fractures. Antifracture efficacy of antiresorptive therapies is only partially explained by increases in bone mineral density. Early decreases in bone resorption may also play a role. We tested this hypothesis by measuring two bone resorption markers, the C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and the N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), in osteoporotic patients in risedronate vertebral fracture trials. We studied 693 women with at least one vertebral deformity (mean age, 69 ± 7 years) who received calcium (and vitamin D if required) and placebo or risedronate 5 mg daily for 3 years. The reductions in urinary CTX (median, 60%) and NTX (51%) at 3–6 months with risedronate therapy were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the reduction in vertebral fracture risk (75% over 1 year and 50% over 3 years). The changes in both CTX and NTX accounted for approximately one-half (CTX, 55%; NTX, 49%) of risedronate's effect in reducing the risk of vertebral fractures in the first year and approximately two-thirds (CTX, 67%; NTX, 66%) over 3 years compared with placebo. The changes in CTX and NTX accounted for 77% and 54%, respectively, of risedronate's effect in reducing the risk of nonvertebral fractures over 3 years compared with placebo. The relationships between vertebral fracture risk and changes from baseline in CTX and NTX were not linear (p < 0.05). There was little further improvement in fracture benefit below a decrease of 55–60% for CTX and 35–40% for NTX. The decrease in bone resorption in patients taking risedronate accounts for a large proportion of the reduction in fracture risk. There may be a level of bone resorption reduction below which there is no further fracture benefit.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115caZG3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — biochemical markers for monitoring: We recommend measuring a specific marker of bone formation or resorption in patients with Paget's disease and abnormal liver or biliary tract function to assess response to treatment or follow evolution of the disease in untreated patients. (1|⊕⊕⊕○) Serum P1NP as a measure of bone formation is the best option, and if cost or availability prevent use of this option, then resorption markers such as serum βCTx or urine NTx provide accurate estimates of baseline bone metabolic activity and the response to treatment; total ALP overlaps with liver ALP with up to 20% cross-reactivity of antibodies to liver ALP with bone ALP, osteocalcin has been shown to be an insensitive marker for bone formation, and availability and cost vary considerably by region and by insurance coverage, so practitioners may need to verify whether a given test is covered by the patient's insurance.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^1153NJPP]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A new body of evidence for a negative effect of hyponatremia on bone may emerge from assessment of serum bone turnover markers such a C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), considered to be a marker of bone resorption, and N-propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP), a marker of bone formation. A small, longitudinal pilot study prospectively measured serial bone turnover markers over 1 week in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Eight patients developed mild-moderate hyponatremia (mean pNa 131 mmol/L), and 14 maintained normal serum sodium and acted as controls. The authors observed a reduction in P1NP in patients who became hyponatremic (P = 0.02), indicating reduced bone formation activity. CTX levels rose in both groups over time (P = 0.001) potentially due to reduced mobility, but there was no between group difference, indicating no effect of hyponatremia on a surrogate measure of bone resorption in this very small data set. Another study assessed bone turnover markers by way of a prespecified post hoc analysis of a larger short-term trial of empagliflozin in hyponatremia and found that P1NP levels rose in those patients in whom hyponatremia corrected after 5 days, which would imply that resolution of hyponatremia might have a positive effect on osteoblast function. CTX rose over the 5 days in the whole cohort of hyponatremic patients whether it was corrected or not. P1NP did not change in those who remained hyponatremic. Caution needs to be exercised in interpretating studies reporting changes in bone turnover biomarkers. Markers of bone formation and markers of bone resorption are measuring coupled bone remodeling events, occurring in different basic multicellular units, and occurring on different time scales. Therefore, differential changes in biomarkers such as P1NP and CTX, especially if measured in the short term, have their limitations in inferring net gain or loss of bone mineral.

This assembled evidence does support a contribution of chronic hyponatremia to loss of bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, and while several mechanisms have been proposed, this process is not fully understood. It remains to be determined whether correction of hyponatremia reduces risk of fracture.

Bone Biomarker Prognostic Analyses

Figure 1 and Table 3 display key data for prognostic analyses in the three prespecified recurrence categories. The proportional hazards assumption was also investigated for each Cox proportional hazards model applied in our study. The majority of markers and end points were not close to violating this assumption (ie, suggesting no difference in the effects of the markers as time elapses). For the 1-CTP marker, the assumption was only borderline valid, suggesting that the impact of 1-CTP may differ as time elapses, although the Cox proportional hazards model was still appropriate.

P values were calculated using the likelihood ratio χ 2 test statistic, and tests were two-sided. 1-CTP = pyridinoline cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type-1 collagen; CI = confidence interval; CTX = C-telopeptide of type-1 collagen; HR = hazard ratio; P1NP = N-terminal propeptide of type-1 collagen.

Bone Recurrence at Any Time

In adjusted continuous log-transformed analyses (Figure 1), increases in all three markers were strongly associated with statistically significantly increased risk of development of bone metastasis (P1NP: P = 0.006; CTX: P = 0.009; 1-CTP: P = 0.008). In categorical analyses, P1NP greater than 70 ng/mL (P = 0.03) and CTX greater than 0.299 ng/mL (P = 0.03), but not CTX greater than 0.566 ng/mL (P = 0.12) or 1-CTP greater than 4.2 ng/mL (P = 0.10), were statistically significantly prognostic for recurrence in bone at any time (Table 3). Cumulative incidence plots for categorical analysis of time to bone metastasis at any time are shown, exemplified for P1NP, in Figure 2 for both control and treatment arms.

### Prediction of bone mass density variation by bone remodeling markers in postmenopausal women with vitamin D insufficiency treated with calcium and vitamin D supplementation [^113BtVbo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether early changes in bone markers could predict long-term response in bone mineral density (BMD) after calcium (500 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplementation twice daily in ambulatory elderly women with vitamin D insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D, < 12 ng/ml). One hundred and ninety-two women (mean age, 75 ± 7 yr) were randomized to receive either the supplementation (n = 95) or a placebo (n = 97) in a double-blind, controlled clinical trial for 1 yr. In comparison with the placebo group, supplementation significantly increased BMD, normalized 25-hydroxyvitamin D and significantly decreased intact PTH and bone remodeling markers. The initial values of telopeptide cross-links were correlated with improvement in total body BMD [urinary N-telopeptides (NTX), r = 0.38; C-telopeptides (CTX), r = 0.32; serum CTX, r = 0.28], and the 3-month changes in the same markers were correlated with improvement in total body (urinary N-telopeptides, r = -0.29; serum CTX, r = -0.26) and vertebral BMD (CTX, r = -0.26; all P < 0.05). We concluded that short-term changes in bone resorption markers can predict long-term variations in BMD in elderly women with vitamin D insufficiency receiving calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111LV3dT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 4.2 — bone turnover marker (BTM) monitoring after initiating therapy in men states: We suggest that clinicians consider measuring a BTM at 3–6 months after initiation of treatment using a bone resorption marker (such as serum CTX or serum or urine NTX) for antiresorptive therapy and a bone formation marker (such as serum PINP) for anabolic therapy (2|⊕⊕○○). Evidence cited notes that alendronate reduces BTMs by about 40–50%, that bone formation and resorption markers increase during the first 6–12 months of teriparatide therapy in men before declining toward baseline, and that BTMs decline consistently when hypogonadal men receive physiological doses of testosterone.

### An anterior cruciate ligament rupture increases levels of urine N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen, urine C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen, serum aggrecan ARGS neoepitope, and serum tumor necrosis factor-α [^117NZizz]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the literature, this study showed a positive correlation between urinary NTX-I and CTX-II. The study of van Spil et alhypothesized that CTX-II measured in urine may merely reflect bone turnover rather than cartilage degradation based on stronger associations with bone markers than cartilage markers, while others have stated that CTX-II originates primarily from cartilage. Nonetheless, we found a correlation between urinary CTX-II and both serum ARGS-aggrecan and urinary NTX-I, which might suggest that CTX-II reflects both cartilage degradation and bone turnover.

In our subgroup analysis, concentrations of serum ARGS-aggrecan and urinary NTX-I and CTX-II were higher for the surgery group compared with the nonoperative group. We did not observe a trauma-induced effect in the cytokines, contrary to the study of Larsson et al, who found elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in synovial fluid at up to 8 months of follow-up in patients treated with ACL reconstruction. This may be explained by the fact that our cytokines were measured within a wider time frame and in serum instead of synovial fluid. Lower concentrations of ARGS-aggrecan, CTX-II, and NTX-I in the nonoperative group may partially be explained by an older age compared with that of the surgery group (30 vs 23 years, respectively) (Table 1). It is also possible that higher marker concentrations resulted from more severe bone bruises and damage to the (sub)chondral layer at initial trauma or from repetitive microtrauma caused by instability and that those patients were more likely to undergo ACL reconstruction. This hypothesis is supported by the study of Frobell et al, who found a prolonged resolution time of bone marrow lesions and greater changes in cartilage morphometry within the first year after trauma for patients who underwent ACL reconstruction. Furthermore, it can be argued whether higher levels of NTX-I at baseline are a result of disuse in the preoperative phase. The role of ACL treatment on biomarker levels is not entirely understood at present.

### Non-isomerized C-telopeptide fragments are highly sensitive markers for monitoring disease activity and treatment efficacy in Paget's disease of bone [^117MfGYL]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

A new resorption assay measuring non-isomerized collagen type I C-telopeptide fragments (alpha-alpha CTX) was evaluated in a cohort comprising 32 Pagetic patients and 48 healthy controls. alpha-alpha CTX was found to be a sensitive marker for assessing disease activity and monitoring treatment efficacy in Paget's disease of bone compared with isomerized CTX (beta-beta CTX) and a number of other established bone turnover markers.

Introduction

Collagen type I fragments are generated by resorbing osteoclasts, and some of them can be measured using a C-telopeptide (CTX) immunoassay. The C-telopeptide of collagen type I comprises a DG-motif susceptible to isomerization. In newly synthesized collagen, this motif is in the native form denoted alpha, but spontaneously converts to an isomerized form (beta) during aging of bone. CTX fragments composed of at least two alpha CTX chains (alpha-alpha CTX) originating from degradation of newly formed bone can be determined in the urine using a newly developed sandwich ELISA. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of this marker to monitor disease activity and treatment efficacy in patients with Paget's disease compared with established bone turnover markers.

Materials and Methods

A total of 32 patients diagnosed with Paget's disease of bone was included in the study. All received 400 mg/day of oral tiludronate for 3 months. Urinary alpha-alpha CTX (U alpha-alpha CTX) was measured at baseline and at 1 and 6 months after discontinuation of therapy and in 48 untreated age-matched and healthy controls. Other markers of bone turnover, including urinary beta-beta CTX, N-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen, and deoxypyridinoline, were also measured for comparison.

Results and Conclusions

The U alpha-alpha CTX marker showed a marked reduction (-82% and -77% at 1 and 6 months of treatment, respectively) in response to antiresorptive therapy in patients with Paget's disease. The response to treatment in this marker exceeded that of the other markers (p < 0.01). The alpha-alpha CTX marker also provided a high correlation (r = 0.89) to disease activity as assessed by scintigraphic activity index. In conclusion, alpha-alpha CTX seems to be a sensitive marker for assessing disease activity and monitoring treatment efficacy in Paget's disease.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and
increased fracture risk, most commonly at the spine, hip, and wrist. The
diagnosis can be confirmed by a finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture
on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis
indicative of vertebral fracture. While osteoporosis occurs in both men and
women, it is most common among women following menopause. In healthy humans,
bone formation and resorption are closely linked; old bone is resorbed and
replaced by newly formed bone. In postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone resorption
exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fracture.
After menopause, the risk of fractures of the spine and hip increases;
approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will experience an osteoporosis-related
fracture during their remaining lifetimes.

BONIVA produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition
of bone resorption, including decreases of biochemical markers of bone collagen
degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked C-telopeptide of Type I
collagen) in the daily dose range of 0.25 mg to 5 mg and once-monthly doses from
100 mg to 150 mg in postmenopausal women.

Treatment with 2.5 mg daily BONIVA resulted in decreases in biochemical
markers of bone turnover, including urinary C-terminal telopeptide of Type I
collagen (uCTX) and serum osteocalcin, to levels similar to those in
premenopausal women. Changes in markers of bone formation were observed later
than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of
bone resorption and formation. Treatment with 2.5 mg daily BONIVA decreased
levels of uCTX within 1 month of starting treatment and decreased levels of
osteocalcin within 3 months. Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of
approximately 64% below baseline values by 6 months of treatment and remained
stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years. Following treatment
discontinuation, there is a return to pretreatment baseline rates of elevated
bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

In a 1-year, study comparing once-monthly vs. once-daily oral dosing
regimens, the median decrease from baseline in serum CTX values was -76% for
patients treated with the 150 mg once-monthly regimen and -67% for patients
treated with the 2.5 mg daily regimen. In a 1-year, prevention study comparing
BONIVA 150 mg once-monthly to placebo, the median placebo-subtracted decrease in
sCTX was -49.8%.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^114ScA79]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Osteoporosis pharmacotherapy — bone turnover marker (BTM) changes and monitoring in postmenopausal women: In postmenopausal women, alendronate reduces serum CTX and serum P1NP by 80% and 60%, respectively, with reductions becoming maximal within several months and remaining stable; with teriparatide, bone formation and resorption markers increase during the first 6 to 12 months then decline toward baseline. Monitoring requires attention to diurnal and food effects, with samples for bone resorption markers collected fasting in the morning, and changes should be compared only if the same assay is used. Least significant change estimates are ~56% for serum CTX and 38% for serum P1NP; by 12 weeks on oral bisphosphonates, between 70% and 90% of women are expected to respond, and the BTM response may account for 30% to 75% of the fracture risk reduction with standard treatments. Some experts recommend measuring BTMs before and 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and if the change exceeds the least significant change (~40%), then one goal has been met; a low risk of fractures while on treatment is associated with BTMs below the median of the reference interval for young women. If markers do not change, options include questioning medication compliance, considering secondary osteoporosis, or changing the medication or route of administration.

### Risedronate sodium [^112aFbae]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in Men In a 2-year study of men with osteoporosis, treatment with risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week resulted in a mean decrease from baseline compared to placebo of 16% (placebo 20%; risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg 37%) for the bone resorption marker urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide, 45% (placebo -6%; risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg 39%) for the bone resorption marker serum C-telopeptide, and 27% (placebo -2%; risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg 25%) for the bone formation marker serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.

Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis with glucocorticoid use occurs as a result of inhibited bone formation and increased bone resorption resulting in net bone loss. Risedronate sodium decreases bone resorption without directly inhibiting bone formation.

In two 1-year clinical trials in the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg decreased urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (a marker of bone resorption), and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (a marker of bone formation) by 50% to 55% and 25% to 30%, respectively, within 3 to 6 months after initiation of therapy.

Paget's Disease

Paget's disease of bone is a chronic, focal skeletal disorder characterized by greatly increased and disordered bone remodeling. Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic new bone formation, leading to the replacement of the normal bone architecture by disorganized, enlarged, and weakened bone structure.

In pagetic patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets 30 mg daily for 2 months, bone turnover returned to normal in a majority of patients as evidenced by significant reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase (a marker of bone formation), and in urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine and deoxypyridinoline/creatinine (markers of bone resorption).

### A chaperone complex formed by HSP47, FKBP65, and BiP modulates telopeptide lysyl hydroxylation of type I procollagen [^115oBGPY]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

Lysine hydroxylation of type I collagen telopeptides varies from tissue to tissue, and these distinct hydroxylation patterns modulate collagen cross-linking to generate a unique extracellular matrix. Abnormalities in these patterns contribute to pathologies that include osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), fibrosis, and cancer. Telopeptide procollagen modifications are carried out by lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2); however, little is known regarding how this enzyme regulates hydroxylation patterns. We identified an ER complex of resident chaperones that includes HSP47, FKBP65, and BiP regulating the activity of LH2. Our findings show that FKBP65 and HSP47 modulate the activity of LH2 to either favor or repress its activity. BiP was also identified as a member of the complex, playing a role in enhancing the formation of the complex. This newly identified ER chaperone complex contributes to our understanding of how LH2 regulates lysyl hydroxylation of type I collagen C-telopeptides to affect the quality of connective tissues. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Predicting incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis in middle-aged women within four years: the importance of knee-level prognostic factors [^115PEzVY]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop and internally validate risk models and a clinical risk score tool to predict incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis (RKOA) in middle-aged women.

Methods

We analyzed 649 women in the Chingford 1,000 Women study. The outcome was incident RKOA, defined as Kellgren/Lawrence grade 0–1 at baseline and ≥ 2 at year 5. We estimated predictors' effects on the outcome using logistic regression models. Two models were generated. The clinical model considered patient characteristics, medication, biomarkers, and knee symptoms. The radiographic model considered the same factors, plus radiographic factors (e.g., angle between the acetabular roof and the ilium's vertical cortex [hip α-angle]). The models were internally validated. Model performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination (area under the receiver characteristic curve [AUC]).

Results

The clinical model contained age, quadriceps circumference, and a cartilage degradation marker (C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen) as predictors (AUC = 0.692). The radiographic model contained older age, greater quadriceps circumference, knee pain, knee baseline Kellgren/Lawrence grade 1 (versus 0), greater hip α-angle, greater spinal bone mineral density, and contralateral RKOA at baseline as predictors (AUC = 0.797). Calibration tests showed good agreement between the observed and predicted incident RKOA. A clinical risk score tool was developed from the clinical model.

Conclusion

Two models predicting incident RKOA within 4 years were developed, including radiographic variables that improved model performance. First-time predictor hip α-angle and contralateral RKOA suggest OA origins beyond the knee. The clinical tool has the potential to help physicians identify patients at risk of RKOA in routine practice, but the tool should be externally validated.

### Monitoring osteoporosis therapy: bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, or both? [^111eR25V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Monitoring the efficacy associated with antiresorptive therapy is an intuitive yet integral part of successful osteoporosis management. Although response rates to bisphosphonates in clinical trials — as judged by changes in bone mineral density (BMD) — are generally high, a small percentage of compliant patients do not respond. Accordingly, monitoring may help identify noncompliant patients and allow for other, possibly more successful, therapeutic interventions. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is the accepted method of assessing BMD to determine the need for treatment and to monitor its effects. Change in BMD is considered a valid intermediate end point for efficacy of fracture risk reduction. However, clinical trials have shown that the reduction in fracture risk associated with antiresorptive therapy may occur before changes in BMD become apparent. Vertebral fracture benefit is observed even among women who maintain rather than gain BMD during antiresorptive therapy. Clinical trials show that suppression of bone turnover markers after as little as 3 months of therapy is strongly associated with reductions in risk for fracture. Although formal guidelines for monitoring bone turnover markers do not yet exist, there are data to suggest that changes in these markers are valid intermediate endpoints for efficacy of fracture risk reduction that may provide valuable additional data on therapeutic success, particularly early in treatment and before changes in BMD become apparent.

### Risedronate sodium [^112k8xG3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Risedronate sodium treatment decreases the elevated rate of bone turnover that is typically seen in postmenopausal osteoporosis. In clinical trials, administration of risedronate sodium to postmenopausal women resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine and urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (markers of bone resorption) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (a marker of bone formation). At the 5 mg dose, decreases in deoxypyridinoline/creatinine were evident within 14 days of treatment. Changes in bone formation markers were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and bone formation; decreases in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase of about 20% were evident within 3 months of treatment. Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of about 40% below baseline values by the sixth month of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years. Bone turnover is decreased as early as 14 days and maximally within about 6 months of treatment, with achievement of a new steady-state that more nearly approximates the rate of bone turnover seen in premenopausal women. In a 1-year study comparing daily versus weekly oral dosing regimens of risedronate sodium for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week decreased urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide by 60% and 61%, respectively. In addition, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was also reduced by 42% and 41% in the risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week groups, respectively. When postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were treated for 1 year with risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily or risedronate sodium tablets 75 mg two consecutive days per month, urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide was decreased by 54% and 52%, respectively, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was reduced by 36% and 35%, respectively. In a 1–year study comparing risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily versus risedronate sodium tablets 150 mg once-a-month in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide was decreased by 52% and 49%, respectively, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was reduced by 31% and 32%, respectively.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^111A4ffd]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

History

Bone turnover markers (BTMs) allow us to study the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts at a whole-body level and have the advantages that they are noninvasive, inexpensive (£12.50 per test in the UK) and as a result allow for multiple measurements over time. The first bone turnover marker to be developed in the 1920s was total alkaline phosphatase, although this marker is not specific to bone. However, it is still widely used clinically for the diagnosis and monitoring of metabolic bone diseases such as Paget's disease and osteomalacia. However, for diseases with smaller changes of bone turnover such as osteoporosis, the BTMs that are more specific to bone have proven more useful.

The next major development in assays for bone turnover was the introduction of hydroxyproline assays in the 1960s. In contrast to total alkaline phosphatase, which is a bone formation marker, hydroxyproline reflects bone resorption. Hydroxyproline excretion in the urine is influenced by hydroxyproline in the diet and is not specific to bone. Total deoxypyridinoline is a more bone-specific marker, which is not influenced strongly by diet. The assay was introduced in the 1980s. A marker of bone formation that was specific for bone was introduced around 1980, namely osteocalcin, initially called bone Gla-protein. In the 1990s, immunoassays became available for other bone formation markers such as the C- and N-propeptides of type I procollagen and bone ALP. Immunoassays also became available for markers of bone resorption such as CTX and NTX and the enzyme TRACP5b.

The final major development was in assay technology; the immunoassays used radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) techniques and these were mostly replaced by the more precise and accurate automated immunoassay analyzers that use chemiluminescence or electrochemiluminescence. Currently, assays for bone ALP, OC, PINP, CTX, urinary NTX (uNTX), and TRACP5b are widely available, and these will now be described in detail.

### Does bone resorption stimulate periosteal expansion? A cross-sectional analysis of β-C-telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX), genetic markers of the RANKL pathway, and periosteal circumference as measured by pQCT [^116q1LpQ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

The positive association between CTX and bone area and PC was only evident after adjusting for body size, reflecting a separate inverse association between CTX and bone size acting via weight. The latter pathway reflects two distinct components. We have previously reported positive associations between fat and lean mass, and bone area and PC as measured by DXA and pQCT respectively. 10 Furthermore, there appeared to be an inverse association between CTX and fat and lean mass, consistent with previous reports of an inverse association between fat mass and another turnover marker, osteocalcin. 24 Although we are not aware of equivalent reports of associations of CTX with lean mass, possibly this relationship reflects the pathway between bone turnover and energy balance previously suggested by Karsenty and colleagues, thought to be mediated by osteocalcin. 25

To explore the causal nature of the association between CTX and PC, we applied an instrumental variable approach, as previously used to examine the relationship between fat mass and bone mass. 27 Although bone resorption was evaluated by measurement of plasma CTX, to our knowledge, no genetic markers for CTX are available. Therefore, we selected genetic instruments on the basis of i) known biological role in bone metabolism restricted to bone resorption, and ii) established association with areal/cortical BMD. RANKL/RANK/OPG was ideally suited for this purpose; this pathway plays a major role in regulating osteoclast differentiation, to which its biological effects are restricted as evidenced by extensive animal and clinical data; 28 SNPs related to RANKL/RANK/OPG are not only robustly associated with areal BMD, but also this is one of the three key pathways found to explain genetic variability of this trait. 19 Consistent with the suggestion that SNPs related to RANKL/RANK/OPG can be used as genetic instruments for bone resorption, the rs1021188 RANKL SNP has previously been related to RANKL expression 23 and to cortical porosity as measured by high‐resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR‐pQCT). 13 Moreover, in the present study, a large proportion of RANK/RANKL/OPG SNPs showed equivalent associations with CTX levels, BMD C, and CT to those seen for areal BMD. Even in the case of those RANK/RANKL/OPG SNPs that showed little evidence of association with CTX, we assume that their association with BMD is mediated by altered levels of bone resorption, given that the role of the RANK/RANKL/OPG system is restricted to regulation of osteoclast function.

### Are there autoantibodies reacting against citrullinated peptides derived from type I and type II collagens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? [^11168kVY]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the possible presence in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of autoantibodies recognising citrullinated peptides derived from type I and II collagens.

Methods

Firstly, the binding of four pairs of synthetic peptides (arginine-containing and artificially citrullinated forms) related to different regions of human type II collagen were tested with sera from 120 patients with RA and 81 controls. Secondly, two similar pairs of peptides related to the carboxy terminal telopeptides of the alpha1 and alpha2 chains of human type I collagen were tested.

Results

42–53% of the RA sera showed increased binding of arginine peptides related to type II collagen. However, 12 RA sera bound the citrullinated form of the alpha1(II) telopeptide more strongly than the corresponding arginine peptide. 20 RA sera bound the citrullinated carboxytelopeptide from the alpha1 chain of type I collagen (alpha1(I) telopeptide) more strongly than the respective arginine peptide. The correlation between the autoantibodies to type I and II collagen telopeptides was r(s) = 0.576, p < 0.001. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) assay was positive in 71/120 (59%) patients with RA. An anti-CCP assay detects a different subgroup of antibodies than anti-telopeptide assays. However, both anti-telopeptide and anti-CCP antibodies were increased in patients with RA.

Conclusion

Some patients with RA were identified whose sera contained antibodies that specifically bound citrullinated peptides related to the carboxy terminal telopeptides of the alpha1 and alpha2 chains of type I collagen and the alpha1 chains of type II collagen (sequences YYXA, FYXA, and YMXA, where X stands for citrulline).

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^111NfYtU]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

BTMs can be very useful when managing patients with osteoporosis and these should include PINP or CTX. They can be used in monitoring patients on antiresorptive medications, mainly bisphosphonates. Two approaches can be used, which include the least significant change and the reference mean approach. Patients can be divided into responders and nonresponders. Following the discontinuation of bisphosphonates, these 2 approaches can also be used to monitor the offset of effect and decide whether treatment needs to be restarted. When using teriparatide, BTMs can be used to monitor the response in treatment. When stopping treatment with denosumab, there is a risk of an overshoot in BTMs. Current recommendations suggest the use of BTMs for deciding the introduction of a bisphosphonate to prevent bone loss, but the timing has not been optimized.

Currently, BTMs have limited value in clinical practice when predicting bone loss and in predicting fractures. There is also insufficient data to suggest their use in deciding about osteoporosis treatment and in the prediction of response.

Other Bone Diseases

Primary hyperparathyroidism

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine disorder characterized by elevated PTH and calcium concentrations. It has been linked to complications such as osteoporosis and kidney stones. The definitive treatment is parathyroid surgery. A milder form has been described, referred to as normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (NPHPT). This is usually defined as persistent normal calcium, with increased PTH, although intermittent hypercalcemia has also been described; other causes of elevated PTH have to be excluded before the diagnosis is made (eg, vitamin D deficiency, idiopathic hypercalciuria, etc.).

PHPT is characterized by high bone turnover. BTM levels are significantly increased in patients with PHPT compared with controls. This is true irrespective of whether they have skeletal symptoms or whether they have mild disease. Although increased, not all are above the reference range. These BTMs do not seem to increase when following up patients for 5 years. It is impossible to draw conclusions in the setting of NPHPT due to the different definitions used in publications. Some studies found that PHPT and NPHPT patients had similar BTM levels, while others showed lower levels in NPHPT. When comparing NPHPT to controls, results are still inconsistent with one study showing higher levels, while another study showed similar levels.

Peak concentrations of PICP at 1 month of treatment were approximately 41% above baseline, followed by a decline to near-baseline values by 12 months. BSAP concentrations increased by 1 month of treatment and continued to rise more slowly from 6 through 12 months. The maximum increases of BSAP were 45% above baseline in women and 23% in men. After discontinuation of therapy, BSAP concentrations returned toward baseline. The increases in formation markers were accompanied by secondary increases in the markers of bone resorption: urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling. Changes in BSAP, NTX, and DPD were lower in men than in women, possibly because of lower systemic exposure to teriparatide in men.

In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide on serum markers of bone turnover were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of teriparatide following single subcutaneous administration of BONSITY in patients with osteoporosis are shown in Table 2.

Absorption — Teriparatide is absorbed after subcutaneous injection; the absolute bioavailability is approximately 95% based on pooled data from 20-, 40-, and 80-mcg doses (1-, 2-, and 4-times the recommended dosage, respectively). The peptide reaches peak serum concentrations about 30 minutes after subcutaneous injection of a 20-mcg dose and declines to non-quantifiable concentrations within 3 hours.

Distribution — Volume of distribution following intravenous injection is approximately 0.12 L/kg.

Elimination — Systemic clearance of teriparatide (approximately 62 L/hour in women and 94 L/hour in men) exceeds the rate of normal liver plasma flow, consistent with both hepatic and extra-hepatic clearance.

No metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide. Peripheral metabolism of PTH is believed to occur by non-specific enzymatic mechanisms in the liver followed by excretion via the kidneys.

Paget's disease of bone — biochemical targets and remission risk: The usual aim is to reduce turnover values into the lower half of the reference range, and after zoledronate achieving total ALP in the lower half of the normal range at 6 months was associated with a 6-year risk of losing therapeutic response of < 10%. Duration of biochemical remission correlates inversely with the minimum post-treatment value and also with the shortterm reduction in turnover.

### Teriparatide (Forteo) [^114XPjzL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects on Markers of Bone Turnover — Daily administration of FORTEO to men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in clinical studies stimulated bone formation, as shown by increases in the formation markers serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP). Data on biochemical markers of bone turnover were available for the first 12 months of treatment. Peak concentrations of PICP at 1 month of treatment were approximately 41% above baseline, followed by a decline to near-baseline values by 12 months. BSAP concentrations increased by 1 month of treatment and continued to rise more slowly from 6 through 12 months. The maximum increases of BSAP were 45% above baseline in women and 23% in men.

The half-life of teriparatide in serum was approximately 1 hour when administered by subcutaneous injection.

No metabolism or excretion studies have been performed with teriparatide. Peripheral metabolism of PTH is believed to occur by non-specific enzymatic mechanisms in the liver followed by excretion via the kidneys.

### Risedronate sodium (atelvia) [^111Z3mMY]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Risedronate has an affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and acts as an antiresorptive agent. At the cellular level, risedronate inhibits osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface, but show evidence of reduced active resorption (for example, lack of ruffled border). Histomorphometry in rats, dogs, and minipigs showed that risedronate treatment reduces bone turnover (activation frequency, that is, the rate at which bone remodeling sites are activated) and bone resorption at remodeling sites.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Risedronate treatment decreases the elevated rate of bone turnover that is typically seen in postmenopausal osteoporosis. In clinical trials, administration of risedronate sodium immediate- release to postmenopausal women resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine and urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (markers of bone resorption) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (a marker of bone formation). At the 5 mg daily dose, decreases in deoxypyridinoline/creatinine were evident within 14 days of treatment. Changes in bone formation markers were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and bone formation; decreases in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase of about 20% were evident within 3 months of treatment. Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of about 40% below baseline values by the sixth month of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years. Bone turnover is decreased as early as 14 days and maximally within about 6 months of treatment, with achievement of a new steady-state that more nearly approximates the rate of bone turnover seen in premenopausal women. In a 1-year study comparing Atelvia 35 mg weekly taken immediately after breakfast versus risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily oral dosing regimens in postmenopausal women, mean decreases from baseline at 1 year in urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide were 47% in the Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week following breakfast group and 42% in the risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily group. In addition, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase at 1 year was reduced by 33% in the Atelvia 35 mg once-a-week following breakfast group and 32% in the risedronate sodium immediate-release 5 mg daily group.

Reference Intervals

The clinical interpretation of the BTMs should be based on a comparison with a BTM reference interval, measured with the same assay and in the same population. For females, these reference intervals are usually based on BTMs in young healthy premenopausal women who are assumed to have the lowest bone turnover and the lowest rates of bone loss. These levels are thought to reflect "optimal bone health"; therefore, when treating older women with osteoporosis this range is the target. For males, the reference intervals are based on samples from healthy males from between 40 to 60 years. There are regional differences that might be associated with sources of variability, such as ethnicity, smoking, exercise, menstrual cycle, vitamin D status. Tables 7 and 8 show reference ranges for CTX and PINP for females and Tables 9 and 10 for males. Studies performed in different populations, using different assays, showed similar reference values for PINP. In contrast, the results for CTX were less consistent, highlighting the need for specific reference ranges.

Sometimes, it is clinically useful to compare the BTM results from an older woman with women of the same age. For example, the clinical question may be "is the bone turnover high for her age?" Reference ranges for postmenopausal women are reported in Table 11.

CKD-MBD serum markers for bone disease — parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase — are addressed as follows: "In patients with CKD stages 3–5D, we suggest that serum PTH or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase measurement can be used to evaluate bone disease because markedly high or low values predict underlying bone turnover (2B)". The page notes that these levels "correlate with some histomorphometric measurements in bone biopsy specimens", but "the positive predictive value for both tests is only modest", and because biopsy "is not feasible in most patients", the group "issued a weak recommendation suggesting measurement of these serum markers because they may be useful to estimate bone turnover, especially when values are very abnormal", and "This recommendation is applicable to the United States".

### Serial markers of bone turnover in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid for detection of bone metastases progression [^113uZt8v]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study assessed the usefulness of serial measurements of bone turnover markers in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid to detect disease progression.

Methods

Serum measurements of total alkaline phosphatase (tALP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP), cross-linked N-terminal (NTx) and cross-linked C-terminal (CTx) telopeptides of type I collagen, amino-terminal procollagen propeptides of type I collagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (ICTP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were performed in 77 prostate cancer patients suffering from bone metastases and treated with zoledronic acid up to 15 mo. Fifty patients were with and 27 patients without objective evidence of metastatic bone progression during the administration of zoledronic acid.

Results

The baseline bone marker concentrations were not significantly different between the groups. After administration of zoledronic acid all bone markers except of ICTP decreased compared with baseline. CTx showed the greatest decrease. In patients with metastatic bone progression PINP, tALP, bALP, and ICTP were significantly higher at weeks 24, 36, 48, and 60 after starting treatment with zoledronic acid compared with patients without progression. In addition to the information of prostate-specific antigen as a monitoring parameter, the bone formation marker showed a better distinction between patients with and without disease progression.

Conclusions

Selected bone turnover markers provide valuable information regarding progression of bone metastasis in men with metastatic prostate cancer under bisphosphonate therapy. The clinical impact should be confirmed in prospective randomised studies.

### Romosozumab-aqqg (Evenity) [^116mUkLo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

EVENITY inhibits the action of sclerostin, a regulatory factor in bone metabolism. EVENITY increases bone formation and, to a lesser extent, decreases bone resorption. Animal studies showed that romosozumab-aqqg stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical bone surfaces by stimulating osteoblastic activity resulting in increases in trabecular and cortical bone mass and improvements in bone structure and strength [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, EVENITY increased the bone formation marker procollagen type 1 N-telopeptide (P1NP) with a peak increase from baseline of approximately 145% compared to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment, followed by a return to concentrations seen with placebo at month 9 and a decline from baseline to approximately 15% below the concentration change seen with placebo at month 12.

EVENITY decreased the bone resorption marker type 1 collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) with a maximal reduction from baseline of approximately 55% compared to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment. CTX remained below concentrations seen with placebo and was approximately 25% below the concentration change seen with placebo at month 12.

After discontinuation of EVENITY, P1NP levels returned to baseline within 12 months; CTX increased above baseline levels within 3 months and returned toward baseline levels by month 12.

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

Administration of a single dose of 210 mg EVENITY in healthy volunteers resulted in a mean (standard deviation [SD]) maximum romosozumab-aqqg serum concentration (Cmax) of 22.2 (5.8) mcg/mL and a mean (SD) AUC of 389 (127) mcg*day/mL. Steady-state concentrations were achieved by month 3 following the monthly administration of 210 mg to postmenopausal women. The mean trough serum romosozumab-aqqg concentrations at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 ranged from 8 to 13 mcg/mL.

Romosozumab-aqqg exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics with exposure increasing greater than dose proportionally (e.g., 550-fold increase in mean AUCinffor the 100-fold increase in subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg [0.03 to 3.3 times the approved recommended dosage for a 70 kg woman).

Absorption

The median time to maximum romosozumab-aqqg concentration (Tmax) is 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days).

### Serum carboxyterminal telopeptide (ICTP) as a prognostic marker in bone metastases (BM) treated with bisphosphonates… [^112LyG9U]. ASCO (2006). Low credibility.

Abstract 10107 Background: Biochemical markers of bone turnover, such as N- and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen have been evaluated as prognostic matkers in patients with BM. In one of such study, we found that ICTP was not affected by bisphosphonate therapy. In this prospective study we analyzed whether the baseline level of ICTP was predictive of skeletal related events as defined by: pathologic fractures, radiation to treat BM or spinal cord compression; time to progression and overall survival in patients with BM from solid tumors under BP therapy. The occurrence of SREs was recorded during the study and an objective evaluation of BM status was performed every 4–6 months. During the time period on study, patients received treatment with IV zoledronate, IV pamidronate, or more than one BP.

The proportional hazards model was used to investigate the correlation of ICTP baseline level with time to first SRE, TTP, and OS; and Poisson regression with the skeletal morbidity rate: number of SREs/person/year. Median TTSRE was 20 months and the SMR was 0.
84. Median TTP was 12 months and median OS time was 29 months. ICTP levels above 6. 2 μg/L were associated with increased mortality risk
2. 86, 95%CI 1. 37–6. 00, p = 0. 005) and increased SMR, but not with TTP or TTSRE. Conclusions: Elevated serum ICTP levels is associated with decreased survival and increased incidence of SREs in BM patients on BP therapy. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### Urinary N-telopeptide levels discriminate normal, osteopenic, and osteoporotic bone mineral density… [^115mc9Jd]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

The level of urinary, type I collagen, crosslinked N-telopeptides is a new marker of bone resorption. To our knowledge, no population-based studies of older adults have determined whether this measure can identify individuals with osteoporosis. Objectives: To measure the levels of NTX in a crosssectional study of ambulatory, older, white adults and to evaluate whether this measure of bone resorption could identify individuals with osteoporosis. Patients and Methods: The subjects, aged 50 to 98 years, formed 3 groups: 374 men, 223 women currently using estrogen, and 364 women not currently using estrogen. A standard medical history and validated record of medication use were obtained. Height and weight were measured. Bone mineral density was measured at the hip and lumbar spine using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The levels of NTX were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results: Overall, the levels of NTX increased slightly with age in men and in estrogen users and more dramatically in nonestrogen users. In a model adjusted for all major risk factors for osteoporosis, there was a significant decrease in BMD levels by increasing quintiles of NTX levels at the hip and spine in women with and without estrogen use and at the hip in men. Using sexspecific, peak bone mass criteria and age-adjusted analyses, the levels of NTX discriminated between normal, osteopenic, and osteoporotic BMD levels in all groups except the spine in men. Conclusions: The levels of NTX uniquely discriminated between older adults with normal, osteopenic, or osteoporotic BMD levels. If confirmed, these data suggest that NTX levels could be used to predict current osteoporosis in older men and women. Arch Intern Med. 1997; 157: 1241–1245. Schneider DL, Barrett-Connor EL.

### Standard vs longer-interval zoledronic acid dosing for bone metastases… [^114Roma8]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The proportions of skeletal-related events did not differ significantly between the every 4-week dosing group vs the every 12-week dosing group for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma. Pain scores, performance status scores, incidence of jaw osteonecrosis, and kidney dysfunction did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Skeletal morbidity rates were numerically identical in both groups, but bone turnover was greater among patients who received zoledronic acid every 12 weeks. The hypothesis of this study was that zoledronic acid administered every 12 weeks for 2 years would be noninferior to zoledronic acid administered at the standard interval of every 4 weeks for 2 years among patients with metastatic breast cancer, metastatic prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma.

Patients who agreed to participate in the C-terminal telopeptide companion study were accrued sequentially as they enrolled in the primary study. At baseline and at 12-week intervals for 2 years, 10 mL of peripheral venous blood was collected from each participant. Serum was separated and refrigerated immediately. Serum samples were submitted to a central repository where they were stored at −70°C until analysis. C-terminal telopeptide levels were assayed using the Serum Crosslaps enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The skeletal morbidity rate was assessed and defined as the mean number of skeletal-related events per year. Suppression of the bone turnover marker C-terminal telopeptide was measured in a subset of patients. Additional prespecified secondary outcomes from the companion pharmacogenetic and cost-effectiveness studies will be reported elsewhere.

For patients in the companion C-terminal telopeptide study, a linear mixed-effects model was used to compare C-terminal telopeptide levels over time between the 2 treatment groups. Variables included in this model were treatment, linear time, quadratic time, and a linear time × treatment interaction term. In addition, this model allowed for random, patient-specific intercepts and linear time slopes. A total of 553 patients were enrolled in the companion C-terminal telopeptide study. These patients were similar to the entire trial population by baseline characteristics. Because of administrative stopping point errors, enrollments for the primary and C-terminal telopeptide studies exceeded target accruals by 64 and 357 patients, respectively. All available samples were assayed.

### NCT01152580 | Melatonin osteoporosis prevention study… [^113M3o3x]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

The current thinking on the development of osteoporosis is that the changes in bone turnover that occur with aging play a major factor. One study which measured markers of bone formation, such as osteocalcin, and markers of bone resorption, such as type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide, showed that rates of bone formation and resorption are high in elderly women. However, bone resorption increases more so than bone formation leading resorption to be the major determinant of bone mass. These biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption may play an important role in monitoring therapy. In a recent review that examined clinical studies in which bone turnover markers were measured after beginning treatment with a bisphosphonate, the data showed that suppression of bone turnover markers occurred after as little as three months of therapy. Melatonin works through melatonin receptors to form osteoblasts from human mesenchymal stem cells and has been shown to inhibit osteoclast activity in rodents. Melatonin levels have been correlated with modulating bone markers whereby low nocturnal levels of melatonin correlate with in an increase in bone marker metabolism and osteoporosis. The addition of exogenous melatonin suppresses bone marker metabolism. Work from my laboratory reveals that application of melatonin to human bone stem cells grown in culture enhances alkaline phosphatase activity by 50% and calcium deposition by 10-fold. These reports show variable effects of melatonin ranging from 400 pM in rat, to 5 mg melatonin in mouse to 50 nM on human mesenchymal stem cells grown in culture. The bioavailability of melatonin is 17% in females taking 250 mcg melatonin po. [. Expected Outcomes.

We expect perimenopausal women taking melatonin to show an improvement in overall bone health as revealed by an increase in bone density, an increase in OC and a decrease in NTX levels when compared to those women taking placebo. We also expect those taking melatonin to have better control over their menopausal symptoms, better quality of life and less sleep disturbances compared to their placebo controls.
