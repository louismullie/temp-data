## Question

What are the treatment options for hyperandrogenism in females with adrenal hyperplasia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for hyperandrogenism in females with adrenal hyperplasia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing classic from nonclassic CAH. Then, I should verify the treatment goals and core principles. Next, I will examine glucocorticoid therapy, including agent selection, dosing, and monitoring. After that, I need to consider mineralocorticoid therapy for salt-wasting forms. Then, I will review adjunctive antiandrogen and contraceptive strategies for cutaneous symptoms. I should also address fertility planning and pregnancy management. Finally, I will integrate special populations, monitoring, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking areas where guidelines are evolving or controversial [^1114eNNi] [^111nJPcf].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and phenotype because treatment hinges on this distinction. Classic CAH is usually diagnosed in infancy with virilization and often salt-wasting, whereas nonclassic CAH presents later with mild hyperandrogenism and can mimic PCOS; screening with an early morning follicular-phase 17-hydroxyprogesterone and confirmatory ACTH stimulation testing is appropriate when NCCAH is suspected, and I should remember that CAH is a recognized cause of hyperandrogenism in women, albeit less common than PCOS [^1114eNNi] [^113ihyb4] [^111nEQmE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure the treatment goals are explicit. The overarching aims are to replace cortisol (and aldosterone when deficient), suppress ACTH-driven androgen excess, restore ovulatory cycles and fertility, control hirsutism/acne/alopecia, and minimize glucocorticoid overtreatment risks such as obesity, osteoporosis, and hypertension; I should confirm that guidelines emphasize clinical control over biochemical perfection, since complete 17OHP suppression signals overtreatment rather than optimal control [^111dDM1M] [^114ZiMjM].

> Next, I will examine glucocorticoid therapy as the cornerstone for classic CAH. Hydrocortisone is generally preferred in children and often in adults to mimic physiologic rhythms, though prednisolone or prednisone can be used in adults for convenience; the dose should be titrated to clinical endpoints such as regular menses, stable energy, and absence of hyperandrogenic features, while avoiding cushingoid effects; I should double-check that androstenedione and testosterone are useful markers of control, and that ACTH is not helpful for monitoring in CAH [^111dDM1M] [^114ZiMjM] [^117AKbKw].

> Wait, let me verify the approach in nonclassic CAH, because overtreatment is a common pitfall. In asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults with NCCAH, guidelines recommend against routine glucocorticoids; however, in women with patient-important hyperandrogenism or infertility, a cautious, low-dose glucocorticoid trial is reasonable, balancing benefits against risks of iatrogenic Cushingoid effects; I should confirm that comparative data suggest oral contraceptives may outperform glucocorticoids for hirsutism regression in some settings, which can guide shared decision-making [^11756sv3] [^113vdRjZ] [^112DAzqN].

> I need to check mineralocorticoid therapy next, since salt-wasting classic CAH requires fludrocortisone. The dose should be titrated to normalize serum potassium, maintain age-appropriate plasma renin activity, and support blood pressure, especially upright; I should confirm that plasma renin is a reliable marker of adequacy and that mineralocorticoid antagonists like spironolactone are relatively contraindicated in salt-wasting CAH because they can worsen volume depletion [^111dDM1M] [^112fJBEV].

> Let me consider adjunctive therapies for persistent cutaneous hyperandrogenism despite optimized glucocorticoids. Combined oral contraceptives with an antiandrogenic progestin such as drospirenone reduce ovarian and adrenal androgen production, increase SHBG, and provide cycle control; spironolactone is effective for hirsutism but must be paired with reliable contraception due to teratogenic risk; finasteride or dutasteride can be added for additional 5α-reductase inhibition; I should confirm that cyproterone acetate has evidence for greater hirsutism reduction than hydrocortisone in NCCAH, while remembering regional availability and hepatotoxicity monitoring for some agents [^112fJBEV] [^116TWw2x] [^115qdhxq].

> But wait, what if the patient desires pregnancy or has infertility. I should confirm that glucocorticoid therapy can improve ovulation and reduce miscarriage risk in some women with NCCAH, and that during pregnancy, hydrocortisone or prednisolone should be continued with dose adjustments as needed, while dexamethasone should be avoided because it crosses the placenta; stress dosing is required during labor and delivery, and coordinated endocrine–obstetric care is essential [^114AEFY2] [^116SFRqg] [^11433DxH].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In adolescents, I should avoid overtreatment with glucocorticoids once adult height is achieved and consider OCs as first-line for hyperandrogenic symptoms; in postmenopausal women, I need to ensure I exclude androgen-secreting tumors when testosterone is markedly elevated and consider antiandrogens for milder symptoms; in those with severe, refractory hyperandrogenism despite optimized medical therapy, bilateral adrenalectomy may be considered in expert centers, recognizing lifelong adrenal insufficiency and the need for meticulous replacement and monitoring [^113vdRjZ] [^116vjH8k] [^116mk9XX].

> Next, I should review monitoring and dose adjustment to avoid both under- and overtreatment. Clinical assessment of fatigue, hirsutism, acne, menses, blood pressure, weight, and bone health should guide therapy; biochemical targets include age- and sex-appropriate androstenedione and testosterone, with 17OHP used to detect overtreatment rather than as a target for suppression; I need to ensure stress-dose protocols for illness, surgery, and trauma, and to adjust glucocorticoid doses when initiating or stopping OCs due to their effects on adrenal androgens [^113r6LHW] [^114ZiMjM] [^111dDM1M].

> Hold on, I should verify a practical decision framework. For classic CAH, lifelong glucocorticoid therapy with mineralocorticoid as indicated is mandatory, with adjunctive antiandrogens or OCs for persistent symptoms; for nonclassic CAH with distressing hyperandrogenism or infertility, a time-limited, low-dose glucocorticoid trial is reasonable, with OCs or antiandrogens as alternatives or adjuncts; for asymptomatic NCCAH, observation without glucocorticoids is preferred; throughout, I must screen for and exclude mimics such as PCOS, androgen-secreting tumors, Cushing syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid disease before anchoring on CAH-specific therapy [^113vdRjZ] [^111uWCrD] [^115uNwMe].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dexamethasone might be acceptable in pregnancy because of its potency, but I should correct that; dexamethasone crosses the placenta and is not recommended for CAH management in pregnancy, so hydrocortisone or prednisolone should be used instead, with individualized dose adjustments and stress coverage at delivery [^116SFRqg] [^11433DxH].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and evolving therapies. Novel approaches such as modified-release hydrocortisone, antiandrogen–aromatase inhibitor combinations, and CRH antagonists are under investigation; until higher-quality prospective data emerge, these should remain within trials, and clinicians should avoid experimental regimens outside formal studies while continuing to optimize conventional therapy and minimize long-term glucocorticoid toxicity [^1114eNNi] [^116dki7Y] [^112HFLJw].

Treatment of hyperandrogenism in females with adrenal hyperplasia centers on **glucocorticoid therapy** to suppress adrenal androgens [^11756sv3], with hydrocortisone preferred in children and prednisone or dexamethasone in adults [^notfound]. For refractory symptoms, add **antiandrogens** (spironolactone, finasteride, or cyproterone acetate) [^116TWw2x] and combined oral contraceptives [^112fJBEV]; avoid spironolactone in salt-wasting CAH [^112fJBEV]. Monitor for adrenal insufficiency, Cushingoid effects, and bone loss, and adjust therapy to balance control with side effects [^112rVAQw]. Consider bilateral adrenalectomy only in severe, refractory cases [^116mk9XX].

---

## Glucocorticoid therapy

Glucocorticoids are the **cornerstone of treatment**, suppressing ACTH and adrenal androgens [^1114eNNi]. Hydrocortisone is preferred in children for its shorter half-life and lower risk of growth suppression; adults may use prednisone or dexamethasone for convenience, but long-acting agents increase Cushingoid risks [^115P7vHn].

- **Hydrocortisone**: 10–20 mg/day in divided doses; adjust to clinical response and androgen levels [^111dDM1M].
- **Prednisone**: 5–7.5 mg/day; monitor for side effects.
- **Dexamethasone**: 0.25–0.5 mg/day; effective but higher risk of Cushingoid effects [^111dDM1M].

---

## Mineralocorticoid therapy

Mineralocorticoids are indicated in **salt-wasting CAH** to prevent hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and dehydration. Fludrocortisone is the agent of choice, titrated to normalize electrolytes and plasma renin activity [^117AKbKw].

---

## Antiandrogen therapy

Antiandrogens are used when **glucocorticoids alone are insufficient** or contraindicated [^112fJBEV]. Spironolactone is effective for hirsutism and acne but is relatively contraindicated in salt-wasting CAH due to its mineralocorticoid antagonism [^115qdhxq] [^114nucc2] [^112fJBEV]. Finasteride inhibits 5α-reductase and reduces hirsutism; cyproterone acetate is effective but not available in the US [^115qdhxq] [^116TWw2x].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Spironolactone | Androgen receptor antagonist | Hirsutism, acne | Contraindicated in salt-wasting CAH |
| Finasteride | 5α-reductase inhibitor | Hirsutism | Effective, well tolerated |
| Cyproterone acetate | Antiandrogen | Hirsutism | Not available in US |

---

## Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)

COCs suppress ovarian androgen production and increase SHBG, reducing free androgens [^113r6LHW]. They are effective for hirsutism and acne, especially when antiandrogens are contraindicated or insufficient [^11327dJw].

---

## Surgical options

Bilateral adrenalectomy is reserved for **severe, refractory cases** with significant hyperandrogenism despite maximal medical therapy [^116mk9XX]. It effectively reduces androgens but causes permanent adrenal insufficiency requiring lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management of side effects

Long-term glucocorticoid therapy carries risks, including **Cushingoid features**, osteoporosis, and adrenal insufficiency [^116ZcBtX]. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments are essential [^114ZiMjM].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Signs of Cushingoid effects, adrenal insufficiency, and hyperandrogenism [^111dDM1M].
- **Biochemical monitoring**: Androgen levels, electrolytes, plasma renin activity, and bone density [^114ZiMjM].
- **Dose adjustments**: Titrate to minimize side effects while maintaining control [^117AKbKw].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **modified-release hydrocortisone** to better mimic physiologic cortisol rhythms and novel antiandrogens targeting specific pathways of androgen synthesis and action [^1114eNNi] [^116dki7Y]. Gene therapy remains experimental [^116mk9XX].

---

Treatment of hyperandrogenism in females with adrenal hyperplasia requires a **multimodal approach**, with glucocorticoids as the foundation and antiandrogens and COCs as adjuncts. Therapy should be individualized, with close monitoring for side effects and adjustments to balance control and safety [^1114eNNi].

Glucocorticoid therapy for hyperandrogenism — Clinicians administer glucocorticoids long-term to suppress adrenal androgens in women with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency; in these patients, glucocorticoids help prevent or manage hirsutism and are effective for maintaining normal ovulatory cycles. In the nonclassic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency they are effective for ovulation induction, but their role in managing hirsutism is less clear. In pure adrenal hyperandrogenism, suppressing adrenal androgens results in only minor improvements in hirsutism, although prolonged remission after therapy withdrawal can occur.

During the past 50 years since the discovery of cortisone therapy as an effective treatment for CAH, many advances have been made in the management of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Despite these advances, the clinical management of patients with CAH is often complicated by abnormal growth and development, iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, inadequately treated hyperandrogenism, and infertility. New treatment approaches to classic CAH represent potential solutions to these unresolved issues. At the National Institutes of Health, a long-term randomized clinical trial is investigating a new treatment regimen: a reduced hydrocortisone dose, an antiandrogen, and an aromatase inhibitor. Peripheral blockade of androgens may also be helpful in the adult woman with CAH and PCOS. Other promising new treatment approaches include LHRH agonist-induced pubertal delay with or without growth hormone therapy, alternative glucocorticoid preparations or dose schedules, CRH antagonist treatment, and gene therapy. The applicability and success of these new approaches await the results of current research.

Other hyperandrogenic conditions include congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and androgen-producing tumors. CAH is an autosomal recessive disease caused by an enzyme deficiency in the adrenal cortex steroid biosynthesis, leading to low or absent production of cortisol with concomitant overproduction of adrenal androgens. The nonclassic variant of CAH has a prevalence of 1 of 1000 to 2000 individuals, is associated with mild symptoms of hyperandrogenism very similar to PCOS, and should be considered also in postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism. Classic CAH, on the other hand, is rare (1 of 10 000 to 20 000) and usually diagnosed in infancy because of varying degrees of virilization in females, or in the most severe cases because of life-threatening salt wasting. Furthermore, androgen-secreting tumors of either ovarian or adrenal origin are very rare and will cause symptoms of hyperandrogenism in both pre- and postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation differs from other hyperandrogenic conditions by the rapid progress of severe hyperandrogenism to virilization. In particular, the risk of malignancy of adrenal tumors should be considered.

Adrenal hyperandrogenism — comparative pharmacotherapy outcomes indicate discordant effects on androgens versus hirsutism: in randomized women with hirsutism of adrenal origin, serum DHEA and DHEAS decreased with dexamethasone but not with an oral contraceptive (OC), yet a greater proportion of OC recipients had significant hirsutism reduction (10 of 15 patients; 66%) than dexamethasone (4 of 13 patients; 31%); in nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH), cyproterone acetate (CPA) produced a larger decrease in hirsutism scores (54% after 1 year) than hydrocortisone (26%), whereas androgen levels normalized only with hydrocortisone.

### Pregnancy outcomes in women with congenital virilizing adrenal hyperplasia [^114Le9TJ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Although low fertility rates have traditionally been reported among women with classic CAH and especially among women with the salt-wasting variant, more recent data suggest that fertility rates are significantly improved, largely owing to earlier treatment of CAH, improved compliance with therapy, and surgical advances in genital reconstruction. Furthermore, ovulation induction and assisted reproductive techniques are now available to women who remain infertile despite effective adrenal androgen suppression. Although the pregnancy experience in women with classic CAH remains limited, it is apparent that, once pregnant, these women have a high probability of successful outcome. Key issues should be emphasized in the management of CAH during gestation, including the need for assessing adrenal steroid replacement and adrenal androgen suppression, particularly in light of the interplay between maternal hyperandrogenism and the protective effect of placental aromatase activity, which provides a relatively large margin of safety for the female fetus. Maternal hormone levels should be evaluated in the context of laboratory-specific reference ranges for pregnancy. The infant should be examined for ambiguous genitalia and monitored for evidence of adrenal insufficiency. Although an affected female infant with classic CAH has not been reported as a pregnancy outcome of a mother with classic virilizing CAH, these concerns should be discussed during preconception counseling. Patients should also be aware of the importance of medication compliance and careful hormonal monitoring during the entire pregnancy. In most cases, successful gestational management requires the close coordination of care between the obstetrician and endocrinologist.

Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia — treatment recommendations and exceptions: In children and adolescents with inappropriately early onset and rapid progression of pubarche or bone age and in adolescent patients with overt virilization we suggest glucocorticoid treatment of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In asymptomatic nonpregnant individuals with nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia we recommend against glucocorticoid treatment; technical remark: risks and benefits of glucocorticoid therapy should be considered and discussed with the patient's family. In previously treated patients with nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia we suggest giving the option of discontinuing therapy when adult height is attained or other symptoms resolve. In adult women with nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia who also have patient-important hyperandrogenism or infertility we suggest glucocorticoid treatment. In most adult males with nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, we suggest that clinicians generally not prescribe daily glucocorticoid therapy; technical remark: exceptions include infertility, testicular adrenal rest tumors or adrenal tumors, and phenotypes that are intermediate between classic and nonclassic phenotypes. In patients with nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, we suggest hydrocortisone stress dosing for major surgery, trauma, or childbirth only if a patient has a suboptimal (< 14 to 18 μg/dL, < 400 to 500 nmol/L) cortisol response to cosyntropin or iatrogenic adrenal suppression; technical remark: a range is given for cortisol cut points due to greater specificity of newer cortisol assays.

Management of hyperandrogenic symptoms in women with CAH — control may require treatment in addition to glucocorticoid (GC) and mineralocorticoid (MC), such as androgen‑receptor antagonists; oral contraceptives containing drospirenone effectively reduce both adrenal and ovarian androgen synthesis without affecting cortisol, blood pressure, PRA, or serum potassium levels; oral contraceptives cannot replace GC and MC treatment in classic CAH; and spironolactone is relatively contraindicated in salt‑wasting CAH because it is also an MC antagonist and can cause volume depletion.

Only one small, randomized, placebo-controlled study shows benefits from T therapy for women with hypopituitarism. If they are treated, they should be monitored as described below for women with HSDD. 3.2 We recommend against routinely measuring T in women for diagnosis, because a correlation between symptoms and T levels has not been established (1|⊕⊕○○). 3.3 We recommend against the routine use of DHEA therapy in women with adrenal insufficiency because data concerning its effectiveness and safety are limited (1|⊕⊕○○).

Hormone Replacement Therapy

The treatment of classic CAH consists of life-long replacement with glucocorticoids (Table 1) and, when indicated, mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone). Androgen excess is reduced by the glucocorticoid replacement therapy since adrenocorticotropin is inhibited. In addition to avoiding adrenal crisis and sudden death, overall treatment goals in girls and women with CAH are to obtain normal growth and development, normal bone maturation, and timing of puberty, and prevent symptoms of hyperandrogenism, infertility, and long-term complications including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and fractures. In addition, good cognitive development, self-esteem, and quality of life are equally important and may entail specific issues in these women.

Table 1.
Glucocorticoids used for treatment in women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Adapted from The 2018 Endocrine Society Guidelines and Claahsen-van der Grinten 2022

Clinical symptoms of undertreatment (fatigue, hyperandrogenic symptoms, anovulation, salt-craving, orthostatic hypotension) and overtreatment (inhibited growth, weight gain, loss of bone mass, hypertension) must be monitored continuously, and good disease control is particularly important during puberty, for optimizing fertility, and during pregnancy (Fig. 3). Serum levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), androstenedione, and testosterone are used for monitoring glucocorticoid treatment, and sodium, potassium, and renin for mineralocorticoid treatment. However, since there are no optimal biochemical markers for monitoring disease control, assessment of clinical symptoms is most important.

During acute illness or surgical intervention, it is important to increase the glucocorticoid dose sufficiently (Table 2). In case of fever above 38 °C, the daily dose should be doubled, and tripled if the temperature is above 39 °C. In cases of vomiting or severe diarrhea, intravenous or intramuscular injections of hydrocortisone are often necessary as the uptake from the gastrointestinal tract is not sufficient. Hospital admission and treatment with intravenous glucose and sodium chloride may also be required.

Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) — treatment recommendations: In children/adolescents with inappropriately early onset and rapid progression of pubarche or bone age and in adolescent patients with overt virilization, we suggest GC treatment of NCCAH (2|⊕⊕○○), and risks and benefits of GC therapy should be considered and discussed with the patient's family. In asymptomatic nonpregnant individuals with NCCAH we recommend against GC treatment (1|⊕⊕⊕○). In previously treated NCCAH, we suggest giving the option of discontinuing therapy when adult height is attained or other symptoms resolve (2|⊕⊕○○). In adult women with NCCAH with patient-important hyperandrogenism or infertility we suggest GC treatment (2|⊕⊕○○). In most adult males with NCCAH, we suggest that clinicians generally not prescribe daily GC therapy (2|⊕⊕○○), with technical remark exceptions including infertility, TARTs, or adrenal tumors and phenotypes intermediate between classic and nonclassic phenotypes. In NCCAH, we suggest HC stress dosing for major surgery, trauma, or childbirth only if a patient has a suboptimal (< 14 to 18 µg/ dL, < 400 to 500 nmol/L) cortisol response to cosyntropin or iatrogenic adrenal suppression (2|⊕○○○), noting the technical remark that a range is given for cortisol cut points due to greater specificity of newer cortisol assays.

### Evidence-based approach to cutaneous hyperandrogenism in women [^11327dJw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Hirsutism, acne, and androgenetic alopecia are classically considered signs of cutaneous hyperandrogenism (CHA). These common skin findings have significant impacts on the quality of patients' lives and pose the diagnostic challenge of excluding underlying disorders. Many with CHA have normal serum androgen levels. Hirsutism is more strongly associated with hyperandrogenism than are acne or androgenetic alopecia. Variable association of CHA with hyperandrogenemia results from the complexity of the underlying pathophysiology, including factors local to the pilosebaceous unit. CHA often occurs in the setting of polycystic ovary syndrome, the most common disorder of hyperandrogenism, but can also present in uncommon conditions, including nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia and androgen-producing tumors. A thorough history and full skin examination are important to guide appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Oral contraceptive pills with or without antiandrogens can provide therapeutic benefit for hirsutism and acne. Medical options for androgenetic alopecia remain limited. Multidisciplinary approaches may be needed given endocrine, metabolic, reproductive, and psychiatric disorders associated with CHA. More high-quality studies into the mechanisms of CHA and the benefits of antiandrogenic therapies are needed. We provide an evidence-based review of key diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in the treatment of women with CHA.

Conclusions

Adolescent females and women with classic CAH due to 21OHD face multiple disease- and treatment-related comorbidities. Clinical symptoms of undertreatment (fatigue, hyperandrogenic symptoms, anovulation, salt-craving, and orthostatic hypotension) and overtreatment (inhibited growth, weight gain, low BMD, and hypertension) must be monitored continuously, and good disease control is particularly important during puberty, to optimize fertility, and during pregnancy. Supportive transition from pediatric to adult care promoting self-management is strongly recommended. For female patients with classic CAH, genital virilization and/or complications from surgeries may present additional comorbidities and psychological burden affecting sexual life and general well-being. Furthermore, long-term metabolic risks including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis must be considered. For this purpose, it is important to avoid overtreatment and encourage a healthy lifestyle. Despite continued progress in the understanding of this complex disease, additional advances are needed to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

Abstract

Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (CAH) is a rare genetic condition that results in cortisol deficiency and excess production of adrenal androgens. While the introduction of newborn screening for CAH has reduced morbidity and mortality, management of CAH remains challenging. Lifelong treatment with glucocorticoids is required to replace the endogenous cortisol deficiency and reduce excess adrenal androgens. Undertreatment or overtreatment with glucocorticoids can lead to multiple disease- and treatment-related comorbidities, including impaired growth and compromised final height, menstrual irregularities and reduced fertility in females, and long-term cardiometabolic complications. In addition to avoiding adrenal crisis and sudden death, treatment goals in adolescent females with CAH are to obtain normal growth and bone maturation and normal timing of puberty. Management of adolescents is particularly challenging due to changes in growth and sex hormone levels that can lead to inadequate suppression of adrenal androgens and increasing independence that can affect treatment adherence. During the transition to adult care, treatment goals focus on preventing symptoms of hyperandrogenism, preserving menstrual regularity and fertility, and providing education and support for issues related to sexuality, atypical genitalia, and/or complications from previous surgical treatment. In addition, patients must be monitored continuously to prevent long-term complications such as decreased bone mineral density, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. In this review, we discuss the challenges faced by adolescent and adult females with CAH and provide guidance to health-care professionals to help patients to navigate these challenges.

The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict of interest review process for the development of clinical practice guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any potential conflicts of interest, which are reviewed before they are approved to serve on the Task Force and periodically during the development of the guideline. The conflict of interest forms are vetted by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) before the members are approved by the Society's Council to participate on the guideline Task Force. Participants in the guideline development must include a majority of individuals without conflict of interest in the matter under study. Participants with conflicts of interest may participate in the development of the guideline, but they must have disclosed all conflicts. The CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for this guideline and resolved or managed all identified conflicts of interest.

Conflicts of interest are defined by remuneration in any amount from the commercial interest(s) in the form of grants; research support; consulting fees; salary; ownership interest (eg, stocks, stock options, or ownership interest excluding diversified mutual funds); honoraria or other payments for participation in speakers' bureaus, advisory boards, or boards of directors; or other financial benefits. Completed forms are available through The Endocrine Society office.

Funding for this guideline was derived solely from The Endocrine Society, and thus the Task Force received no funding or remuneration from commercial or other entities.

1.0 Diagnosis of PCOS

Diagnosis in adults

1.1 We suggest that the diagnosis of PCOS be made if two of the three following criteria are met: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or PCO (Tables 1 and 2), whereas disorders that mimic the clinical features of PCOS are excluded. These include, in all women: thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, and nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (primarily 21-hydroxylase deficiency by serum 17-OHP) (Table 3). In select women with amenorrhea and more severe phenotypes, we suggest more extensive evaluation excluding other causes (Table 4) (2|⊕⊕⊕○).

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia describes a group of inherited autosomal recessive disorders characterized by an enzymatic defect in cortisol biosynthesis, compensatory increases in corticotropin secretion, and adrenocortical hyperplasia. 21-Hydroxylase deficiency is responsible for more than 95% of cases and is one of the most common known autosomal recessive disorders. The classic or severe type presents in the newborn period or early childhood with virilization and adrenal insufficiency, with or without salt loss; the mild or nonclassic form presents in late childhood or early adulthood with mild hyperandrogenism and is an important cause of masculinization and infertility in women. This wide range of phenotypic expression is mostly explained by genetic variation, although genotype-phenotype discrepancies have been described. Reproductive, metabolic, and other comorbid conditions, including risk for tumors, are currently under investigation in both forms of the disease. A high proportion of patients with adrenal incidentalomas may be homozygous or heterozygous for 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia often develop the polycystic ovary syndrome. Ectopic adrenal rest tissue is often found in the testes of men with congenital adrenal hyperplasia; characteristic clinical and radiologic findings help differentiate this tissue from other tumors. Levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone are elevated in patients with depression and anxiety and are expected to be elevated in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia; it is unknown whether patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency have an increased incidence of these psychiatric disorders. Abnormalities in both the structure and function of the adrenal medulla have been shown in patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and the degree of adrenomedullary impairment may be a biomarker of disease severity. The 21-hydroxylase-deficient mouse has provided a useful model with which to examine disease mechanisms and test new therapeutic interventions in classic disease, including gene therapy. Treatment of this condition is intended to reduce excessive corticotropin secretion and replace both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. However, clinical management is often complicated by inadequately treated hyperandrogenism, iatrogenic hypercortisolism, or both. New treatment approaches currently under investigation include combination therapy to block androgen action and inhibit estrogen production, and bilateral adrenalectomy in the most severely affected patients. Other approaches, which are in a preclinical stage of investigation, include treatment with a corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist and gene therapy.

Adjunct management of hyperandrogenic symptoms in classic CAH — control in young women may require treatment in addition to GC and MC, such as androgen‑receptor antagonists; oral contraceptives containing drospirenone effectively reduce both adrenal and ovarian androgen synthesis without affecting cortisol, blood pressure, PRA, or serum potassium, but they cannot replace GC and MC in classic CAH; spironolactone is relatively contraindicated in salt‑wasting CAH because it is also an MC antagonist and can cause volume depletion.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^116vjH8k]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism is a condition caused by relative or absolute androgen excess originating from the ovaries and/or the adrenal glands. Hirsutism, in other words, increased terminal hair growth in androgen-dependent areas of the body, is considered the most effective measure of hyperandrogenism in women. Other symptoms can be acne and androgenic alopecia or the development of virilization, including clitoromegaly. Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism may also be associated with metabolic disorders such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Mild hyperandrogenic symptoms can be due to relative androgen excess associated with menopausal transition or polycystic ovary syndrome, which is likely the most common cause of postmenopausal hyperandrogenism. Virilizing symptoms, on the other hand, can be caused by ovarian hyperthecosis or an androgen-producing ovarian or adrenal tumor that could be malignant. Determination of serum testosterone, preferably by tandem mass spectrometry, is the first step in the endocrine evaluation, providing important information on the degree of androgen excess. Testosterone > 5 nmol/L is associated with virilization and requires prompt investigation to rule out an androgen-producing tumor in the first instance. To localize the source of androgen excess, imaging techniques are used, such as transvaginal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the ovaries and computed tomography and MRI for the adrenals. Bilateral oophorectomy or surgical removal of an adrenal tumor is the main curative treatment and will ultimately lead to a histopathological diagnosis. Mild to moderate symptoms of androgen excess are treated with antiandrogen therapy or specific endocrine therapy depending on diagnosis. This review summarizes the most relevant causes of hyperandrogenism in postmenopausal women and suggests principles for clinical investigation and treatment.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^112dhtky]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism ranges from mild symptoms due to relative androgen excess during menopausal transition to virilizing symptoms caused by a hormone-producing ovarian or adrenal tumor that could be malignant. A thorough investigation must be performed to determine the underlying cause and to offer appropriate treatment. Onset of symptoms, development, and severity of symptoms are indicative for further investigation. Measurement of serum testosterone, preferably by LC–MS/MS, provides important information on the degree of androgen excess. Testosterone > 5 nmol/L is associated with virilizing symptoms and should prompt further investigation with imaging modalities to rule out an androgen-producing tumor. There is no discriminatory method to distinguish an ovarian hormone–producing tumor from ovarian hyperthecosis, although the latter is related to slower development of virilizing symptoms and bilateral ovarian enlargement. Surgery with bilateral oophorectomy or removal of an adrenal tumor is the main curative treatment and will ultimately lead to a histopathological diagnosis. GnRH analogs can be used as an alternative treatment of ovarian hyperthecosis. PCOS is probably the most common cause of mild to moderate symptoms of hyperandrogenism and testosterone < 5 nmol/L in postmenopausal women. In this case, the recommended treatment is antiandrogen therapy using an androgen receptor blocker and/or a 5α reductase inhibitor. NC CAH could be treated in a similar way or if needed with cortisone, whereas Cushing syndrome is primarily treated with surgery.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^117NNqfZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

When a patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery for a benign ovarian cause of severe hyperandrogenism, treatment with GnRH analogs is an alternative. Depending on the menopausal status of the patient, she may experience symptoms of estrogen withdrawal, and in this situation estrogen add-back therapy could be considered. Estrogen substitution is also important to consider during long-term treatment with GnRH analogs given the risk of accelerated bone loss.

The primary treatment for androgen-secreting adrenal tumors is adrenalectomy for histopathological diagnosis of malignant or benign tumor. Complete surgical resection can be sufficient therapy. In cases of malignancy, adjuvant therapy with mitotane, chemotherapy, or radiation may be used. Adrenal function must be closely monitored after surgery for detection of adrenal insufficiency or recurrent tumor.

Postmenopausal women with testosterone < 5 nmol/L and a history of PCOS with persistent or aggravating hyperandrogenic symptoms are treated with antiandrogen therapy. There are different types of antiandrogens with various mechanisms of action and potential side-effects. Ovarian androgen overproduction can be inhibited by GnRH analogues as mentioned above; androgen effects can be blocked by androgen receptor blockers (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or by a 5α reductase inhibitor (finasteride) blocking the conversion of testosterone to DHT, which is the most potent androgen in peripheral tissue. However, treatment of metabolic symptoms with metformin or other substances has limited effect on hyperandrogenic symptoms. The efficacy of antiandrogens for treatment of hirsutism is moderate, and it must be explained to the patient that it takes time before any treatment effect can be observed (at least 6 months) and that the effect disappears when treatment is stopped.

Postmenopausal women with NC CAH are usually treated with antiandrogens, similarly to PCOS, and cortisone is seldom needed. Cushing syndrome is primarily treated with surgery for an ACTH-producing pituitary or ectopic tumor or cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor. In some cases, medical therapy or radiation may be necessary.

### Clinical manifestations and challenges in adolescent and adult females with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^113r6LHW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Adulthood

There are several medical and psychosocial challenges for women with CAH, such as gynecological disorders affecting fertility and pregnancy outcomes, psychological problems related to sexuality and previous surgical treatment, as well as long-term metabolic risks and complications (see Fig. 3).

Menstrual Disturbances, Polycystic Ovaries, and Oral Contraceptives

The imbalance of steroid hormones caused by CAH leads to menstrual disturbances in up to 30% to 60% of female patients not on hormonal contraception. Adrenal androgen excess, including 11-oxygenated C19 steroids, may be an underlying cause, as increased androgens inhibit ovulation leading to anovulation and symptoms of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea. Polycystic ovaries can also be a consequence of ovarian androgen excess. In particular, NC-CAH is associated with clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome, that is, hirsutism, oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, and polycystic ovarian morphology. It is therefore important that individuals presenting with symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome undergo screening for CAH with 17OHP levels for accurate diagnosis of both conditions. To rule out CAH, a blood sample should be taken in the morning at the beginning of the menstrual cycle (early follicular phase) since 17OHP increases after ovulation and is highest during the luteal phase. Furthermore, progesterone elevation (> 2 nmol/L) in the follicular phase due to poor disease control and increased adrenal progesterone production may inhibit endometrial development and contribute to menstrual disturbances.

Optimizing glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid substitution should be the first step to improve menstrual function. In adulthood, prednisolone is often preferred since it allows for dosing twice a day, which can facilitate compliance. The glucocorticoid dose can often be lowered in adult patients, but this should be balanced to symptoms of hyperandrogenism. For women who do not wish to become pregnant, combined oral contraceptives (COCs) can be added to regulate menstruation and reduce symptoms of hyperandrogenism like hirsutism. COCs decrease androgen levels through various mechanisms, including a) inhibited ovarian androgen production, b) increased level of sex hormone–binding globulin leading to decreased free androgen index, and c) androgen receptor antagonism by certain progestogens. The production of adrenal androgens is also inhibited by COCs, which leads to a reduced need for glucocorticoids. It is therefore important to adjust the dose of glucocorticoids when initiating and stopping COCs.

The development of modified-release formulations of hydrocortisone and new treatment strategies may enable more efficient effects on hormonal control in CAH.

Summary

Objective

Hyperandrogenism in congenital adrenal hyperplasia provides an in vivo model for exploring the effect of androgens on erythropoiesis in women. We investigated the association of androgens with haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Hct) in women with.

Design

Cross‐validation study.

Patients

Women withfrom Sheffield Teaching Hospitals,(cohort 1, the training set: n = 23) and National Institutes of Health,(cohort 2, the validation set: n = 53).

Measurements

Androgens, full blood count and basic biochemistry, all measured on the same day. Demographic and anthropometric data.

Results

Significant age‐adjusted correlations (P < 0.001) were observed for Ln testosterone with Hb and Hct in cohorts 1 and 2 (Hb r = 0.712 & 0.524 and Hct r = 0.705 & 0.466), which remained significant after adjustments forstatus, glucocorticoid treatment dose and serum creatinine. In the combined cohorts, Hb correlated with androstenedione (P = 0.002) and 17‐hydroxyprogesterone (P = 0.008). Hb and Hct were significantly higher in cohort 1 than those in cohort 2, while there were no group differences in androgen levels, glucocorticoid treatment dose or body mass index. In both cohorts, women with Hb and Hct in the highest tertile had significantly higher testosterone levels than women with Hb and Hct in the lowest tertile.

Conclusions

In women with, erythropoiesis may be driven by androgens and could be considered a biomarker for disease control.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^1114eNNi]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders leading to multiple complex hormonal imbalances caused by various enzyme deficiencies in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway. The most common type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to steroid 21-hydroxylase (21-OHase, henceforth 21OH) deficiency. The rare, classic (severe) form caused by 21OH deficiency is characterised by life-threatening adrenal crises and is the most common cause of atypical genitalia in neonates with 46, XX karyotype. After the introduction of life-saving hormone replacement therapy in the 1950s and neonatal screening programmes in many countries, nowadays neonatal survival rates in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are high. However, disease-related mortality is increased and therapeutic management remains challenging, with multiple long-term complications related to treatment and disease affecting growth and development, metabolic and cardiovascular health, and fertility. Non-classic (mild) forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 21OH deficiency are more common than the classic ones; they are detected clinically and primarily identified in female patients with hirsutism or impaired fertility. Novel treatment approaches are emerging with the aim of mimicking physiological circadian cortisol rhythm or to reduce adrenal hyperandrogenism independent of the suppressive effect of glucocorticoids.

Evidence of clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess poses a unique differential in postmenopausal women.

### Cardiovascular risk in women with nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^115Xyx19]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The nonclassical form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal recessive disease that affects up to 1% of the general population. It is caused by mutations in the CYP21A2 gene that impair 21-hydroxylase activity, resulting in decreased cortisol production and increased secretion of adrenal androgens. Clinical manifestations in adult females include menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism, acne, and/or infertility, which are similar to those of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Traditionally, children with NCAH are treated with short-life glucocorticoids to preserve potential final height. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal therapy for adult females; some centers use low glucocorticoid (GC) doses to reduce adrenal hyperandrogenism, while others use symptom-directed medications such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) to normalize the menstrual cycle and/or cyproterone acetate or spironolactone for hirsutism.

### Are the endocrine society's clinical practice guidelines on androgen therapy in women misguided? A commentary [^113fjzko]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines on Androgen Therapy in Women (henceforth referred to as the Guidelines) do not necessarily represent the opinion held by the many health-care professionals and clinicians who are specialized in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of women's health in androgen insufficiency states. The recommendations provided in the published Guidelines are neither accurate nor complete. We disagree with the therapeutic nihilism promoted by these Guidelines. The members of the Guidelines Panel (henceforth referred to as the Panel), in their own disclaimer, stated that the Guidelines do not establish a standard of care. Based on data available in the contemporary literature, on the role of androgens in women's health, we provide in this commentary a point-by-point discussion of the arguments made by the Panel in arriving at their recommendations. It is our view that the Guidelines are not based on the preponderance of scientific evidence. Health-care professionals, physicians, and scientists often disagree when determining how best to address and manage new and emerging clinical issues. This is where we stand now as we endeavor to understand the role of androgens in a woman's health and welfare. Indeed, some basic facts are not in contention. All agree that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) production from the adrenal gland begins during the preteen years, peaks in the mid 20s, then declines progressively over time. In contrast, ovarian androgen (i.e., testosterone) secretion commences at puberty, is sustained during a woman's peak reproductive years and declines as a woman ages, with a more rapid and steep decrease after surgical menopause. However, there are ample data to suggest that adrenal androgens play a role in the development of axillary and pubic hair, and that testosterone is critical for women's libido and sexual function. We take this opportunity to invite members of the Panel on Androgen Therapy in Women to discuss, clarify, comment, or rebut any of the points made in this Commentary. It is our goal to elevate this debate in order to provide women who are afflicted with androgen insufficiency and sexual disorders with the highest quality health care and to relieve their distress and suffering, as well as to improve their quality of life.

### What every physician should know about polycystic ovary syndrome [^113F6m2J]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine cause of hirsutism, acne, and pattern alopecia. It is a heterogeneous syndrome of hyperandrogenic anovulation that is typically due to intrinsic ovarian dysfunction, which is often aggravated by insulin-resistant hyperinsulinemia with its risks of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome and their complications. Because there are many pitfalls to androgen assays, evaluation for hyperandrogenemia is suggested in women with moderate or severe hirsutism or hirsutism equivalents, menstrual irregularity, acanthosis nigricans, or intractable obesity. An endocrinologic work-up is necessary to rule out other hyperandrogenic disorders that require specific therapy (e.g., virilizing tumors, nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, and Cushing's syndrome). Ultrasonography helps in the differential diagnosis and may demonstrate the polycystic ovaries that have recently been vetted as an alternative to oligo-anovulation as a diagnostic criterion. Management of PCOS is determined by symptomatology. For those women not desiring pregnancy, the most common therapies are oral contraceptive pills, antiandrogens (contraindicated in the absence of adequate contraception), and insulin-lowering treatments (which have little effect on hirsutism).

Nonclassical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

CAH is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by low or absent production of cortisol and aldosterone with concomitant overproduction of androgens due to an enzyme deficiency in the adrenal cortex steroid biosynthesis. The most common type is 21-hydroxylase deficiency caused by a mutation in the gene (CYP21A1) encoding the adrenal 21-hydroxylase enzyme. There are different clinical forms of CAH depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency: the severe salt wasting form (SW CAH), the simple virilizing form (SV CAH), and the less severe nonclassic form (NC CAH). SW CAH and SV CAH, often referred to as classic CAH, are usually diagnosed in infancy via newborn screening programs if available, due to varying degrees of virilization in females, or in the most severe cases due to life-threatening SW. The treatment of CAH consists of substitution therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, which will reduce the overproduction of androgens.

In contrast to classic CAH, women with NC CAH are usually diagnosed later in life due to mild symptoms of androgen excess, such as hirsutism, menstrual disorders, and infertility (Table 3). The symptoms are very similar to PCOS, and, in agreement with PCOS, NC CAH is not associated with virilizing symptoms. Since some of these women may be undiagnosed or have worsening symptoms by age, NC CAH should be considered in postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism. The NC form of CAH is estimated to be one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders, with a prevalence of 1% to 10% in women with hyperandrogenic symptoms.

Elevated serum 17-OHP, due to accumulation before the enzyme block, is indicative of CAH. It should be further investigated by an ACTH stimulation test. Serum concentrations of testosterone and adrenal androgen precursors (A4, DHEA, and DHEAS) are also increased. The diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing and detection of a mutation causing enzyme deficiency and impaired corticosteroid synthesis.

### Childhood-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia: long-term outcome and optimization of therapy [^116BosFH]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a general term applied to several disorders caused by inherited recessive defects of cortisol synthesis. The most common form is 21-hydroxylase deficiency, accounting for 95% of cases. The classical forms have an incidence of one in 15,000 and the non-classical forms about one in 1,000. The classical or severe phenotype presents in the newborn period or early infancy with virilization and adrenal insufficiency, with or without salt-losing; the non-classical or mild phenotype presents in late childhood or early adulthood with signs of hyperandrogenism. This wide range of clinical expression is explained by genetic variation. Although there is a certain amount of genotype-phenotype correlation, discrepancies have been described. During the last 30 years there has been a substantial improvement in diagnosis and treatment of this disease, and patients with CAH now reach adulthood. Treatment of this condition is intended to reduce excessive corticotropin secretion and replace glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids as physiologically as possible. Clinical management is often complicated by periods of inadequately treated hyperandrogenism, iatrogenic hypercortisolism, or both. Long-term consequences in adult life may include short stature, obesity, diminished bone mass, gonadal dysfunction with low fertility rates and psychosexual dysfunction in females. New treatment approaches are under investigation, such as the use of anti-androgens, inhibitors of estrogen production and adrenalectomy for severely resistant cases.

### Androgens correlate with increased erythropoiesis in women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^113NvcKS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effect of androgens on erythropoiesis is well described and initially came to light through the observation that men have higher levels of haemoglobin (Hb) than women. 1 Pre‐pubertal boys and girls have similar levels of Hb but boys acquire higher Hb levels following puberty that coincides with the surge in testosterone levels. 2 Lower Hb levels in women are not due to chronic menstrual blood loss as this gender difference persists in non‐menstruating women. 3, 4 The evidence for an erythropoietic effect of testosterone led to its use as a treatment for anaemia in renal failure 4 and bone marrow failure 5 in the past before the development of recombinant erythropoietin. In men, intramuscular testosterone replacement is often associated with polycythaemia, 6 which reverses with a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. 7 Conversely, androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer leads to a reduction in Hb levels. 8

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the commonest genetic endocrine disorder, and 21‐hydroxylase deficiency accounts for more than 95% of cases. 9 In this condition, defective cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands leads to the loss of negative feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion by the pituitary. The elevated ACTH leads to hyperplasia of the adrenal glands and excess production of adrenal androgens. 9 Treatment with glucocorticoids aims to control androgen excess and replace steroid deficiency; however, it is challenging to achieve the correct balance between over‐ and under‐treatment. When patients are under‐replaced, adrenal androgens are elevated and women are affected by symptoms of hyperandrogenism. With over‐replacement, adrenal androgens are suppressed.

The effect of elevated adrenal androgens on erythropoietic markers in patients with CAH has been assumed but not studied in detail. Polycythaemia is seen in neonates with CAH, 10 and there have been a few case studies reporting polycythaemia in untreated men and women with CAH and androgen excess. 11, 12 To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies examining the relationship of androgens with erythropoiesis in women with CAH. This study investigated the association of androgens with Hb and haematocrit (Hct) in women with CAH in a cross‐validated study.

### Fertility in patients with nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^115FKSaT]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH) is by far a subtler and milder enzymatic defect to the classical form of the disease. A nuanced understanding of NC-CAH will lead to increased detection of the disorder in those initially misdiagnosed as having polycystic ovary syndrome, will assist in the detection of pregnancies at risk for severe genetic steroid disorders, and will facilitate appropriate ovulation induction and reduction in the hyperandrogenic symptoms which are a cornerstone of the disease. We describe the history of the disease as well as elucidate the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the disorder.

Although androgen excess can manifest in many ways, the most common and recognizable symptoms are hirsutism and acne. Reports of hirsutism and acne should be taken seriously because of their possible association with medical disorders, their substantial effect on self-esteem and quality of life, and the potential for psychosocial morbidity. In patients with symptoms of androgen excess, the differential diagnosis should include physiologic hyperandrogenism of puberty, idiopathic hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). There is a great deal of overlap between the symptoms of PCOS and those of normal puberty, which makes the diagnosis of PCOS in the adolescent difficult. Treatment of acne and hirsutism should not be withheld during the ongoing longitudinal evaluation for possible PCOS. On physical examination, body mass index, blood pressure, and signs of hyperandrogenism, such as acne and hirsutism, should be evaluated. Although guidelines differ on recommended laboratory studies, most include measurement of total testosterone, free testosterone, or both, and screening for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia with a 17-hydroxyprogesterone test. Elevation of the free or total testosterone level higher than the adult female normative values is a key diagnostic feature of biochemical hyperandrogenism. Because treatment is indicated only when symptoms are distressing to the patient, the degree to which acne or hirsutism bothers the patient should be assessed. Before initiation of any medical therapy, expectations of treatment should be discussed with the patient. Anticipatory guidance is critical to help patients understand the timeline for expected responses to therapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of women with hirsutism [^1112YUMa]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is a common disorder, often resulting from conditions that are not life-threatening. It may signal more serious clinical pathology, and clinical evaluation should differentiate benign causes from tumors or other conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome, late-onset adrenal hyperplasia, and Cushing's syndrome. Laboratory testing should be based on the patient's history and physical findings, but screening for levels of serum testosterone and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is sufficient in most cases. Women with irregular menses and hirsutism should be screened for thyroid dysfunction and prolactin disorders. Pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments may be used. Advances in laser hair removal methods and topical hair growth retardants offer new options. The use of insulin-sensitizing agents may be useful in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

### What is the best approach to the teenage patient presenting with nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia: should we always treat with glucocorticoids? [^1123kRaP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to partial deficiency in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase can present in childhood or adolescence with signs of adrenal androgen excess. Strategies to reduce the impact of androgen excess in females include cosmetic measures as well as antiandrogens and agents such as the combined oral contraceptive pill. Glucocorticoid may not be appropriate straightaway but can be introduced if other measures are ineffective or when pregnancy is planned.

### Hirsutism in women [^1163nw6c]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Hirsutism is the excessive growth of terminal hair in a typical male pattern in a female. It is often a sign of excessive androgen levels. Although many conditions can lead to hirsutism, polycystic ovary syndrome and idiopathic hyperandrogenism account for more than 85% of cases. Less common causes include idiopathic hirsutism, nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, medications, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, and Cushing syndrome. Women with an abnormal hirsutism score based on the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system should be evaluated for elevated androgen levels. Women with rapid onset of hirsutism over a few months or signs of virilization are at high risk of having an androgen-secreting tumor. Hirsutism may be treated with pharmacologic agents and/or hair removal. Recommended pharmacologic therapies include combined oral contraceptives, finasteride, spironolactone, and topical eflornithine. Because of the length of the hair growth cycle, therapies should be tried for at least six months before switching treatments. Hair removal methods such as shaving, waxing, and plucking may be effective, but their effects are temporary. Photoepilation and electrolysis are somewhat effective for long-term hair removal but are expensive.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^115crLcv]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

The congenital adrenal hyperplasias comprise a family of autosomal recessive disorders that disrupt adrenal steroidogenesis. The most common form is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency associated with mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene, which is located at chromosome 6p21. The clinical features associated with each disorder of adrenal steroidogenesis represent a clinical spectrum that reflect the consequences of the specific mutations. Treatment goals include normal linear growth velocity and "on-time" puberty in affected children. For adolescent and adult women, treatment goals include regularization of menses, prevention of progression of hirsutism, and preservation of fertility. For adolescent and adult men, prevention and early treatment of testicular adrenal rest tumors is beneficial. In this article key aspects regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia are reviewed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): an interview with richard legro [^114Uo1FH]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In addition to hyperandrogenism, the second is ovulatory dysfunction, and that can be manifested as oligomenorrhea or infrequent menstruation. Sometimes this is observed as secondary amenorrhea or total lack of periods for a while. The third component is a characteristic of the appearance of the ovaries known as the polycystic ovary. It is a misnomer because the ovary really is not polycystic but it contains a lot of very small follicles, that are the size of a quarter inch or less, that develop into ovulatory follicles. This enlarges the ovary with lots of follicles and usually increases the central stoma, a central portion of the ovary that is solid. This appearance of the polycystic ovary is the third sign.

If you have two or three of the conditions indicated above, you qualify for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. We relied on a workshop that had been held and sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that upheld the expert consensus based Rotterdam criteria. One of the things we wanted to focus more on was treatment rather than diagnosis, so we went with the conventional opinion [for diagnosis]. Everyone should be aware though that there is a lot of controversy on what the proper diagnostic criteria are. Certainly I would say the main criticism of Rotterdam criteria is that it can include subjects who have no hyperandrogenism. Thus, a woman can have irregular periods and polycystic ovaries. It appears that these women have a different prognosis than the women with hyperandrogenism. Specifically, these women tend to have less insulin resistance, less glucose intolerance, less lipid abnormalities, and probably are more likely to be normal weight.

All the criteria agree that you should exclude common conditions that may mimic some of the signs and symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome. Thus, women should be screened for thyroid dysfunction, prolactin excess, and the onset of non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In rare cases, where there are signs of virilization or Cushingoid signs, women should be screened for these other causes of severe androgen excess like an androgen-secreting tumor or, in the case of the Cushingoid symptoms, should be screened for Cushing's Syndrome. Thus, all the guidelines agree that one should exclude conditions that may mimic polycystic ovary syndrome.

3 CLINICAL EVALUATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

3.1 History

Clinical features of androgen excess in women include hirsutism, acne and alopecia. A focused history will include assessment of the severity and duration of symptoms as well as rapidity of onset. Establishing how much time is spent removing hair from face, trunk and limbs may also give an indication of the severity of hirsutism, as the modified Ferriman–Gallwey index (mFG) may be confounded by cosmetic measures taken preconsultation. It should be emphasized that acne is highly prevalent in non‐hyperandrogenic women, particularly in adolescence, with up to 20% of individuals in their midteens and 15% of those in their early 20 s reporting the presence of acne.

Long‐standing mild to moderate symptoms of androgen excess are usually due to PCOS, whereas rapid virilization suggests non‐PCOS pathology (Figure 2). Androgen excess may be linked to menstrual disturbances such as oligomenorrhoea (defined as menses occurring at intervals longer than 35 days apart or less than 8 periods per year) either causally or in the context of underlying PCOS, and so a full menstrual history should be obtained. Cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, cigarette smoking, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance should be considered. Patients should be asked about a family history of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), severe insulin resistance (SIR) syndromes, impaired glucose tolerance or PCOS. It is important to determine fertility plans as the majority of systemic pharmacological treatments for androgen excess are not compatible with trying to conceive due to teratogenic risk. Lastly the patient should be asked about signs and symptoms consistent with overt virilization such as clitoral enlargement or voice deepening.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1157rq8n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To update practice guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women.

Participants

A Task Force appointed by the Endocrine Society, American Congress of Obestricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), and International Menopause Society (IMS) consisting of six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials. The GRADE methodology was used; the strength of a recommendation is indicated by a number "1" (strong recommendation, we recommend) or "2" (weak recommendation, we suggest).

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications and conference calls determined consensus. Committees of the Endocrine Society, ASRM, ACOG, ESE, and IMS reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions

We continue to recommend against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women because there is a lack of a well-defined syndrome, and data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms are unavailable. We recommend against the general use of T for the following indications: infertility; sexual dysfunction other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder; cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health; or general well-being. We recommend against the routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency. We recommend against the routine prescription of T or dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, surgical menopause, pharmacological glucocorticoid administration, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk. Evidence supports the short-term efficacy and safety of high physiological doses of T treatment of postmenopausal women with sexual dysfunction due to hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Importantly, endogenous T levels did not predict response to therapy. At present, physiological T preparations for use in women are not available in many countries including the United States, and long-term safety data are lacking. We recommend that any woman receiving T therapy be monitored for signs and symptoms of androgen excess. We outline areas for future research. Ongoing improvement in androgen assays will allow a redefinition of normal ranges across the lifespan; this may help to clarify the impact of varying concentrations of plasma androgens on the biology, physiology, and psychology in women and lead to indications for therapeutic interventions.

### Approach to androgen excess in women: clinical and biochemical insights [^117VSXg4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Androgen excess in women typically presents clinically with hirsutism, acne or androgenic alopecia. In the vast majority of cases, the underlying aetiology is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common chronic condition that affects up to 10% of all women. Identification of women with non-PCOS pathology within large cohorts of patients presenting with androgen excess represents a diagnostic challenge for the endocrinologist, and rare pathology including nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, severe insulin resistance syndromes, Cushing's disease or androgen-secreting tumours of the ovary or adrenal gland may be missed in the absence of a pragmatic screening approach. Detailed clinical history, physical examination and biochemical phenotyping are critical in risk-stratifying women who are at the highest risk of non-PCOS disorders. Red flag features such as rapid onset symptoms, overt virilization, postmenopausal onset or severe biochemical disturbances should prompt investigations for underlying neoplastic pathology, including dynamic testing and imaging where appropriate. This review will outline a proposed diagnostic approach to androgen excess in women, including an introduction to androgen metabolism and provision of a suggested algorithmic strategy to identify non-PCOS pathology according to clinical and biochemical phenotype.

### Acne: effect of hormones on pathogenesis and management [^114nucc2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

In the pathogenesis of acne, androgen hormones play a crucial role. In the treatment of acne, hormonal therapies provide valuable alternatives to standard modalities in selected women. Although numerous factors contribute to the development of acne, the requirement for androgens is absolute and is one that allows for effective treatments in women through inhibition of androgen expression. The two prerequisites for androgen expression at the level of the pilosebaceous unit are the presence of androgen in the form of either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone; and functioning androgen receptors. A third component may be the metabolism of androgen precursors to active androgens within pilosebaceous units. Hormonal treatment of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism, androgenetic alopecia) such as that seen in polycystic ovary syndrome, centers on reduction of circulating androgen levels and androgen receptor blockade. Combination oral contraceptives represent the primary treatment modality for reducing circulating androgens from ovarian and, to a lesser degree, adrenal sources. Newer formulations may also have clinically significant androgen receptor blocking and 5alpha-reductase inhibiting effects. Newer oral contraceptives have high safety profiles and are used widely internationally for this purpose. Androgen receptor blockers currently in use include spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and flutamide. Androgen receptor blockers are frequently combined with oral contraceptives to achieve optimal results in selected women. In women with adrenal hyperplasia, low-dose corticosteroids may be added to reduce adrenal androgen precursors. Inhibition of enzymes of androgen metabolism in the pilosebaceous unit remain largely investigational in the treatment of acne, although the benefit of 5alpha-reductase (type 2) inhibition is established in androgenetic alopecia in men. This article reviews the essentials of hormonal influence in acne pathogenesis, discusses the hormonal therapies most utilized in the treatment of acne, and the pre-treatment evaluation of women in whom hormonal therapies are being considered.

7.2 96‐h Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST)

As adrenal androgen production is regulated by ACTH, hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis suppression with dexamethasone can be used to confirm an adrenal source of androgen excess in selected cases. Androgen suppression confirms the presence of ACTH‐dependent hyperandrogenism and is also a clear indication of benign disease. In principle, suppression of DHEAS after dexamethasone implies that adrenal androgen secretion remains under the control of ACTH, and therefore strongly legislates against ACTH‐independent malignant disease such as adrenocortical carcinoma. As DHEAS is exclusively of adrenal gland origin, dexamethasone suppression testing is not generally needed when DHEAS is the sole androgen that is elevated. Additionally, patients with an adrenal mass and clear biochemical elevation of adrenal androgen excess do not require this test and should proceed to adrenalectomy. However, it has a diagnostic role in those patients with normal adrenal imaging with a biochemical picture suggestive of adrenal origin, for example, preferential elevation in DHEAS.

Exceptionally rarely, androgen excess from bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia has been reported, either in isolation or with concomitant glucocorticoid excess. For optimal androgen suppression that accounts for the 22h half‐life of DHEAS, the test should be undertaken as a prolonged protocol by administration of dexamethasone 0.5mg every 6h for 4 days, with androgens measured at baseline and on the morning of the fifth day. This suppresses androgens with less variability compared to 24, 48 and 72 h of dexamethasone. Androgen suppression by over 50% of the basal value supports adrenal androgen dominance.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^116ZcBtX]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is a disorder of the adrenal cortex characterised by cortisol deficiency, with or without aldosterone deficiency, and androgen excess. Patients with the most severe form also have abnormalities of the adrenal medulla and epinephrine deficiency. The severe classic form occurs in one in 15,000 births worldwide, and the mild non-classic form is a common cause of hyperandrogenism. Neonatal screening for CAH and gene-specific prenatal diagnosis are now possible. Standard hormone replacement fails to achieve normal growth and development for many children with CAH, and adults can experience iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, hyperandrogenism, infertility, or the development of the metabolic syndrome. This Seminar reviews the epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of CAH, and provides an overview of clinical challenges and future therapies.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117AKbKw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Medium credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia — adult monitoring and reproductive considerations: In adult patients with CAH, there are neither established optimal biomarkers nor target values, and clinicians should adjust glucocorticoid (GC) doses primarily using clinical indicators. For women with delay in conception, GC treatment should aim to achieve a follicular-phase progesterone level < 0.6 ng/mL (2 nmol/L). Mineralocorticoid dosing (fludrocortisone and/or salt) should be titrated to standing blood pressure, PRA appropriate for age, and serum potassium measurements. For men, suppressed gonadotropins indicate infertility; elevated FSH suggests sustained testicular damage in men with TARTs, and men with large TARTs may have low morning testosterone indicating poor Leydig cell function. The ratio of androstenedione to testosterone is < 0.5 in eugonadal men; values > 2 indicate poor CAH control with a significant fraction of testosterone of adrenal origin. Androstenedione and testosterone are good parameters of disease control, with additional tests considered in the context of menstrual irregularity and signs of androgen excess.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia — management during pregnancy: In women with nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia who are infertile or have a history of prior miscarriage, we recommend treatment with a glucocorticoid that does not traverse the placenta (1|⊕⊕○○). In women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who are pregnant, we advise management by an endocrinologist familiar with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). In women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who become pregnant we recommend continued pregnancy doses of hydrocortisone/ prednisolone and fludrocortisone therapy, with dosage adjustments if symptoms and signs of glucocorticoid insufficiency occur (1|⊕⊕○○); clinicians should evaluate the need for an increase in glucocorticoid during the second or third trimester and administer stress doses of glucocorticoids during labor and delivery. In women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who are pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, we recommend against using glucocorticoids that traverse the placenta, such as dexamethasone (1|⊕⊕○○). In women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who are pregnant, we advise that the birthing plan includes an obstetric specialist (Ungraded Good Practice Statement).

### Management of fully pubertal girls with nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia: glucocorticoids versus oral contraceptives [^112DAzqN]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare clinical outcomes of 3 treatment regimens-glucocorticoids (GCs), oral contraceptives (OCs), or a combination of both-administered to adolescents and young women diagnosed in childhood with nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH), who had been treated with GCs until their adult height was achieved.

Methods

A retrospective study of medical records of 53 female patients with NCCAH followed in 3 tertiary pediatric endocrinology institutes. The 3 treatment groups were compared for the prevalence of hirsutism and acne, standardized body mass index (BMI)-standard deviation score (SDS), and androgen levels at the attainment of adult height (baseline), 1-year later, and at the last documented visit.

Results

At baseline, there were no significant differences among groups in BMI-SDS, androgen levels, hirsutism prevalence, acne, or irregular menses. From baseline to the last visit, the rate of hirsutism declined significantly only in the OC group (37.5% vs 6.2%, respectively; p = 0.03). The rate of acne declined in the combined group (50% vs 9%, respectively; p = 0.03) with a similar tendency in the OC group (50% vs 12.5%, respectively; p = 0.05). No significant changes were observed in BMI-SDS for the entire cohort or any subgroup during follow-up. A significant rise in androstenedione (P < .001), testosterone (P < .01), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (P < .01) levels was observed only in the OC group.

Conclusion

In girls diagnosed in childhood with NCCAH, who require treatment for hyperandrogenism following completion of linear growth, management should be tailored individually using a patient-centered approach. Treatment with OCs might be better than that with GCs for regression of hirsutism and acne. The long-term effects of elevated levels of androgens associated with this treatment regimen should be further studied.

Abstract

Androgen excess in women typically presents clinically with hirsutism, acne or androgenic alopecia. In the vast majority of cases, the underlying aetiology is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common chronic condition that affects up to 10% of all women. Identification of women with non‐PCOS pathology within large cohorts of patients presenting with androgen excess represents a diagnostic challenge for the endocrinologist, and rare pathology including nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, severe insulin resistance syndromes, Cushing's disease or androgen‐secreting tumours of the ovary or adrenal gland may be missed in the absence of a pragmatic screening approach. Detailed clinical history, physical examination and biochemical phenotyping are critical in risk‐stratifying women who are at the highest risk of non‐PCOS disorders. Red flag features such as rapid onset symptoms, overt virilization, postmenopausal onset or severe biochemical disturbances should prompt investigations for underlying neoplastic pathology, including dynamic testing and imaging where appropriate. This review will outline a proposed diagnostic approach to androgen excess in women, including an introduction to androgen metabolism and provision of a suggested algorithmic strategy to identify non‐PCOS pathology according to clinical and biochemical phenotype.

### Approach to the adult with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^115P7vHn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) describes a group of autosomal recessive disorders where there is impairment of cortisol biosynthesis. CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 95% of cases and shows a wide range of clinical severity. Treatment of the classic or severe form of CAH is targeted at replacing cortisol and aldosterone and effectively controlling excess androgen symptoms by using the lowest possible glucocorticoid dose. Treatment of the mild or nonclassic form is targeted at controlling excess androgen symptoms and may or may not involve glucocorticoid therapy. Hydrocortisone is the treatment of choice for children, but there is no consensus on how patients should be treated as adults. Current glucocorticoid therapy is suboptimal because it is often difficult to reduce excess androgen without giving excess glucocorticoid, and patients may experience hypercortisolism, androgen excess, or a combination of these states. Treatment of CAH, especially in the adult patient, remains controversial given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials comparing treatment regimens. Nevertheless, patients benefit from careful individualized therapy with avoidance of Cushingoid side effects and optimization of reproductive, sexual, and bone health.

### Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia and its impact on reproduction [^113GLw78]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Women with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can suffer from impaired fertility rates as a result of increased androgen secretion or impaired sex steroid production. In virilizing CAH forms, such as 21-hydroxylase and 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, the low reported pregnancy rate is mainly secondary to a diminished desire to conceive. Optimal glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid replacement, sufficient to normalize androgen and P levels in the follicular phase, allows natural conception in most cases. The remaining CAH forms exemplified by StAR, P450scc, P450-oxidoreductase, and 17α-hydroxylase/17–20 lyase deficiencies are associated with impaired sex steroid production. Several factors are involved in the true low fertility rate in this group: folliculogenesis arrest, uterine hypoplasia, and inadequate endometrial thickness related to aberrant androgen, estrogen, and P secretion. There are several reports of successful term pregnancies achieved through controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, followed by estrogen replacement and IVF. Progress in female genitalia reconstructive surgery, individualized hormonal therapies, psychosexual evaluation, and assisted reproductive technology have improved fertility and pregnancy outcomes in women with classic CAH. Finally, successful gestational management in CAH patients requires the close coordination of care between endocrinologists and obstetricians.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114A5gqQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21‑hydroxylase deficiency — risk, timing, and scope of empiric prenatal treatment: In at‑risk pregnancies there is a 1:4 chance of having CAH and a 1:2 chance of being female; thus, there is a 1:8 chance that the fetus will be female and have CAH. Because the period during which fetal genitalia may become virilized begins ∼6 weeks after conception, treatment must be started by 6 to 7 weeks. Because genetic diagnosis by chorionic villus biopsy cannot be performed until 10 to 12 weeks, all pregnancies at risk for CAH would need to be treated, although the treatment is directed at only one in eight fetuses.

### Revisiting the prevalence of nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia in US ashkenazi jews and caucasians [^1114Lq73]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

These results have important implications. As nonclassic CAH may result in infertility, which is easily treated with glucocorticoid therapy, and nonclassic CAH women not receiving glucocorticoid therapy have higher miscarriage rates than those receiving treatment, our new data will aid with preconception and infertility counseling. Importantly, current infertility guidelinesdo not address nonclassic CAH. Our estimate of 1 in 200 disease rates for nonclassic CAH in the US Caucasian population argue for screening in the setting of female infertility, regardless of ethnicity, especially since hyperandrogenic symptoms may not be present.

The mild nonclassic form of CAH was first discovered during studies of family members of patients with the classic form of CAH. The lack of symptomatology led to the term cryptic CAH being used to describe an individual who is genetically found to have nonclassic CAH, but is apparently asymptomatic. Although individuals found to have nonclassic CAH by family genetic studies are mostly asymptomatic, female infertility and suboptimal cortisol response have been commonly described in such individuals. In addition, there is some evidence that symptomatology worsens with age. Affected males usually do not exhibit symptoms, but infertility and oligospermia have been described infrequently. Affected women more commonly suffer from infertility than affected men due to hormonal imbalances that result in menstrual irregularities. In both males and females, infertility and gonadal dysfunction can be reversed with glucocorticoid treatment. The clinical presentation of women with nonclassic CAH may be identical to that of polycystic ovary syndrome, a common ovarian disorder associated with androgen excess in women and infertility. Since the treatment and management of these two conditions differ, it is essential to distinguish between these two disease entities. Our findings argue for ruling out the diagnosis of nonclassic CAH in the setting of female hyperandrogenism.

Evidence of clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess connotes a unique differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women. Providers need to be able to discriminate between changes of the normal ageing process compared to potential pathology in older women. The evaluation and treatment of postmenopausal hirsutism and hyperandrogenism is reviewed. Androgen excess may have long-term negative health consequences and as such should be detected and treated.

### An approach to the patient with hirsutism [^1143XS66]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is a common endocrinological complaint. The causes of this complaint can vary from dissatisfaction with a normal pattern of hair growth on the one hand, to the first clinical manifestation of androgen overproduction by an adrenal adenocarcinoma on the other. The purpose of this short review is to reexamine the physiology of hair growth in normal women, identify the common abnormal patterns, and explore the differential diagnosis associated with each. An approach to working through the differential diagnosis will be described, and the commonly available treatment modalities for the various forms of hirsutism will be examined in terms of risk and benefit. The review is written from the point of view of the physician and the most efficient, cost effective, and safe clinical approach to the patient with the problem.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1126pHuA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in pregnancy — evidence and obstetric considerations state that androgen and cortisol levels increase gradually during pregnancy due to increases in sex hormone–binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin, maternal 17OHP is elevated in normal pregnancy and hence cannot be used to monitor GC treatment, and clinicians should not use Dex, or other steroids that are not inactivated by placental 11β-HSD2, to treat pregnant women affected by CAH. High progesterone levels during pregnancy may compete for the MC receptor, theoretically necessitating increased fludrocortisone doses, but this possibility has not been tested, and nonspecific symptoms of adrenal insufficiency may develop in pregnancy such that GC and/or fludrocortisone doses may be increased if such signs and symptoms occur, with a GC dosage increase of 20% to 40% from the 24th week onward often beneficial. During labor and delivery, stress doses of GCs should be administered, but there are no controlled studies regarding optimal dosing. Women with CAH may be at increased risk for gestational diabetes; thus, clinicians should monitor glucose tolerance as clinical judgment indicates throughout pregnancy, and treatment should be individualized for pregnant patients with CAH. Caesarean section is the most common method of delivery, although vaginal delivery has been reported in 16% to 42% of women, and similar principles of pregnancy management apply to women with NCCAH requiring GC treatment during pregnancy.

### Management of hirsutism [^115qdhxq]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

This review reports our own experience with, and literature studies of, the pharmacological management of hirsutism in women with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome) or with normal serum androgen levels and regular ovulatory menstrual cycles (idiopathic hirsutism). Treatment consists of suppressing ovarian or adrenal androgen secretion, or blocking androgen actions in the skin. The major drugs used are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and steroidal (cyproterone acetate and spironolactone) or nonsteroidal (flutamide and finasteride) antiandrogens. GnRH agonists, suppressing the pituitary, decrease androgen and estradiol secretion and improve severe hirsutism. To avoid estrogen deficiency problems, 'add back' therapy with estrogen-progestogen or COCs is advisable. This method of treatment is complicated and expensive, limiting its use to severe forms of ovarian hyperandrogenism with hyperinsulinemia. The third-generation COCs, containing new progestogens or cyproterone, have very restricted effectiveness in the short term (6 cycles), but their long term use (> 12 cycles) cures mild-to-moderate hirsutism and improves severe hirsutism. As well as suppressing gonadotropins and ovarian androgen steroidogenesis, these formulations decrease free testosterone levels and may also decrease adrenal androgen production. In women being treated with antiandrogens, COCs are important to provide control of the menstrual cycle and contraception. Cyproterone, a progestational agent, inhibits gonadotropin secretion and blocks androgen action. It is used in COCs or in a reverse sequential regimen. In the latter, it is very effective in the short term treatment of hirsutism. Spironolactone blocks androgen receptors. Its effectiveness in hirsutism is dosage-dependent: low dosages are less active than other antiandrogens, whereas high dosages (200 mg/day) are very effective at the cost of several adverse effects (particularly dysfunctional uterine bleeding), but the concomitant use of a COC may prevent these. Flutamide is a pure antiandrogen that blocks androgen receptors and inhibits hair growth. It is very effective in treating hirsutism within 6 to 12 months. Dry skin is very frequent during treatment with flutamide, and hepatotoxicity is possible at high dosages. Finasteride, a 5 alpha-reductase type 2 inhibitor, is the least effective antiandrogen, but a dosage of 5 mg/day decreases hirsutism without adverse effects. Pregnancy must be avoided during therapy with antiandrogens because of the possible risk of abnormal development of a male fetus. Antiandrogens, especially flutamide (250 to 500 mg/day) and cyproterone (12.5 to 50 mg/day in a reverse sequential regimen), alone or in association with COCs, seem to be the most effective agents for the treatment of hirsutism.

### Fertility in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^113CqasD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is generally regarded as a paediatric endocrine disease, but nowadays nearly all patients reach adulthood as a result of improved diagnosis and treatment. It is now increasingly recognised that treatment goals shift during life: one of the major treatment goals in childhood and puberty, i.e. normal growth and development, is no longer relevant after childhood, whereas other aspects, such as fertility and side effects of long-term glucocorticoid treatment, become more important in adulthood. This paper focuses on fertility in male and female adult patients with CAH. In males with CAH the fertility rate is reduced compared with the normal population, the most frequent cause being testicular adrenal rest tumours. Development and growth of these tumours is assumed to be ACTH dependent and undertreatment may play an important role. If intensifying glucocorticoid treatment does not lead to tumour decrease, surgical intervention may be considered, but the effect on fertility is not yet known. In females with CAH the degree of fertility depends on the phenotype of the CAH. Most fertility problems are seen in the classic salt-wasting type. Age of menarche and regularity of the menstrual cycle depends on the degree of adrenal suppression. Not only adrenal androgens have to be normalised but also the levels of adrenal progestins (progesterone and 17-OH-progesterone) that interfere with normal ovulatory cycles. The regularity of menstrual cycles can be considered as an important measure of therapeutic control in adolescent females with CAH and therefore as a therapeutic goal from (peri)pubertal years on. Other factors that contribute to impaired fertility in females with CAH are ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome), ovarian adrenal rest tumours, genital surgery and psychological factors. Subfertility in CAH can have its origin already in the peripubertal years and is therefore of interest to the paediatric endocrinologist.

Cushing Syndrome

Cushing syndrome is a rare disorder, which can be either ACTH-dependent and caused by pituitary hypersecretion of ACTH (Cushing disease, about 70%) or ACTH independent due to adrenocortical adenoma or carcinoma (about 20%). ACTH-dependent Cushing is associated with elevated ACTH levels causing bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and hypersecretion of cortisol. In contrast, ACTH-independent Cushing disease is related to suppressed ACTH secretion due to negative feedback by increased cortisol secretion. The overall incidence of Cushing syndrome is estimated to be 1.8 to 3.2 cases per million population. Cushing disease occurs mainly in women aged 25–45 years.

The major clinical manifestations of Cushing syndrome are moon face and facial plethora, abdominal obesity, striae, buffalo hump, proximal muscle weakness, bruising, hypertension, glucose intolerance, depression, and other neuropsychological symptoms. About 50% of women with Cushing syndrome also have symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as hirsutism, due to adrenal androgen excess (A4, DHEA, and DHEAS) (Table 3). Furthermore, the free androgen index is increased by endogenous hypercortisolism, probably due to a decrease in SHBG. However, signs of hyperandrogenism are usually mild to moderate and seldom lead to virilization.

The diagnosis of Cushing syndrome is established by hypersecretion of cortisol, as measured by 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, or the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test. Further evaluation is needed to determine ACTH dependence or independence by measurement of plasma ACTH, as well as pituitary, adrenal, or ectopic etiology by using MRI of the pituitary and CT of the adrenal glands or other relevant imaging. First-line treatment is surgical removal of the ACTH- or cortisol-secreting tumor.

### Hirsutism of adrenal origin in adolescents: consequences in adults [^114R5wVv]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is a common clinical and psychological problem in women. Polycystic ovary syndrome and idiopathic hirsutism are the most common causes of hirsutism. Adrenal disorders are less common causes of hirsutism; the most common adrenal cause of hirsutism is non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH). Hirsutism may be the presenting symptom of an adrenal carcinoma or adenoma. In this review, adrenal causes of hirsutism, the pathophysiology of the hirsutism in NC-CAH, and the treatment of hirsutism in these patients, are discussed.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and pregnancy [^112HYVot]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old woman with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) secondary to 21-hydroxylase deficiency presented with infertility. She was treated with different steroid replacement regimens together with fludrocortisone. The aim of this case report is to discuss fertility barriers in women with classical CAH, and emphasise the risks and benefits of available steroid treatment options. Clinical considerations covered include preconception health and fertility planning, optimising fertility through suppression of excess hormone production, reducing fetal androgen exposure in utero and limiting maternal and fetal side effects of therapy and limiting chances of CAH in the baby. In this case suppression of androgen and progesterone levels was challenging but eventually was achieved and resulted in a spontaneous pregnancy. However, she miscarried in the first trimester, and fetal biopsy revealed a complete hydatiform mole. She is advised not to conceive while she is under investigation to determine the extent of the disease.

### Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: phenotype and genotype [^113GsRAp]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a monogenic autosomal recessive condition manifested as a heterogeneous phenotype and caused by mutations in the CYP21 gene on chromosome 6p21.3. More than 50 mutations have been described, of which about 10 types account for > 90% of affected alleles. Concordance between genotype and phenotype is sufficiently robust to be of significant value in the diagnosis and management of the adrenal disorder. Knowledge of the genotype is essential in planning a strategy for prenatal treatment and useful in resolving diagnostic dilemmas in newborn screening programs, identifying nonclassic CAH in hyperandrogenic women with elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels, and studying the role of 21-hydroxylase deficiency in adrenal 'incidentalomas'. CYP21 genotyping is also valuable in defining the requirement for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement from infancy to adulthood. More detailed gene sequencing of the noncoding as well as the coding regions, together with analysis of other genes involved in steroid hormone production and action, will potentially be a significant step toward the goal of tailoring treatment to each individual.

Adult classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) monitoring — Complete suppression of serum 17OHP level is not a treatment goal but instead indicates overtreatment, androstenedione levels should be referenced to age- and sex-specific norms, and ACTH measurements are not useful in patients with CAH. For women who experience a delay in conception, glucocorticoid (GC) treatment should aim to achieve a follicular-phase progesterone level < 0.6 ng/mL (2 nmol/L), and the dose of fludrocortisone and/or salt supplementation should be titrated to standing blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA) appropriate for age, and serum potassium measurements. For men, suppressed gonadotropins are a reliable sign of infertility, large testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs) may be associated with low morning testosterone, and the ratio of androstenedione to testosterone is < 0.5 in eugonadal men; values > 2 indicate poor CAH control with a significant fraction of testosterone of adrenal origin. There are neither established optimal biomarkers nor target values, clinicians should adjust GC doses primarily using clinical indicators, and the presence of TARTs does not correlate strictly with the degree of control.

### ACOG releases guidelines on diagnosis and management… [^117PwFWx]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate suppresses circulating androgen levels and pituitary gonadotropin levels in women with PCOS. The ACOG notes that the optimal progestin and the optimal duration and frequency of treatment to prevent endometrial cancer in women with PCOS is not known. The ACOG notes that interventions to improve insulin sensitivity, such as weight loss and the use of insulin-sensitizing agents, are beneficial in improving the frequency of ovulation in women with PCOS. Ovulation Induction in Women Attempting to Conceive In women with PCOS who wish to conceive, treatment begins with weight control and a regular exercise program. Then, if needed, medication is used. The ACOG recommends treatment with clomiphene citrate because of its effectiveness.

When this agent is used in women with PCOS, about 80 percent ovulate and one half of these patients conceive. If clomiphene treatment fails, gonadotropins are often used to induce ovulation in women who have PCOS. The ACOG recommends low-dose, rather than high-dose, gonadotropin therapy because low-dose treatment induces a high rate of monofollicular development with a lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Hirsutism in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome A primary treatment for hirsutism in PCOS has not been established, and treatment is often palliative rather than curative. Agents that have been used include oral contraceptives, antiandrogen drugs, insulin-sensitizing agents, and eflornithine. The FDA has labeled only topical eflornithine hydrochloride cream for the treatment of hirsutism; additional benefits or risks for the use of this agent in women with PCOS are unknown.

Combined medical interventions may be the most effective treatment approach to hirsutism. The combination of an antiandrogen and an ovarian suppression agent appears to be effective in women with PCOS, although the best oral contraceptive pill or antiandrogen agent is not known.

### Evaluation and management of hirsutism in women… [^115qNBxN]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The second step involves the identification of the disorders that could contribute to the etiology or complicate the management of hirsutism. The most common causes of hirsutism are androgenic. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of women with androgen excess have hirsutism. The most common cause of androgen excess is polycystic ovary syndrome. Rarer androgenic causes include the insulin-resistant acanthosis nigricans syndrome, some forms of adrenal hyperplasia, and ovarian or adrenal androgen-secreting tumors. Approximately 5 to 15 percent of hirsutism cases are idiopathic. Some of these women are believed to have enzyme overactivity in the hair follicles, causing hirsutism in spite of normal circulating hormone levels.

Pharmacologic treatment is directed at the underlying cause of hirsutism, with special attention given to associated risk factors. More than one half of women with PCOS are at significant risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. Suppression of ovarian androgens usually is obtained through the use of combined oral contraceptives. Use of estrogens alone in appropriate women has been recommended. Oral contraceptives may be combined with long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, such as Lupron Depot in a dosage of 3. 75 mg per month, but this approach generally requires two to three cycles for effect. Insulin resistance may respond to weight loss or therapy with metformin or troglitazone, but the effect on hirsutism may be modest. The most effective treatments combine androgen suppression with peripheral androgen blockade. Androgen-receptor blockers include spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride, and cyproterone acetate.

These drugs have teratogenic potential and require secure contraception. Electrolysis and laser therapy can be successful but have unwanted side effects, such as blistering and pigmentation changes. Eflornithine hydrochloride 13. 9 percent cream is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of unwanted facial hair. This agent slows and miniaturizes hair growth but appears to require continuous application. It has been associated with improvement in 60 percent of cases in initial studies and requires at least eight weeks of treatment for effectiveness.
