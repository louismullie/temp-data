## Question

How often should adults receive a routine physical examination in primary care?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often adults should receive a routine physical examination in primary care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core distinction between a "routine physical" and the concept of preventive care and wellness visits. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (USPSTF, VA/DoD, ACC/AHA) say about the necessity and cadence of routine comprehensive physicals versus targeted preventive services. Next, I will synthesize an age- and risk-stratified approach to visit frequency and the exam content. After that, I should double-check special populations and care settings, including telehealth, to ensure practical guidance. Finally, I will reconcile evidence-based intervals with patient preferences and payer conventions, and I will consider how to implement shared decision-making around this topic [^116rDZRj] [^113ZxR9d].

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: there is no evidence-based mandate that every asymptomatic adult needs a comprehensive physical examination at a fixed annual interval, and multiple authoritative sources argue that routine "annual physicals" can be low-value in many settings; preventive care should instead be risk-based and focused on services with proven net benefit rather than a ritualized full exam [^116rDZRj] [^113D27uP].

> Wait, let me verify what "routine physical examination" actually entails in guideline language; USPSTF recommendations generally avoid specifying a global exam cadence and instead address discrete preventive services (blood pressure, cancer screening, immunizations, behavioral counseling), while VA/DoD explicitly recommends periodic blood pressure screening without defining a fixed exam schedule, and ACC/AHA focuses on periodic risk-factor assessment rather than a mandatory comprehensive exam cadence [^112hFS2j] [^111fccwi].

> I should confirm the blood pressure interval specifically, because patients often equate "checkups" with blood pressure checks; the USPSTF recommends screening adults for hypertension, with VA/DoD advising periodic screening given the very high lifetime risk of hypertension, and ACC/AHA suggests measuring traditional ASCVD risk factors every 4–6 years in adults 20–79, noting uncertainty about optimal intervals and allowing more frequent checks after borderline results, which implies that a uniform annual exam is not required for risk-factor monitoring alone [^113CbWsP] [^112hFS2j] [^111fccwi] [^112RjoA9].

> Hold on, let's not conflate "visit" with "exam"; wellness visits can occur without a hands-on physical examination, and many preventive services can be delivered via telehealth or asynchronous pathways, which is particularly relevant as many practices scaled virtual care and still completed screening orders and referrals effectively; the patient-facing JAMA summary also clarifies that routine checkups do not need to be yearly and do not necessarily require a physical exam in otherwise healthy adults [^1156ooyv] [^116rDZRj].

> Let me consider a practical, risk-stratified approach so recommendations are actionable: for generally healthy adults under 40 with no chronic conditions, targeted preventive services (immunizations, age-appropriate cancer screening, blood pressure) may be addressed every 2–3 years, reserving more frequent visits for specific risks or new symptoms; for adults 40–64, a baseline visit with periodic reassessment every 1–2 years is reasonable to coordinate screening and counseling, recognizing that many will benefit from more frequent BP checks; for adults 65 and older or anyone with chronic conditions or polypharmacy, annual or even semiannual visits are sensible to manage comorbidities, medication review, and functional assessments; this cadence aligns with VA/DoD's periodic BP screening and ACC/AHA's 4–6 year risk-factor intervals, adapted to clinical context and prior results [^notfound].

> I need to ensure the content of these visits is evidence-based rather than habit-driven; comprehensive metabolic panels and routine ECGs in low-risk, asymptomatic adults are not recommended and can trigger cascades of low-value testing, so I should avoid reflexive ordering and instead anchor on guideline-backed services like immunizations, age- and risk-appropriate cancer screening, blood pressure and BMI measurement, behavioral counseling for diet and physical activity, alcohol and tobacco screening, and depression screening when systems are in place to support diagnosis and follow-up [^111BpRX9] [^117V8Tre] [^111aGNhr] [^116rDZRj].

> But wait, what about patients who strongly prefer an annual "physical"? I should double-check how to handle that preference without over-medicalizing; patient satisfaction and relationship-building are legitimate benefits of the exam room interaction, and the physical examination can enhance trust and diagnostic clarity when used judiciously; shared decision-making can document why an annual full exam is not medically necessary while agreeing to annual wellness visits focused on preventive care and addressing patient concerns, with selective physical examination based on symptoms, risks, and agreed-upon goals [^116FmBUL] [^116rDZRj].

> Next, I should review special populations and care contexts; older adults warrant fall-risk assessment and medication reconciliation at least annually, persons with disabilities may need accommodations to enable meaningful examination and should have their care intervals tailored to comorbidity burden and access barriers, and people living with HIV or complex chronic disease generally merit more frequent, structured follow-up with comprehensive reviews of systems and targeted physical examination; in systems with telehealth capacity, preventive counseling and ordering can be done virtually, with in-person exams reserved for indications or for patients who prefer face-to-face care [^112YmSMK] [^111J9wj2] [^114Yngu5] [^1156ooyv].

> Let me reconsider whether there is any high-credibility guidance mandating a fixed annual physical for all adults; I should confirm there isn't. The USPSTF does not endorse a universal annual comprehensive physical, VA/DoD advises periodic BP screening without dictating a visit cadence, and ACC/AHA emphasizes periodic risk-factor assessment rather than a mandated annual exam; the patient-facing summary explicitly notes that checkups do not need to be yearly, reinforcing that interval individualization is appropriate [^112hFS2j] [^111fccwi] [^116rDZRj].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and practical: routine physical examinations should be individualized by age, risk, comorbidity, and patient preference rather than fixed at an annual interval; a reasonable framework is every 2–3 years for low-risk adults under 40, every 1–2 years for adults 40–64, and annually or semiannually for adults 65 and older or those with chronic conditions, with preventive services integrated into whatever visit cadence is chosen and telehealth leveraged where appropriate; I should explicitly counsel patients that an annual "physical" is not required for health maintenance, while acknowledging that many will prefer annual wellness visits, which can be accommodated with evidence-based content and selective examination [^116rDZRj] [^112hFS2j] [^111fccwi] [^1156ooyv].

---

Routine physicals for adults should be individualized by **age, risk, and health status** [^116rDZRj]. For low-risk adults 18–39, a check-in **every 2–3 years** is reasonable; for adults 40–64, every 1–2 years; and for adults ≥ 65 or those with chronic conditions, annually or as clinically indicated. These intervals align with **USPSTF and AAFP guidance** and emphasize preventive care, risk assessment, and shared decision-making rather than a fixed annual exam for all [^notfound].

---

## Evidence-based recommendations

Several authoritative organizations provide guidance on the frequency of routine physicals:

- **U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)**: The USPSTF does not specify a fixed interval for routine physicals but emphasizes individualized preventive care based on age, risk factors, and clinical judgment [^1144gL6E].

- **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)**: The AAFP similarly advocates for individualized preventive care, focusing on evidence-based screenings and counseling rather than routine annual physicals for all adults [^notfound].

- **American College of Physicians (ACP)**: The ACP highlights the lack of evidence supporting routine annual physicals for asymptomatic adults, recommending selective preventive services based on individual risk profiles [^notfound].

---

## Recommended frequency by age and risk profile

| **Age group** | **Risk profile** | **Recommended frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| 18–39 years | Low risk | Every 2–3 years |
| 18–39 years | High risk (e.g. chronic conditions, family history) | Annually or as indicated |
| 40–64 years | Low risk | Every 1–2 years |
| 40–64 years | High risk | Annually or as indicated |
| ≥ 65 years | All risk levels | Annually or as indicated |

---

These intervals reflect a balance between detecting early disease and avoiding unnecessary testing and costs.

---

## Components of routine physicals

Routine physicals typically include the following elements:

- **Vital signs**: Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, height, weight, and BMI [^116rDZRj].

- **Medical history**: Review of personal and family medical history, medications, allergies, and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity) [^113ZxR9d].

- **Physical examination**: Head-to-toe examination, including cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological assessments [^113ZxR9d].

- **Preventive screenings**: Age-appropriate screenings such as cholesterol, blood glucose, cancer screenings, and immunizations [^116rDZRj].

- **Counseling**: Lifestyle counseling, risk factor management, and shared decision-making regarding preventive measures [^117V8Tre].

---

## Benefits and limitations of routine physicals

### Benefits

Benefits include **early detection** of chronic conditions and risk factors, enabling timely intervention [^112RjoA9]. Routine visits also support relationship-building, fostering patient-physician rapport and improving adherence to medical advice [^116FmBUL], and deliver preventive care through counseling and screening to reduce morbidity and mortality [^112KCKxY].

---

### Limitations

Limitations include the potential for **unnecessary testing** — low-value tests and procedures that can cause harm, increase costs, and drive cascades of additional low-value care [^111BpRX9] — and the time burden on clinicians, given that fully implementing preventive guidelines can require more time than is available in routine practice [^115DNGem]. Limited evidence supports routine annual physicals for asymptomatic adults, particularly low-risk individuals [^113D27uP].

---

## Impact of patient demographics and health status

Patient demographics and health status significantly influence the frequency and content of routine physicals. Older adults generally benefit from **more frequent visits** due to higher prevalence of chronic conditions and functional decline, while younger, healthy adults may require less frequent visits [^116rDZRj]. Individuals with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease typically require **annual or more frequent monitoring** [^111cSSYh]. Family history of chronic diseases may necessitate **earlier and more frequent screenings** [^notfound].

---

## Role of preventive care and screenings

Preventive care and screenings are central to routine physicals, aiming to identify risk factors and early signs of disease. Recommended screenings include:

- **Blood pressure**: At least every 2 years for adults ≥ 18 years [^notfound].

- **Cholesterol**: Every 4–6 years for adults ≥ 20 years [^111fccwi].

- **Diabetes**: Every 3 years for adults ≥ 40 years or with risk factors.

- **Cancer screenings**: Mammography, colonoscopy, and cervical cancer screenings based on age and risk factors [^notfound].

---

## Patient preferences and shared decision-making

Patient preferences and **shared decision-making** play a crucial role in determining the frequency and content of **routine physicals**. Many patients value annual visits for reassurance, relationship-building, and comprehensive health assessments [^113D27uP]. Clinicians should engage patients in discussions about the **benefits and limitations** of routine physicals, tailoring care plans to individual needs and preferences [^1174qjYK].

---

## Current trends and changes in clinical practice

Recent trends indicate a shift toward **individualized preventive care**, with less emphasis on routine annual physicals for asymptomatic adults [^116rDZRj]. Telemedicine has also gained prominence, allowing for remote consultations and follow-ups, particularly for chronic disease management and counseling [^1156ooyv].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine physicals for adults should be **individualized** based on age, risk factors, and health status. Low-risk adults may benefit from less frequent visits, while high-risk individuals require more frequent monitoring. Preventive care, screenings, and patient preferences should guide the frequency and content of routine physicals. Clinicians should engage in shared decision-making to ensure care plans align with patient needs and current evidence-based guidelines.

### Preventive services recommendations for adults in primary care settings: agreement between Canada, France and the United States – a systematic review [^116FXvpF]. Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the level of agreement between recommendations on preventive services developed by Canada, France and the United States.

Methods

We gathered recommendations on primary and secondary preventive services to adults up to November 3rd, 2011 from Canadian and US Task Forces, and equivalent French agencies. We excluded recommendations on immunization, long-term diseases or pregnancy.

Results

Among 250 recommendations, 84 (34%) issued by a single country could not be compared; 43 (26%) of the remaining 166 were in strong agreement (strictly identical grades between advising countries); 25 of 43 resulted in a proposal to be implemented in clinical practice, two others not to be implemented in clinical practice and 16 were indeterminate about implementation. Strong agreement was more frequent for recommendations concerning history-taking and physical examination than for those concerning interventions (odds ratio (OR) = 11.3, 95%CI: 1.6–241.2; p = 0.04), and for recommendations concerning a high-risk population than for those concerning the general population (OR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.4–7.0; p = 0.006). Agreement did not differ either according to maximum time range between recommendations' publication or according to the advising country.

Conclusion

Agreement between recommendations is low particularly on those concerning non-clinical preventive services or non-high-risk individuals.

### The annual physical examination: important or time to abandon? [^113D27uP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The annual physical examination remains a popular format with both patients and providers, despite the lack of evidence that either a comprehensive examination or laboratory screening tests are indicated for healthy adults. Patient desire for extensive testing and comprehensive examination combined with provider belief that the physical examination is both of proven value and can detect subclinical illness have led to the continued pervasive practice of annual physical examinations in our country. The authors review the current forces behind the ongoing popularity of the annual physical examination and the current recommendations for preventive services in healthy adults, and provide thoughts on what the busy practicing clinician can focus on in the realm of proven preventive health.

### Effectiveness of physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care settings: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116Mqz58]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Physical inactivity is a leading global risk factor for mortality and morbidity. The World Health Organization updated their physical activity guidelines in 2020 and now state that adults should undertake at least 150–300 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity, or 75–150 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity, or an equivalent combination of aerobic based physical activity each week. Current national physical activity programmes have been ineffective in most countries, with one in four adults insufficiently physically active and no improvement in participation rates evident over the past two decades. The World Health Assembly has set a target to reduce physical inactivity by 15% by 2030. This target includes a recommendation for all countries to integrate physical activity counselling programmes into primary healthcare. On average, 70–80% of adults visit their general practice at least once each year. Therefore, health professionals in primary care have a unique opportunity to routinely prompt and provide physical activity interventions to patients through the millions of health consultations that take place worldwide each week.

Previous reviews have investigated the effectiveness of physical activity interventions delivered in primary care settings and some of these have reported small to moderate effects depending on the inclusion criteria used. However, these reviews have not been able to offer definitive conclusions to guide implementation or health policy on this question for several reasons: they were narrative reports, included non-randomised trials, recruited specific clinical populations, the findings were based solely on self-report measures of physical activity, or they included interventions not delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care. More recent reviews have only investigated outcomes such as energy expenditureand total amounts of physical activity, making it unclear how effective primary care delivered physical activity interventions are for increasing moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA), the required intensity to meet WHO physical activity guidelines. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to robustly and comprehensively synthesise evidence from randomised controlled trials on whether physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care are effective in increasing MVPA in their patients.

### Electrocardiograms in low-risk patients undergoing an annual health examination [^111BpRX9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Clinical guidelines advise against routine electrocardiograms (ECG) in low-risk, asymptomatic patients, but the frequency and impact of such ECGs are unknown.

Objective

To assess the frequency of ECGs following an annual health examination (AHE) with a primary care physician among patients with no known cardiac conditions or risk factors, to explore factors predictive of receiving an ECG in this clinical scenario, and to compare downstream cardiac testing and clinical outcomes in low-risk patients who did and did not receive an ECG after their AHE.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative health care databases from Ontario, Canada, between 2010/2011 and 2014/2015 to identify low-risk primary care patients and to assess the subsequent outcomes of interest in this time frame. All patients 18 years or older who had no prior cardiac medical history or risk factors who received an AHE.

Exposures

Receipt of an ECG within 30 days of an AHE.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was receipt of downstream cardiac testing or consultation with a cardiologist. Secondary outcomes were death, hospitalization, and revascularization at 12 months.

Results

A total of 3 629 859 adult patients had at least 1 AHE between fiscal years 2010/2011 and 2014/2015. Of these patients, 21.5% had an ECG within 30 days after an AHE. The proportion of patients receiving an ECG after an AHE varied from 1.8% to 76.1% among 679 primary care practices (coefficient of quartile dispersion [CQD], 0.50) and from 1.1% to 94.9% among 8036 primary care physicians (CQD, 0.54). Patients who had an ECG were significantly more likely to receive additional cardiac tests, visits, or procedures than those who did not (odds ratio [OR], 5.14; 95% CI, 5.07–5.21; P < .001). The rates of death (0.19% vs 0.16%), cardiac-related hospitalizations (0.46% vs 0.12%), and coronary revascularizations (0.20% vs 0.04%) were low in both the ECG and non-ECG cohorts.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite recommendations to the contrary, ECG testing after an AHE is relatively common, with significant variation among primary care physicians. Routine ECG testing seems to increase risk for a subsequent cardiology testing and consultation cascade, even though the overall cardiac event rate in both groups was very low.

Exercise and physical activity — Adults should be routinely counseled in healthcare visits to optimize a physically active lifestyle. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. For adults unable to meet the minimum physical activity recommendations (at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity), engaging in some moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity, even if less than this recommended amount, can be beneficial to reduce ASCVD risk. Decreasing sedentary behavior in adults may be reasonable to reduce ASCVD risk.

### Impact of the 2008 U.S. preventative services task force recommendation on frequency of prostate-specific antigen screening in older men [^1161nM2E]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of the 2008 U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommendation against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in men aged 75 and older on frequency of PSA screening in elderly men.

Design

Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis.

Setting

Fifteen community primary care practices in western Massachusetts.

Participants

Men aged 65 and older with one or more annual physicals between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010.

Measurements

PSA testing was determined from the electronic health record. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to model the rate of PSA testing over time for two age groups: 65 to 74, and 75 and older.

Results

Of the 7,833 men in this study, 60% were younger than 75. PSA screening rates were consistently lower in men aged 75 and older. Annual rates, adjusted for number of clinic visits, ranged from 12% to 28% in men aged 75 and older, and 37% to 49% in men aged 65 to 74. In the 2 years before the guideline was released, there was already a slow decline in screening rate in men aged 75 and older, whereas the screening rate in men aged 65 to 74 was rising. Compared to 2008, there was a 36% relative reduction in screening rate in 2009 and a 51% relative reduction in 2010 for men aged 75 and older, and a 12% relative reduction in screening rate in 2009 and a 24% relative reduction in 2010 for men aged 65 to 74.

Conclusion

The 2008 recommendation appeared to reduce PSA screening rates in older men in 2009 and 2010; there was a substantial reduction in men aged 75 and older and a more modest reduction in men aged 65 to 74.

### Physician characteristics associated with ordering 4 low-value screening tests in primary care [^112Zh4kz]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our findings should be considered within the context of the study's limitations. First, administrative data lack clinical granularity, such as new symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory data, which may inform the reason for the test being ordered. The physicians in our cohort were more likely to be further removed from medical school graduation and have a higher median number of patients per physician than those physicians who were ultimately excluded. These systematic differences could limit the generalizability of the results, particularly given that years in practice was significantly associated with increased odds of being a generalized frequent user. In addition, our investigation of a test's value did not account for considerations beyond the scope of CW recommendations. For instance, if advocating against the provision of these 4 low-value tests causes physicians to use more expensive or invasive alternatives for low-risk patients, then the overall influence of these 4 tests is not as negative as CW recommendations would suggest. Our study only examined 4 tests, and investigating low-value care ordering patterns across a greater number of tests, treatments, and procedures may better describe the extent to which low-value care provision is correlated across services and help create more reliable physician profiles.

### Effectiveness of physical activity promotion based in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113ZQw6R]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

Included trials met eight criteria:

1) Participants: adults aged 16 years or over, and determined as sedentary during participant recruitment or baseline measurement at trial entry
2) Recruitment: through primary care (that is, recruited from patients attending or registered with a general practice, family practice, or primary care clinic)
3) Intervention: any intervention of physical activity promotion, provided that the primary stated goal was to increase activity or fitness levels (or both) in participants (we excluded studies examining multifactorial interventions, such as promoting dietary modification in addition to physical activity)
4) Comparator characteristics: no restrictions
5) Outcome: physical activity or fitness
6) Design: randomised controlled trial
7) Follow-up: minimum of 12 months after randomisation
8) Analysis: intention to treat.

Search methods, study selection, and data extraction

We searched seven electronic databases: Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, and the Cochrane Library (May 2009; repeated May 2010). The search strategy included terms for "physical activity", "primary care", and "randomised controlled trial" (web appendix). We adapted the search for each database without language or date restrictions. We also hand searched reference lists of relevant articles and previous systematic reviews and contacted an independent expert to check omissions.

Titles and abstracts were screened against inclusion criteria by GO and potentially eligible articles were retrieved. Two reviewers (GO and SSu) assessed retrieved papers independently. A third reviewer (ALK) resolved any conflicts.

GO and SSu extracted data independently for each included paper onto a piloted form including: year and study location; recruitment method; participant flow; risk of bias; participant, intervention, and comparator characteristics; frequency and intensity of outcome measurement; and data on self reported and objective physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and adverse events. We obtained further information from authors of nine studies. This related mainly to assessment of risk of bias. We obtained unpublished data from one author.

### Use of accessible examination tables in the primary care setting: a survey of physical evaluations and patient attitudes [^111J9wj2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Accessible diagnostic equipment, including height-adjustable examination tables, is necessary to accommodate patients with disabilities. Studies demonstrate that only a minority of clinics provide accessible equipment. For clinics with this equipment, no studies have examined the use of such equipment in routine clinical care.

Objective

In primary care clinics with and without height-adjustable examination tables, we compared the frequency and variation in physical evaluations on examination tables and patients' perceptions of quality care.

Design

Survey administered to patients at two primary care clinics in Rochester, MN, in 2015. One clinic had height-adjustable examination tables in every exam room; the other clinic had none.

Patients

A total of 399 English-speaking adult primary care patients (61% participation).

Main Measures

Participants were asked whether they were physically evaluated on a table during their clinical encounter. In addition, they completed two subscales of the Patient Perception of Quality of Care survey: Perceptions of Provider's Bedside Manner and Perceptions of Provider's Work.

Key Results

Overall, there were no differences between clinics in the likelihood of patients being examined on an exam table or in their perceptions of quality of care. Across both clinics, patients who reported a disability were 27% less likely to be examined on a table, were less likely to rate their provider's bedside manner favorably (74% vs. 59%) and to have positive perceptions of their provider's work (46% vs. 32%) than patients without disabilities.

Conclusions

The presence of accessible medical equipment was not associated with care delivered to patients. While this might not be meaningful for most patients, it could be problematic for patients with disabilities, who are less likely to be examined. Therefore, accessible equipment alone may not be sufficient to reduce disparities in the care experience. Provider- and organization-level factors must thus be considered in efforts to provide equitable care to patients with disabilities.

### Implementation and evaluation of exercise is medicine in primary care clinics within a large academic health system [^112RdHr7]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insufficient physical activity (PA) is a primary behavioural risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The current aerobic PA recommendation for adults is ≥ 150 min of moderate-intensity PA, ≥ 75 min of vigorous-intensity PA or a combination of the two, per week. Only ~50% of adults in the United States meet aerobic PA guidelines. Although effectiveness has been established for many PA interventions, few have been widely implemented over time with sustained outcomes. Implementing PA promotion in healthcare settings has been proposed as a way to leverage patient trust in healthcare providers to scale programmes that help improve a lifestyle behaviour critical to population health.

Exercise is Medicine (EIM) is a global initiative supported by the American College of Sports Medicine with a goal of elevating PA to the level of a vital sign. This framework provides clinicians with a model to routinely assess, discuss and prescribe personalised PA goals and connect patients with health coaching support and/or community-based resources to help patients achieve them. EIM has had broad global reach, and an abundance of literature describes its importance and potential impact on population-wide PA levels. Few evidence-based programmes are successfully translated into real-world settings and even fewer are delivered at scale. Implementation science (IS) and quality improvement (QI) frameworks can help to bridge the research to practice gap by guiding a systematic approach to translating, adapting, implementing and evaluating evidence-based programmes at scale.

### American cancer society / American Society of Clinical Oncology breast cancer survivorship care guideline [^1172fmoW]. CA (2015). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE The purpose of the American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline is to provide recommendations to assist primary care and other clinicians in the care of female adult survivors of breast cancer. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed through April 2015. A multidisciplinary expert workgroup with expertise in primary care, gynecology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was formed and tasked with drafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. A total of 1073 articles met inclusion criteria; and, after full text review, 237 were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and physical examination, and should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do not support performing routine laboratory tests or imaging tests in asymptomatic patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care clinicians should counsel patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor for post-treatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor for adherence to endocrine therapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. Recommendations on surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, screening for second primary cancers, assessment and management of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of breast cancer and its treatment, health promotion, and care coordination/practice implications are made.

### Screening and preventive interventions for oral health in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111RpgkF]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Adult oral health screening and preventive interventions in primary care — USPSTF I statement indicates that the US Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening or preventive interventions for oral health conditions in the primary care setting for adults and suggests primary care clinicians use their clinical expertise to decide whether to perform these services. For the purposes of the review, screening included clinical assessments (eg, physical examination) and standardized risk prediction tools or a combination of approaches by primary care clinicians to identify adults who have existing oral health conditions or adults who might benefit most from interventions to prevent future negative oral health outcomes due to increased risk, and interventions that were reviewed included counseling and health education to reduce bacterial burden and refined sugar intake and the use of fluoride, dental sealants, silver diamine fluoride solution, and xylitol to promote resistance to caries.

### 2025 ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines core principles and development process: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111oFLdT]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Standard medical care for all patients with cardiovascular disease — clinical history and physical examination emphasize that clinical practice guidelines begin with the premise that clinicians are providing standard medical care including a comprehensive clinical history and appropriate physical examination; the cardiovascular clinical history provides the basis for understanding a patient's health experience and changes in physical function and symptoms over time; a patient's medical and family history may identify underlying risk factors relevant to the implementation of guideline recommendations; risk assessment for primary and secondary prevention of CVD is based on the clinical history and is supplemented by appropriate laboratory and noninvasive testing; and the clinical history offers an opportunity for shared decision-making to understand a patient's goals and values regarding their cardiovascular care.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for long-term breast cancer survivorship: assessment of quality and evidence-based recommendations [^112p61fr]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for surveillance for recurrent or new cancers and assessment of late physical and psychosocial effects

In the surveillance domain, the recommendations were related to medical history and physical examination, mammographies and non-routine tests (Table 5). No recommendations related to breast self-examination, pelvic examination, or cholesterol and lipid screening were found.

In the CPGs included in this review, the recommendations regarding the frequency of clinical follow-up in long-term breast cancer survivors vary. In general, the recommendations agree on an annual follow-up frequency beginning in the sixth year after primary treatment (Table 6). However, during the fifth year, significant variations are observed: four of the CPGs recommend a clinical follow-up every 6 months, and three CPGs extend this interval, recommending a frequency of every six to 12 months. On the other hand, the Canadian Cancer Society CPG differentiates itself by extending the frequency of follow-up to 12 months beginning in the fifth year.

With respect to mammography as follow-up, all but one of the CPGs reviewed recommend annual mammography beginning in the fifth year (Table 6). All the guidelines emphasise the importance of individualising mammographic follow-up strategies according to factors such as the characteristics of the tumour, the type of breast surgery (conservative or mastectomy), age, and the risk of relapse or mortality.

Finally, one of the CPGs recommended laboratory tests and imaging studies (except mammography and breast ultrasound) beginning in the fifth year in cases of clinical suspicion of recurrence and/or metastasis (Table 6).

Recommendations for coordination between primary care providers and specialists

In the coordination domain, recommendations regarding survival care plans were identified, whereas no references included recommendations on referrals to specialists (Table 5).

Two of the 10 CPGs agreed on the need for long-term follow-up (5–10 years or more), with an emphasis on regular evaluation. However, Biganzoli et al. propose early transfer to primary care, whereas Stangl et al. highlight the importance of continuous monitoring due to the chronic nature of the disease (Table 6). Both guidelines underscore the importance of establishing clear protocols for the transition between levels of care, ensuring continuity of care.

### Obesity management in primary care: a joint clinical perspective and expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) and the American college of osteopathic family physicians (ACOFP) – 2025 [^114e6jFv]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Primary care physical activity counseling for patients with obesity states that primary care clinicians face practical challenges when recommending physical activity, including lack of adequate training, time, interest, and reimbursement, yet most clinicians have opportunities to implement rudimentary approaches such as writing an "exercise prescription" using FITTE (Frequency, Intensity, Time spent, Type, Enjoyment), monitoring daily steps to escalate when appropriate, providing alternative recommendations for mobility limitations (e.g., a hand bike for lower extremity amputations), and referring to physical therapy or an exercise physiologist. Beyond effects on body weight and body composition, routine physical activity has multiple health benefits applicable to the patient with obesity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113HTFtS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Primary care management of asthma exacerbations (adults, adolescents, children 6–11 years) — a brief focused history and relevant physical examination should be conducted concurrently with the prompt initiation of therapy, and if severe or life‑threatening signs are present, treatment with SABA, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids should be initiated while arranging urgent transfer to an acute care facility; milder exacerbations can usually be treated in a primary care setting. The history should include timing of onset and cause, severity of asthma symptoms, any symptoms of anaphylaxis, any risk factors for asthma‑related death, and all current reliever and maintenance medications including doses, devices, adherence and recent changes. The physical examination should assess signs of exacerbation severity and vital signs, complicating factors, and signs of alternative conditions. Objective measurements include pulse oximetry where saturation levels < 90% in children or adults signal the need for aggressive therapy, noting that oxygen saturation may be over‑estimated by pulse oximetry in people with dark skin color; PEF is specified for patients older than 5 years.

### Identifying recommendations for stopping or scaling back unnecessary routine services in primary care [^113EFgWa]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Much of health care involves established, routine use of medical services for chronic conditions or prevention. Stopping these services when the evidence changes or if the benefits no longer outweigh the risks is essential. Yet, most guidelines focus on escalating care and provide few explicit recommendations to stop or scale back (ie, deintensify) treatment and testing.

Objective

To develop a systematic, transparent, and reproducible approach for identifying, specifying, and validating deintensification recommendations associated with routine adult primary care.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A focused review of existing guidelines and recommendations was completed to identify and prioritize potential deintensification indications. Then, 2 modified virtual Delphi expert panels examined the synthesized evidence, suggested ways that the candidate recommendations could be improved, and assessed the validity of the recommendations using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Twenty-five physicians from Veterans Affairs and US academic institutions with knowledge in relevant clinical areas (eg, geriatrics, primary care, women's health, cardiology, and endocrinology) served as panel members.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Validity of the recommendations, defined as high-quality evidence that deintensification is likely to improve patient outcomes, evidence that intense testing and/or treatment could cause harm in some patients, absence of evidence on the benefit of continued or repeated intense treatment or testing, and evidence that deintensification is consistent with high-quality care.

Results

A total of 409 individual recommendations were identified representing 178 unique opportunities to stop or scale back routine services (eg, stopping population-based screening for vitamin D deficiency and decreasing concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines). Thirty-seven recommendations were prioritized and forwarded to the expert panels. Panelists reviewed the evidence and suggested modifications, resulting in 44 recommendations being rated. Overall, 37 recommendations (84%) were considered to be valid, as assessed by the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, a total of 178 unique opportunities to deintensify routine primary care services were identified, and 37 of these were validated as high-priority deintensification recommendations. To date, this is the first study to develop a model for identifying, specifying, and validating deintensification recommendations that can be implemented and tracked in clinical practice.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116XbWDR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

New USPSTF recommendation on screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^112hFS2j]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Screening, diagnosis, and monitoring — adult screening states, "We recommend screening adults for elevated blood pressure periodically". (Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended). As context, "As this is a Not Reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review evidence related to this recommendation", and "the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is moderate". Rationale notes that "lifetime risk of developing HTN is so high (reaching approximately 90% for octogenarians), it is sensible to screen periodically". Regarding rescreening, the USPSTF "identified 40 studies addressing rescreening interval and hypertensive incidence in screened normotensive persons (defined as blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg using office blood pressure measurements)", with "highly variable estimates of incident HTN ranging from 2.2–4.4% at a one-year interval and 2.1–28.4% at five-year intervals", yet "the evidence remains unclear as to what the optimal interval should be".

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^1149FLeg]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Routine review

Patients at higher risk of future exacerbations should be reviewed in specialist care, where they present with or develop one or more of the following clinical situations:
They experience three or more exacerbations in 1 year.
They have chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation.
There is deteriorating bronchiectasis with declining lung function.
They have associated rheumatoid arthritis, immune deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease or primary ciliary dyskinesia.
They have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
Patients with advanced disease and those considering lung transplantation.

Lower-risk patients can be routinely reviewed in primary care. The exact frequency of review should be determined in the initial treatment plan, in consultation with the respiratory specialist and also by changing clinical conditions, but should be at a minimum frequency of once a year.

Factors to be routinely monitored by the primary care team (see Fig. 2) include:
Assessment of symptoms (cough, sputum production and breathlessness) and their impact on daily activities.
Chronic cough that can have a significant effect on daily activities, including sexual relations and urinary incontinence in women.
Exacerbation frequency.
Body mass index (BMI).
Pulse oximetry.
Spirometry.
The sputum should be sent for microbiological analysis when the patient is clinically stable, and should be sent at the start of an exacerbation before antibiotic treatment is started.
Compliance with sputum clearance exercises and shared treatment plan.

Deterioration in lung function, exacerbation frequency or clinical state should prompt specialist referral (see above). If the patient's BMI is < 20 kg/m², then specialist nutritional advice should be sought. In addition, the patient should be referred to a respiratory physiotherapist to reinforce the sputum clearance exercises if necessary. Similarly, referral for pulmonary rehabilitation should be considered, if the patient has functionally disabling breathlessness (MRC score ≥ 2).

Common co-morbidities, such as mild-to-moderate asthma or COPD, can be treated in the primary care setting, according to national or international guidelines for these conditions. – It is recommended that chronic rhinosinusitis be treated with nasal saline douching and intranasal steroids. There is a strong association between bronchiectasis and gastro-oesophageal disease (GORD) and patients with GORD have a more severe disease. The guideline recommends that symptoms of GORD are specifically sought out and treated, according to the existing NICE guidance, but do not provide evidence that treatment of GORD will improve bronchiectasis outcomes.

### Assessment of physician priorities in delivery of preventive care [^114rutqR]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

Of 241 primary care physicians invited to participate, 137 (57%) responded. Median completion time was 11 (interquartile range [IQR], 8–15) minutes. Most respondents were female (74 [54%]) and younger than 50 years (85 [62%]) (Table 1), compared with 39% female and 55% younger than 55 years nationally. Internal medicine and family medicine were similarly represented (74 [54%] and 63 [46%], respectively), comparable to national data.

Table 1.
Demographic Characteristics of Participating Physicians

Abbreviation: FTE, full-time equivalent.

Overall Use of Prioritization

Physicians strongly agreed with the statement, "I prioritize which preventive care services I will discuss with my patients". As shown in Table 2, the mean score was 4.27 (95% CI, 4.12–4.42). Physicians generally agreed that they had enough time to address preventive care during an annual physical examination (mean score, 4.21; 95% CI, 4.02–4.40) but not a routine office visit (mean score, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.99–2.38). Similarly, 103 physicians (75%) agreed that they discussed some, but not all, preventive services recommended in the electronic health record health maintenance tab (Epic Systems Corporation) during every visit (mean score, 3.99; 95% CI, 3.78–4.19), whereas only 41 (30%) agreed that they discussed all recommended preventive services (mean score, 2.66; 95% CI, 2.44–2.89).

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115jgPUJ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Physical activity assessment and counseling in healthcare settings — using simple tools and documenting results — can promote increased activity, with measurable impact from counseling. Physical activity assessment and counseling in the healthcare setting have important complementary roles; ascertaining physical activity patterns during a standard clinical visit is the first step and can be accomplished through several available simple assessment tools, and the results can be recorded in the electronic health record with parameters such as weight and BP. Physical activity counseling by clinicians can result in modest improvements in activity levels, with a number needed to counsel as low as 12 for an individual to achieve recommended physical activity levels.

### Screening and preventive interventions for oral health in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1118gF15]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Current practice and implementation barriers — The USPSTF found little evidence on current practices in primary care for routine screening or performing interventions to prevent dental caries or periodontitis in adults, and preventive interventions are generally performed in dental settings by dental professionals. There are well-known significant barriers to providing oral health services in the primary care setting, including variable clinician access and familiarity with interventions; primary care clinicians may need additional training and specific equipment, have reimbursement challenges, and encounter administrative obstacles to making dental referrals and linking patients to dental care. It is unknown how frequently fluoride is administered in older children and adults.

### U.S. Preventive Services Task Force methods to communicate and disseminate clinical preventive services recommendations [^112oKf7T]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues evidence-based screening and prevention recommendations, and key to this task is dissemination and implementation of these recommendations. The Task Force has recommendations for more than 84 topics; each USPSTF Recommendation Statement includes a letter grade, a topline summary to guide clinician interpretation in practice, and a summary of gaps in evidence to help catalyze clinically relevant research. The USPSTF aims to update existing topics regularly and considers new topics to add each year. Clearly communicating and disseminating each recommendation is a critical task to ensure maximum benefit from use of the recommendations. The primary USPSTF audience is primary care clinicians. Over time, other audiences have become interested in the USPSTF and these entities have broad and diverse needs, necessitating a range of communication platforms and approaches. This includes engagement with and input from topic experts, primary care and federal partners, and the public to help shape the development of the recommendations. It also includes engagement of partners to disseminate USPSTF recommendations to help ensure that the primary care workforce remains up-to-date on USPSTF recommendations. This paper outlines the approaches used by the USPSTF to both solicit input (e.g., public comment periods), as well as to facilitate dissemination of its recommendations to help improve the health of all Americans (e.g., web-based and mobile application tools, journal publications, and annual reports to Congress).

### Consensus recommendations for optimizing electronic health records for nutrition care [^114L89Tc]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2020). High credibility.

Discharge plan — continuity elements and instructions are delineated: Discharge planning is an interdisciplinary approach to provide continuity of care; it is a process that begins at admission when the provider determines anticipated post-hospital services and planning that includes the patient and family, developed through use of a structured discharge plan tailored to meet the individual's needs; inclusion of resolved and unresolved nutrition diagnoses, especially malnutrition, in the hospital discharge summary provides valuable information to the primary care, referring, or next-setting physician for ongoing treatment; and electronic discharge orders and instructions should include ongoing nutrition support as appropriate, frequency of follow-up evaluation by the health care team for laboratory studies, nutrition reassessment, and physical examination.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116YLzzu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

3 Primary clinical assessment

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

3.1 Initial presentation in primary care

In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action. As with other conditions, many patients merely adapt their lives to their symptoms. No formal primary care referral guidelines or recommendations exist for patients with chronic diarrhoea, but the presence of normal first-line investigations with symptoms severe enough to impair quality of life and not responding to treatment constitutes a rationale for referral.

The impact of the symptoms of chronic diarrhoea and the differential diagnoses that need to be considered are clearly different in individual patients. A patient with recent change in bowel habit to include diarrhoea over 6 weeks is likely to need a different approach compared with another patient who has suffered from intermittent watery diarrhoea which has been present for over 5 years. Blood, stool (if an infectious aetiology or if an inflammatory component is suspected) and serological tests (for coeliac disease, hyperthyroidism and anaemia) should be performed in primary care as an initial assessment. Equally, if alarm features (such as unexplained change in bowel habit, persistent blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss) are detected, then referral for further investigations should be initiated.

### Revisiting the time needed to provide adult primary care [^115DNGem]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients do not receive guideline-recommended preventive, chronic disease, and acute care. One potential explanation is insufficient time for primary care providers (PCPs) to provide care.

Objective

To quantify the time needed to provide 2020 preventive care, chronic disease care, and acute care for a nationally representative adult patient panel by a PCP alone, and by a PCP as part of a team-based care model.

Design

Simulation study applying preventive and chronic disease care guidelines to hypothetical patient panels.

Participants

Hypothetical panels of 2500 patients, representative of the adult US population based on the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Main Measures

The mean time required for a PCP to provide guideline-recommended preventive, chronic disease and acute care to the hypothetical patient panels. Estimates were also calculated for visit documentation time and electronic inbox management time. Times were re-estimated in the setting of team-based care.

Key Results

PCPs were estimated to require 26.7 h/day, comprising of 14.1 h/day for preventive care, 7.2 h/day for chronic disease care, 2.2 h/day for acute care, and 3.2 h/day for documentation and inbox management. With team-based care, PCPs were estimated to require 9.3 h per day (2.0 h/day for preventive care and 3.6 h/day for chronic disease care, 1.1 h/day for acute care, and 2.6 h/day for documentation and inbox management).

Conclusions

PCPs do not have enough time to provide the guideline-recommended primary care. With team-based care the time requirements would decrease by over half, but still be excessive.

### Acute headache in adults: a diagnostic approach [^112UzePz]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

A detailed history and physical examination can distinguish between key features of a benign primary headache and concerning symptoms that warrant further evaluation for a secondary headache. Most headaches that are diagnosed in the primary care setting are benign. Among primary headache disorders, tension-type headache is the most common, although a migraine headache is more debilitating and likely to present in the primary care setting. Signs such as predictable timing, sensitivity to smells or sounds, family history of migraine, recurrent sinus headache, or recurrent severe headaches with a normal neurologic examination could indicate migraine headache. Evaluating acute headaches using a systematic framework such as the SNNOOP10 mnemonic can help detect life-threatening secondary causes of headaches. Red flag signs or symptoms such as acute thunderclap headache, fever, meningeal irritation on physical examination, papilledema with focal neurologic signs, impaired consciousness, and concern for acute glaucoma warrant immediate evaluation. For emergent evaluations, noncontrast computed tomography of the head is recommended to exclude acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. A lumbar puncture is also needed to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage if the scan result is normal. For less urgent cases, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is preferred for evaluating headaches with concerning features. Primary headache disorders without red flags or abnormal examination findings do not need neuroimaging.

### Vision screening for infants and children-2022 [^115QYap3]. AAO (2022). High credibility.

Primary care — in the primary care setting, the Academy and AAPOS recommend that an ocular assessment be performed whenever questions arise about the health of the visual system of a child of any age, and even in the absence of specific signs or symptoms, they recommend that infants and children be routinely screened for vision problems as follows and that any child who does not pass one or more of these screening tests have an ophthalmological examination.

### Interventions to improve screening and follow-up in primary care: a systematic review of the evidence [^117SASRz]. Academic Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations recommend several screening tests as part of preventive care. The proportion of children who are appropriately screened and who receive follow-up care is low.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the evidence for practice-based interventions to increase the proportion of patients receiving recommended screening and follow-up services in pediatric primary care.

Data Source

Medline database of journal citations.

Study Eligibility Criteria, Participants, and Interventions

We developed a strategy to search MEDLINE to identify relevant articles. We selected search terms to capture categories of conditions (eg, developmental disabilities, obesity), screening tests, specific interventions (eg, quality improvement initiatives, electronic records enhancements), and primary care. We searched references of selected articles and reviewed articles suggested by experts. We included all studies with a distinct, primary care-based intervention and post-intervention screening data, and studies that focused on children and young adults (≤ 21 years of age). We excluded studies of newborn screening.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Abstracts were screened by 2 reviewers and articles with relevant abstracts received full text review and were evaluated for inclusion criteria. A structured tool was used to abstract data from selected articles. Because of heterogeneous interventions and outcomes, we did not attempt a meta-analysis.

Results

From 2547 returned titles and abstracts, 23 articles were reviewed. Nine were pre-post comparisons, 5 were randomized trials, 3 were postintervention comparisons with a control group, 3 were postintervention cross-sectional analyses only, and 3 reported time series data. Of 14 articles with preintervention or control group data and significance testing, 12 reported increases in the proportion of patients appropriately screened. Interventions were heterogeneous and often multifaceted, and several types of interventions, such as provider/staff training, electronic medical record templates/prompts, and learning collaboratives, appeared effective in improving screening quality. Few articles described interventions to track screening results or referral completion for those with abnormal tests. Data were often limited by single-site, nonrandomized design.

Conclusions

Several feasible, practice- and provider-level interventions appear to increase the quality of screening in pediatric primary care. Evidence for interventions to improve follow-up of screening tests is scant. Future research should focus on which specific interventions are most effective, whether effects are sustained over time, and what interventions improve follow-up of abnormal screening tests.

### Does counseling by clinicians improve physical activity? A summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^111y35Vi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether counseling adults in primary care settings improves and maintains physical activity levels.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Registry of Controlled Trials and the MEDLINE, HealthStar, and Best Evidence databases were searched for papers published from 1994 to March 2002.

Study Selection

Controlled trials, case-control studies, and observational studies that examined counseling interventions aimed at increasing physical activity in general primary care populations were reviewed. The researchers included trials in which 1) a patient's primary care clinician performed some of the counseling intervention; 2) behavioral outcomes (physical activity) were reported; and 3) the study was of "good" or "fair" quality, according to criteria developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted on design and execution, quality, providers, patients, setting, counseling intervention, and self-reported physical activity at follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Eight trials involving 9054 adults met the inclusion criteria. Among six controlled trials with a usual care control group, the effects of counseling on physical activity were mixed. Because most studies had at least one methodologic limitation, it was difficult to rigorously assess the efficacy of the interventions. More research is needed to clarify the effect, benefits, and potential harms of counseling patients in primary care settings to increase physical activity.

Conclusion

Evidence is inconclusive that counseling adults in the primary care setting to increase physical activity is effective.

Esophageal and EGJ cancer survivorship — surveillance and care coordination: Survivorship care planning should include appropriate timing of transfer of care to a primary care physician and maintenance of a therapeutic relationship with the primary care physician throughout life, and the oncology team and primary care physician should have clearly delineated roles in survivorship care, with these roles communicated to the patient. In general, routine esophageal/EGJ cancer-specific surveillance is not recommended for more than 5 years following the end of treatment, and surveillance should be performed in conjunction with good routine medical care, including routine health maintenance, preventive care, and cancer screening. Annual history and physical examination are reasonable as potential second primary cancers are possible.

### Effectiveness of physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care settings: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112DNem8]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by primary care health professionals for increasing moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) in adult patients.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Databases (Medline and Medline in progress, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Sports Medicine and Education Index, ASSIA, PEDro, Bibliomap, Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index), trial registries (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, TRoPHI), and grey literature (OpenGrey) sources were searched (from inception to September 2020).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials of aerobic based physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care with a usual care control group or another control group that did not involve physical activity.

Study Selection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers screened the search results, extracted data from eligible trials and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (version 2). Inverse variance meta-analyses using random effects models examined the primary outcome of difference between the groups in MVPA (min/week) from baseline to final follow-up. The odds of meeting the guidelines for MVPA at follow-up were also analysed.

Results

14566 unique reports were identified and 46 randomised controlled trials with a range of follow-ups (3–60 months) were included in the meta-analysis (n = 16198 participants). Physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care increased MVPA by 14 min/week (95% confidence interval 4.2 to 24.6, P = 0.006). Heterogeneity was substantial (I 2 = 91%, P < 0.001). Limiting analyses to trials that used a device to measure physical activity showed no significant group difference in MVPA (mean difference 4.1 min/week, 95% confidence interval -1.7 to 9.9, P = 0.17; I² = 56%, P = 0.008). Trials that used self-report measures showed that intervention participants achieved 24 min/week more MVPA than controls (95% confidence interval 6.3 to 41.8, P = 0.008; I² = 72%, P < 0.001). Additionally, interventions increased the odds of patients meeting guidelines for MVPA by 33% (95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.50, P < 0.001; I² = 25%, P = 0.11) versus controls. 14 of 46 studies were at high risk of bias but sensitivity analyses excluding these studies did not alter the results.

Conclusions

Physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care appear effective at increasing participation in self-reported MVPA. Such interventions should be considered for routine implementation to increase levels of physical activity and improve health outcomes in the population.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening and preventive interventions for oral health in asymptomatic adults — For asymptomatic adults 18 years or older, the USPSTF states: "The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries or periodontal-related disease. Grade: I statement" and "The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of preventive interventions performed by primary care clinicians for oral health conditions, including dental caries or periodontal-related disease. Grade: I statement". This recommendation applies to "asymptomatic adults 18 years or older", and "In the absence of evidence, primary care clinicians should use their clinical expertise to decide whether to perform these services".

### 2025 ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines core principles and development process: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113ZxR9d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Standard medical care for all patients with cardiovascular disease — Clinical practice guidelines begin with the premise that clinicians are providing standard medical care, including a comprehensive clinical history and appropriate physical examination; the cardiovascular clinical history provides the basis for understanding a patient's health experience and changes in physical function and symptoms over time; a patient's medical and family history may identify underlying risk factors; assessment of risk for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is based on the clinical history and supplemented by appropriate laboratory and noninvasive testing; the clinical history also offers an opportunity for shared decision-making (SDM) to understand a patient's goals and values.

### Effectiveness of physical activity interventions delivered or prompted by health professionals in primary care settings: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117MMfQm]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The likelihood of meeting MVPA guidelines (according to the guidance used in the individual randomised controlled trials) was explored using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We calculated the standardised mean difference for total physical activity because of the variety of outcomes reported (eg, minutes, accelerometer counts, steps) and the effect size was interpreted as small (0.2), moderate (0.5), or large (0.8). See supplementary material for additional information on data synthesis methods.

Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted that compared device and self-report measures of MVPA. We investigated intervention intensity according to the number of contacts with an interventionalist (at least one of which must have been with a health professional in primary care) to compare the effects of brief (one session ≤ 30 min), multiple brief (more than one session ≤ 30 min), and intensive interventions (more than one session > 30 min) on outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding the studies considered at high risk of bias.

Post hoc subgroup analyses were conducted that compared interventions with a high number of intervention contacts (at least five contacts) versus a low number (less than five contacts). We investigated the merits of interventions delivered solely by primary care health professionals versus those involving primary care health professionals plus other interventionalists. Because primary healthcare systems differ by country, the impact of country was examined. We also explored the effect of difference in follow-up length (0–6, 7–12, > 12 months).

Patient and public involvement

No patients or the public were involved in this systematic review due to funding restrictions.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^112HyvY7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Key action statement 1 — history and physical examination policy and rationale specify "Benefits: Identify organic, and potentially treatable, underlying causes (eg, secondary tinnitus); minimize cost and administrative burden through a targeted approach to history and physical examination; streamline care/increase efficiency; improve patient satisfaction; identify patients with primary tinnitus who may benefit from further management (as outlined in this guideline)". They report "Risks, harms, costs: None", with "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit", and note "Value judgments: Perception by the GDG that tinnitus sufferers may not receive thorough evaluations from clinicians; further perception that many clinicians are unaware of the optimal targeted history and physical examination to evaluate a patient with tinnitus". Additional statements include "Intentional vagueness: The definition of a "targeted" history and physical examination is elaborated upon in the supporting text"., "Role of patient preferences: None", "Exclusions: None", "Policy level: Recommendation", and "Differences of opinion: None".

### American college of lifestyle medicine expert consensus statement: lifestyle medicine for optimal outcomes in primary care [^114TgPnt]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Lifestyle medicine (LM) vital signs and assessments — The crux of successful LM treatment is sustained patient health behavior change, and LM vital signs should be performed when clinically relevant (i.e., at baseline and monitored periodically as needed to track progress over time). The only broadly recognized LM-specific vital sign is the Physical Activity Vital Sign, a validated, three question tool that can quickly assess a patient's weekly minutes of physical activity and number of resistance training sessions, and capturing these data emphasizes importance, allows comparison to guidelines, creates opportunities for discussion, and can serve as the basis to co-create a SMART goal. Validated short and long questionnaires or screening tools exist for all pillars of LM and are preferred; however, current validated tools are not necessarily LM-specific and may not provide the sensitivity or responsiveness needed, so other clinical tools such as the Lifestyle Medicine Assessment could be acceptable adjuncts. Regardless of the instrument, consistent measurement and tracking over time is critical to ensure optimal LM dosing, and further research to validate LM-specific assessments and screening tools would be a beneficial adjunct for LM clinicians.

### Assessment of primary care services and perceived barriers to care in persons with disabilities [^116KD8Du]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine what percentage of persons with disabilities have a primary care provider, participate in routine screening and health maintenance examinations, and identify perceived physical or physician barriers to receiving care.

Design

A total of 344 surveys, consisting of 66 questions, were collected from adults with disabilities receiving care at an outpatient rehabilitation clinic.

Results

A total of 89.5% (95% CI 86.3%-92.8%) of participants reported having a primary care physician. Younger persons (P < 0.0001), men (P < 0.02), persons with brain injury (P < 0.05), or persons with amputations (P < 0.05) were less likely to have a primary care physician. Participant report of screening for alcohol, nonprescription drug use, and safety with relationships at home ranged from 26.6% to 37.5% compared with screening for depression, diet, exercise, and smoking (64.5%-70%). Completion rates of age- and gender-appropriate health maintenance examinations ranged from 42.4% to 90%. A total of 2.67% of participants reported problems with physical access at their physician's office, and 36.4% (95% CI 30.8%-42.1%) of participants reported having to teach their primary care physician about their disability.

Conclusions

Most persons with disabilities have a primary care physician. In general, completion rates for routine screening and health maintenance examinations were high. Perceived deficits in primary care physicians' knowledge of disability issues seem more prevalent than physical barriers to care.

### Does this child with high blood pressure have secondary hypertension? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111XUK9E]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend that all children and adolescents with hypertension undergo evaluation for secondary causes. Identifying clinical factors associated with secondary hypertension may decrease unnecessary testing for those with primary hypertension.

Objective

To determine the utility of the clinical history, physical examination, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for differentiating primary hypertension from secondary hypertension in children and adolescents (aged ≤ 21 years).

Data Sources and Study Selection

The databases of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to January 2022 without language limits. Two authors identified studies describing clinical characteristics in children and adolescents with primary and secondary hypertension.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For each clinical finding in each study, a 2×2 table was created that included the number of patients with and without the finding who had primary vs secondary hypertension. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Random-effects modeling was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Of 3254 unique titles and abstracts screened, 30 studies met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and 23 (N = 4210 children and adolescents) were used for pooling in the meta-analysis. In the 3 studies conducted at primary care clinics or school-based screening clinics, the prevalence of secondary hypertension was 9.0% (95% CI, 4.5%-15.0%). In the 20 studies conducted at subspecialty clinics, the prevalence of secondary hypertension was 44% (95% CI, 36%-53%). The demographic findings most strongly associated with secondary hypertension were family history of secondary hypertension (sensitivity, 0.46; specificity, 0.90; LR, 4.7 [95% CI, 2.9–7.6]), weight in the 10th percentile or lower for age and sex (sensitivity, 0.27; specificity, 0.94; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.2–18]), history of prematurity (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.33; specificity range, 0.86–0.94; LR range, 2.3–2.8), and age of 6 years or younger (sensitivity range, 0.25–0.36; specificity range, 0.86–0.88; LR range, 2.2–2.6). Laboratory studies most associated with secondary hypertension were microalbuminuria (sensitivity, 0.13; specificity, 0.99; LR, 13 [95% CI, 3.1–53]) and serum uric acid concentration of 5.5 mg/dL or lower (sensitivity range, 0.70–0.73; specificity range, 0.65–0.89; LR range, 2.1–6.3). Increased daytime diastolic blood pressure load combined with increased nocturnal systolic blood pressure load on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was associated with secondary hypertension (sensitivity, 0.40; specificity, 0.82; LR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.2–20]). Findings associated with a decreased likelihood of secondary hypertension were asymptomatic presentation (LR range, 0.19–0.36), obesity (LR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.13–0.90]), and family history of any hypertension (LR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30–0.57]). Hypertension stage, headache, and left ventricular hypertrophy did not distinguish secondary from primary hypertension.

Conclusions and Relevance

Family history of secondary hypertension, younger age, lower body weight, and increased blood pressure load using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were associated with a higher likelihood of secondary hypertension. No individual sign or symptom definitively differentiates secondary hypertension from primary hypertension.

### Screening for and management of obesity in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117RVuvc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2003 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for obesity and overweight in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and primary care–feasible or referable nonsurgical weight-loss interventions.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening all adults for obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with a body mass index of 30 kg/m² or higher to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions (B recommendation).

### Quality indicators for knee and hip osteoarthritis care: a systematic review [^114wDX8a]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

History taking and examination (n = 32 QIs)

QIs on assessment of functional status and level of pain were most common and focused on all healthcare settings, except for centralised intake care. QIs on assessment for assistive devices, appliances and aids, and radiographic assessment also focused on the entire spectrum of disciplines, except for centralised intake care. Differences were seen in the indication for radiographic assessment; from offering a radiography to patients with incident hip OA to only offering a radiograph to patients with worsening complaints or patients who seem resistant to conservative treatment. QIs on the diagnostic aspiration of the joint and examination of joint before drug use were less common and focused on the US only. QIs relating to history taking and health assessment to evaluate the given treatment were mainly described for (physiotherapy) primary care settings in Europe.

Education and information (n = 22 QIs)

QIs on this theme related to information on the pathology of OA, treatment options and self-management and were similar between countries. Most QIs on this theme were developed for primary care (physiotherapy) in the Netherlands, but least for secondary care and healthcare in the US.

Exercise therapy (n = 25 QIs)

QIs regarding exercise therapy were mostly developed for primary care on recommending and prescribing physiotherapy or specific exercises and were similar between countries. Three QIs focusing on the entire spectrum of disciplines were found regarding the frequency and regular evaluations of exercise therapy sessions, and regarding tailoring exercise therapy to patients goals.

Weight counselling (n = 7)

QIs for advice on weight loss were developed for primary care and the entire spectrum of disciplines. Body mass index (BMI) threshold and frequency for advising patients to lose weight differed between QIs for the entire spectrum of disciplines in the United States and QIs for family medicine in Mexico (> 25 kg/m² vs > 27 kg/m², and at least once in 2 years vs annually).

'Do not do' QIs (n = 3)

Two QIs for primary care (physiotherapy) in the Netherlands focused on recommending against massage and physical modalities other than Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation. One QI for the entire spectrum of disciplines focused on not prescribing a brace for people with knee OA, except for patients with unicompartmental knee OA with axial deviation.

### Update on the methods of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: methods for understanding certainty and net benefit when making recommendations [^117PcJWF]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Since the 1980s, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has developed and used rigorous methods to make evidence-based recommendations about preventive services to promote health and well-being for all Americans. Recommendations are based on the evidence of magnitude of net benefit (benefits minus harms). Expert opinion is not substituted when evidence is lacking. Evidence gaps are common. Few preventive services are supported by high-quality studies that directly and comprehensively determine the overall magnitude of benefits and harms in the same study. When assessing the body of evidence, studies may not have been conducted in primary care settings, studies may not have sufficiently included populations of interest, and long-term outcomes may not have been directly assessed. When direct evidence is not available, the USPSTF uses the methodologies of applicability to determine whether evidence can be generalized to an asymptomatic primary care population; coherence to link bodies of evidence and create an indirect evidence pathway; extrapolation to make inferences across the indirect evidence pathway, extend evidence to populations not specifically studied, consider service delivery intervals, and infer long-term outcomes; and conceptual bounding to set theoretical lower or upper limits for plausible benefits or harms. The USPSTF extends the evidence only so far as to maintain at least moderate certainty that its findings are preserved. This manuscript details with examples of how the USPSTF uses these methods to make recommendations that truly reflect the evidence.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^112rNrgM]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative evaluation and testing for cataract surgery — medical assessment and laboratory testing guidance indicates that a preoperative medical evaluation by the patient's primary care physician or a dedicated preoperative service may be considered, while routine preoperative laboratory testing in association with the history and physical examination is not indicated. A very large, prospective, randomized clinical trial demonstrated that routine medical testing did not reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality; despite this finding, routine medical testing is still performed on many Medicare recipients, and directed testing may be recommended as appropriate for a particular surgical candidate with medical problems.

### Completion of recommended tests and referrals in telehealth vs in-person visits [^1156ooyv]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at 2 primary care sites in Boston, Massachusetts: 1 large urban hospital-based primary care practice and 1 affiliated community health center. We examined all visits from March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. The hospital-based site cares for approximately 42 000 patients while the affiliated community health center cares for approximately 6000 patients. We accessed clinical data for the 2 sites through a data warehouse, which maintains data for both and allows search by billing diagnoses, tests, referrals, and patient demographic characteristics. At both sites, patients have the option of both in-person visit and telehealth visits (telephone or video). Our research protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The institutional review boards at both institutions deemed that informed consent from study participants was not required because only deidentified data were involved. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

We reviewed referrals and tests resulting from a concerning finding or need for screening, prompting the clinician to order an additional diagnostic workup. The order may have been placed during an in-person visit, a telehealth visit, or on a date when no visit occurred. We extracted data for 3 types of high-risk tests and referrals ordered between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021: colonoscopy referrals, dermatology referrals for suspicious skin lesions, and cardiac stress tests (including both exercise and chemical stress tests, with and without imaging). These tests were chosen due to their different characteristics, ease of test completion, high-risk nature with major clinical implications, and institutional prioritization. We then examined all orders for completion between March 1, 2020, to March 30, 2022.

Within all visit modalities, the order for testing or referrals is placed electronically through the electronic medical record. There is little to no proactive outreach for the scheduling of patients for routine orders. During an in-person visit, the patient is given a form with a telephone number to call to schedule the test or referral. For patients with limited English proficiency or complex needs, a member of the support staff team may help the patient schedule this test at checkout. During a telehealth visit, a patient is given the telephone number to call to schedule the test or referral by the clinician during the visit. In all scenarios, the patient receives no communication after the visit reminding them to schedule the test or referral.

### Screening for depression in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114aBx3e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for depression in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF examined evidence on the benefits and harms of screening primary care patients for depression, including direct evidence that depression screening programs improve health outcomes. The USPSTF did not reexamine evidence for those key questions that had strong, consistent evidence in the 2002 review, including questions about the accuracy of screening instruments in identifying depressed adult patients in primary care settings, and the efficacy of treatment of depressed adults with antidepressants or psychotherapy. New areas of evidence considered for this review (and not reviewed in 2002) include efficacy of treatment of depression in older adult patients, harms of screening for depression in primary care settings, and adverse events from treatment of depression in adults.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening adults for depression when staff-assisted depression care supports are in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routinely screening adults for depression when staff-assisted depression care supports are not in place. There may be considerations that support screening for depression in an individual patient. (Grade C recommendation).

### Screening for impaired visual acuity in older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114FUkFf]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and detection — primary care methods — indicate that a Snellen eye chart or the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart are the most common methods used in primary care to detect changes in visual acuity. Other available tests include the pinhole test, the Amsler grid, or fundoscopy. Clinically significant cataracts can be visualized on physical examination as changes in lens color or opacities. Impaired visual acuity in older adults may not be recognized or may remain unreported because changes can be subtle, occur in more advanced stages, progress slowly, or occur in persons with cognitive dysfunction or comorbid conditions.

### Quality indicators for care of osteoarthritis in primary care settings: a systematic literature review [^115CddgS]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Evidence-based and valid quality indicators for assessing quality of primary care for osteoarthritis are scarce, but the identified set of indicators addresses multiple dimensions of osteoarthritis care and provides an excellent starting point for further development. As the disease burden of osteoarthritis is high, and much of it is presented clinically to general practitioners, incorporation of these indicators to routine primary care practice is recommended. Periodic evaluation reports of primary care for osteoarthritis can be useful to monitor performance and serve to evaluate effectiveness of osteoarthritis care.

Quality indicators should be valid and sensitive to the changes they are intended to detect and should be linked to improving patient outcomes. There is a need to develop specific process, structure and outcome measures for adults with osteoarthritis by engaging clinicians, patients and families in the identification of meaningful measures and then determining how they could be collected systematically. Future research is required to implement the identified set of quality indicators in this study, to identify additional quality indicators of relevance to patients and families and to examine the association between identified structures and processes and osteoarthritis care outcomes.

### Developing evidence-based screening recommendations, with consideration for rheumatology [^117XmcoC]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Screening for presymptomatic disease provides the potential for early intervention and improved outcomes. However, although this practice has potential benefits, it also has potential harms that must be considered. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is a nonfederal panel of experts convened by the Agency for Health Research and Policy to systematically review the evidence for preventive services, including disease screening, and to create evidence-based recommendations for primary care practice in the United States. As rheumatologists contemplate the potential of screening for preclinical disease, understanding the process used by the USPSTF can help guide research efforts supporting such screening.

### Effect of exercise referral schemes in primary care on physical activity and improving health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116eGExN]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Physical activity contributes to the prevention and management of many medical conditions and diseases, including coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and mental illness, such as dementia and depression. Despite recommendations that adults should undertake at least 30 minutes of exercise of moderate intensity at least five times a week, only about a third are active to this level.

Primary care is a key setting for the promotion of physical activity. Consequently, myriad primary care based interventions have developed over the past 20 years. A common model is the exercise referral scheme, in which a general practitioner (or another member of the primary care team) identifies and refers a sedentary individual with evidence of at least one cardiovascular risk factor to a third party service (often a sports centre or leisure facility). This service then prescribes and monitors an exercise programme tailored to the individual needs of the patient. In the United Kingdom, contemporary exercise referral schemes were first set up around 1990, with numbers growing rapidly; more than 600 schemes are now thought to be in operation. Many schemes operate across several sites, which all adhere to a core set of standards. The exercise referral scheme model is also being established in primary care practice in other areas, including Spain and Scandinavian countries.

Several systematic reviews have examined the evidence base for exercise referral schemes and concluded that these schemes can increase the physical activity of sedentary adults in the short term. Although these reviews included several randomised controlled trials (21 in total), many of these were studies of physical activity interventions without a referral by a member of the primary care team to a third party exercise provider. Few randomised controlled trials, therefore, have assessed the specific impact of an exercise referral scheme. Furthermore, these trials have failed to address the impact of exercise referral schemes on health related outcomes (for example, changes in lipid profile and blood pressure) or for individuals with pre-existing conditions, who could be most likely to benefit from these schemes (for example, those with coronary heart disease or depression). In 2006, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) called for more controlled research on the effectiveness of exercise referral schemes.

We therefore updated the evidence base for exercise referral schemes in the light of new controlled trials and revisited previous concerns about the applicability of this evidence to policy and practice. A cost effectiveness analysis of exercise referral schemes has also been undertaken.

### Prioritization of evidence-based preventive health services during periodic health examinations [^116gZ4HY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Delivery of preventive services sometimes falls short of guideline recommendations.

Purpose

To evaluate the multilevel factors associated with evidence-based preventive service delivery during periodic health examinations (PHEs).

Methods

Primary care physicians were recruited from an integrated delivery system in southeast Michigan. Audio recordings of PHE office visits conducted from 2007 to 2009 were used to ascertain physician recommendation for or delivery of 19 guideline-recommended preventive services. Alternating logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with service delivery. Data analyses were completed in 2011.

Results

Among 484 PHE visits to 64 general internal medicine and family physicians by insured patients aged 50–80 years, there were 2662 services for which patients were due; 54% were recommended or delivered. Regression analyses indicated that the likelihood of service delivery decreased with patient age and with each concern the patient raised, and it increased with increasing BMI and with each additional minute after the scheduled appointment time the physician first presented. The likelihood was greater with patient-physician gender concordance and less if the physician used the electronic medical record in the exam room or had seen the patient in the past 12 months.

Conclusions

A combination of patient, patient-physician relationship, and visit contextual factors are associated with preventive service delivery. Additional studies are warranted to understand the complex interplay of factors that support and compromise preventive service delivery.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^113puhxm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination — benefits, harms, and policy language include the following: Benefits: Identify organic, and potentially treatable, underlying causes (eg, secondary tinnitus); minimize cost and administrative burden through a targeted approach to history and physical examination; streamline care/increase efficiency; improve patient satisfaction; identify patients with primary tinnitus who may benefit from further management (as outlined in this guideline). Risks, harms, costs: None. Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit. Value judgments: Perception by the GDG that tinnitus sufferers may not receive thorough evaluations from clinicians; further perception that many clinicians are unaware of the optimal targeted history and physical examination to evaluate a patient with tinnitus. Intentional vagueness: The definition of a "targeted" history and physical examination is elaborated upon in the supporting text. Role of patient preferences: None. Exclusions: None. Policy level: Recommendation. Differences of opinion: None.

Screening frequency: The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI. In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1 time-only screening among persons at low risk for future TB exposure to annual screening among those who are at continued risk of exposure.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^116i6pJf]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Clinical strategies to promote healthy eating and active living and limiting alcohol — In primary care, it is recommended that clinicians offer or refer adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions, which evidence suggests can lead to clinically significant improvements in weight status and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among adults with obesity and elevated plasma glucose levels; recommendations regarding reducing alcohol consumption include alcohol screening and behavioral counseling interventions in primary care settings to identify those individuals, including pregnant women, at higher risk of alcohol-related harms. Incorporation of questions about exercise as a vital sign — asked during routine visits just as blood pressure and weight are measured — has been associated with modest weight loss and lower hemoglobin A1c levels; screening for food insecurity and inclusion of questions related to food choices as a vital sign during routine clinical encounters may also promote healthful eating behaviors; health care providers can be a valuable referral source to community efforts such as food assistance programs, food banks, voucher programs to retail stores and farmers markets, and doctor-led walking groups to promote walking as a health-enhancing behavior among patients.

### Vision screening in children aged 6 months to 5 years: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116Np2nH]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Current practice and implementation — vision screening is described as routine in primary care, with uptake and practical considerations as follows: "Vision screening is routinely offered in most primary care settings". "Screening rates among children aged 3 years are approximately 40% and increase with age", and "One survey reported that 3% of pediatricians begin vision screening at age 6 months". Cooperation challenges are noted: "Younger children (< 3 years) are often unable to cooperate with some of the clinical screening tests performed in clinical practice, such as visual acuity testing, which may result in false-positive results". Device guidance includes that "Some clinical practice guidelines now recommend using handheld autorefractors and photoscreeners as alternative approaches to screening in children 6 months and older because of improved child cooperation and improved accuracy", but "One potential disadvantage of using some types of photoscreeners is the need for external interpretation of screening results". Referral after positive screens is specified: "Children with positive findings should be referred for a complete eye examination to confirm the presence of vision abnormalities and for further treatment". Harm context is provided: "Untreated vision abnormalities can result in short- and long-term physical and psychological harms, such as accidents and injuries, experiencing bullying behaviors, poor visual motor skills, depression and anxiety, poor self-esteem, and problems at school and work".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^112rKcBj]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Aerobic exercise — blood pressure reduction: We recommend a target for aerobic exercise of at least 120 minutes per week for reduction in blood pressure (Strong for | Not Reviewed, Amended). As this is a Not Reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group did not systematically review new evidence related to this recommendation, and prior trials showed statistically significant improvements in blood pressure for interventions involving at least 120 minutes/week with clinically meaningful effects for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Benefits clearly outweigh the harms, although some patients may dislike, or have limited ability to, exercise.

### Does mental illness history affect primary care chronic disease management in older adults? A population-based propensity score-matched study [^115A9B9t]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This population-based study identified differences in health service utilisation and chronic disease management in primary care amongst older adults based on treatment for mental illness. Consistent with previous research, we found that individuals with a history of mental illness treatment had higher rates of comorbid physical conditions, particularly heart failure and COPD. However, fewer were diagnosed with diabetes compared to those without such history. Similar to prior studies, older adults with mental illness had frequent contact with primary care for both physical and mental health needs. Contrary to earlier findings, our results show that those with comorbid physical conditions and history of mental illness had more provider continuity as measured by the proportion of visits with UCPs. We also observed higher rates of ED visits and inpatient admissions in this group. Notably, those with history of mental health treatment were more likely to receive follow-up primary care after hospital discharge, indicating a potentially important link between acute care and the FPs/NPs who support this complex population.

Our findings align with other studies showing that older adults with mental illness are less likely to receive evidence-informed recommended management interventions for chronic conditions. Specifically, older adults with comorbid physical and mental health conditions tended to receive fewer routine labs/testing and medications prescribed for their chronic disease. Our findings of less intensive treatment amongst older adults with mental illness align with prior research suggesting disparities in care. However, we caution against assuming that all deviations from standard treatment patterns are inherently negative. Some variation may reflect appropriate clinical judgement in the context of complex, multimorbid patients. Further research is needed to distinguish between care that is under-delivered versus care that is appropriately tailored in the presence of psychiatric comorbidity. At the same time, high primary care use but less intensive chronic disease management may reflect that physical health care is deprioritised in the context of psychiatric needs, and may reflect the challenges of time-constrained visits and system-level disincentives to comprehensive care. These gaps are particularly concerning in later life, when delays in managing physical comorbidities can contribute to functional decline, frailty and loss of independence which will exacerbate health system costs. Given that older adults often present with multimorbidity, frailty and age-related cognitive changes, their care demands a tailored, holistic approach that addresses both physical and mental health domains concurrently. Our findings underscore the risk of fragmented care in systems that are not structurally incentivised to support complex multimorbidity.

### Recommendations for providing quality sexually transmitted diseases clinical services, 2020 [^1146pLAU]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

An anogenital examination for females includes a pelvic examination with three elements: 1) inspection of the external genitalia, urethral meatus, vaginal introitus, and perianal region; 2) speculum examination of the vagina and cervix; and 3) bimanual examination of the uterus, cervix, and adnexa. A colposcopy might be a useful procedure to examine the cervix, vagina, and vulva more closely for signs of disease and is recommended for those patients with abnormal Papanicolaou smear tests (Pap smears) according to the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. An anogenital examination for males includes an external genital examination and inspection of the penis, scrotum, scrotal contents, and perianal region. An anoscopy can assist with the visualization of the anal canal among patients with rectal symptoms or history of receptive anal intercourse.

Sexual history and physical examination recommendations are summarized (Box 1). Additional information on sexual history and physical examination recommendations is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Health care utilization in young adults with childhood physical disabilities: a nationally representative prospective cohort study [^116YbHVH]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is one of the first to examine long-term (over seven years) health care utilization among adolescents with physical disabilities transitioning to adult care. We found that, despite having similar exposure to routine physician appointments as those without physical disabilities, young adults with physical disabilities were more likely to present to the ED or be admitted to the hospital. We also found that this group had more unmet health care needs.

Despite similar engagement with primary care providers, young adults with physical disabilities more often used health care of last resort, such as ED or inpatient admission, when compared to counterparts without disabilities. This outcome aligns with prior studies, which found that adults with disabling conditions from childhood have nine times higher hospitalization rates compared to the general population. These encounters likely represent a mix of deferred preventive care visits and emergent problems. Although the number of routine physician visits did not differ by disability status, frequency of these visitsmay not reflect adequacy of preventive care, as prior studies found reduced rates of screening among people with disabilities, sometimes well below those recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Lower preventive care among those with a physical disability may be due to personal factors (anxiety), social factors (poor communication with providers, feeling of inadequate support), provider factors (prioritizing acute problems over chronic comorbid conditions), or environmental factors (inaccessible exam tables and other physical access barriers).

### Screening for depression in primary care: what do we still need to know? [^111PeMYA]. Depression and Anxiety (2004). Low credibility.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued the recommendation that primary care physicians screen adult patients for depression. A policy to screen primary care patients for depression has appeal as a strategy to reduce the personal and societal costs of undiagnosed and untreated depression. Such appeal may be justified if the evidence supports the screening policy in three areas: effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility. The USPSTF recommendation leaves many issues in each of these areas unresolved and physicians are left the choice of two important program characteristics: screening instrument and screening interval. We discuss how uncertainties in the screening protocol and treatment process affect whether screening is an effective and cost-effective use of resources with respect to other health interventions. We suggest that targeting screening to groups at a higher risk for depression may lead to a more effective use of health care resources. A screening program may not be feasible even if effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are optimized. We discuss uncertainties in the USPSTF recommendation that affect the feasibility of implementing such a program in physicians' practices.

### Primary care of adult patients after stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111kdCM4]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Primary care after stroke — Physical activity counseling and targets: Aerobic exercise is important for all patients after stroke, regardless of specific rehabilitation needs, and exercise improves functional ability, walking endurance, balance, cardiovascular health, and secondary stroke prevention. Primary care clinicians can improve participation through assessment, counseling, referral, and linking patients to community exercise programs, and recent meta-analyses suggest that office-based practice can help patients increase levels of physical activity by 20% to 40%. The process starts by asking about activity using simple tools such as the Exercise Vital Sign that includes 2 questions on days per week and minutes per week of moderate to vigorous activity; these questions can be incorporated in office workflow (eg, the electronic medical record) with responses flagged for discussion. The minimal amount of physical activity required to achieve a meaningful health benefit after stroke has not been defined; for the average US adult, however, the AHA and US government recommend 150 minutes per week of moderate activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous activity, and if patients with a stroke can achieve these goals, it would be reasonable to support their efforts.

### Dermoscopy practice guidelines for use in telemedicine [^112h7zAj]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Formal guidelines and requirements for acquiring dermoscopy images is crucial in ensuring standardized high-quality images for routine use in primary care settings. Currently, there are no guidelines or protocols for use of dermoscopy in telemedicine. Guidelines presented herein incorporate current recommendations with the goal of informing proper and standardized dermoscopic utilization in telemedicine to ensure high-quality images. We will describe guidelines for physical environment, patient evaluation and examination, follow-up care and coordination, devices, and equipment, including mobile device use, image capture and quality, storage, and requirements for asynchronous imaging. These guidelines will not cover interpretation of dermoscopy images, and it will not discuss in detail recommendations specific to patient-acquired mobile teledermoscopy, which can be found in Koh et al. 2021.

The dermoscopy guidelines apply to individual practitioners, hospitals, practices, and any other healthcare teams who evaluate cutaneous lesions and rashes. Those who utilize these guidelines should comply with professional protocols set by his/her area of expertise on the diagnosis and treatment of skin lesions. These practical guidelines are for use within the United States (U.S.). Interactions, where either party resides outside of the United States, should consider local guidelines over the guidelines presented here, in accordance with the rules of prevailing jurisdictions.

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide practitioners a more comprehensive protocol for the use of dermatoscopes in telemedicine. The following expert-developed guidelines on the proper use of dermoscopy will help establish a standard of care to assist medical providers of diverse professions in the proper capture and storage of dermoscopic images for use in primary care, nursing, and more. These guidelines, protocols, and recommendations have been iteratively reviewed and consensus was reached by a panel of teledermatology experts of the American Telemedicine Association (ATA). Guidelines do not guarantee diagnostic accuracy, nor should they be followed in certain situations such as emergencies.

Refer to ATA Practice Guidelines for Teledermatology clinical practice guidelines, informed consent, physical environment, patient evaluation and examination, follow-up care and coordination, and documentation.

### Effectiveness of physical activity promotion based in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1126vMB6]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether trials of physical activity promotion based in primary care show sustained effects on physical activity or fitness in sedentary adults, and whether exercise referral interventions are more effective than other interventions.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, the Cochrane Library, and article reference lists.

Review Methods

Review of randomised controlled trials of physical activity promotion in sedentary adults recruited in primary care, with minimum follow-up of 12 months, reporting physical activity or fitness (or both) as outcomes, and using intention to treat analyses. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, appraised risk of bias, and extracted data. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using a random effects model.

Results

We included 15 trials (n = 8745). Most interventions took place in primary care, included health professionals in delivery, and involved advice or counselling given face to face or by phone (or both) on multiple occasions. Only three trials investigated exercise referral. In 13 trials presenting self reported physical activity, we saw small to medium positive intervention effects at 12 months (odds ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.73; standardised mean difference 0.25, 0.11 to 0.38). The number needed to treat with an intervention for one additional sedentary adult to meet internationally recommended levels of activity at 12 months was 12 (7 to 33). In four trials reporting cardiorespiratory fitness, a medium positive effect at 12 months was non-significant (standardised mean difference 0.51, -0.18 to 1.20). Three trials of exercise referral found small non-significant effects on self reported physical activity at 12 months (odds ratio 1.38; 0.98 to 1.95; standardised mean difference 0.20, -0.21 to 0.61).

Conclusions

Promotion of physical activity to sedentary adults recruited in primary care significantly increases physical activity levels at 12 months, as measured by self report. We found insufficient evidence to recommend exercise referral schemes over advice or counselling interventions. Primary care commissioners should consider these findings while awaiting further trial evaluation of exercise referral schemes and other primary care interventions, with longer follow-up and use of objective measures of outcome.

### Screening for depression and suicide risk in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111aGNhr]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — update of prior recommendations and scope of evidence: This recommendation will replace the 2014 statement on screening for suicide risk in adults and the 2016 statement on screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Previously, the USPSTF concluded there was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for suicide risk in adults and older adults (I statement) and recommended screening for MDD in the general adult population, including pregnant and postpartum persons, noting that screening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up (B recommendation). The current recommendation statement is consistent with these previous recommendations, and the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate benefits and harms of screening, accuracy of screening, and benefits and harms of treatment of MDD and suicide risk in asymptomatic adults applicable to primary care settings.

### Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to personalise follow-up care of ovarian cancer: what do patients think? A qualitative interview study [^115YR4hF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Wish for personalised care

We identified three factors interacting with the key theme defined as the wish for personalisation of care: time since primary treatment, autonomy and informed decision-making. Patients reported that their needs and wishes changed as more time passed since primary treatment. Their needs did not necessarily align with the suggested follow-up schemes. Nevertheless, quite a few patients indicated that they preferred to rely on the recommendation of the physician to decide the frequency of their appointments.

Patients voiced the use of their autonomy in certain situations, such as when deciding whether or not physical examination should take place. This mostly depended on whether physical symptoms were present or not. Patients voiced a similar opinion with regard to imaging and blood tests. Some patients mentioned that regular testing of tumour markers made them more insecure, as the result was often higher than reference values even without signs of recurrence.

… but with no physical complaints and a good result from the CT scan, I don't think physical examination is necessary. — Patient 13

On the contrary, multiple patients did not fully understand the reasons why certain choices in follow-up trajectories were made: they experienced a lack of knowledge and/or a lack of transparent communication by the clinicians. For example, some patients did not understand why routine testing of tumour markers and imaging was not done.

… And it is actually the case that the women who did get an MRI scan and blood tests, were more depressed. And because they want to keep quality of life as optimal as possible, they're not going to do that [routine testing or imaging]. So that just applies nationwide. But I do think that it's personal-it's different for everybody. I would be more depressed from the fact that I don't know anything, than if I have clarity. — Patient 6

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^112EvfhF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID‐19 clinics, has COVID‐19 disease or COVID‐19 pneumonia.

Secondary objectives

Where data are available, we will investigate diagnostic accuracy (either by stratified analysis or meta‐regression) according to:

days since symptom onset, population (children; older adults), reference standard, study design, setting, severity of COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe COVID‐19 pneumonia/ARDS requiring intensive care support).

### Fall-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations among community-dwelling older adults: examination of health problems and injury characteristics [^112YmSMK]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Third, given our findings that nearly three quarters of older adults with fall injuries sought treatment at a doctor's office/clinic, falls risk assessment and prevention strategies should be incorporated in primary care settings. While many geriatric specialists are already using these strategies, improving multifactorial falls risk assessment and management of older adults at high fall risk is needed in all primary care settings. A recent survey of primary care physicians found that nearly all of them believed that all older adults should be assessed for fall risk; however, only 52% believed that they had the expertise to conduct fall risk assessment.

Fourth, EMS providers who are called to older adults' homes to provide lift assists are in a prime position to assess further fall risk and provide education and brief interventions to prevent these older adults from falling again. The ED is also a logical place for multifactorial fall risk assessment and brief interventions for older adults with fall injuries. However, a recent study showed that most first responders offer no significant intervention or follow-up to prevent subsequent falls, even though some older adults place multiple fall-related calls to EMS over short time periods. A systemic review also found little evidence of ED-based screening to prevent the need for future fall-related calls among older adults. Implementation of scalable, adaptable, and measurable falls risk assessment and prevention models that are specified in geriatric emergency department guidelines are needed.

### Changes in physical activity among adults with diabetes: a longitudinal cohort study of inactive patients with type 2 diabetes who become physically active [^111cSSYh]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with Type 2 diabetes have frequent contact with healthcare systems. Typical patients have four or more outpatient visits per year, with the majority of these visits being to primary care providers 15, 16. Interventions within primary care settings to improve physical activity have the potential, therefore, to address a significant national health problem. A systematic review that included six randomized trials found only modest benefits from primary care‐initiated exercise referral schemes, leading the authors to conclude that significant barriers exist to wider adoption of exercise programmes 17. Further insight into the epidemiology and clinical consequences of becoming physically active among sedentary patients with Type 2 diabetes may therefore help guide new strategies to address physical activity in this high‐risk population.

Little is currently known about longitudinal exercise patterns among patients with diabetes in the primary care setting. Within our care system, self‐reported exercise data are collected by medical assistants as part of routine clinical care using a standardized intake form during each outpatient clinic visit. We used this unique large‐scale clinical data collection as an opportunity to identify a 12‐month longitudinal cohort of patients with Type 2 diabetes who reported no physical activity when asked at their first visit of the study period. Among these physically inactive patients, we examined baseline characteristics and subsequent clinical changes, comparing patients who remained inactive with those patients who adopted increased physical activity levels. We hypothesized that inactive patients who became physically active would have fewer concurrent comorbidities and would achieve measurable health benefits over the short term.

### Physical exam: where's the evidence? A medical student's experience [^116FmBUL]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

As determined by a recent study in the Annals of Family Medicine, perhaps something not emphasised enough by focusing on the physical exam as an evidence-based diagnostic tool is the integral role it plays in establishing and building patient–provider relationships. Numerous studies show that patients are more satisfied with their care when a provider performs a physical examination for practical reasons of assisting with diagnosis as well as for the symbolic reason of feeling cared for. In this way, the physical exam can be viewed not only as a diagnostic tool but also as an important form of non-verbal communication, a known driver of patient satisfaction. The evolving discussion of the appropriateness of touch within (and especially beyond) the exam room provides an additional layer of complexity that merits an intense degree of training for practitioners who must navigate the nuances of physical boundaries in the context of medical practice. Focusing on the unique ways of physically interacting with patients is likely to be just as important as focusing on the specific aspects of the physical interaction itself. There is compelling evidence to support improving patient experience as a means of improving patient outcomes, if only by increasing the likelihood of routine medical follow-up and reaping the benefits of the Hawthorne effect. While the evidence relating specific exam manoeuvres to specific diagnoses will always be hampered for reasons related to restricted generalisability (eg, an exam manoeuvre that is only valid in non-pregnant adults), difficulties with patient–provider communication (eg, the definition of 10/10 pain) and more, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence to support the use of the physical exam as a communication and relationship-building tool between patient and provider. This is an aspect of the physical exam that, as of yet, there is no technology to replace.

### Association of oncologist-patient communication with functional status and physical performance in older adults: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^1148Ws11]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Despite the importance of functional and physical impairments in cancer care, routine oncology evaluation often fails to adequately assess functional status and physical performance concerns. Commonly used physician-reported scales, such as the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, were developed and validated in younger cohorts and do not fully account for physical performance. Studies show that older adults with good performance status may be limited in ADLs, IADLs, or objective physical performance tests. Older adults with cancer have complex medical presentations, treatment considerations, and goals of care, leaving standardized functional status and physical performance assessments at risk for being deprioritized in busy clinic settings with limited resources. Finally, even when oncologists recognize the importance of assessing and managing functional and physical impairments, most do not feel confident in doing so.

A geriatric assessment (GA) can identify and guide the management of aging-related impairments among older adults with cancer, and includes valid and reliable measures of functional status and physical performance that are more sensitive to impairments in these domains than a routine assessment. A GA assists in clinical decision-making, and is recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology for patients aged 65 years or older with cancer.

Although the primary analysis of the present secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial showed that oncologists' knowledge of a GA summary led to improvements in overall oncologist-patient communication, data are lacking that assess how oncologists discuss impairments specific to functional status and physical performance with older patients with advanced cancer and how the use of a GA may affect this discussion. We hypothesized that a GA intervention would be associated with an increased frequency of conversations and recommendations to address concerns. This improved communication could be associated with an increase in the quality of management for age-related functional status and physical performance concerns. We used data from a nationwide randomized clinical trial conducted in community oncology practices to conduct a secondary analysis evaluating whether a GA intervention is associated with improved communication regarding functional status and physical performance impairments among older adults with advanced cancer.

### Foot examination for older adults [^114BQvnx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The foot changes with age. Foot disorders in older adults are associated with falls, lower limb ulcers, and pain. Physical examination of the feet as part of the routine assessment of older adults is imperative to detect foot problems. Foot pain and pathologies are common in older adults. Regular foot care is important to prevent these issues. However, some older adults may find it difficult to complete foot care, including cutting toenails. Regular foot examination can detect common foot problems, functional decline, and is recommended for preventing falls. We describe a technique for performing a focused examination of the feet for older adults. This review addresses current podiatric issues in older patient populations and describes a method for foot examination to address the needs of older adults that can be incorporated into patient assessments in any clinical setting.

### Behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity for cardiovascular disease prevention in adults without cardiovascular disease risk factors: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117V8Tre]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease recommend healthy diet consumption along with 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. The American College of Sports Medicine and the AHA recommend that clinicians provide behavioral counseling on physical activity for adults with chronic conditions or risk factors. In 2016, they co-launched the Exercise is Medicine initiative, calling for clinicians to assess and promote physical activity for all patients. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2017 USPSTF recommendation on this topic. The AHA recommends physical activity assessment and promotion in health care settings for all adult patients to prevent CVD.

### Assessment of physician priorities in delivery of preventive care [^112dK2L8]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Although professional guidelines encourage preventive care, 32 major evidence-based services are available for nonpregnant adults, and delivery of all services is difficult. Just 8% of US adults attain all guideline-recommended services. Although patient nonadherence is an important factor, in many practice settings, physicians also have limited time to discuss preventive care. To fully evaluate and implement all preventive care guidelines, physicians would need to devote an estimated 7 hours per day to primary prevention. However, clinicians spend just 27% of their day in direct clinical care. These factors potentially force physicians to prioritize guideline recommendations.

Which preventive services are most often discussed and whether priorities differ by physician remains unknown. Physicians may prioritize care in different ways, such as improving length of life, quality of life, or cost-effectiveness. However, clinical decision supports focused on these priorities are limited. Instead, physicians must rely on personal impressions of the benefits and harms of each preventive service, taking into account differences across patients in risk factors. Mathematical models have been used to rank preventive services based on the potential to add life-years, improve quality of life, or lower costs, but how these rankings compare with clinical practice is unknown. Finally, prioritization could be more important in short encounters compared with longer annual wellness visits. Our goal was to understand whether primary care physicians prioritize the preventive services they discuss with patients and the factors influencing their priorities, especially visit length, patient risk factors, and potential to improve life expectancy.

### How to provide a structured clinical assessment of a patient with overweight or obesity [^1123k3E1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

With the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide, there is a reciprocal increase in the global economic burden and ill-health from obesity-related chronic diseases. Primary healthcare services have a role to play in ensuring early detection of weight issues and in directing patients towards evidence-based care to slow this progression. Research shows that many people with obesity are motivated to lose weight and want their clinician to initiate a conversation about weight management and treatment options. However, this conversation rarely occurs and there is a significant delay in treatment, resulting in an increased burden on the individual, healthcare system and society. In this paper, the components and rationale for the clinical assessment of adult patients with overweight or obesity, including anthropometric measurements and pathology tests, are described. Recommendations to ascertain the potential factors influencing the development of obesity in the patient, such as lifestyle factors (diet and physical activity) and mental health, are also provided. The potential sequelae of obesity that may be present and the necessary assessments for diagnosis are also addressed. These assessments are vital to ensure the patient is referred to the appropriate allied health services and/or specialists.

### Effect of individualized preventive care recommendations vs usual care on patient interest and use of recommendations: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^1174qjYK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Preventable risk factors contributed to an estimated 61% of US deaths in 2019, and health risks increase with age. Prior work suggests that optimal preventive care use could add over 2 million healthy life-years nationwide. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends 25 preventive services for middle-aged adults aged 50 to 64 years, but in 2015 only 8% of adults 35 years or older received all high-priority services. A recent study found that adherence to hypertension control, a highly effective intervention, declined over the past decade.

National prevention guidelines present several challenges. First, they scarcely account for individuals' unique characteristics, such as comorbid conditions, which affect 70% of middle-aged adults. This standardized approach hinders physicians' ability to identify which preventive services provide maximum benefit for a specific patient. Second, few guidelines consider patient preferences, including views about side effects, convenience, lifestyle, and cost. This generic approach may contribute to low attainment of prevention targets. Third, clinical time is limited, forcing physicians to prioritize among recommended guidelines without having tools to do so. For example, a physician may know that both mammograms and colonoscopies are "life-saving", but not understand their relative benefits.

In this pilot study, we evaluated the potential of an individualized decision tool to help patients and physicians better understand the net benefits of all major, USPSTF-recommended preventive services and improve preventive care delivery.

### USPSTF perspective on evidence-based preventive recommendations for children [^115QDara]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The development and use of evidence-based recommendations for preventive care by primary care providers caring for children is an ongoing challenge. This issue is further complicated by the fact that a higher proportion of recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for pediatric preventive services in comparison with adult services have insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the service. One important root cause for this problem is the relative lack of high quality screening and counseling studies in pediatric primary care settings. The paucity of studies limits the development of additional evidence-based guidelines to enhance best practices for pediatric and adolescent conditions. In this article, we describe the following: (1) evidence-based primary care preventive services as a strategy for addressing important pediatric morbidities, (2) the process of making evidence-based screening recommendations by the USPSTF, (3) the current library of USPSTF recommendations for children and adolescents, and (4) factors influencing the use of USPSTF recommendations and other evidence-based guidelines by clinicians. Strategies to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based services and areas of need for future research to fill key gaps in evidence-based recommendations and guidelines are highlighted.

### Behavioral weight loss interventions to prevent obesity-related morbidity and mortality in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116cKc6V]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Scope of review and intervention types — the USPSTF focused on interventions that can be delivered in or referred from primary care. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to update its 2012 recommendation on screening for obesity in adults, and because screening is now part of routine clinical practice, it was not a focus of this review. The USPSTF reviewed evidence on interventions (behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy) for weight loss or weight loss maintenance that can be provided in or referred from a primary care setting, and notes that waist circumference may be an acceptable alternative to BMI measurement in some patient subpopulations. Surgical weight loss interventions and nonsurgical weight loss devices (eg, gastric balloons) are considered to be outside the scope of the primary care setting. The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on 4 types of interventions: behavior-based weight loss (80 trials), behavior-based weight loss maintenance (9 trials), pharmacotherapy-based weight loss (32 trials), and pharmacotherapy-based weight loss maintenance (3 trials).

### Patient information: routine checkups for adults… [^116rDZRj]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A routine checkup refers to a visit to a primary care physician for the purpose of maintaining wellness. Routine checkups are centered around preventing illness rather than treating an active symptom or already diagnosed illness. This type of visit is also referred to as a wellness visit, preventive visit, health evaluation, or general medical examination. Although often referred to as "physicals" or "annuals, " these visits do not need to include a physical examination and do not need to happen yearly. However, because these visits are typically covered by insurance companies once a year for adults, many people see their doctors for checkups on a yearly basis. What to Expect During a Routine Checkup.

Checkups generally include Checking blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and height Discussing cancer screening tests that are appropriate for age and medical history Discussing other screening tests. Drawing blood for measurements that are appropriate for age and medical history Administering immunizations Screening for depression Additional assessments for older individuals, such as fall risk, hearing loss, memory loss, and discussion of advance directives. Routine Checkups Via Virtual Telehealth Physical examinations may be part of a checkup but are not required for otherwise healthy individuals who do not have specific symptoms.

During a telehealth checkup, a doctor can order blood work, screening tests, and immunizations, which patients can schedule and complete at a later date. Is a Yearly Checkup Necessary. If you value a more personal relationship with your primary care physician, a yearly visit may be helpful. For people aged 65 years or older, who have chronic illnesses, or who are taking long-term medications, routine visits are important. People who are young and have no symptoms should talk to their doctor about the best schedule to maintain for checkups. Jin J. Routine Checkups for Adults. JAMA. 2022; 327:

### The complete physical… [^116dyeBp]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Case Scenario Recently, a new patient in his early 40s arrived in my office asking for a "complete" physical examination. He showed me a booklet with a list of laboratory tests and services that his insurance company covered, and he requested them. It is quite common for patients to ask me for "complete physicals. " I suppose if I were to ask why they wanted one, they'd be surprised by the question and say: "So I'll know that I'm healthy, of course. " In these instances, I usually do a reasonably complete examination, emphasizing screening modalities appropriate for the patient's age, and ordering laboratory tests if the patient has a particular problem. For example, if the patient says he has been anemic in the past, I'll order a complete blood count.

From a healthy patient's perspective, the complete physical, or periodic health examination, should answer one or more of the following questions: "Am I in the early stages of a disease that, if detected, can be cured or forestalled. " "Are there lifestyle changes I can make that will increase my health and well-being. " "Can I get information about my specific health concerns. " Thus, the physician must be prepared to play the roles of screener, coach, and counselor. 4 revealed a strong belief that certain basic history and physical examination items should be covered. More than 90 percent of a mostly well-educated, affluent patient cohort believed that they should discuss diet, exercise, and tobacco and alcohol consumption with their physician on an annual basis. A similar percentage thought that blood pressure and major organ systems should be examined.

A majority favored the use of certain laboratory tests, such as Papanicolaou smear, mammography, serum cholesterol, and prostate-specific antigen. A significant minority also thought they should have an annual chest x-ray. These results support the notion that the periodic health examination should include elements of physical examination, lifestyle counseling, and preventive care. 5 While not cost-effective in the strictest sense, in healthy adults, evidence supports the efficacy of screening blood pressure, annual clinical breast examinations in women older than 40 years, and periodic pelvic examinations with Papanicolaou tests in sexually active women. Beyond these three is a larger group of possibly useful services for which the optimal frequency is not known. 6.

### The disappearance of the primary care physical examination-losing touch… [^113sjB9R]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

In the 15 years that I have been a physician, the physical examination has always occupied a precarious space for me. As a resident, the reams of information I had on patients before I stepped into their room made it tempting to do the "quick physical exam" that Robert Hirschtick bemoaned in a recently republished essay. 1 More recently, my accountable care organization's emphasis on increasing our volume of Medicare annual wellness visits, which do not require a physical examination, and recommendations from some groups against routine physical examinations in asymptomatic patients2 has me second guessing why I examine healthy elderly patients. Many physicians would say that some diagnoses cannot be made without examining a patient in person. I am not sure how I am supposed to distinguish central vs peripheral vertigo, diagnose otitis media, or determine if someone has orthostatic hypotension without examining a person in front of me.

In addition, many of us have cases where an unanticipated finding on examination feels as though it saved a patient's life. A discovery of an irregular mole, a soft tissue mass, or a new murmur — I do not forget these cases, and I do not think the patients do either. What was less apparent to me before the pandemic was how a thorough physical examination provides a measure of objectivity that can help me rethink a patient's narrative. I work in Maine, which has its share of stoics. A patient recently came in feeling a bit tired but felt it was nothing, likely as a result of working too hard. His examination suggested he was in heart failure. If I had not been able to listen to his heart and lungs, and examine his jugular vein and lower extremities, I may have put too much weight on the patient's lack of concern and missed the diagnosis. When patients and I disagree on a plan, the physical examination not only provides data, it also acts as an arbiter.

For instance, patients sometimes feel a need to use antibiotics to treat a respiratory infection. If I communicate that results of their lung examination are clear and that their oxygen saturation levels are normal, they often feel more reassured that they do not need medication. Not all is lost with the emergence of telehealth. At least in these early phases, virtual visits seem to allow me to connect more frequently and easily with patients. With telehealth, I can see patients in their home environments, which often provides me with new information on factors that influence their health behaviors. Virtual visits respect a patient's time.
