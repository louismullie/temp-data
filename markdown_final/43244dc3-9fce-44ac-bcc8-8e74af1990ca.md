## Question

Anticoagulation in arterial thrombosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation in arterial thrombosis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology distinguishing arterial from venous thrombosis. Then, I should verify the standard treatment paradigm and where it breaks down. Next, I will examine special contexts where anticoagulation is indicated in arterial disease, including cardioembolic sources, antiphospholipid syndrome, and COVID-19. After that, I need to review dual-pathway inhibition and combination strategies. Finally, I should consider bleeding risk, periprocedural management, and synthesize a practical decision framework with explicit caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the foundational pathophysiology. Arterial thrombosis typically arises under high shear at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture or endothelial injury, producing platelet-rich "white clots", whereas venous thrombosis forms under low shear and is fibrin-rich with trapped red cells; this mechanistic distinction underpins why antiplatelet therapy is first-line for arterial events and anticoagulation for venous events, though I should be careful not to overstate a binary model because biology is more nuanced than "platelets-only" versus "fibrin-only" [^115mL15Y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the standard treatment paradigm. For most atherothrombotic arterial events such as acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease, single or dual antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone, with anticoagulation reserved for specific indications like atrial fibrillation or mechanical valves; this aligns with long-standing guideline frameworks and contemporary consensus statements on aortic and peripheral arterial disease management [^115mL15Y] [^115Dz2Nw].

> Wait, let me consider where this paradigm shifts. Anticoagulation becomes appropriate in arterial disease when the thrombotic driver is plasmatic rather than purely platelet-driven, such as cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation, where DOACs or warfarin are indicated for secondary prevention; I should confirm that this is consistent with modern practice patterns and guideline-concordant care [^1136sryG].

> I need to check the antiphospholipid syndrome scenario because it is a notable exception. In thrombotic APS, especially with arterial events, warfarin remains preferred over DOACs due to inferior outcomes with rivaroxaban in high-risk phenotypes; I initially thought DOACs might suffice broadly, but the TRAPS data and regulatory guidance caution against DOACs in triple-positive APS, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize VKA with INR 2–3 as standard, with consideration of higher targets in select refractory cases while balancing bleeding risk [^1117udCQ] [^115PA1Lz] [^1168aS2L].

> Next, I should review COVID-19, where the hypercoagulable state blurs traditional distinctions. The CHEST expert panel advises that patients with pre-existing arterial indications should generally continue their antiplatelet or anticoagulant regimens, and for those with recent ACS on DAPT, continuation of DAPT is favored when receiving prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, with individualized decisions if therapeutic-dose anticoagulation is used; for acute limb ischemia, early revascularization is prioritized over anticoagulation alone, and for stroke/TIA, intensification beyond standard antiplatelet therapy is not supported by current evidence, so I should avoid over-treatment here [^116xWQF3] [^116BcMhu] [^114yVk8q] [^111qrSsb].

> Let me think about dual-pathway inhibition, because this is where anticoagulation meaningfully enters arterial secondary prevention. In stable PAD after lower-extremity revascularization, adding low-dose rivaroxaban to aspirin reduces major adverse limb and cardiovascular events compared with aspirin alone, reflecting inhibition of both platelet activation and thrombin generation; similarly, in chronic coronary disease, low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin outperforms aspirin alone, supporting a biologically plausible and clinically validated dual-pathway approach in selected patients [^111rwN7g] [^114jPpjs].

> I should double-check the bleeding trade-offs when combining therapies. Evidence and guidelines caution that adding anticoagulation to antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding, so the ischemic benefit must clearly outweigh hemorrhagic risk; in COVID-19 cohorts, intermediate-dose anticoagulation with background antiplatelet therapy has been associated with higher major bleeding, reinforcing the need for careful patient selection and dose minimization when dual-pathway strategies are used [^113yFNko] [^115QZzk4].

> But wait, what if the presentation is acute limb ischemia or an arterial embolus. Immediate systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is suggested to limit thrombus propagation while arranging reperfusion, and reperfusion therapy is preferred over anticoagulation alone; I should confirm that this remains a conditional recommendation given limited direct comparative trials, yet it reflects standard practice patterns [^115XFtCn] [^111fgpEh].

> Next, I should review periprocedural management because arterial patients frequently need interventions. Structured periprocedural frameworks emphasize individualized risk stratification for thrombosis and bleeding, coordination with procedural teams, and clear plans for interruption and resumption of antithrombotic therapy; I need to ensure that any anticoagulation adjustments are explicitly timed and communicated to mitigate both procedural bleeding and post-procedural thrombosis [^112kdLNm].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will now examine it step-by-step. First, define the arterial event phenotype and mechanism: atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, APS-related, COVID-associated, or limb ischemia; second, assess bleeding risk and patient-specific modifiers; third, apply the default antiplatelet strategy for atherothrombosis; fourth, layer anticoagulation when a cardioembolic source, APS, or a compelling dual-pathway indication exists; fifth, in COVID-19, continue pre-existing antithrombotics and tailor intensity to ischemic versus bleeding risk; sixth, in acute limb ischemia, prioritize timely revascularization with adjunctive heparin; and seventh, reassess periodically as the ischemic–bleeding balance evolves over time [^115Dz2Nw] [^116n17mG] [^116xWQF3].

> Hold on, I should verify key caveats so we do not overgeneralize. DOACs are not appropriate for thrombotic APS with arterial events, high-intensity VKA targets have not consistently improved outcomes and increase bleeding, and COVID-19-specific data are limited with most guidance extrapolated from non-COVID populations; therefore, shared decision-making and close monitoring are essential when deviating from standard antiplatelet monotherapy [^1117udCQ] [^1168aS2L] [^111XBYXa].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: anticoagulation is not routinely first-line for arterial thrombosis, but it is indicated for cardioembolic prevention, for thrombotic APS, and as part of dual-pathway strategies in selected coronary or peripheral artery disease patients, all while balancing bleeding risk and contextual factors such as COVID-19 and periprocedural needs; this measured, mechanism-aligned approach avoids both therapeutic nihilism and unnecessary harm from overtreatment [^1136sryG] [^114jPpjs] [^116n17mG].

Anticoagulation is **not routinely indicated** for arterial thrombosis; antiplatelet therapy is the **standard of care** [^115Dz2Nw] because arterial clots are platelet-rich [^115mL15Y]. Anticoagulation is reserved for specific scenarios: cardioembolic stroke (e.g. atrial fibrillation) [^1136sryG], mechanical heart valves, or antiphospholipid syndrome [^1136sryG]. In acute limb ischemia, short-term anticoagulation is used to prevent thrombus propagation while arranging revascularization [^112gMgee]. For COVID-19, continue pre-existing antithrombotics [^116xWQF3]; add anticoagulation only if there is a separate indication, balancing bleeding risk [^1158W7s8]. Dual-pathway inhibition (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin) is beneficial in PAD after revascularization [^111rwN7g] but increases bleeding and should be individualized [^114jPpjs].

## Pathophysiology of arterial thrombosis

Arterial thrombosis **occurs under high shear stress** [^111ShxqZ], typically at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture or endothelial injury, and is primarily platelet-driven with fibrin as a secondary component [^112tJxkf]. This contrasts with venous thrombosis, which is fibrin-rich and forms under low shear conditions [^115mL15Y]. Given this composition, antiplatelet agents are the cornerstone of therapy for arterial thrombosis [^115mL15Y].

## Indications for anticoagulation in arterial thrombosis

While anticoagulation is not routinely indicated for arterial thrombosis, **specific clinical scenarios warrant its use**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for anticoagulation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Atrial fibrillation (AF) | Stroke prevention in cardioembolic stroke | Anticoagulation reduces stroke risk in AF [^1136sryG] |
| Mechanical heart valves | Prevention of thromboembolism | Anticoagulation is required to prevent valve thrombosis |
| Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) | Arterial thrombosis (especially stroke) | Anticoagulation is recommended, particularly in triple-positive APS [^1117udCQ] |
| Acute limb ischemia | Short-term anticoagulation to prevent thrombus propagation | Anticoagulation is used while arranging revascularization [^111fgpEh] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting anticoagulation in arterial thrombosis

### Atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke

Anticoagulation is strongly recommended for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, including those with prior ischemic stroke [^1136sryG]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and warfarin are effective in **reducing stroke recurrence** in this population.

---

### Antiphospholipid syndrome

Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly those who are triple-positive (positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies), have a high risk of recurrent arterial thrombosis. Anticoagulation, typically with warfarin, is recommended to **reduce recurrence risk** [^113769uo].

---

### Acute limb ischemia

In acute limb ischemia, short-term anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is recommended to prevent thrombus propagation while definitive revascularization is arranged [^111fgpEh]. Evidence supporting long-term anticoagulation in this setting is limited.

---

## Risks and benefits of anticoagulation in arterial thrombosis

Anticoagulation in arterial thrombosis carries a **significant risk of bleeding**, including major hemorrhagic events [^113yFNko]. The decision to anticoagulate must carefully balance the potential benefits of thrombosis prevention against the risks of bleeding. In many cases, antiplatelet therapy provides sufficient thrombosis prevention with a lower bleeding risk than anticoagulation [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize antiplatelet therapy as the **standard of care** for arterial thrombosis, with anticoagulation reserved for specific indications such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, and antiphospholipid syndrome [^115mL15Y] [^1177JMMR]. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) provide detailed guidance on when anticoagulation is appropriate in arterial thrombosis [^115XFtCn] [^115SuTXE].

---

## Special considerations: COVID-19-associated arterial thrombosis

COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of **arterial thrombosis** due to systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction [^112ZPw5m]. Current guidelines recommend continuing pre-existing antithrombotic therapy and adding **anticoagulation** only if there is a separate indication, such as atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism [^1158W7s8] [^11636sAU]. The decision to anticoagulate should be individualized, balancing **thrombotic and bleeding risks** [^1158W7s8].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies targeting specific coagulation pathways, such as factor XI and factor XII inhibitors, are under investigation and may offer safer alternatives to traditional anticoagulants [^115PHucv]. Additionally, dual-pathway inhibition (combining antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy) is being explored in specific populations, such as patients with peripheral artery disease undergoing revascularization [^111rwN7g].

---

Anticoagulation is **not routinely indicated** for arterial thrombosis; antiplatelet therapy remains the **standard of care** [^115Dz2Nw]. Anticoagulation is reserved for specific indications such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, antiphospholipid syndrome, and acute limb ischemia. The decision to anticoagulate must balance thrombotic benefits against bleeding risks, and emerging therapies may expand future options.

Background

Evidence increasingly shows that the risk of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is associated with a hypercoagulable state. Several organizations have released guidelines for the management of COVID-19-related coagulopathy and prevention of VTE. However, an urgent need exists for practical guidance on the management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in this setting.

Research Question

What is the current available evidence informing the prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19?

Study Design and Methods

A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) format that address urgent clinical questions regarding prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19. Using MEDLINE via PubMed, a literature search was conducted and references were screened for inclusion. Data from included studies were summarized and reviewed by the panel. Consensus for the direction and strength of recommendations was achieved using a modified Delphi survey.

Results

The review and analysis of the literature based on 11 PICO questions resulted in 11 recommendations. Overall, a low quality of evidence specific to the population with COVID-19 was found. Consequently, many of the recommendations were based on indirect evidence and prior guidelines in similar populations without COVID-19.

Interpretation

The existing evidence and panel consensus do not suggest a major departure from the management of arterial thrombosis according to recommendations predating the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on the optimal strategies for prevention and management of arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 are sparse. More high-quality evidence is needed to inform management strategies in these patients.

### How I treat the co-occurrence of venous and arterial thromboembolism: anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, or both? [^116n17mG]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Arterial and venous thromboses are classically considered distinct disease states, with arterial thrombosis mediated predominantly by platelets and therefore, treated with antiplatelet therapy, and venous thrombosis mediated by the plasmatic coagulation system and treated with anticoagulation. However, co-occurrence of arterial and venous events is common, and there is increasing evidence of shared risk factors and pathophysiologic overlap. This presents a management challenge: does the patient with venous and arterial thrombosis, require anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, or both? Herein, we present a structured approach to the evaluation and management of patients with venous thrombosis who are also at risk for or have a history of an arterial thromboembolic event. We emphasize the importance of defining the indications for antithrombotic therapy, as well as the evaluation of factors that influence both thrombotic and bleeding risk, including disorder-specific and patient-specific factors, as well as the inherent risk balance of antithrombotic therapy regimens. We illustrate this approach in 4 cases, discussing the unique considerations and recent updates in the management of venous thrombosis, acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease after revascularization.

### How I treat unexplained arterial thrombosis [^112CRnWV]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Most arterial thrombotic events have a clear atherosclerotic or cardioembolic etiology, but hematologists are frequently asked to assist in the diagnosis and management of a patient with a nonatherosclerotic and noncardioembolic arterial event, referred to here as an unexplained arterial thrombosis. Because there is an assorted list of factors that can precipitate an arterial event, we present a systematic diagnostic approach to ensure consideration of not only primary hypercoagulable disorders, but also pro-thrombotic medications or substances, vascular and anatomic abnormalities, and undiagnosed systemic disorders, such as malignancy and autoimmune diseases. We also review existing literature of the role of hypercoagulable disorders in arterial thrombosis and discuss our approach to thrombophilia workup in patients after an unexplained arterial event. We conclude with 3 representative cases to both illustrate the application of the outlined diagnostic schema and discuss common management considerations, specifically the selection of anticoagulation vs antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention.

### Antithrombotic agents [^114jPpjs]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in our understanding of the contribution of thrombin generation to arterial thrombosis and the role of platelets in venous thrombosis have prompted new treatment paradigms. Nonetheless, bleeding remains the major side effect of such treatments spurring the quest for new antithrombotic regimens with better benefit-risk profiles and for safer anticoagulants for existing and new indications. The aims of this article are to review the results of recent trials aimed at enhancing the benefit-risk profile of antithrombotic therapy and explain how these findings are changing our approach to the management of arterial and venous thrombosis. Focusing on these 2 aspects of thrombosis management, this article discusses 4 advances: (1) the observation that in some indications, lowering the dose of some direct oral anticoagulants reduces the risk of bleeding without compromising efficacy, (2) the recognition that aspirin is not only effective for secondary prevention of atherothrombosis but also for prevention of venous thromboembolism, (3) the finding that dual pathway inhibition with the combination of low-dose rivaroxaban to attenuate thrombin generation plus aspirin to reduce thromboxane A2-mediated platelet activation is superior to aspirin or rivaroxaban alone for prevention of atherothrombosis in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease, and (4) the development of inhibitors of factor XI or XII as potentially safer anticoagulants.

### Evolving treatments for arterial and venous thrombosis: role of the direct oral anticoagulants [^114iyVZs]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent a major advance in oral anticoagulant therapy and have replaced the vitamin K antagonists as the preferred treatment for many indications. By simplifying long-term anticoagulant therapy and improving its safety, the DOACs have the potential to reduce the global burden of thrombosis. Postmarketing studies suggest that the favorable results achieved with DOACs in the randomized controlled trials can be readily translated into practice, but highlight the need for appropriate patient, drug and dose selection, and careful follow-up. Leveraging on their success to date, ongoing studies are assessing the utility of DOACs for the prevention of thrombosis in patients with embolic stroke of unknown source, heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, and cancer. The purpose of this article is to (1) review the pharmacology of the DOACs, (2) describe the advantages of the DOACs over vitamin K antagonists, (3) summarize the experience with the DOACs in established indications, (4) highlight current challenges and limitations, (5) highlight potential new indications; and (6) identify future directions for anticoagulant therapy.

### Arterial thrombosis – insidious, unpredictable and deadly [^112tJxkf]. Nature Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The formation of blood clots — thrombosis — at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture is a major clinical problem despite ongoing improvements in antithrombotic therapy. Progress in identifying the pathogenic mechanisms regulating arterial thrombosis has led to the development of newer therapeutics, and there is general anticipation that these treatments will have greater efficacy and improved safety. However, major advances in this field require the identification of specific risk factors for arterial thrombosis in affected individuals and a rethink of the 'one size fits all' approach to antithrombotic therapy.

### Unexplained arterial thrombosis: approach to diagnosis and treatment [^113h6VEQ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Arterial thrombotic events in younger patients without a readily apparent etiology present significant diagnostic and management challenges. We present a structured approach to diagnosis with consideration of common causes, including atherosclerosis and embolism, as well as uncommon causes, including medications and substances, vascular and anatomic abnormalities, systemic disorders, and thrombophilias. We highlight areas of management that have evolved within the past 5 years, including the use of dual-pathway inhibition in atherosclerotic disease, antithrombotic therapy selection in embolic stroke of undetermined source and left ventricular thrombus, the role of closure of patent foramen ovale for secondary stroke prevention, and the thrombotic potential of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and vaccination. We conclude with a representative case to illustrate the application of the diagnostic framework and discuss the importance of consideration of bleeding risk and patient preference in determining the appropriate management plan.

### Antithrombotic therapy in arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in COVID-19: an American College of Chest Physicians expert panel report [^116BcMhu]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) — anticoagulation co-management is addressed as follows: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 on DAPT for recent ACS who are receiving prophylactic-dose anticoagulant therapy for COVID-19, we suggest continuing DAPT (Conditional Recommendation, Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 on DAPT for recent ACS who are on therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulant therapy, we suggest individualized decisions that consider the risk of bleeding regarding continuation of DAPT alongside anticoagulation (Conditional Recommendation, Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). As justification, the risk of stent thrombosis is highest in the first 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with an incidence of < 2% in this period, decreasing to 0.7% per year, and high-quality evidence is lacking to guide antithrombotic regimens, although no evidence supports that DAPT should be withheld in patients with ACS who receive such regimens.

### New antithrombotic drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115mL15Y]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

New antithrombotic drugs — scope and clinical context are outlined: the article "focuses on new antithrombotic drugs that are in or are entering phase 3 clinical testing", notes development was driven by limitations of existing agents and covers drugs "focusing primarily on those in phase 2 or 3 clinical testing", with advances mainly in antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants while "the development of new fibrinolytic agents has lagged". Arterial and venous thrombosis are highlighted as major causes of morbidity and mortality; arterial thrombosis causes myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and limb gangrene, and venous thrombosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) that "can be fatal or can lead to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension". Arterial thrombi form under high shear as "platelet aggregates held together by small amounts of fibrin", guiding strategies that "focus mainly on drugs that block platelet function" while also using anticoagulants to prevent cardioembolic events in atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves. Venous thrombi form under low shear and are "composed mainly of fibrin and trapped RBCs and contain relatively few platelets", consistent with anticoagulants being "the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of VTE". Fibrinolytic therapy roles are specified: fibrinolytics are used for rapid restoration of flow in acute MI without primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and for acute ischemic stroke, and "systemic or catheter-directed fibrinolytic therapy is used for treatment of massive PE and for management of selected patients with submassive PE", with catheter-directed therapy used in some patients with extensive iliofemoral DVT.

Anticoagulation dosing terminology — definitions used in this report: Prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is defined as "refers to standard dosing regimen(s) of the respective anticoagulant agent used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism". Therapeutic-dose anticoagulation is defined as "refers to full dosing regimen(s) of the respective anticoagulant agent used for the management of an acute thrombosis or prevention of arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism". Intermediate-dose anticoagulation is defined as "refers to the escalated prophylactic dosing regimen(s), with drug doses higher than standard prophylactic doses, but lower than therapeutic doses, of the respective anticoagulant agent".

Regarding medical management for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of arterial thrombosis, BSH 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating anticoagulation with warfarin in patients < 50 years of age with ischemic stroke and APS, despite the lack of evidence that it is better than antiplatelet therapy.

### Dilemmas in hematology: consults in patients with arterial thrombosis [^113JDbH9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Arterial thrombotic events, particularly ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction, are common, and mostly occur due to atherosclerotic disease or arrhythmias. The diagnosis and management of the majority of such events occurs without the involvement of a hematologist, following established guidelines or pathways. In this review, we discuss 3 scenarios in which optimal management is less certain. These scenarios concern patients with a left ventricular thrombus, in whom the duration and choice of anticoagulant has been debated, patients with ischemic stroke and a patent foramen ovale, in whom the role of patent foramen ovale closure requires careful consideration, and the role of thrombophilia testing in young patients after a stroke or myocardial infarction, which remains an area of contention. We consider the available evidence and published guidelines in order to provide a practical, evidence-based approach to these 3 clinical scenarios.

### Rationales and uncertainties for aspirin use in COVID-19: a narrative review [^112AQpFm]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention of arterial thrombosis during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines and European Society for Cardiology (ESC) Guidance for the Diagnosis and Management of CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic do not include any recommendations regarding aspirin for the primary prevention of arterial atherothrombosis during this pandemic. This role is controversial in literature before the COVID-19 era(table 1).

Table 1
Primary prevention of arterial atherothrombosis events in guidelines

The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada in collaboration with the Canadian Stroke Consortium does not recommend the use of aspirin for primary prevention in individuals without a history of symptomatic CVD as the harms of daily aspirin use could potentially outweigh the benefits.

Secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel and the ESC recommend that patients who are receiving antiplatelet therapies (eg, aspirin) or anticoagulant for underlying conditions should continue these medications if they receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 unless there are contraindications such as the excessive risk of bleeding or planned invasive surgical procedures. These underlying conditions are acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, previous MI or revascularisation, postpercutaneous coronary interventions, transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke. A recent retrospective cohort study revealed that prehospital aspirin use in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with established coronary artery disease was not associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Prevention of venous thromboembolic events during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel does not recommend anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy for VTE prophylaxis or at therapeutic doses in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 unless there are other indications. These indications may be for arterial thrombosis prevention as mentioned above or for the prevention of VTE following total hip or knee replacementafter a risk assessment of postoperative VTE.

### Thrombotic disorders: diagnosis and treatment [^114oXiLe]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2003). Low credibility.

Hematologists are increasingly involved in the diagnosis and management of patients with venous and arterial thromboembolic disorders. There have been major advances in recent years in our understanding of the central role of hypercoagulability in the pathogenesis of thrombosis. This has led to new approaches to the diagnosis of patients at risk for thrombosis and the development of more rational antithrombotic strategies. In Section I, Dr. Andrew Schafer reviews current concepts of acquired and inherited hypercoagulable states. It is now recognized that most, if not all, patients with venous thromboembolism have a genetic basis for the disorder ("thrombophilia"). The level of lifelong, baseline hypercoagulability in any individual may be determined by the type(s) and number of thrombophilia(s) that are inherited. Clinical episodes of thrombosis are precipitated by acquired thrombogenic triggers, which may be overt (e.g., pregnancy) or subclinical. In Section II, Dr. Mark Levine discusses the complex problem of thrombosis in patients with cancer. The goals of treating acute venous thromboembolism in cancer patients are to prevent recurrence, minimize the risk of anticoagulant-induced bleeding, and improve quality of life. New developments have improved treatment of venous thromboembolism in these patients, including outpatient therapy and secondary prevention with low-molecular-weight heparin. In Section III, Dr. Barbara Konkle reviews the diagnosis and management of thrombotic complications associated with pregnancy and hormonal therapy. Patient management is discussed based on data on thrombotic risks associated with hormonal treatment of infertility, pregnancy and the post-partum period in women with and without underlying thrombophilic risk factors. In Section IV, Dr. Clive Kearon discusses the management of anticoagulation before and after elective surgery. In the past, there has been no consensus on the perioperative management of anticoagulation for patients who require long-term warfarin therapy. This review considers the expected risks and benefits of different approaches to anticoagulation in patients who require warfarin because of atrial fibrillation, a mechanical heart valve, or a history of venous thromboembolism.

### Triggers, targets and treatments for thrombosis [^111ShxqZ]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

Thrombosis — localized clotting of the blood — can occur in the arterial or the venous circulation and has a major medical impact. Acute arterial thrombosis is the proximal cause of most cases of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and of about 80% of strokes, collectively the most common cause of death in the developed world. Venous thromboembolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular-associated death. The pathogenic changes that occur in the blood vessel wall and in the blood itself resulting in thrombosis are not fully understood. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing safer and more effective antithrombotic drugs.

### New aspects on treatment modalities for thromboembolic episodes [^1152gPJz]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been treated with a glycosaminoglycan, followed by a vitamin K antagonist during the past 60 years. During the past two decades the glycosaminoglycans have undergone refinement, allowing for simplification of care for these patients, but parenteral administration is still required. Therefore, the current completion of phase III trials with selective, predictable and orally available anticoagulants with rapid onset brings promise for a change in paradigm in the treatment of VTE in the next few years. Whereas these efforts will lead to further simplification of the therapy there are also trials conducted to advance the treatment by rapid resolution of the thromboembolism in order to improve long-term outcome. Catheter-directed thrombolysis, perhaps also with thrombus fragmentation and stent insertion, if demonstrated to be successful for the reduction of the postthrombotic syndrome, will only be an alternative for a minority of patients due to the complexity, risks and cost of therapy. This treatment increases the complexity at the same time as new drug regimens offer simplicity. This review focuses on the novel therapies for VTE although the new anticoagulants will also play a major role in the management of arterial disease, which will be briefly presented.

### Management of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: a systematic review [^113769uo]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Antiphospholipid antibodies are autoantibodies directed against proteins that bind to phospholipid. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) refers to the association between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis risk or pregnancy morbidity. Patients with APS may be at increased risk of recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy loss.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence for treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005) and Cochrane Library electronic databases (2005) and reference lists for randomized trials, meta-analyses of randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies of the treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS. Studies were selected on the basis of clinical relevance.

Evidence Synthesis

Among patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the absolute risk of developing new thrombosis is low (< 1% per year) in otherwise healthy patients without prior thrombotic events, may be moderately increased (up to 10% per year) in women with recurrent fetal loss without prior thrombosis, and is highest (> 10% in the first year) in patients with a history of venous thrombosis who have discontinued anticoagulant drugs within 6 months. Compared with placebo or untreated control, anticoagulation with moderate-intensity warfarin (adjusted to a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.0–3.0) reduces the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis by 80% to 90% irrespective of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and may be effective for preventing recurrent arterial thrombosis. No evidence exists that high-intensity warfarin (target INR, > 3.0) is more effective than moderate-intensity warfarin. For patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and prior stroke, aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke. Treatment issues that have not been addressed in clinical trials, or for which the evidence is conflicting, include the role of antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies without prior thrombosis, the optimal treatment of noncerebrovascular arterial thrombosis, recurrent thrombosis despite warfarin therapy, and treatment of women with antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent fetal loss.

Conclusions

In patients with APS, moderate-intensity warfarin is effective for preventing recurrent venous thrombosis and perhaps also arterial thrombosis. Aspirin appears to be as effective as moderate-intensity warfarin for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke and a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibody. The optimal treatment of other thrombotic aspects of APS needs to be addressed in well-designed prospective studies.

### Clotting problems: diagnosis and management of underlying coagulopathies [^113KrS4Z]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vessel wall injury, stasis, and blood hypercoagulable state are major predisposing factors of thrombosis. Although, a procoagulable factor is found in half of patients with venous thromboembolism, relatively little is known about coagulopathies that predispose to arterial thromboembolism or unexplained arterial revascularization thrombosis. Those hypercoagulable states can be inherited or acquired and related to either an increase of a procoagulable factor or a decrease of an anticoagulation agent. However, most thrombotic episodes seem to occur with additive combination of acquired and inherited predisposing factors. Therefore, controversy exists as to which patients and family members to test for thrombophilia and which patients to treat with life-long anticoagulation. The aim of this review is to provide a practical overview with guidelines for detecting, and treatment of, the principal underlying coagulopathies that a vascular surgeon should be aware of in his/her practice and for the care of patients with vascular disease.

Arterial thrombotic events

Apart from the venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events, there are also reports of arterial thrombosis including stroke, myocardial infarction, acute limb ischemia, aortic thrombosis and splenic infarcts. Microvascular thrombosis also is present in COVID-19 disease. Autopsies done on patients who died from COVID-19 infection demonstrated microvascular thrombosis in the lungs. The mechanism of development of this entity is unclear and is thought to be multifactorial.

Guideline recommendations

Guidance on the treatment of COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability has been provided by several international organisations. For outpatients with COVID-19 infection, it is not recommended to initiate anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy for prevention of venous thromboembolism or arterial thrombosis unless other indications are present. However, there is general agreement that thromboprophylaxis should be administered to all patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection with the prophylactic dose anticoagulation being the backbone of the antithrombotic therapy. Nevertheless, there exist some variations concerning the recommended dosages, duration of treatment and optimal agent. Some societies recommend intermediate dose anticoagulation (eg, enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg two times per day or 40 mg two times per day or intravenous UFH to achieve antifactor Xa level of 0.3–0.7 units/mL) in a specific subgroup of patients considered at high risk of thrombotic events, whereas others recommend against it. In addition, extended thromboprophylaxis even after patient discharge can be considered in patients at high thrombotic and low bleeding risk. The optimal anticoagulant agent is yet to be determined. Currently, most societies recommend the use of LMWH and UFH as first-line agents for inpatient management of these patients, whereas others recommend the use fondaparinux in addition to the previously mentioned agents. However, the use of antiplatelet alone for thromboprophylaxis is not recommended. When pharmacological anticoagulation is contraindicated, it is recommended to use mechanical thromboprophylaxis.

Acute limb ischemia — anticoagulation practice and evidence gaps: Regardless of the cause and level of acute limb ischemia, patients usually receive short-term anticoagulation treatment with therapeutic doses of heparin to reduce the extent of ischemic injury by preventing clot propagation and further embolism, but there are no formal studies demonstrating improved outcomes with anticoagulation. The expected adverse effect of preoperative anticoagulation therapy is an increased risk of bleeding, including wound hematomas, and to the authors' knowledge there are no randomized trials directly comparing unfractionated heparin with other anticoagulants in this setting.

### Oral factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors: a clinical perspective [^11642kR4]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation used to be synonymous with warfarin until the recent approval of oral direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors in United States and other countries across the world. Thrombosis prevention and treatment continue to be the main objective and goal for surgical and medical patients. Regulatory agencies continue to revise their guidelines to treat these patients with appropriate medication and for optimal duration. As the choices for oral anticoagulants increase, with many oral anticoagulant drugs currently in the pipeline awaiting completion of clinical trials, the guidelines for venous thromboembolism prevention, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and treatment of acute arterial and venous thrombi will also shift from the current standards to new standards set by these clinical trials for optimal dosing and duration of treatment. However, it must be reinforced that these new oral anticoagulants are distinct pharmacological compounds with specific targets and will also have distinct clinical indications for use.

### Treatment of arterial thrombosis in children: methods and mechanisms [^1138AV6T]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Arterial thrombosis is increasingly recognized in children and is mostly related to the presence of an arterial catheter or an ischemic stroke. Treatment of children with arterial thrombosis varies widely and consists on the administration of the common available anticoagulant und antiplatelet drugs. No evidence-based guidelines are available so far to prefer one treatment approach to another. Data in adults indicate that understanding the pathomechanism and composition of arterial thrombosis is crucial for choosing the most efficient and safe antithrombotic drug. This review will briefly summarize new insights on the pathomechanism and composition of arterial thrombosis in adults and describe available antithrombotic treatment modalities currently used n children.

### Argatroban: update [^113DEtEX]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Unfractionated heparin has historically been used as the anticoagulant of choice in the management of a number of thrombotic diseases. Recognition of the limitations of heparin has led to the development of a newer class of anticoagulants, the direct thrombin inhibitors. Argatroban is a synthetic small molecule that selectively inhibits thrombin at its active site. In preclinical studies, argatroban has been shown to be more effective than heparin in preventing arterial thrombosis and in promoting vessel patency in conjunction with thrombolysis in a number of animal models. In clinical trials, argatroban has been shown to be as effective as heparin in the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in conjunction with thrombolysis. It has been shown to be an effective anticoagulant in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. In patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia complicated by thrombosis, argatroban significantly decreases the risk of thrombotic events. Small studies have demonstrated a potential role for its use in ischemic stroke and hemodialysis. Additional studies are warranted to confirm argatroban's efficacy in a wide variety of clinical settings.

COVID-19 thrombosis risk and prophylaxis background — These guidelines consistently recommend that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (excluding pregnant women) should receive at least prophylactic-dose anticoagulation to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE). The increased risk of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic or thrombophilic state resulting from multiple mechanisms, and in a recent large cohort study, COVID-19 was associated with substantially increased incidence of both VTE and arterial thromboses.

Recommendations determined to be strong used the wording "we recommend" and those determined to be conditional used the wording "we suggest". Given the low quantity and quality of evidence, "a strong recommendation could be considered only if there were unanimous agreement among the panel for a strong recommendation and if an acceptable paradigmatic situation existed to justify a strong recommendation".

### Antiplatelet therapy in children [^112cPBxC]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Platelets are essential for the maintenance of vascular integrity and control of bleeding at sites of injury, but they are also implicated in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and arterial vascular thrombosis. The use of antiplatelet drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular thromboses in adult populations has been extensively evaluated, resulting in defined management strategies. Much less is known about the appropriate use of antiplatelet drugs (primarily aspirin) in infants and children for secondary prevention in ischemic stroke, for prevention of coronary artery thrombosis in Kawasaki disease, or for prevention of thromboembolism following surgery for congenital cardiac disease. Additional studies will be required to evaluate the relative benefits of aspirin and anticoagulants in these settings. A role for newer antiplatelet drugs in the management of pediatric arterial thrombosis is as yet unexplored.

Introduction

Aims of these guidelines and specific objectives

Please refer to the original ASH guideline on thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19.

Description of the health problem

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant public health impact. As of 2 May 2021, more than 152 million cases and 3.2 million deaths had been attributed to COVID-19–related illness globally. It is estimated that 5% to 20% of infected patients require hospital admission, of whom 5% to 15% may develop critical illness requiring intensive care support.

Patients with critical illness resulting from COVID-19 may develop a severe inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction, which may result in platelet activation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and a hypercoagulable state. Several laboratory predictors of thrombosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have been reported, including elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.VTE has emerged as an important complication in critically ill patients with COVID-19, occurring in up to 23% of such patients. This was observed in the very early days of the pandemic, but it remains an important issue, even with the introduction of improved treatments in subsequent waves of the pandemic. In addition, arterial thrombotic complications including stroke have been noted. Microvascular thrombosis, which may involve the pulmonary vasculature and other organs, has been reported in autopsy studies, although its impact on the development of respiratory and multiorgan failure remains unclear. Patients who are critically ill may also be at increased bleeding risk, which may be a result of platelet dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, organ dysfunction, or consumptive coagulopathy.

The optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy that balances thrombotic and bleeding risk in critically ill patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. This uncertainty has led to variability in clinical practice regarding empiric thromboprophylaxis regimens, and several randomized trials are in progress. Although COVID-19–associated coagulopathy seems to be marked primarily by thrombotic complications, patients may develop major bleeding complications when receiving anticoagulation therapy, which can have an impact on the safety of intensified thromboprophylaxis regimens. In this living guideline update, the role of intermediate- vs prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is addressed.

Description of the target populations

The target population, patients with COVID-19–related critical illness, is described in Table 2.

### What is the appropriate anticoagulation strategy for thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome? [^1117udCQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder mediated by a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies collectively known as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). They include lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β2-glycoprotein I (anti-β2GPI) antibodies. It has been shown that those patients with all three aPL (triple positive) are at highest risk of both a first thrombotic event and of a recurrence, despite anticoagulation. In response to publication of a meta-analysis and a randomised controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in triple-positive APS with venous and/or arterial thrombosis, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued recommendations that direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOACs) should not be used for secondary prevention of thrombosis in all APS patients (although they did draw specific attention to the high risk of triple-positive patients). As there is less evidence for patients with single- or dual-positive patients with APS, this may be an over-interpretation of the data. In this review, we explore the available evidence on safety and efficacy of DOACs in thrombotic APS, the problem of detecting LA while on DOAC, and provide some practical guidance for managing this problem.

Discussion

In our systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials with over 10,000 participants, we did not detect a difference in ATE with the use of anticoagulation among ambulatory cancer patients undergoing anticancer therapy (Central Illustration). On the other hand, the risks of major and nonmajor bleeding were increased with anticoagulant use. All-cause mortality was similar between the anticoagulation and control groups.

Central Illustration
Anticoagulation and Risk of Arterial Thrombosis and Bleeding in Ambulatory Cancer Patients

The figure describes the overall results of the study by illustrating the comparative effects of anticoagulation and no anticoagulation among ambulatory cancer patients starting systemic therapy on arterial thrombotic events and major bleeding.

The effectiveness of oral or parenteral anticoagulants to prevent ATE in cancer remains a contentious topic of debate. Although international guidelines recommend the use of low-dose anticoagulants among outpatients receiving systemic anticancer therapy at high risk of VTE, there is paucity of systematic data synthesis on the prevention of cancer-associated arterial thrombotic events. Importantly, although the risks of ATE in malignancy are elevated compared with noncancer populations, their absolute incidence appears to be 5-fold lower than those of VTE among patients with cancer. Therefore, understanding the impact of anticoagulants on ATE among ambulatory cancer patients is crucial to optimize primary prevention strategies for cancer-associated thrombosis.

Treatment with DOACs

Data from a recent open-label RCT (TRAPS trial) showed that thrombosis, mainly arterial, developed in 12% of triple aPL patients with APS randomised to rivaroxaban compared with none of those randomised to warfarin, over a mean follow-up of 569 days. Based on these results, and the data from a previousand an updated systematic reviewof 447 APS cases treated with DOACs reporting that triple aPL positivity and history of arterial thrombosis was associated with higher risk of recurrent thrombosis, rivaroxaban should not be used in the treatment of patients with APS and arterial thrombosis.

Treatment in patients with recurrent arterial thrombosis despite adequate anticoagulation

No studies were identified that directly addressed the effectiveness and risks related to an increase of INR target to 3–4, or switch of VKA treatment to LMWH. Regarding the addition of LDA, a prospective cohort study with 5-year follow-up showed that among 22 patients with at least one arterial event, new thromboses occurred in 2/4 (50%) treated with VKA and one antiplatelet drug compared with 6/18 (33%) treated with VKA alone. The target INR was > 3 but achieved INR was not reported, and the timing of antiplatelet treatment relative to events was not clearly specified. Confounding by indication may have been present. The role of dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, HCQ and targeted treatments including B-cell depletion therapy for the management of recurrent arterial events has been mainly examined in small case series and may reflect publication bias. Their potential effect in refractory thrombotic APS should be examined in well-designed prospective studies (Research agenda).

Therapeutics for thrombosis were discovered because of observations made nearly one hundred years ago. The mainstays of these treatments have been either heparin or warfarin, with the latter being preferred for long-term anticoagulation. In the last six years, newer agents with antigoagulant activities have been approved for clinical use. These agents have advantages and disadvantages over warfarin and consensus for their use is still being formed, as is the manner in which the more traditional agents, such as warfarin, should be used and monitored.

Acute limb-threatening ischemia in COVID-19 — clinical outcomes and treatment considerations report that three patients died of ARDS, with two major and one minor amputations during hospitalization; in a systematic review of 194 patients, 123 underwent surgical revascularization, 37 underwent percutaneous angioplasty, and 32 were deemed too ill for procedural revascularization. Considering the lack of high-quality data, it is reasonable to consider the treatment of patients with COVID-19-associated acute limb-threatening ischemia similar to pre-pandemic practice, and anticoagulation should be started as early as possible.

Several advances have occurred over the last 2 years in the clinical management of venous thromboembolism (VTE), as evidenced by several high-profile publications in top-tier medical journals. The translation of the knowledge gained into routine clinical practice is an important challenge so that VTE is managed optimally and established and new anticoagulants are used effectively and safely. This chapter reviews issues of VTE treatment from acute management to treatment of long-term complications, addressing new data gained in the last 2 years and putting them into a clinical context, with the goal of improved everyday VTE management.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^1149ARZf]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

### Emerging anticoagulant strategies [^115PHucv]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the search for more effective and safer antithrombotic strategies continues. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of thrombosis has fostered 2 new approaches to achieving this goal. First, evidence that thrombin may be as important as platelets to thrombosis at sites of arterial injury and that platelets contribute to venous thrombosis has prompted trials comparing anticoagulants with aspirin for secondary prevention in arterial thrombosis and aspirin with anticoagulants for primary and secondary prevention of venous thrombosis. These studies will help identify novel treatment strategies. Second, emerging data that naturally occurring polyphosphates activate the contact system and that this system is critical for thrombus stabilization and growth have identified factor XII (FXII) and FXI as targets for new anticoagulants that may be even safer than the DOACs. Studies are needed to determine whether FXI or FXII is the better target and to compare the efficacy and safety of these new strategies with current standards of care for the prevention or treatment of thrombosis. Focusing on these advances, this article outlines how treatment strategies for thrombosis are evolving and describes the rationale and approaches to targeting FXII and FXI. These emerging anticoagulant strategies should address unmet needs and reduce the systemic underuse of anticoagulation because of the fear of bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Xpz9Z]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^116NBsoG]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of acute thrombotic events

Acute thrombotic events should be managed according to current guidelines. Cytoreductive therapy should be instituted to ensure control of blood counts to the therapeutic target. Venesection to reduce the Hct to < 0.45 should be undertaken if it is not controlled at the time of acute thrombosis. For arterial thrombosis, low dose aspirin should be offered to all patients, and specialist advice should be sought.

For venous thromboembolism (VTE), anticoagulation should be commenced. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) remains the first choice in the acute setting, followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) as per guidelines (NICE, 2012). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in the non‐MPN population for prophylaxis and VTE therapy. However, there is limited data for their specific use in MPN, where they appear to be safe and efficacious (Ianotto et al, 2017).

Secondary prevention of thrombosis

Indefinite anticoagulation for VTE is recommended because of the presence of continuing risk (NICE 2012; Watson et al, 2015; Kearon et al, 2016). In MPN, the role of continuing anticoagulation, particularly in VTE, has been assessed by several studies. Around a third of patients who stop anticoagulation after initial treatment suffer a recurrence (Barosi et al, 2013; Kaifie et al, 2016). Two retrospective studies (Hernández‐Boluda et al, 2015; De Stefano et al, 2016a) showed that cessation of VKA after 3 months of treatment for a first VTE in MPN patients increased the risk of recurrent thrombosis compared with continued treatment. The later study also suggested a role for VKA in reducing the risk of arterial thrombotic recurrence and the possible benefit of adding aspirin to VKA to prevent recurrent arterial thrombosis. We are unable to make a specific recommendation about the addition of aspirin to VKA when a secondary thrombosis occurs in a patient already on VKA, as there is not yet evidence to support this. However, trials of this combination are in progress in other conditions and evidence may emerge.

For unprovoked VTE, where there is no physical precipitating factor, we therefore recommend indefinite anticoagulation to reduce the incidence of recurrence. In a significant number of patients with recurrent thrombosis (De Stefano et al, 2008), cell counts were sub‐optimally controlled. Cytoreduction should therefore be reviewed to ensure optimal counts are achieved. For recurrent arterial events, specialist advice should be sought from cardiovascular, stroke or vascular physicians.

COVID-19 with stable peripheral artery disease (PAD) — In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and stable PAD (ie, no acute limb events or revascularization procedures within the past 30 days), we suggest continuation of antiplatelet therapy if concurrent prophylactic-dose anticoagulation for COVID-19 is being given (Conditional Recommendation, Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and stable PAD (ie, no acute limb events or revascularization procedures within the past 30 days) who are receiving single antiplatelet therapy and therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for COVID-19 is being given, we suggest individualizing the decision whether to continue or hold the antiplatelet agent (Conditional Recommendation, Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Oral anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism [^111AMGWg]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis, prevention, and management, venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. For decades, antithrombotic therapy for prevention and treatment of VTE was limited to parenteral agents related to heparin and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Both classes of anticoagulants are effective, but have limitations, including considerable variability in dose-response, narrow therapeutic margins between the risks of thrombosis and bleeding, and the need to monitor anticoagulation intensity. Over the past decade, the introduction of new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit coagulation factors IIa (thrombin) or Xa has changed practice in a variety of clinical situations, including VTE prophylaxis and treatment. In this Review, we outline the use of the novel oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of VTE, and discuss practical considerations for choosing the appropriate drug for each patient. Although the introduction of novel anticoagulant drugs is promising, selecting the optimum strategy for an individual patient requires an understanding of the specific circumstances associated with thrombus formation and the pharmacological properties of each agent.

### Antithrombotic therapies in aortic and peripheral arterial diseases in 2021: a consensus document from the ESC working group on aorta and peripheral vascular diseases, the ESC working group on thrombosis, and the ESC working group on cardiovascular pharmacotherapy [^115Dz2Nw]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of this collaborative document is to provide an update for clinicians on best antithrombotic strategies in patients with aortic and/or peripheral arterial diseases. Antithrombotic therapy is a pillar of optimal medical treatment for these patients at very high cardiovascular risk. While the number of trials on antithrombotic therapies in patients with aortic or peripheral arterial diseases is substantially smaller than for those with coronary artery disease, recent evidence deserves to be incorporated into clinical practice. In the absence of specific indications for chronic oral anticoagulation due to concomitant cardiovascular disease, a single antiplatelet agent is the basis for long-term antithrombotic treatment in patients with aortic or peripheral arterial diseases. Its association with another antiplatelet agent or low-dose anticoagulants will be discussed, based on patient's ischaemic and bleeding risk as well therapeutic paths (e.g. endovascular therapy). This consensus document aims to provide a guidance for antithrombotic therapy according to arterial disease localizations and clinical presentation. However, it cannot substitute multidisciplinary team discussions, which are particularly important in patients with uncertain ischaemic/bleeding balance. Importantly, since this balance evolves over time in an individual patient, a regular reassessment of the antithrombotic therapy is of paramount importance.

### Recurrent thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and arterial thrombosis on antithrombotic therapy [^115ZPPNV]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Management for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and arterial thrombosis is controversial. There are no prospective data demonstrating the superiority of high- or moderate-intensity anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists over antiplatelet agents. Using 2 antiphospholipid antibody databases (single center [New York Presbyterian Hospital] and multicenter [Antiphospholipid Syndrome Alliance for Clinical Trials and International Networking]), we retrospectively collected demographic and clinical data of patients with APS and arterial thrombosis. The primary outcome was recurrent thrombosis rate after initial arterial thrombosis in patients with APS treated with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy. We identified 139 patients with a median follow-up time of 4.24 years after initial thrombosis. Thirty-seven patients (27.3%) received anticoagulants, 43 (30.9%) antiplatelets, and 58 (41.7%) combined therapy. Sixteen patients (37.2%) in the antiplatelet group, 9 (23.7%) in the anticoagulant group, and 4 (6.9%) in the combined therapy group experienced recurrent thrombosis. We estimate that 20% of patients will experience a recurrence by 3.4, 7.3, and 16.3 years, respectively, depending on assignment to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or combined therapy. These results suggest that combined therapy decreases the rate of and increases the time to thrombosis recurrence in patients with APS presenting with arterial thrombosis.

### Multiple recurrent ischaemic strokes in a patient with cancer: is there a role for the initiation of anticoagulation therapy for secondary stroke prevention? [^112VU1yW]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation in high-risk vascular events is an established treatment. However, the use of risk-stratified thromboprophylaxis in patients with active malignancy as a strategy for the prevention of arterial, as well as venous, thromboembolic events is a less common intervention. Most clinical trials of cancer-associated thrombosis and the use of anticoagulation have focused on the treatment and prevention of cancer-associated venous thrombosis and clear guidelines have been established. Several large studies have focused on the risk assessment, safety and compliance with thromboprophylaxis for VTE in patients with cancer. However, it is uncertain how much these data can be extrapolated to guide clinical decision making for the use of anticoagulation in regards to arterial thrombotic events such as ischaemic strokes.

Controversies remain concerning the initiation of anticoagulation therapy and the optimal choice of medication for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of active malignancy. The goal of anticoagulation therapy in these patients would be to decrease their substantial risk of short-term stroke recurrence while also considering their risk of bleeding. However, there is not enough data to support the claim that early anticoagulation would be beneficial. One retrospective study suggested that treatment with LMWH may be more effective than warfarin for lowering the risk of stroke recurrence, but it was limited by a small sample size, confounding factors and a short study period. There is also an ongoing randomised phase I/II trial evaluating enoxaparin versus aspirin in patients with active cancer and first-ever acute ischaemic stroke to compare these treatments' safety and efficacy in preventing recurrent thromboembolic events (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01763606). But, currently, the role of thromboprophylaxis for secondary stroke prevention in patients with active cancer is not addressed in current stroke or cancer treatment guidelines. Since this is an important evolving area of research, large-scale randomised prospective studies are needed to establish patient-specific and disease-specific diagnostic and treatment algorithms for acute and recurrent strokes in patients with cancer.

### A review of therapeutic strategies for the management of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [^114caE8L]. Neurosurgical Focus (2009). Low credibility.

Object

Although initially described in the 19th century, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) remains a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. It has an unpredictable course, and the propensity for hemorrhagic infarction produces significant consternation among clinicians when considering anticoagulation. It is the purpose of this review to analyze the evidence available on the management of CVST and to provide appropriate recommendations.

Methods

A thorough literature search was conducted through MEDLINE and PubMed, with additional sources identified through cross-referencing. A classification and level of evidence assignment is provided for recommendations based on the American Heart Association methodologies for guideline composition.

Results

Of the publications identified, the majority were isolated case reports or small case series. Few prospective trials have been conducted. Existing data support the use of systemic anticoagulation as an initial therapy in all patients even in the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. Chemical and/or mechanical thrombectomy, in conjunction with systemic anticoagulation, is an alternative strategy in patients with progressive deterioration on heparin therapy or in those who are moribund on presentation. Mechanical thrombectomy is probably preferred in patients with preexisting intracranial hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Effective treatments exist for the management of CVST, and overall outcomes are more favorable than those for arterial stroke. Further research is necessary to determine the role of individual therapies; however, the rarity of the condition poses a significant limitation.

Treatment with VKA with INR 2–3 versus INR 3–4

Summary of an earlier SLR showed a lower risk for recurrent thrombosis in patients with high-intensity INR anticoagulation treatment versus those with a target INR of 2–3. Analyses of paired comparisons within studies were not reported. Recurrence risk among patients with first arterial thrombosis was not analysed specifically. One RCT with low risk of bias provided stratified data on patients with arterial thrombosis specifically (table 3). Over a mean of 2.6 years, recurrences were higher among those in the target INR 3–4 group than in the INR 2–3 group (8.6/100 py vs 2.6/100 py) but without statistical significance. Bleeding complications were only reported for the treatment groups as a whole (including patients with either venous or arterial events) and were similar. Another RCT compared patients with APS treated to a high target INR (3–4.5) versus moderate target INR, but only 32% of participants had prior arterial events. Over a median follow-up of 3.6 years, recurrent events occurred more frequently in the high INR group (3.1/100 patient-years (py) vs 1.6/100 py). Major bleeding was slightly less common in the high INR group. Results were not stratified by history of venous or arterial events, so these results are only indirectly related to the treatment of patients with arterial thrombosis. Risk of bias was rated as high (table 3).

Table 3
Studies of intensity of oral anticoagulation treatment in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous arterial thrombosis

Two additional indirect comparison studies included a mixture of patients with histories of venous and arterial events. The first study included 39 patients with venous thrombosis and 31 with arterial thrombosis. Recurrent thrombosis was not observed in the subgroup treated with warfarin INR ≥ 3 while the rate was 7/100 py in the subgroup of INR 2–3. Methodological quality was intermediate. In the second study of patients with APS with history of thrombosis (54% venous; 46% arterial at diagnosis), recurrent thrombosis was less frequent among patients treated with VKA at INR ≥ 3 than those with INR < 3 (63). All bleeding complications occurred in the high-intensity group (any bleeding 7.1/100 py; major bleeding 1.7/100 py) (table 3). Data from mixed treatment and single treatment arm studies showed substantial variability in thrombosis recurrence(online supplementary table 6).

Table 2
Recent Trials Involving Novel Therapies for Anticoagulation

Although recent data have shed some insight on the safety and effectiveness of DOACs in cancer patients both as primary prophylaxis and as treatment of VTE, several areas need future investigation. Among them is the optimal anticoagulant management of patients with cancer who are admitted for minor procedures or short chemotherapy infusion, as well as the optimal duration of post-operative anticoagulation in patients with cancer.

As it relates to arterial thromboembolism management, there are no guidelines specific to patients with cancer. In recent clinical trials such as the DAPT (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy) trial and the LEADERS FREE (Polymer-free Drug-Coated Coronary Stents in Patients at High Bleeding Risk) trial, 10% to 12% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention had a history of cancer. For cancer patients, the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions advocates for the use of radial access or a small needle kit femoral access, careful review of the appropriate use criteria for the need of percutaneous coronary intervention, liberal use of fractional flow reserve in indeterminate cases, and intravascular ultrasound–guided percutaneous coronary intervention. Cancer patients also have a higher risk of stent thrombosis, as malignancy is a potent predictor of late stent thrombosis. The other frequent concern in cancer is thrombocytopenia. A platelet cutoff of > 50,000/μl for coronary artery bypass grafting, > 30,000/μl for dual antiplatelet therapy, and > 10,000/μl for aspirin is advised by the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions. Certainly, shaping recommendations for dual antiplatelet therapy, the role of percutaneous coronary intervention, and clarifying the bleeding risk in the cancer population is of critical importance.

### Combination antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with coronary and peripheral artery disease [^1121iPxb]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay for the treatment of acute and chronic arterial disease involving the coronary and peripheral beds. However, questions remain about optimal antithrombotic therapy for long-term treatment of chronic vascular disease. The observation that dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel was associated with lower thrombotic event rates than acetylsalicylic acid monotherapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention changed the treatment paradigm. Moreover, the demonstration that more pharmacodynamically potent P2Y 12 inhibitors than clopidogrel were associated with fewer thrombotic event occurrences further solidified the dual antiplatelet therapy approach. However, recurrent thrombotic events occur in ≈1 in 10 patients in the first year following an acute coronary syndrome event, despite treatment with the most potent P2Y 12 inhibitors, a limitation that has stimulated interest in exploring the efficacy and safety of approaches using anticoagulants on top of antiplatelet therapy. These investigations have included treatment with very-low-dose oral anticoagulation, and even its replacement of acetylsalicylic acid in the presence of a P2Y 12 inhibitor, in patients stabilized after an acute coronary syndrome event. Recent basic and translational studies have suggested noncanonical effects of coagulation factor inhibition that may further modulate clinical benefits. This in-depth review will discuss developments in our understanding of the roles that platelets and coagulation factors play in atherothrombosis and review the rationale and clinical evidence for combining antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with coronary and peripheral artery disease.

### Changes in the landscape of anticoagulation: a focus on direct oral anticoagulants [^1136sryG]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Over the last decade, the advent of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has rapidly changed the landscape of anticoagulation. In the early 2010s, DOACs became widely available for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and the treatment of venous thromboembolism. About 10 years later, approximately two-thirds of patients requiring oral anticoagulant treatment were receiving a DOAC. The results of several post-marketing studies consistently confirmed the findings of phase 3 clinical trials, and research has focused on new areas of development, with heterogeneous results. A role for DOACs has emerged for patients with peripheral artery disease and other challenging conditions, such as cancer-associated thrombosis, unusual-site venous thromboembolism, and end-stage renal disease. Conversely, clinical trials showed that DOACs were not efficacious in patients with valvular atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, embolic strokes of undetermined source, or antiphospholipid syndrome. In this Review, we discuss the impact of DOACs in clinical practice over the last decade, new areas under development, and practical issues in the management of these drugs.

### Anticoagulation for the prevention of arterial thrombosis in ambulatory cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tCmHC]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systemic review and meta-analysis is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Statement. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board (protocol ID: 20220572–01H) to enable analysis of patient-level data where required. This review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

Eligibility criteria

We included randomized trials comparing oral or parenteral anticoagulant treatment (at prophylactic, intermediate, or therapeutic dose) to standard of care (no anticoagulation) among ambulatory cancer patients with solid tumors or lymphoma who were receiving or initiating tumor-directed systemic therapy. Eligible systemic therapies included conventional chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, oral targeted therapies (eg, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or poly[adenosine diphosphate–ribose] polymerase inhibitors), checkpoint inhibitors, and hormonal therapies. Eligible studies must have collected or reported symptomatic ATEs during follow-up either as an adjudicated outcome or as an adverse event, including ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), intra-abdominal arterial embolism, or peripheral artery occlusion.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) observational studies, reviews, abstracts, trial registries, protocols, conference proceedings, or unpublished studies; 2) < 10 participants enrolled; 3) non-English abstracts; 4) more than 5% of participants with hematologic malignancies (excluding lymphoma) because these patients have an elevated risk of thromboembolism or bleeding on anticoagulants;5) patients with primary brain tumors given the increased risk of intracranial bleeding on anticoagulation (patients with brain metastases were included);6) radiation or surgery alone; 7) duration of follow-up < 3 months; 8) patients on anticoagulation at enrollment; 9) more than 5% of participants with previous VTE, and 10) comparison of anticoagulants to antiplatelet agents; however, studies that included individuals on antiplatelet agents at baseline were eligible.

### Prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19 [^114q418V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The primary manifestation is respiratory insufficiency that can also be related to diffuse pulmonary microthrombosis in people with COVID-19. This disease also causes thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, catheter thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Recent studies have indicated a worse prognosis for people with COVID-19 who developed thromboembolism. Anticoagulants are medications used in the prevention and treatment of venous or arterial thromboembolic events. Several drugs are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic events, such as heparinoids (heparins or pentasaccharides), vitamin K antagonists and direct anticoagulants. Besides their anticoagulant properties, heparinoids have an additional anti-inflammatory potential, that may affect the clinical evolution of people with COVID-19. Some practical guidelines address the use of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in people with COVID-19, however, the benefit of anticoagulants for people with COVID-19 is still under debate.

Objectives

To assess the effects of prophylactic anticoagulants versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention, on mortality and the need for respiratory support in people hospitalised with COVID-19.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and IBECS databases, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and medRxiv preprint database from their inception to 20 June 2020. We also checked reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews identified and contacted specialists in the field for additional references to trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and cohort studies that compared prophylactic anticoagulants (heparin, vitamin K antagonists, direct anticoagulants, and pentasaccharides) versus active comparator, placebo or no intervention for the management of people hospitalised with COVID-19. We excluded studies without a comparator group. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and need for additional respiratory support. Secondary outcomes were mortality related to COVID-19, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, adverse events, length of hospital stay and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias for non-randomised studies (NRS) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. We reported results narratively.

Main Results

We identified no RCTs or quasi-RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. We included seven retrospective NRS (5929 participants), three of which were available as preprints. Studies were conducted in China, Italy, Spain and the United States. All of the studies included people hospitalised with COVID-19, in either intensive care units, hospital wards or emergency departments. The mean age of participants (reported in 6 studies) ranged from 59 to 72 years. Only three included studies reported the follow-up period, which varied from 8 to 35 days. The studies did not report on most of our outcomes of interest: need for additional respiratory support, mortality related to COVID-19, DVT, pulmonary embolism, adverse events, and quality of life. Anticoagulants (all types) versus no treatment (6 retrospective NRS, 5685 participants) One study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.66; 2075 participants). One study reported a reduction in mortality only in a subgroup of 395 people who required mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89). Three studies reported no differences in mortality (adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.92; 449 participants; unadjusted OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 154 participants and adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.57; 192 participants). One study reported zero events in both intervention groups (42 participants). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was critical and the certainty of the evidence was very low. One NRS reported bleeding events in 3% of the intervention group and 1.9% of the control group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.71; 2773 participants; low-certainty evidence). Therapeutic-dose anticoagulants versus prophylactic-dose anticoagulants (1 retrospective NRS, 244 participants) The study reported a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46) and a lower absolute rate of death in the therapeutic group (34.2% versus 53%). The overall risk of bias for all-cause mortality was serious and the certainty of the evidence was low. The study also reported bleeding events in 31.7% of the intervention group and 20.5% of the control group (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.37; low-certainty evidence). Ongoing studies We found 22 ongoing studies in hospital settings (20 RCTs, 14,730 participants; 2 NRS, 997 participants) in 10 different countries (Australia (1), Brazil (1), Canada (2), China (3), France (2), Germany (1), Italy (4), Switzerland (1), UK (1) and USA (6)). Twelve ongoing studies plan to report mortality and six plan to report additional respiratory support. Thirteen studies are expected to be completed in December 2020 (6959 participants), eight in July 2021 (8512 participants), and one in December 2021 (256 participants). Four of the studies plan to include 1000 participants or more.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the risks and benefits of prophylactic anticoagulants for people hospitalised with COVID-19. Since there are 22 ongoing studies that plan to evaluate more than 15,000 participants in this setting, we will add more robust evidence to this review in future updates.

### Update on anticoagulant medications for the interventional radiologist [^115mRDUB]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

For many years, available anticoagulant medications were limited to vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated heparin, and aspirin. However, in the past 20 years, several new agents have been developed for the treatment of thrombosis, and even more are being developed. This increasing number of medications has led to more specific treatment algorithms for the care of venous and arterial thrombotic events. As more agents become available, treatment guidelines are rapidly changing. With increasing frequency, interventional radiologists encounter patients already taking anticoagulant medications prophylactically or therapeutically, or they need to determine which anticoagulant medications need to be initiated for a particular procedure. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to understand the mechanisms, risks, and benefits of anticoagulant medications. A review of the traditional anticoagulants, their new counterparts, and their places in the medication repertoire of interventional radiology will be discussed herein.

### Prevention of arterial and venous thrombotic events in symptomatic peripheral arterial disease patients after lower extremity revascularization in the VOYAGER PAD trial: dual anticoagulant / antiplatelet regimen vs antiplatelet therapy alone [^111rwN7g]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

During the course of their disease, patients with symptomatic PAD after LER can have more than one thrombotic complication over time, more than one type of thrombosis (arterial or venous), and thrombosis at different sites (e.g. stroke, MI, PE, DVT). A focus on the first event, however, can steer the clinical decision‐making process toward how to prevent that one type of thrombotic complication and hinder consideration of broader therapeutic options that may address future associated thrombotic complications at other locations of the vascular tree, and which could potentially work in tandem or even synergistically. Given our penchant in clinical practice to cling to traditionally understood mechanistic concepts of athero‐ and venous thrombosis, it can be tempting to think of treatment of arterial disease as primarily, if not exclusively, addressed by antiplatelet therapy alone (to treat "platelet‐rich" clots) and venous disease treated only with anticoagulants (for "fibrin‐rich" clots). However, evidence is accumulating to the contrary. Recurrent thrombotic events may still occur in approximately 1 in 10 patients in the first year following an ACS event, despite treatment with aspirin plus potent P2Y12 blockade. Dual antiplatelet therapy is not consistently superior to single antiplatelet therapy in reducing MACE and MALE in patients with peripheral artery disease. This suggests that mechanisms beyond platelet function may be driving thrombus occurrence. Recent developments in our understanding of the contribution of thrombin generation to arterial thrombosis and the role of platelets in venous thrombosis give credence to re‐thinking the current therapeutic paradigm.

Acute limb ischemia — thrombolytic agents and management recommendations: Evidence comparing the efficacy of different intraarterial thrombolytic agents for acute limb ischemia is limited, and with streptokinase, there was an increased rate of amputation at 30 days (seven of 20 vs one of 20; RR, 7.0; 95% CI, 0.95–51.80). The guideline states: In patients with acute limb ischemia due to arterial emboli or thrombosis, we suggest immediate systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin over no anticoagulation (Grade 2C); we suggest reperfusion therapy (surgery or intraarterial thrombolysis) over no reperfusion therapy (Grade 2C); and we recommend surgery over intraarterial thrombolysis (Grade 1B). In patients undergoing intraarterial thrombolysis, we suggest rt-PA or urokinase over streptokinase (Grade 2C). Results failed to demonstrate or exclude an effect of intraarterial rt-PA vs intraarterial urokinase on amputation, limb salvage, major hemorrhage, or death.

### Methodology for the development of antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis guidelines: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112M3uzQ]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians antithrombotic guideline methodology — AT9 describes an explicit, transparent process using PICO-formulated questions, predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, exhaustive literature search, risk of bias evaluation, and a rigorous, standardized assessment of the evidence translated into recommendations using GRADE Working Group methodologies; values and preferences and resource considerations were incorporated, and bias from conflicts of interest was addressed through disclosure requirements and aggressive management. Limitations include that some authors were unable to produce Evidence Profiles and Summary of Findings tables, some recommendations would have benefited from meta-analyses, and although panelists were instructed to estimate patient values and preferences rather than their own, "we cannot be assured that they succeeded in all instances". Plans for updating include continuing to update recommendations when important new studies are published and adopting a "living guidelines" process whereby evidence-based guidelines will be periodically assessed and updated; ACCP will continue clinical resources such as quick reference materials, patient education materials, and slide sets, accessed online via the ACCP Web site with related tools and links.

### Anticoagulation for arterial injuries of the extremity… [^113hoq4k]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 The use of systemic anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis is a standard protocol for vascular surgeons during repair of blood vessels. However, in the setting of traumatic vascular injuries, concomitant intracranial hemorrhage, soft tissue injury, or solid organ lacerations may preclude its use for vascular repair. Conflicting data exist as to whether patients with vascular extremity trauma require anticoagulation when undergoing surgical treatment. 1, 2 This project was undertaken to determine whether anticoagulation during arterial repair or bypass decreased the risk for repair thrombosis or limb amputation after traumatic vascular injury of the extremities. After exclusion of patients with incomplete records, data were collected on 123 unique trauma patients. Systemic intraoperative anticoagulation was administered in 69 patients.

Those who received intraoperative anticoagulation had a lower Injury Severity Score compared with patients who did not receive anticoagulation. There was a slightly higher rate of penetrating trauma in patients who did not receive anticoagulation compared with those who did. Eight patients who received intraoperative anticoagulation had repair failure and/or amputation vs 7 patients who did not receive anticoagulation. There was no difference in time from injury to operative repair, type of repair, length of surgery, or mean blood loss, and univariate analysis showed none of these variables affected risk for repair failure or limb loss. In multivariable analysis, intraoperative systemic anticoagulation did not significantly decrease the risk for repair failure or limb loss.

Postoperative anticoagulation use was highly predictive of repair failure and amputation. Klocker et al4 recommended the use of postoperative anticoagulation after vascular repair to improve outcomes after extremity vascular repair; these authors did not account for the severity of the extremity injury. Our results suggest these limbs likely were not salvageable to begin with and use of postoperative anticoagulation as an adjunct does not change this outcome.
