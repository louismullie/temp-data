## Question

What are the most updated treatment guidelines for asthma patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most updated treatment guidelines for asthma patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guideline sources are most authoritative and current. Then, I should verify the key updates and how they differ from older guidance. Next, I will examine the stepwise treatment framework, including mild, moderate, and severe asthma. After that, I need to check special populations and implementation issues. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight controversies or gaps, making sure I cite the highest-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources. The most current, high-credibility guidance comes from the 2024/2025 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy reports, the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) focused update, and the 2023 European Respiratory Society (ERS) short guideline on as-needed ICS-formoterol in mild asthma; I should also consider the 2024 American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) summary and the 2025 VA/DoD primary care guideline for U.S. practice contexts [^784506ca] [^fea5b03e] [^ce068196] [^9adb4292] [^36ddb561] [^2001384e] [^2131a9ee].

> Wait, let me verify the scope and timing of these updates. GINA revises its global strategy annually, with the 2024 and 2025 reports refining recommendations on monitoring, stepping down, and biomarker-guided care; NAEPP issued its first update in 13 years in 2020, focusing on six priority topics; ERS released a focused guideline in 2023 specifically for as-needed ICS-formoterol in mild asthma; AAFP and VA/DoD provide practical summaries and implementation guidance for primary care clinicians [^784506ca] [^fea5b03e] [^ce068196] [^9adb4292] [^43d3adbe] [^2131a9ee].

> I will now examine the overarching principles that cut across these guidelines. All emphasize a stepwise, control-based approach that balances current symptom control with future risk of exacerbations, individualizes therapy to phenotype and patient preferences, and prioritizes inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as foundational therapy across ages; shared decision-making and written action plans are consistently endorsed, and there is a strong push toward minimizing systemic corticosteroid exposure and simplifying regimens where possible [^784506ca] [^ce068196] [^0c9e9f36].

> Next, I should review the stepwise framework and confirm the major shifts. Historically, treatment was escalated by severity; current guidance operationalizes a six-step pharmacologic approach (Steps 1–6) and integrates control assessment to step up or down therapy, with GINA and NAEPP aligning on ICS-containing controllers for persistent disease and a preference for single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) with ICS-formoterol in Steps 3–4 for patients aged 12 years and older [^ce068196] [^2f33fbd5] [^784506ca].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mild asthma. I need to check the most controversial change: GINA and ERS now recommend as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol as preferred reliever therapy for mild asthma (Step 1–2) rather than SABA-only rescue, because it reduces severe exacerbations and systemic steroid use; NAEPP 2020 allowed intermittent ICS plus SABA as an option for mild persistent asthma but did not fully endorse as-needed ICS-formoterol due to limited U.S. evidence and regulatory issues, so practice varies by region and payer coverage [^9adb4292] [^36ddb561] [^ce068196] [^0c68849e].

> Let me consider moderate persistent asthma next. For adolescents and adults, both GINA and NAEPP prefer SMART with ICS-formoterol as both maintenance and reliever, which reduces exacerbations versus higher-dose ICS-LABA plus SABA; for children 5–11 years, evidence is more limited, but GINA supports SMART in this group, and NAEPP notes insufficient evidence for a strong recommendation, so clinician judgment and device/formulary constraints apply [^ce068196] [^2f33fbd5] [^784506ca].

> I should confirm severe asthma recommendations. For Step 5–6, add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) can be considered when control remains suboptimal on ICS-LABA, but NAEPP advises preferentially adding LABA to ICS over LAMA due to potential harm signals in some populations; GINA supports LAMA as an add-on in selected adults. Biologics are indicated for severe, uncontrolled asthma with Type 2 inflammation, with selection guided by phenotype and biomarkers such as eosinophils and IgE; EAACI provides GRADE-based recommendations for agents like omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab [^9d71287b] [^784506ca] [^e3d08f85].

> But wait, what about stepping down and monitoring? I need to ensure I capture that. GINA recommends reassessing every 1–3 months initially, then every 3–12 months, and stepping down ICS by 25–50% at 3-month intervals once control is stable for 3 months; complete ICS withdrawal increases exacerbation risk, so tapering is preferred. Written action plans and patient education on recognizing loss of control are essential, and follow-up after exacerbations should occur within 1 week [^fea5b03e] [^de61717b] [^d8837c49].

> Next, I should review special populations and practical issues. For children 0–4 years, NAEPP advises short-course ICS at the onset of viral wheeze to reduce exacerbations, with reassessment if no benefit in 4–6 weeks. For older adults, undertreatment is common; multidimensional assessment and attention to comorbidities, inhaler technique, and adherence are critical. In pregnancy, ICS remain first-line and are safe. For low-resource settings, GINA emphasizes adaptation to local formularies and cost constraints, and the need for implementation science to close care gaps [^0c68849e] [^0d3361b7] [^784506ca].

> I should double-check biomarker-guided strategies. GINA supports FeNO-guided treatment to reduce exacerbations in pediatric and young adult patients, and suggests sputum eosinophil-guided adjustment in adults with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS/LABA in experienced centers; conversely, ATS/ERS advises against routine FeNO-guided therapy in severe asthma, underscoring that evidence is mixed and population-specific [^ce2a34d8] [^6cb054f7] [^e784f64e] [^22a2656e].

> Let me synthesize the practical, updated recommendations. For adults and adolescents with persistent asthma, prioritize ICS-containing therapy, prefer SMART with ICS-formoterol in Steps 3–4, and escalate to ICS-LABA-LAMA or biologics in Steps 5–6 based on control, risk, and phenotype. For mild asthma, consider as-needed ICS-formoterol where available and acceptable, otherwise use daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA. Across all steps, reassess control regularly, step down when stable, and embed education and action plans to sustain outcomes [^ce068196] [^784506ca] [^9adb4292].

> Hold on, I should verify controversies and implementation barriers. SMART adoption in the U.S. is limited by FDA labeling, device/formulary constraints, and cost; clinicians often default to maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA despite stronger evidence for SMART in reducing exacerbations. There is also an ongoing debate about the role of SABA-only rescue in truly intermittent asthma, with GINA arguing against SABA monotherapy due to risk, whereas some U.S. clinicians cite access and patient preference; this is an area where shared decision-making and local policy matter greatly [^cdb0f357] [^0c68849e] [^9a844ae2].

> Finally, I need to ensure I note research gaps and the direction of travel. Guidelines increasingly call for precision approaches using biomarkers and treatable traits, faster "living" guideline updates, and real-world effectiveness data to close the evidence-practice gap; remission is emerging as a treatment goal in some national strategies, though consensus definitions and feasibility in routine care are still evolving [^c21dc2a9] [^7abf8b0d] [^39ea7a19].

The most current asthma treatment guidelines are the **2024 GINA Global Strategy** [^784506ca] and the **2020 NAEPP Focused Updates** [^ce068196], both emphasizing a stepwise, control-based approach with ICS-containing therapy for persistent asthma and as-needed ICS-formoterol for mild disease [^9adb4292]. Key updates include: **SMART (single maintenance and reliever therapy)** with ICS-formoterol as preferred for moderate-to-severe asthma [^ce068196] [^c3760644]; **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** for mild asthma instead of SABA-only [^9adb4292] [^36ddb561]; and **biologics** for severe, uncontrolled Type 2 asthma [^e3d08f85]. Both guidelines stress regular assessment, individualized care, and shared decision-making to optimize control and minimize exacerbations [^844dbdf1] [^5975149a].

---

## Current guideline sources

The two most authoritative, up-to-date sources are:

- **Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2024**: Annual updates integrating new evidence; widely adopted internationally [^784506ca] [^0160bf3b].
- **National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) 2020 Focused Updates**: U.S.-specific, evidence-based updates using GRADE methodology [^ce068196] [^839cda4c].

---

## Core principles of current guidelines

Both guidelines share **core principles**:

- **Stepwise therapy**: Adjust treatment intensity to symptom control and exacerbation risk [^2f33fbd5] [^844dbdf1].
- **ICS-containing therapy**: Foundation for persistent asthma to reduce exacerbations [^ce068196] [^844dbdf1].
- **Individualized care**: Tailor to phenotype, comorbidities, preferences, and access [^5975149a] [^ac67696c].
- **Regular monitoring**: Reassess control, adherence, and inhaler technique at 3–6 month intervals [^fea5b03e] [^de61717b].

---

## Key updates and recommendations

### Mild asthma management

A major shift is **away from SABA-only** rescue in mild asthma [^9a844ae2]. GINA and ERS recommend **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** for adults and adolescents with mild asthma, which reduces exacerbations versus SABA-only or daily ICS plus SABA [^9adb4292] [^36ddb561]. NAEPP 2020 supports either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS-SABA for mild persistent asthma, reflecting evolving evidence [^ce068196] [^0c68849e].

---

### Moderate-to-severe asthma management

- **SMART therapy**: Preferred for patients ≥ 12 years with moderate-to-severe asthma; reduces exacerbations and steroid exposure versus higher-dose ICS-LABA plus SABA [^ce068196] [^c3760644].
- **Add-on LAMA**: Consider triple therapy (ICS-LABA-LAMA) when control remains suboptimal despite optimized ICS-LABA [^2001384e] [^9d71287b].
- **Biologics**: For severe, uncontrolled Type 2 asthma (eosinophilic, allergic); agents include anti-IgE, anti-IL5/5R, and anti-IL4/13 [^e3d08f85].

---

### Special populations and considerations

- **Children**: GINA recommends ICS-containing therapy for all children; SMART is preferred in those ≥ 12 years, with as-needed ICS-SABA for 6–11 years due to device constraints [^844dbdf1] [^091c23d2].
- **Pregnancy**: ICS are first-line; maintain control to reduce maternal and fetal risks.
- **Elderly**: Address comorbidities, polypharmacy, and inhaler technique; consider LAMA cautiously due to anticholinergic effects [^0d3361b7].

---

## Implementation and adherence strategies

Guidelines emphasize **practical implementation**:

- **Education**: Teach inhaler technique and adherence at every visit [^7138b269].
- **Action plans**: Provide written, individualized plans for self-management [^d8837c49].
- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in treatment choices to improve adherence [^f314e530].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

- **Precision medicine**: Biomarker-guided therapy (FeNO, blood eosinophils) is expanding, especially in severe asthma [^ce2a34d8] [^6cb054f7].
- **Digital health**: Telemedicine and digital monitoring are increasingly integrated into care pathways.
- **Remission goals**: Some guidelines now target remission (no symptoms, no exacerbations, no steroids) as an aspirational endpoint [^7abf8b0d].

## Summary of key recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Mild asthma | As-needed ICS-formoterol (GINA/ERS) or daily low-dose ICS + as-needed SABA (NAEPP) |
| Moderate-to-severe asthma | SMART (ICS-formoterol) preferred; add LAMA if uncontrolled; consider biologics for Type 2 severe asthma |
| Children ≥ 12 years | SMART preferred; as-needed ICS-SABA for 6–11 years |
| Severe asthma | Biologics for Type 2 inflammation; phenotype-guided selection |
| Monitoring | Reassess every 3–6 months; adjust therapy based on control and risk |

---

The 2024 GINA and 2020 NAEPP updates converge on a **control-based, ICS-centered strategy**, with SMART and biologics as key advances. Individualized care, regular monitoring, and shared decision-making remain essential to reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life [^784506ca] [^ce068196].

### Guidelines for asthma management: a review and comparison of 5 current guidelines [^c0b9932b]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma were published over 20 years ago in New Zealand and Australia. During the same period, British and Scottish groups were collaborating on a United Kingdom version of asthma guidelines. Shortly after the introduction of the New Zealand and Canadian guidelines, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health participated in 2 additional asthma guideline endeavors, which were published in the early 1990s. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute formed the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program to develop asthma guidelines for the United States, and participated with an international task force to develop guidelines for the treatment of asthma in all countries, which resulted in the formation of the Global Initiative for Asthma in the mid-1990s. The asthma guidelines issued by professional societies and other groups prior to the late 1990s were primarily based on consensus or expert opinion in each guideline committee, though those opinions were based on the available studies. The early guidelines played a vital role in bridging the gap between various treatment options and recent discoveries in basic science, and served as the vehicle to implementation into daily clinical practice. Asthma guidelines have been published and revised in dozens of countries around the world and have become reputable directives or "road maps" in asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management for patients of all ages. The guidelines have similar formats. The dissemination and implementation of the early guidelines was inconsistent, and they were criticized for not being evidence-based. As the knowledge of asthma pathophysiology continues to expand, along with basic science research on asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management, as well as education of the asthma patient, it is essential that the asthma guidelines be frequently updated and based on evidence-based-medicine processes.

### Medication regimens for managing stable asthma [^d32df538]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma was developed as a means of standardizing asthma therapies and of improving outcomes. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines provide recommendations to care providers about the routine management of asthma. There has been rapid development of new therapies for asthma, specifically with the advent of new drug delivery devices and biologic therapies for severe asthma. We are increasingly recognizing that asthma is a heterogenous disease with a diverse underlying pathophysiology, and therefore, it is imperative for care providers to begin to understand asthma phenotypes and endotypes, and the implications of these classifications on management, especially of severe refractory asthma. This article serves as a review of guideline-based therapy for asthma and includes updates on alternative therapies, new approaches that use previously recognized therapies, and special populations with asthma.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^afbe5923]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

While we have international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, asthma remains poorly controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use, particularly in primary care.

Discussion

Clinical practice guidelines based on evidence from randomized controlled trials are considered the most rigorous and accurate. Current evidence-based guidelines are written predominantly from the perspective of the patient with a clear-cut asthma diagnosis, however, and tend not to consider the heterogeneity of asthma or to accommodate individual patient variations in response to treatment or their needs, differences in practice settings, or local differences in availability and cost of therapies. The results of randomized controlled trials, which are designed to establish efficacy of treatment under ideal conditions, may not apply to 'real-world' clinical practice, where patients are unselected, monitoring is less frequent, and effectiveness — the benefit of treatment in routine clinical practice — is the most relevant outcome. Moreover, most guidelines see asthma in isolation rather than considering other factors that may impact on asthma and response to asthma therapy, particularly age, allergic rhinitis, cigarette smoking, adherence, and genetic factors. When these links are recognized, guidelines rarely provide practical recommendations for treatment in these scenarios. Finally, there is some evidence that general practitioners are not convinced of the applicability of asthma guidelines to their practice settings, especially when those writing the guidelines principally work in specialist practice.

Conclusion

Developing country-specific guidelines or, ideally, local guidelines could provide more practical solutions for asthma care and could account for regional factors that influence patient choice and adherence to therapy. Pragmatic clinical trials and well-designed observational trials are needed in addition to randomized controlled trials to assess real-world effectiveness of therapies, and such evidence needs also to be considered by guideline writers. Finally, practical tools to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of asthma and factors responsible for poor control, such as associated allergic rhinitis, limited adherence, and smoking behavior, are needed to supplement treatment information provided in clinical practice guidelines for asthma.

### Defining and managing risk in asthma [^2e4d90c5]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma attacks are a major global source of morbidity and cost. The incidence and impact of asthma attacks have not improved despite widespread adoption of effective universal treatment guidelines. Consequently, there is increasing interest in managing asthma based on specific assessments of both current symptoms and future risk. In this review, we consider 'risk' in asthma, and how it might be assessed from the patient's history and objective measurements. We also discuss the potential for encouraging shared decision-making and improving medical consensus through explicit communication of risk and highlight the potential opportunities and challenges in risk assessment to improve asthma management through individualised treatment strategies.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^020c4eb0]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^9dc37e6c]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

### The disease management approach to controlling asthma [^89f6d9b0]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma has become an important public health issue worldwide and certain groups, such as children, are at particular risk of the disease. Often asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Despite these worrying trends, the disease management approach to asthma control can help most asthma patients achieve a 'normal' way of life. The increased prevalence and greater diagnostic awareness of asthma have placed increased demands on healthcare resources, but effective asthma control can minimize the personal, social and economic burdens of asthma. Early diagnosis and immediate anti-inflammatory treatment is the first step in gaining control of symptoms. A stepwise approach is then used to classify asthma severity and treatment, with the number and frequency of medications increasing (step up) as asthma severity increases and decreasing (step down) when asthma is under control. This stepwise approach to asthma management necessitates regular review of treatment once asthma is under control. However, effective asthma management is dependent on successful patient education, adherence to prescribed medication and good doctor patient partnerships. Current treatment guidelines recommend the use of a written asthma management plan that should be agreed between the doctor and patient. These plans should cover all aspects of asthma treatment, including prevention steps for long-term control and action steps to stop attacks once a worsening in asthma has been recognized. This comprehensive approach to asthma management increases the likelihood of achieving asthma control, which in turn reduces the need for emergency visits to the hospital or clinic and reduces the limitations on physical activity previously imposed by the condition.

### Asthma exacerbations: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^b0338993]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma focuses on disease severity and choosing the appropriate medical therapy to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, irrespective of asthma severity and often despite optimal medical therapy, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control. Asthma exacerbations are most commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, particularly with human rhinovirus. Given the importance of these events to asthma morbidity and health care costs, we will review common inciting factors for asthma exacerbations and approaches to prevent and treat these events.

### Mild persistent asthma: is any treatment needed? [^01272014]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma treatment guidelines are intended to relieve symptoms and to prevent complications such as exacerbations, airway remodeling, and death. The existing recommendations are based on a combination of evidence and expert opinion. Recent data raise questions about the need for chronic controller therapy for those patients at the very low end of the asthma-severity continuum. Although these data are not sufficient to warrant a change in guidelines, the new information points out the need for large, long-term studies on the treatment of mild persistent asthma, with an emphasis on exacerbations, remodeling, and the relationship between these outcomes and markers of asthma control.

### Asthma: guidelines-based control and management [^7138b269]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines-based management of the patient with asthma allows maximal levels of function with few adverse effects. A flexible approach to therapy that emphasizes an ongoing partnership between the patient and physician allows optimal communication, facilitating treatment adherence and maximal levels of control. Through assessment of the patient's initial severity of disease and an evaluation of the patient's ongoing level of control, appropriate medical therapy can be initiated and level of therapy can be modified based on the patient's response. Patient education, environmental control strategies, and proper use of medications are vital in achieving maximal benefit in asthma management. Excellent asthma control is possible and should be a goal of both physicians and patients.

### Asthma update: part II. medical management [^b38775cf]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recently updated its guidelines for the management of asthma. An evidence-based approach was used to examine several key issues regarding appropriate medical therapy for patients with asthma. The updated guidelines have clarified these issues and should alter the way physicians prescribe asthma medications. Chronic inhaled corticosteroid use is safe in adults and children, and inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as first-line therapy in adults and children with persistent asthma, even if the disease is mild. Other medications, such as cromolyn, theophylline, and leukotriene modifiers, now are considered alternative treatments and should have a more limited role in the management of persistent asthma. The addition of a long-acting beta2 agonist to an inhaled corticosteroid is superior to all other combinations as well as to higher dosages of inhaled corticosteroids alone. Combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2 agonist is the preferred treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. Antibiotic therapy offers no additional benefit in patients with asthma exacerbations.

### Bringing asthma care into the twenty-first century [^cca64145]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What are the goals of diagnosis and treatment in asthma?

Correct diagnosis is essential to ensure that every patient receives treatment appropriate to their condition and, unfortunately, misdiagnosis of asthma is still common. Correct diagnosis of asthma is generally based on a history of symptoms, family history (e.g. atopic disease), physical examination and, as the essential part of the diagnostic process, demonstration of variable airflow limitation by spirometry or peak flow measurement, with consideration of differential diagnoses, (Table 1).

Table 1
Factors in asthma diagnosis in adults.

Various guidelines and reports, such as the GINA Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, have been developed with the aim of providing consistency of asthma treatment around the world. Most guidelines share a 'step care' approach to treatment, with the aim of achieving daily asthma control and preventing exacerbations (future risk) using the lowest level of medication needed to achieve these goals (Fig. 2). Controller medication should be stepped up or down in line with the observed variations in level of asthma control which can be detected by regular assessment, treatment and review.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^dbb9507f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^839cda4c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The methodology framework used for this update, GRADE, is the internationally recommended approach for developing recommendations that clinicians can trust. This framework endorses a systematic and transparent approach to decision making, uses established criteria to rate the certainty of evidence, and determines the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations developed using GRADE combine certainty of evidence with patient values and preferences and weigh the benefits and harms of making treatment recommendations. Importantly, the recommendations are based on the key questions that clinicians, both generalists and specialists, wanted to be answered.

Users of these recommendations may be disappointed by the absence of many strong recommendations — that is, recommendations that clinicians should adhere to for almost all individuals with asthma as the standard of care. This is not, however, surprising given the variations in asthma phenotypes and endotypes and in the outcomes used in the studies reviewed to develop the recommendations. When the GRADE framework is used, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as offering a high certainty of evidence, but issues with study designs (eg, lack of blinding or of a placebo control), heterogeneity of study results, or small numbers of events may result in downgrading the certainty of evidence. For most of the asthma recommendations, the overall certainty of the evidence was downgraded because of inconsistencies in study results, risk of bias, or absence of critical standardized outcome measures. The need to downgrade the evidence should be a clarion call to investigators to use standardized and validated outcome measures that were outlined in the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012). This single activity will create more robust evidence to support recommendations in the future.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^784506ca]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Adapting and implementing asthma clinical practice guidelines — implementation of asthma management strategies may be carried out at a national, regional or local level, and ideally should be a multidisciplinary effort involving many stakeholders, using cost-effective methods of knowledge translation; each implementation initiative needs to consider the nature of the local health system and its resources, including human resources, infrastructure, and available treatments, with goals and strategies varying between and within countries based on economics, culture, and the physical and social environment; priority should be given to high-impact interventions, and specific steps need to be followed before clinical practice recommendations can be embedded into local clinical practice and become the standard of care, with the individual steps summarized in Box 14–2.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^98b88260]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Is the assessment of asthma treatment efficacy sufficiently comprehensive? [^4e0e73d9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The goal of asthma guideline therapy is to achieve disease control, by minimizing impairment and decreasing the risk of exacerbations and adverse effects of the disease and its treatment. The primary objective of most clinical trials of biologics for severe asthma is a reduction in exacerbation rate. Recently, studies with patients at the lower guideline steps have also selected exacerbation reduction as a primary objective. These trials in patients with milder disease frequently demonstrate statistically significantly fewer exacerbations, but their power calculations reflect larger sample size and smaller effect size. Exacerbations have a precise consensus definition, although a minimal clinically important difference has not been established. Reduction of exacerbations in severe asthma is commonly 10-fold greater than in mild disease. Further, reduction in exacerbations is not always associated with reduced impairment. If superior control is the objective, both domains should demonstrate consistent and parallel improvement. The disconnect may reflect the need for alternative tools for measurement of impairment or, possibly, different therapeutic mechanisms of action. Determining response to biologics or discussion of disease remission requires assessing symptoms that may occur daily rather than focusing on exacerbations that occur once or twice a year for patients at the highest steps of care according to the guidelines.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^519c7cb0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Limitations of current guidelines

Clinical practice guidelines are by their nature general recommendations aimed for broad applicability in the clinical setting. Applicability, however, is limited by several factors. One of the challenges to the daily use of current asthma guidelines by physicians is that these guidelines tend to be disease-oriented, not patient-oriented. Guidelines are written not from the perspective of the patient who comes to the physician's office with symptoms, but rather from the perspective of the patient with a clear-cut asthma diagnosis. Symptom-based guidelines are needed. In addition, there are patients who do not fit within many current guideline definitions; for example, children with intermittent wheezing that does not appear to be the classical asthmatic phenotype. Moreover, guideline recommendations tend to be based on disease severity without accounting for concomitant conditions, such as allergic rhinitis, or the time course of disease – factors used by clinicians to individualize the diagnosis and the treatment plan.

In addition, clinical practice guidelines for asthma tend not to consider the heterogeneity of asthma or to accommodate individual patient variations in response to treatment or their needs, differences in practice settings, or local differences in availability and cost of therapies. Guideline recommendations are generally made on the basis of grouped mean data, and fail to recognize individual heterogeneity. For instance, a recent crossover trial comparing an inhaled corticosteroid with a leukotriene receptor antagonist for the treatment of persistent childhood asthma found that, while both treatments were effective, on average the effect was greater in those treated with inhaled corticosteroid. When individual patient responses on each treatment were compared, however, 29% of children had better asthma control (asthma control days/week) on the leukotriene receptor antagonist, indicating that for this subgroup the leukotriene receptor antagonist would be the ideal monotherapy.

Asthma is most commonly managed in the community in general practice settings, and the organization of medical care will affect how asthma care can be delivered. Differential diagnoses vary according to location, with infectious disease being more common in less developed countries. Moreover, currently available guidelines are based on the assumption that the recommended drugs are available and affordable, an assumption that is not true in many parts of the world. There is therefore a pressing need for local guidelines. To be useful to primary care physicians, these guidelines must be in the local language as well as physically available, whether by Internet or in print.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^0e7ad76f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Generating evidence to inform an update of asthma clinical practice guidelines: perspectives from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [^25e81e16]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide. Its increasing prevalence and evidence of suboptimal control require renewed efforts in the development and widespread implementation of clinical practice guidelines for prevention, treatment, and control. Given the rapidly changing landscape and evolving best practices for guideline development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute made a commitment to support rigorous systematic evidence reviews that frontline health care providers and stakeholders could use to create new or update existing guidelines. This article describes the protocols, key questions, methodology, and analytic framework to support the update of the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) on the diagnosis and management of asthma in adults and children. It also describes the expert panel's practical experience in managing asthmatic patients across the age and severity spectrum. The article explains the process for ensuring that the expert panel's deliberations are conducted in accordance with the Institute of Medicine's standards and recommendations for guideline development. The outcome of this ambitious effort will be an update of the EPR-3 asthma guidelines and publication of the key recommendations in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Importantly, several novel approaches will be explored and incorporated as appropriate to accelerate adoption and sustained implementation of the guidelines.

The 2020 Focused Updates to the Asthma Management Guidelines: A Report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group was coordinated and supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health. It is designed to improve patient care and support informed decision making about asthma management in the clinical setting. This update addresses six priority topic areas as determined by the state of the science at the time of a needs assessment, and input from multiple stakeholders:A rigorous process was undertaken to develop these evidence-based guidelines. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Evidence-Based Practice Centers conducted systematic reviews on these topics, which were used by the Expert Panel Working Group as a basis for developing recommendations and guidance. The Expert Panel used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), an internationally accepted framework, in consultation with an experienced methodology team for determining the certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on the evidence. Practical implementation guidance for each recommendation incorporates findings from NHLBI-led patient, caregiver, and clinician focus groups. To assist clincians in implementing these recommendations into patient care, the new recommendations have been integrated into the existing Expert Panel Report-3 (EPR-3) asthma management step diagram format.

### Promoting prevention and targeting remission of asthma: a EUFOREA consensus statement on raising the bar in asthma care [^39ea7a19]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, multifaceted respiratory disease with a major impact on quality of life. Despite increased insights into mechanisms underlying various asthma phenotypes and endotypes and the availability of targeted biologic treatment options, the disease remains uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients with risk of exacerbations, requiring systemic corticosteroids, and with progressive disease. Current international guidelines advocate for a personalized management approach to patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. The European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) asthma expert panel was convened to discuss strategies to optimize asthma care and to prevent systemic corticosteroid overuse and disease progression. In this meeting report, we summarize current concepts and recommendations and provide a rationale to implement personalized asthma management at earlier stages of the disease. The ultimate goal is to move away from the current one-size-fits-most concept, which focuses on a symptom-driven treatment strategy, and shift toward a phenotype- and endotype-targeted approach aimed at curbing the disease course by improving clinical outcomes and preserving health-related quality of life. Herein, we provide a consensus view on asthma care that advocates a holistic approach and highlight some unmet needs to be addressed in future clinical trials and population studies.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^08cfc620]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The new GINA strategy report and supporting resources provide a substantial array of new, practical, evidence-based materials that supplement current national asthma guidelines, or can be adapted for local use, in both high- and low-resource countries. In the 2014 revision and 2015 update, GINA has moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk in a practical, practice-centred format. The aim is to reduce the burden of asthma, both for patients who suffer from this disease and for health-care systems.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^37691483]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma

Asthma is a major burden worldwide, for governments, health-care providers, patients and their carers, and there is considerable variation in asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality. Asthma remains a common cause of death in many countries, and many asthma deaths are preventable, so there is a need for a different approach.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in 1993 to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. The GINA report is not a guideline, but a global strategy that can be adapted to local conditions; over the years, the reports have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. The GINA strategy report, prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, is annually updated following a review of evidence, and is now independently funded by the sale of GINA documents and resources.

Over recent years, research has led to considerable advances not only in our knowledge about asthma and treatment optionsbut also in our understanding of how to implement evidence-based recommendations within clinical practice. This evidence is reflected in a major revision of GINA's landmark Global Strategy Report (published in May 2014, with further minor updates in 2015). The report not only provides up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk but also presents these in a radically different style to improve their utility for busy frontline clinicians.

This paper summarises the key changes in the GINA strategy report that are most relevant to health professionals working in primary care.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^c21dc2a9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Where Do We Go from Here?

The NHLBI Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma Network is conducting clinical trials to further refine a biomarker-driven approach to severe asthma. A biomarker-driven strategy may also be warranted in mild asthma, although confirmatory studies are needed. These observations suggest a future in which guidelines support a precision-medicine approach to asthma management that is based on endotype and not on age and presumed disease severity (current approach). Also, the pace of discovery is only getting faster; an update every 10–15 years is unacceptable. A more agile approach to developing guidelines that retains the benefits of rigor and trustworthiness is needed. We therefore advocate for a dynamic or "living" topic-driven guideline to respond more rapidly to a new body of evidence for an individual recommendation rather than the whole guideline. Such an approach would require a greater level of collaboration between those who develop new evidence (e.g. clinical trialists), experts in evidence synthesis (e.g. guideline methodologists), and funders who can support and plan for topic-specific updates. Importantly, an update to the NAEPP 2020 update that includes the management of severe asthma is urgently needed.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^616667be]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

FOREWORD

It has been 13 years since the last revision of the asthma recommendations, and substantial progress has been made since that time in understanding the origins of asthma as well as its pathophysiology and treatment. As members of the pulmonary and allergy provider community and the primary care community that provide more than half of all asthma care in the United States, we now recognize that asthma is not one disease, but it is a syndrome composed of multiple phenotypes. Asthma is much more complex than indicated in the Expert Panel Report: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-1), released in 1991, which characterized asthma as an inflammatory disease that is responsive to corticosteroids.

This document updates selected topics that were identified as high priority by an NHLBI Advisory Council Asthma Expert Working Group based on input from previous guideline developers, NAEPP participant organizations, and the public. The list of these priority topics was published in 2015.

Limitations and research gaps

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process it used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:
A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates.
The process would benefit from a discussion and development of a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.
Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and the implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also identified several overarching research gaps listed below. Research gaps that are specific to individual topics are listed at the end of each topic section.

Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop report should require the studies they fund to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Because new information on asthma outcomes is now available, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it needs to be revised.
The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes (eg, exacerbations and asthma symptoms) and the cutoffs for tests (eg, F). Clinical relevance should be established using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.
Updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes. The definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated.
Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized. Although the populations of interest for the focused updates were defined for the systematic reviews, the characterizations of study participants did not reflect current understanding of relevant phenotypes and endotypes (eg, based on asthma severity, allergen-specific sensitization, or airway inflammatory type).
Standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies.
The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, which evaluate treatment effects in relatively homogeneous populations and conditions in which fidelity to study protocols is actively promoted. Applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs. Such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations.
Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma. The GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes. However, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. Research is needed to understand how preferred outcomes vary by race or ethnicity, asthma severity, age (eg, children or older adults), and socioeconomic status.
All measures and outcomes relevant to making judgments need to be included in the systematic reviews. For example, although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data. Moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

Ultimately, broad change in clinical practice depends on the uptake, adoption, and implementation of clinical practice recommendations by primary care providers with input from people who have asthma and their families, as well as support from health care systems. This update can serve as a basis to disseminate and facilitate adoption of the asthma recommendations at all levels and to ensure optimal care and equitable outcomes for all individuals with asthma. We ask for the assistance of every stakeholder in reaching our goal: improving asthma care and the quality of life of every person with asthma.

2020 focused updates to the 2007 Asthma Guidelines

After the Expert Panel reached consensus on the recommendations, each topic team drafted a narrative to provide further information on each recommendation. These narratives form the body of this report. Each topic narrative has the following sections:
A brief background section that includes definitions of the terms used in the recommendations
The key questions addressed
The recommendations
An Implementation Guidance section that explains the recommendation in greater detail and provides Expert Panel opinion about how to implement the recommendation in clinical practice
A summary of the evidence
The rationale for the recommendation
A discussion of the evidence supporting the recommendation
A list of topic-specific research gaps and questions

Differences (if any) between the new recommendations and the recommendations in EPR-3 are discussed in Appendix A (in this article's Online Repository at).

The Implementation Guidance sections are for practicing clinicians, and they contain the following information:
Clinician's summary (more detailed explanation of the recommendation)
Population most likely to benefit from the recommendation
Any populations to which the recommendation does not apply
Topic-specific considerations
Issues that clinicians should discuss with their patients as part of the shared decision-making process

Review and public comment

The NAEPPCC reviewed an initial draft report. The NHLBI subsequently made the draft report available for public review and comment from December 2, 2019, to January 17, 2020. Interested stakeholders — including health professionals; representatives of the scientific community, academic institutions, the private sector, professional societies, advocacy groups, and patient communities; and other interested members of the public — were invited to submit comments. The Expert Panel received and reviewed approximately 500 comments from almost 100 individuals and organizations, and the panel used this input to revise the draft report.

One or more individuals and organizational representatives who submitted public comments mentioned almost all of the emerging topics. Of the 11 emerging topics (see list toward the beginning of Section I of this report), biologic agents received the most attention. The first biologic agent for asthma received approval from the US FDA in 2003, but the second biologic agent did not receive approval until November 2015. Between November 2015 and November 2017, four biologic agents received approval, but several others were not shown to be effective in clinical trials. Thus, at the time that the priority topics and key questions were developed, the only biologic agent available for use in the United States was omalizumab, which EPR-3 had addressed. The NHLBAC Asthma Expert Working Group did not believe that this single available biologic agent warranted inclusion in the update and included biologic agents as an emerging topic.

Step diagrams for asthma management — Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group; Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years, Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years, and Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older. Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments, and a lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options. In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy. The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams; instead, these options are listed in Table IF, and the guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient management and the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Treatment of overlapping asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can guidelines contribute in an evidence-free zone? [^c4ebb6bc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

In their most typical forms, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are clearly distinguishable, but many patients with chronic airflow limitation demonstrate features of both conditions and have worse health outcomes than those with either disease alone. This has been called the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS), but as yet, it lacks a precise definition. However, given the different pathways by which a patient can come to demonstrate features of both asthma and COPD, ACOS is not thought to represent a single disease but to include several heterogeneous phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. These issues have important implications for guidelines because some existing treatment recommendations for asthma and COPD are in conflict, and patients with both asthma and COPD have specifically been excluded from major pharmacologic trials. As a result, there is little evidence at present to support specific treatment recommendations for ACOS on the basis of efficacy or effectiveness, yet these patients continue to present for diagnosis and management, mainly in primary care. This article highlights the need for clinical guidance about ACOS, summarizes recommendations about its diagnosis and treatment from a sample of national asthma and COPD guidelines, and proposes a way forward, as suggested in a collaborative Global Initiative for Asthma/Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report, to provide health professionals with interim recommendations about syndromic recognition and initial treatment based on both potential effectiveness and potential risk. Additional research in broad populations is urgently needed to develop a precise definition for ACOS, characterize its phenotypes, and identify opportunities for targeted treatment.

Stepwise approach for managing asthma.

In preparing the step diagrams (Figs 2–4), the Expert Panel used some of the definitions and assumptions from EPR-3. The step diagrams that follow this section retain the EPR-3 recommendations that the Expert Panel did not address in the current report. The Expert Panel encourages readers to review the footnotes in the step diagrams because they offer important information about the use of these diagrams.

The following conventions apply to Figs 2 to 4:
Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group. Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years. Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years. Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older.
Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. For newly diagnosed or treatment-naive individuals, clinicians should first choose the appropriate step diagram for the person's age and then consider both the individual's level of asthma impairment and risk when selecting the initial step and treatment. Within a given step, the preferred options are the best management choices supported by the evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed. When the available evidence is insufficient or does not change a previous recommendation, the step diagrams list preferred options from the EPR-3 step diagrams. Within a given step, an alternative option(s) is management strategies that are less effective or have more limited evidence than the preferred options. Clinicians and patients may choose the alternative treatments if individuals with asthma are currently receiving this therapy and their asthma is under control, if the preferred treatments are not available or too costly, or if the individuals with asthma prefer an alternative treatment. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments. A lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options.
In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy.
The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams. Instead, these options are listed in Table IF.
The guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient managementand the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

### Managing asthma in adolescents and adults: 2020 asthma guideline update from the national asthma education and prevention program [^ce068196]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and economic costs associated with lost productivity. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has released the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update with updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of patients with asthma.

Objective

To report updated recommendations for 6 topics for clinical management of adolescents and adults with asthma: (1) intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs); (2) add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists; (3) fractional exhaled nitric oxide; (4) indoor allergen mitigation; (5) immunotherapy; and (6) bronchial thermoplasty.

Evidence Review

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council chose 6 topics to update the 2007 asthma guidelines based on results from a 2014 needs assessment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted systematic reviews of these 6 topics based on literature searches up to March-April 2017. Reviews were updated through October 2018 and used by an expert panel (n = 19) that included asthma content experts, primary care clinicians, dissemination and implementation experts, and health policy experts to develop 19 new recommendations using the GRADE method. The 17 recommendations for individuals aged 12 years or older are reported in this Special Communication.

Findings

From 20 572 identified references, 475 were included in the 6 systematic reviews to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Compared with the 2007 guideline, there was no recommended change in step 1 (intermittent asthma) therapy (as-needed short-acting β2-agonists [SABAs] for rescue therapy). In step 2 (mild persistent asthma), either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA therapy or as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA therapy are recommended. Formoterol in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler (single maintenance and reliever therapy) is recommended as the preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma in step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) and step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) for both daily and as-needed therapy. A short-term increase in the ICS dose alone for worsening of asthma symptoms is not recommended. Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended in individuals whose asthma is not controlled by ICS-formoterol therapy for step 5 (moderate-severe persistent asthma). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing is recommended to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms, but not alone to diagnose or monitor asthma. Allergen mitigation is recommended only in individuals with exposure and relevant sensitivity or symptoms. When used, allergen mitigation should be allergen specific and include multiple allergen-specific mitigation strategies. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for individuals with symptoms and sensitization to specific allergens. Sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended specifically for asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty is not recommended as part of standard care; if used, it should be part of an ongoing research effort.

Conclusions and Relevance

Asthma is a common disease with substantial human and economic costs globally. Although there is no cure or established means of prevention, effective treatment is available. Use of the recommendations in the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update should improve the health of individuals with asthma.

### SMART-is it practical in the United States? [^cdb0f357]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group advocate for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol combinations as single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) for patients with persistent asthma. We review the rationale, the evidence supporting SMART use in asthma, and barriers limiting its wide adoption in the United States.

Recent Findings

A growing body of evidence supports the use of SMART over the conventional use of controller medicaments with an as-needed short-acting β2 agonist for rescue therapy for the purpose of reducing the risk of asthma exacerbation and maintaining asthma control in adolescents and adults with persistent disease. Lack of US Food and Drug Administration approval, inconsistent insurance coverage, and limited options of ICS-formoterol combination available for use as SMART represent obstacles to wider integration of SMART in clinical practice.

Summary

SMART represents a paradigm shift in asthma management. By identifying and addressing the current and anticipated barriers to implementing SMART, its adoption by providers is likely to increase in the United States.

### Updated guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute… [^43d3adbe]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients 12 years and older with mild, persistent asthma, intermittent low-dose ICS and as-needed inhaled SABAs should be used as rescue therapy instead of daily controller therapy.
- In patients four years and older with moderate to severe asthma, ICS/formoterol therapy should be considered as a daily controller and rescue therapy, a SMART strategy.
- Adding an inhaled LABA to an ICS in uncontrolled asthma is preferred over adding a LAMA because of increased hospitalizations associated with LAMA therapy.
- Subcutaneous immunotherapy can reduce the severity of mild or moderate asthma over time in patients with proven allergies. From the AFP Editors The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute published asthma management guidelines in 1991 and 2007. In 2020, the NHLBI released an update focusing on six priority topics. Intermittent ICS Rescue Therapy Intermittent use of inhaled corticosteroids is an option for mild persistent asthma.

In patients 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, using both an ICS and a short-acting beta-agonist as rescue therapy is equivalent to daily ICS controller therapy with SABA rescue therapy. In children younger than 12 years, the benefit of rescue ICS therapy is uncertain. As-needed ICS therapy is also beneficial in other situations. In children up to four years of age who only experience wheezing with respiratory infections, a seven- to 10-day course of ICS daily at the start of a respiratory infection reduces exacerbations and systemic corticosteroid use. The effects of short-term ICS use on growth are uncertain, but they are likely less than systemic corticosteroids. In patients four years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, a single inhaler can be used as rescue therapy.

In single maintenance and reliever therapy, a combination of an ICS and the long-acting beta-agonist formoterol can be used as a daily controller and a rescue inhaler to a maximum of eight puffs daily for children four to 11 years of age and 12 puffs daily for patients older than 12 years. SMART reduces asthma exacerbations and overall corticosteroid use compared with standard treatment. SMART using other LABA medications has not been studied. Limited Indications for Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists In patients with uncontrolled asthma despite daily ICS therapy, adding a LABA is recommended instead of adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. Although effects on symptoms are similar, adding a LAMA is associated with increased hospitalizations, especially in one study of Black adults. Adding a LAMA to an ICS may be indicated for contraindications to or intolerance of LABA medications.

Adding a LAMA to ICS/LABA therapy does not decrease the frequency of exacerbations or the use of systemic corticosteroids or rescue medications. LAMA medications should be avoided in patients at risk of urinary retention and glaucoma. Immunotherapy Useful Adjunct for Mild to Moderate Asthma Subcutaneous immunotherapy is an option if skin testing or in vitro antigen-specific immunoglobulin E testing suggests that allergen exposure worsens asthma control. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is not recommended for patients with severe asthma because of increased anaphylaxis risk. In patients with mild or moderate asthma, immunotherapy can have a disease-modifying effect, reducing asthma severity over time. Sublingual immunotherapy is approved for allergic rhinitis but not for asthma. Patients with asthma should not administer immunotherapy at home.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-recommendations for severe asthma [^e3d08f85]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of severe asthma, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include selection of a certain biological (as they all target overlapping disease phenotypes), the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based) and its cost-effectiveness. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of biologicals in severe asthma follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each biological and each outcome. In addition, a management algorithm for the use of biologicals in the clinic is proposed, together with future approaches and research priorities.

### Overview of changes to asthma guidelines: diagnosis and screening [^3038af3d]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as "well controlled", "not well controlled", and "very poorly controlled". Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.

Overview of current guidelines

The systematic establishment of a thorough evidence base is currently considered the most rigorous and accurate means to develop clinical practice guidelines. Developing evidence-based consensus guidelines is an enormous undertaking in a field such as asthma, involving a major literature search, consideration of thousands of papers, and time commitment by numerous individuals in the respiratory medical community. Several hierarchies of evidence and grading recommendations have been used by different working groups; those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network are presented in Table 1. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group has recently proposed a system for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was first launched in 1993 as a program to reduce asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. GINA has published evidence-based asthma guidelines since 2002; annual updates are available on the GINA website. These guidelines emphasize the fact that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways and that, while asthma exacerbations are episodic, airway inflammation is chronically present. Exposure to allergens is listed as a common risk factor. The fact that medication must be taken every day by most patients to control symptoms, to improve lung function, and to prevent attacks is noted. Criteria defining the control of asthma are presented in the guidelines (Table 2). Moreover, the guidelines provide criteria for determining asthma severity; and recommendations for pharmacological management of asthma are outlined according to a stepwise approach based on asthma severity.

The Expert Panel achieved consensus when more than 90% of the Expert Panel members voted in favor of a recommendation, and if less than 90% of members voted in favor of a recommendation the topic team continued to revise the recommendation until it achieved consensus approval according to these criteria.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

SECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF LAMAs FOR ASTHMA

Background

LAMAs comprise a pharmacologic class of long-acting bronchodilators. The role of LAMAs in the management of asthma was not addressed in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. Since that report's publication in 2007, several trials have investigated LAMAs as controller therapy for individuals with asthma.

The Expert Panel examined the harms and benefits of LAMAs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma and addressed three key questions. The Expert Panel did not examine the role of LAMA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years because the key questions and systematic reviews did not address this age group. With the exception of one study that examined the LAMA umeclidinium, the RCTs reviewed by the Expert Panel used tiotropium bromide as the LAMA. At the time this report was written, tiotropium bromide (Respimat) was the only formulation of LAMA with US FDA approval for asthma treatment. The majority of LAMA studies used a comparative efficacy design, and not an effectiveness design, but the key questions were about effectiveness. Therefore, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood. Table V provides an overview of the key questions and recommendations on LAMAs.

Definitions of terms used in this section

In this section, "controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The term "ICS-LABA" indicates therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually (and preferably) in a single inhaler.

Question 5.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA compared with other controller therapy as add-on therapy to ICSs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Question 5.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy to ICS controller therapy compared with placebo or increased ICS dose in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Recommendation 14: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against adding LAMA to ICS compared to adding LABA to ICS.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

Recommendation 15: If LABA is not used, in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS controller therapy compared to continuing the same dose of ICS alone.

### Asthma management guidelines: focused updates for 2020… [^0c68849e]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2020 Focused Updates to the asthma management guidelines represent the first revision of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines in more than 10 years. 1 The report differs from the Global Initiative for Asthma recommendations because of the focused number of issues addressed and the nature of the evidence review.
2. Whereas the GINA guidelines are an ongoing series of revisions on a broad range of asthma topics, the 2020 Focused Updates targeted six key areas of asthma care for which there was strong interest and sufficient evidence to influence patient care. In addition, it used Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality systematic reviews and the rigorous GRADE methodology to assess study design and relevance of the current evidence. 3 Other strengths include attention to the perspective of primary care and participation by primary care representatives in leadership roles on the panel.

Inhaled Corticosteroids INTERMITTENT ASTHMA GINA recommends treating patients with mild intermittent asthma with as-needed inhaled corticosteroids with short-acting beta. 2 agonists for children six to 11 years of age and as-needed ICS/formoterol in adults. 4 However, the Focused Updates panel did not address this topic and carried forward its previous recommendation for as-needed SABA use. The panel identified limitations in the literature describing the risks of albuterol but chose to emphasize the importance of patient education with SABA use instead of discouraging its use. Switching rescue therapy from a SABA to ICS/formoterol for intermittent asthma would also incur a significant additional cost. PERSISTENT ASTHMA For patients with mild persistent asthma, the Focused Updates recommend either of the following: daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS with SABA for worsening asthma.

For mild to moderate persistent asthma, single maintenance and reliever therapy is preferred. This approach reduces the potential adverse effects of chronic steroid use, lowers emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and simplifies patients' medication regimens. 1 For patients four years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, SMART with ICS/formoterol, used daily and as needed, is preferred. For patients 12 years or older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, a single ICS/formoterol inhaler, used daily and as needed, is conditionally preferred. 5 GINA recommends daily moderate-dose ICS or ICS/long-acting beta 2 agonist with as-needed ICS/formoterol as equivalent options; however, the Focused Updates panel found the evidence for ICS/formoterol daily and as-needed to be more compelling. SMART carries several caveats. Budesonide/formoterol is not approved by the U. S.

Food and Drug Administration for use as a quick relief agent. The device most studied was the dry-powder Symbicort Turbohaler; however, in the United States, only the metered-dose device is available. Studies suggest that salmeterol is less effective, and it is not recommended as an alternative to formoterol. As of September 30, 2021, studies of as-needed use of vilanterol or mometasone/formoterol have not been published. ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS The use of ICS for acute asthma without the concomitant use of oral steroids was previously discouraged. However, for patients from birth to four years of age with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections only and no wheezing between infections, the Focused Updates now conditionally recommend a short course of ICS at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection with an inhaled SABA as needed.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^844dbdf1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to improve asthma awareness, prevention and management worldwide. GINA develops and publishes evidence-based, annually updated resources for clinicians. GINA guidance is adopted by national asthma guidelines in many countries, adapted to fit local healthcare systems, practices, and resource availability. GINA is independent of industry, funded by the sale and licensing of its materials. This review summarizes key practical guidance for primary care from the 2022 GINA strategy report. It provides guidance on confirming the diagnosis of asthma using spirometry or peak expiratory flow. GINA recommends that all adults, adolescents and most children with asthma should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing therapy to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations, either taken regularly, or (for adults and adolescents with "mild" asthma) as combination ICS-formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief. For patients with moderate-severe asthma, the preferred regimen is maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS-formoterol. Asthma treatment is not "one size fits all"; GINA recommends individualized assessment, adjustment, and review of treatment. As many patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma are not referred early for specialist review, we provide updated guidance for primary care on diagnosis, further investigation, optimization and treatment of severe asthma across secondary and tertiary care. While the GINA strategy has global relevance, we recognize that there are special considerations for its adoption in low- and middle-income countries, particularly the current poor access to inhaled medications.

How Does the NAEPP 2020 Asthma Guideline Update Compare with Recommendations by the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma?

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the NHLBI to promote a coordinated worldwide effort in asthma prevention and management. Although the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention 2020 Update (GINA 2020 report) is not a guideline, many readers of the NAEPP update are likely to ask whether the recommendations in the two documents are similar or different. The answer is yes and yes. For example, note the similarities and differences in pharmacologic step therapy recommendations for individuals age 12 years or older (Table 1).

Table 1.
Preferred Controller and Reliever Pharmacotherapy Recommendations for Individuals ≥ 12 Years with Asthma in the NAEPP 2020 Guideline Update and GINA 2020 Report

We believe the differences are largely the result of different objectives, methods used to review evidence, and definitions. The GINA report is intended to inform a comprehensive global strategy for various aspects of diagnosis and management of mild to severe asthma, including in low- and middle-income countries. The NAEPP update offers recommendations for six priority topics. GINA updates its report annually based on a twice-yearly review of the recently published literature by asthma clinicians and researchers from diverse geographic regions in the world. The GINA report is not a guideline, so it does not adhere to methodologies recommended for guidelines. GINA advises healthcare professionals "to use their own professional judgement, and to take into account local and national regulations and guidelines".

The GINA report includes five levels of progressive treatment intensification ("steps"), with step 1 therapy reserved for individuals with symptoms less than 2 times/mo. The NAEPP 2020 guideline update "pulled-through" the six-step pharmacotherapy framework used in the NAEPP 2007 asthma guidelines but only made changes to some of the pharmacotherapy recommendations in the six steps in each age group. For example, in individuals 12 years or older, the Expert Panel's pharmacotherapy recommendations for the preferred controller only address steps 2–5 (Table 1). The NAEPP 2007 asthma guideline pharmacotherapy recommendations for step 1, reserved for "intermittent asthma", was not reviewed by the Expert Panel for 2020 update. GINA does not include the construct of intermittent asthma because all patients with asthma are at risk for severe exacerbations.

### It is time to change the way we manage mild asthma: an update in GINA 2019 [^9a844ae2]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The new GINA 2019 report highlights significant updates in mild asthma management and these recommendations represent a clear deviation from decades of clinical practice mandating the use of symptom-driven SABA treatment alone in those with mild asthma. While the new inclusions of strategies such as symptom-driven (as-needed) ICS-formoterol and "ICS taken whenever SABA is taken" are based on several key trials, data in this context are still only emergent data, with clear superiority of as needed ICS-formoterol combinations over maintenance ICS regimens yet to be established for valid endpoints. There also remain several issues relating to implementations of these strategies globally and their long-term effects in mild asthma patients. Further discussions are needed on this matter. It also remains to be observed if other guidelines such as (such as the British Thoracic Society and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) share the same vision with GINA in their updates/revisions. Nevertheless, current and emerging data position the clinical asthma realm at a watershed moment with imminent changes for the way we manage mild asthma likely in going forward.

### National asthma education and prevention program 2020 guideline update: where Do we Go from here? [^b410abaa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) oversaw the development of national asthma guidelines nearly 30 years ago. Since that time, there have been two major revisions (1997 and 2007) and one interim update (2002). In December 2020, the 2020 Focused Update to the Asthma Management Guidelines was released — the first update to the guidelines in 13 years.

The NAEPP 2020 update adheres to standards for trustworthy guidelines promulgated by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, including a systematic review of the evidence that addresses specific questions, a multidisciplinary panel of experts and representatives of key affected groups, consideration of important patient subgroups and preferences, an explicit and transparent process to minimize bias and conflicts of interest, and ratings of both the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. An Expert Panel coordinated by the NHLBI of the NIH was first convened in July 2018 to examine six priority topics that were selected after an extensive needs assessment. The six topics included intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), add-on inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists, bronchial thermoplasty, indoor allergen mitigation strategies, immunotherapy, and use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide. No other aspects of asthma management in the NAEPP 2007 asthma guidelines were considered by the Expert Panel.

Limitations and research gaps — The Expert Panel noted that a better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates, that the process would benefit from a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine, and that research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes and the cutoffs for tests, and updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes; the definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated. Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized, and standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies. The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, and applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs; such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations. Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma, and the GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes; however, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. All measures and outcomes relevant to making recommendations need to be included in the systematic reviews, and although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data; moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

Asthma guideline focused update — scope and features: The update is limited in scope and excludes biologic agents because including them "would have delayed the release of these recommendations for another 1 to 2 years", and "This update also is not a complete revision of EPR-3", with some areas "not covered". Reasons for these limits included "lack of time, lack of resources, and, for some topics, insufficient new evidence". To aid use, "the addition of an Implementation Guidance section for each recommendation" was made, and "Amended step diagrams for asthma management are also provided for the topics being updated".

### Getting control of uncontrolled asthma [^5901d52f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite various treatment modalities, a large proportion of patients have asthma that remains uncontrolled. These patients remain at an increased risk of developing severe exacerbations, have a poor quality of life, and pose a high economic healthcare burden, with an estimated mean annual cost more than double that of patients with good symptom control. It is therefore important to accurately diagnose asthma and continually assess asthma control. Several validated tools are available to do this, including questionnaires, biomarker analysis, and bronchoscopy. Current guidelines advise physicians to establish a self-management program for the patient to assess and monitor asthma control. A further recommendation is the establishment of an educational action plan to increase treatment adherence and to improve asthma control. National and international guidelines provide long-term management strategies for these patients and recommend a stepwise approach for achieving and maintaining asthma control. Despite availability of a wide range of controller and reliever therapies, uncontrolled asthma remains a challenge and reflects the need for new therapeutic options. This review discusses current global guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma control and summarizes the broad spectrum of novel therapeutic agents currently under development for the treatment of asthma, including anticholinergics, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecules expressed on T-helper 2 lymphocyte antagonists, and anti-interleukin (IL)-5, anti-IL-13, and anti-IL-4 agents.

### Treating asthma: is there a place for leukotriene receptor antagonists? [^046b5070]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disorder, characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway inflammation and airway remodelling. Evidence has been provided for a relationship between pathophysiology, airway inflammation and remodelling. Moreover, these asthma features have been shown to respond to anti-inflammatory therapy. According to current guidelines, monitoring of asthma is predominantly based on symptoms and lung function data. However, these parameters appeared as poor indices for asthma control. Alternatively, asthma control relates well to exacerbations and (anamnestic) surrogate biomarkers of airway inflammation. Hence, appropriate treatment of asthma should primarily target the airway inflammation. According to current guidelines for asthma management, anti-inflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is the cornerstone in the treatment of persistent asthma. To further optimize asthma control, add-on therapy with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) should be combined with low to high doses of ICS. While the first combination focuses on optimal control of symptoms and lung function, the second provides a more complete suppression of the airway inflammation. In this paper we discuss treatment of asthma according to current guidelines versus new insights, addressing practical issues.

### A review of the burden and management of mild asthma in adults-implications for clinical practice [^af643f8b]. Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Mild asthma is present in 50–75% of patients with asthma and is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as asthma that can be well controlled with low-intensity treatments (Steps 1 and 2). Despite this definition, 'mild' asthma is often not well controlled in reality, and can have a significant impact on an individual's symptom burden and quality of life. We performed a PubMed literature search to investigate the burden of 'mild' asthma in the lives of patients, including future risk and asthma control, and the current management strategies. While clinical guidelines recommend long-term, daily, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for 'mild' asthma, published data suggest that ICS are often under-prescribed or used intermittently as symptoms arise. Furthermore, patients and physicians tend to overestimate disease control, impacting the accuracy of diagnosing 'mild asthma' and subsequent management. This disconnect may be amplified by miscommunication between patients and physicians, limited objective assessment of control, and differences in guidelines. As with moderate and severe asthma, current evidence supports early initiation of regular ICS in 'mild' asthma to address the underlying inflammation, achieve symptom control and reduce risk of exacerbations. Adherence to ICS treatment is key and can be improved by educating both patients and healthcare professionals. The results of this literature search challenge the term 'mild' asthma and suggest strategies to improve the proactive management of the disease to enable patients to live symptom-free.

### Chinese guidelines for childhood asthma 2016: major updates, recommendations and key regional data [^35f4982a]. The Journal of Asthma (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

With increased industrialization and urbanization in China, pediatric asthma is becoming more prevalent. Despite a growing body of evidence, there remains a significant unmet need for adequate management of childhood asthma. The Subspecialty Group of Respiratory Diseases of the Society of Pediatrics, the Chinese Medical Association, and the editorial board of the Chinese Journal of Pediatrics have recently updated the "Guidelines for diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children", first published in 2008.

Methods

This article reviews the major updates to the guidelines and covers the main recommendations for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of pediatric asthma in China. Key regional data on epidemiology, clinical features, disease burden, knowledge among children and parents, and risk factors including pollution are provided to contextualize the recommendations.

Results

The major updates to the guidelines include: (1) A more practical definition of asthma; (2) assessment of asthma control that takes into account both current symptom control and future risk; (3) classification based on disease severity that corresponds with treatment step; (4) differentiation between difficult-to-treat and poorly controlled asthma; (5) an open-ended approach to pharmacological management; and (6) allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in mild- to moderate-persistent asthma.

Conclusions

The updated "Guidelines for the diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children (2016)" combine the latest national and international clinical evidence and experience to provide practical and reliable recommendations to Chinese clinicians.

### Advances in the pathogenesis and personalised treatment of paediatric asthma [^091c23d2]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines

Table 3 lists key recommendations from three international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children. Overall, they are similar in their recommendations for the use of objectives measurements to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. The guidelines, however, differ in the age brackets used to classify management recommendations, which slightly limits comparisons. A key fundamental difference is that the recent GINA guideline does not recommend the use of SABA alone for the management of asthma in children and adolescents aged 6 years and above. For mild asthma (step 1 treatment), GINA advise using a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler as needed. In children aged 6–11 years, owing to device limitations, SABA as needed via a metered dose inhaler plus a dose of ICS at the same time is recommended as step 1 treatment. GINA further recommend that a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler is used as a reliever for children aged 12 years and over. The GINA recommendations are a major change to the management of mild asthma and reliever treatment in asthma.

Update on strategies to manage the elderly patient with asthma — guideline context and nonpharmacologic care: Current evidence-based guidelines for asthma are derived from studies on younger individuals, as older patients are frequently excluded from clinical trials, and only a few reports have addressed the management of the elderly population with asthma. It is widely accepted that asthma is often undertreated in older patients. The appropriate management of any chronic disease in the elderly, including asthma, should include multidimensional assessment (MDA) of physical, psychological, cognitive, and social factors that may impact successful treatment. Nonpharmacological management strategies emphasize that optimal asthma management for all patients incorporates avoidance of known asthma triggers.

### Traditional therapies for severe asthma [^f9fab3e0]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is a complex and heterogeneous disease. The European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society guidelines define severe asthma for patients 6 years or older as "asthma which requires treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids… plus a second controller or systemic corticosteroids to prevent it from becoming 'uncontrolled' or which remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy". This article reviews available traditional therapies, data behind their uses in severe asthma, and varying recommendations. As various asthma endotypes and phenotypes are better understood and characterized, targeted therapies should help improve disease outcomes, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.

### Asthma update [^4c03a984]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^ceefbf45]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Moving forward, the process of guideline development needs to be more agile. Creating an ongoing process for developing recommendations that includes individuals with varied expertise and from multiple organizations may facilitate this process. In addition, the structure of the recommendations may need to change. The step diagrams, although useful, are a one-size-fits-all approach. The current recommendations use a patient-centered approach that is critical but not sufficient. In the emerging era of personalized medicine, tailored interventions and treatments customized to particular individuals with specific characteristics will be needed. Discussions about how to address individualized approaches to asthma care and how to incorporate these approaches into the standard of care are needed now so that future recommendations can integrate these new approaches.

Finally, I thank the members of the Expert Panel who voluntarily gave their time and expertise to complete this work. The amount of work that was needed in a compressed period of time from each member was very high. To them, to Drs Kiley and Mensah, whose support was unwavering, and to the NHLBI and Westat staff, thank you.

Intermittent ICS use — background, scope, and key questions: Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages, and although intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, prior evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond expert consensus; in this update, given the range of options and the number of comparisons embedded in the three key questions for this priority topic, the Expert Panel made five recommendations, with most studies using comparative efficacy designs and with evidence insufficient to support recommendations for all of the comparators; additionally, the Expert Panel did not address the efficacy and safety of types of intermittent ICS treatment not mentioned in the key questions, specifically as-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA in Step 1 (intermittent asthma) or Steps 5 and 6 (severe asthma) treatment.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^9d71287b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — Implementation guidance (therapy choice when ICS alone is insufficient): In individuals with asthma that is not controlled by inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy alone, the Expert Panel recommends adding a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) rather than a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) to an ICS; if the individual is not using or cannot use LABA therapy, adding a LAMA to ICS is an acceptable alternative, and adding a LAMA to ICS controller therapy is more effective than using ICS controller therapy alone in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma. The panel notes that adding a LAMA to ICS controller therapy is not more efficacious than adding a LABA to ICS controller therapy and may increase the risk of harm, based on a single real-world study in Blacks, and therefore recommends preferentially adding LABA over LAMA to ICS; a LABA should not be used when it is not tolerated, is contraindicated, the device is unsuitable, or LABA is unavailable for insurance or supply reasons.

### Remission in asthma [^7abf8b0d]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current concepts of remission in asthma.

Recent Findings

Until 2023, asthma guidelines have been promoting the concept of disease control, recommending the step-wise addition of drugs until the best possible disease control is achieved. With the advent of highly effective, anti-inflammatory disease-modifying antiasthmatic drugs (DMAADs), treatment goals of asthma have changed. Several national guidelines have now announced remission as a general treatment goal in asthma. Currently, all guidelines agree that asthma remission is defined by the presence of at least three characteristics over a period of at least one 1year: absence of exacerbations, no systemic corticosteroid use for the treatment of asthma and minimal asthma-related symptoms. In the future, a generally accepted, evidence-based and easy-to-use definition of remission will be needed for daily clinical practice. It is clear, however, that precise phenotyping (including measurement of biomarkers) is an essential prerequisite to achieve clinical remission in each individual patient.

Summary

Remission has been included as the treatment goal in asthma in several national guidelines, reflecting the paradigm shift in asthma, from short-term symptom control to long-term symptom prevention. An international consensus on the criteria for asthma remission is expected in the near future.

### Real-world treatment trajectories of adults with newly diagnosed asthma or COPD [^d43fff07]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prevalent chronic respiratory conditions with a large global health burden (21.6 and 74.4 million disability-adjusted life-years, respectively). Both diseases have a negative impact on all aspects of life when not properly controlled and are responsible for (preventable) deaths, often as a result of acute exacerbations. Treatment is mainly organised via primary care and is aimed to minimise symptoms and prevent acute exacerbations. To support clinicians in the management of patients with asthma or COPD, several national and international guidelines have been developed which are frequently updated based on the latest research and insights. These guidelines suggest a stepwise treatment approach where treatment is initiated and tailored on the needs (ie, symptoms, severity, disease control and future risk) of the individual patient.

There is a lack of global knowledge on how patients with asthma or COPD are treated in the real world, especially with regard to the initial pharmacological treatment of newly diagnosed patients and the different treatment trajectories (encompassing both treatment step-up and treatment step-down strategies). Therefore, the purpose of this global characterisation study was to shed light on real-world treatment trajectories of newly diagnosed adults with asthma and COPD across different countries and continents. This descriptive study provides high-level insight into real-world treatment practices and helps to generate hypotheses for follow-up studies to address current gaps in clinical practice.

VA/DOD primary care asthma clinical practice guideline (CPG) — scope, population, methods, and aims: This CPG provides an evidence-based framework for evaluating and managing care for children aged five years and older, and adults who have asthma treated in a VA/DOD ambulatory care setting. Successful implementation of this CPG will assess the patient's condition and determine, in collaboration with the patient, the best treatment method, optimize human health outcomes and improve quality of life, minimize preventable complications and morbidity, and emphasize the use of Patient-Centered Care (PCC) or Family-Centered Care (FCC), especially when caring for children. It notes that in 2019 the VA and DOD published a CPG based on evidence reviewed through July 2018, that a recommendation to update was initiated in 2024, and that this updated CPG's use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach reflects a more rigorous application of the methodology than previous iterations.

### GINA guidelines on asthma and beyond [^f744c88d]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help practitioners and patients make decisions regarding the appropriate health care for specific circumstances. Guidelines are based on the scientific evidence on therapeutic interventions. The first asthma guidelines were published in the mid 1980s when asthma became a recognized public health problem in many countries. The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) was launched in 1995 as a collaborative effort between the NHLBI and the World Health Organization (WHO). The first edition was opinion-based but updates were evidence-based. A new update of the GINA guidelines was recently available and it is based on the control of the disease. Asthma guidelines are prepared to stimulate the implementation of practical guidelines in order to reduce the global burden of asthma. Although asthma guidelines may not be perfect, they appear to be the best vehicle available to assist primary care physicians and patients to receive the best possible care of asthma.

### Asthma control or severity: that is the question [^01498a27]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

In the first National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the level of symptoms and airflow limitation and its variability allowed asthma to be subdivided by severity into four subcategories (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent). It is important to recognize, however, that asthma severity involves both the severity of the underlying disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be. Because of these considerations, the classification of asthma severity is no longer recommended as the basis for treatment decisions, a periodic assessment of asthma control being more relevant and useful.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^0160bf3b]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects more than a quarter of a billion people worldwide, is the most common chronic condition in childhood, and is responsible for over 1000 deaths a day, of which the majority are preventable –.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established by the World Health Organization and the US National Heart Lung and Blood institute in 1993 to improve asthma awareness, prevention, and management worldwide. GINA is independent of industry, funded by the sale and licensing of its evidence-based, annually updated reports and figures. The GINA methodology is published on its website.

The GINA report is a global evidence-based strategy that can be adapted for local health systems and local medicine availability. Many countries have their own national asthma guidelines, with many of these based on GINA. However, most national guidelines are updated only infrequently, so they may not reflect current best evidence. In recent years, some countries have conducted partial updates of their asthma guidelines, by undertaking a detailed review of evidence for a limited number of clinical questions, but this process often takes several years. By contrast, the GINA strategy is updated every year based on a twice-yearly cumulative review of new evidence. Hence, even when national asthma guidelines are available, the GINA report may provide a useful resource for clinicians (both primary care and specialists) to be aware of the most recent evidence, and to understand how it can be integrated into holistic asthma care. However, when assessing and treating patients, health professionals are strongly advised to use their own professional judgment, and to take into account local and national regulations and guidelines, and the needs of the individual patient.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^ac67696c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β 2 -agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^ca8736ee]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Seventeen topics were suggested initially for updating, and six topics were found to have sufficient new information to warrant an update. Key questions were drafted by the Advisory Council and used by AHRQ Evidence-Based Practice Centers (EPCs) to conduct systematic reviews that were published between October 2017 and March 2018. – The Expert Panel was then assembled in July 2018 and charged with using these systematic reviews to develop recommendations on these six previously chosen topics.

The Expert Panel updated the literature for the systematic reviews through October 2018 and then developed its recommendations. These recommendations differ from other guidelines in several important ways:
The key questions were developed a priori and not after a review of the current literature.
The Expert Panel was composed of diverse individuals not only from the asthma specialty community (adult and pediatric pulmonary and allergy specialists) but also from the general medical community (pediatric, internal medicine, family medicine, and emergency medicine providers). Expert Panel members also included health policy and dissemination and implementation experts, and the panel received input from patients and families.
The Expert Panel members abided by strict standards for conflicts of interest (COIs) developed by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)and in the spirit of the more recently released recommendations from the American College of Physicians (ACP). Individuals with any conflict of interest related to the updated topics recused themselves from discussions of those topics.
This was the first time that the NAEPP used the GRADE methodology (discussed later) to provide transparency in the decision-making process.
Lastly, but not insignificantly, the Expert Panel sought comments from external groups and individuals, including from the NAEPP Coordinating Committee (whose members represent a diverse group of stakeholders), the public, and federal agencies. Although the panel that developed the Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3) also sought external input, this approach has rarely been used by other asthma guideline committees. The Expert Panel considered this input when it developed the final recommendations and this document.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^29a711b8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the preferred Step 4 therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. The recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA along with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control. However, individuals whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up their treatment to a higher step of therapy.

In individuals aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, combination ICS-formoterol used daily and intermittently is more beneficial than an increase in the daily ICS dose if they are already taking combination ICS-LABA (and as needed SABA). The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol for individuals aged 12 years and older:
This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older.
Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily (depending on asthma severity and ICS dose in the ICS-formoterol preparation). The additional rescue dose is 1 to 2 puffs as needed for asthma symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
Clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy.
This therapy is appropriate for Step 4.
Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
For individuals aged 5 to 11 years, the evidence was insufficient to make a recommendation regarding SMART compared to higher-dose ICS-LABA. SMART with low- or medium-dose ICS therapy is preferred for children aged 5 to 11 years as opposed to same-, low-, or medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA as part of Step 3 and Step 4 therapy (Recommendation 12).
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that the major demonstrated benefits of combination ICS-formoterol used daily and as needed are reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits and in use of systemic corticosteroids. Clinicians should also inform individuals with asthma that studies found no difference in documented harms between this type of therapy and daily ICS-LABA. Studies showed that combination ICS-formoterol reduces exposure to corticosteroids, suggesting that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.
