## Question

Are proton pump inhibitors safe to use during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are safe to use during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about regulatory labeling from the FDA and what it says across specific PPIs. Then, I should review high-quality epidemiologic data on major malformations and miscarriage. Next, I will assess maternal and neonatal outcomes like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and fetal growth. After that, I should confirm what major guidelines recommend. Finally, I will weigh risks versus benefits, consider agent selection and drug–drug interaction profiles, and conclude with a practical prescribing approach and safety statement.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that often anchors risk communication in pregnancy counseling. The FDA labels for pantoprazole and lansoprazole state that available observational data do not demonstrate an association between PPI exposure and adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, while cautioning that observational designs cannot definitively prove absence of risk, which is a critical limitation I need to keep in mind [^111tdzyi] [^115eHfoY] [^116tzjpY] [^117LNZBR] [^116r8GgE]. Esomeprazole is categorized as Pregnancy Category C on older labeling, but epidemiologic data similarly do not show an increased risk of major congenital malformations with first-trimester use, and the animal bone findings occur at high multiples of human exposure, which I should contextualize for patients [^116negZi].

> Wait, let me verify the core fetal safety outcomes for malformations and miscarriage in broader datasets. A large meta-analysis including 1,530 PPI-exposed pregnancies versus 133,410 unexposed found no significant increase in major congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion, which supports the FDA summaries but still reflects observational design constraints [^112sVzxb]. The Danish nationwide cohort in NEJM initially reported a modest elevation in malformations when exposure windows included the preconception period, but this attenuated and became non-significant when limited to first-trimester exposure, suggesting confounding by indication or timing rather than a teratogenic signal, which I need to emphasize when interpreting effect estimates [^114gqkba]. More recent population data generally align with a lack of teratogenicity signal, consistent with the pantoprazole and lansoprazole labels, which again reinforces the absence of a class-wide congenital anomaly effect in human observational cohorts [^111tdzyi] [^117LNZBR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about maternal and neonatal outcomes beyond malformations, because several large cohorts have reported associations with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age infants. The Swedish nationwide cohort reported higher odds of preeclampsia, GDM, preterm birth, and SGA with PPI use, with some apparent dose–response patterns by prescription count, but confounding by underlying disease severity, nutrition, and healthcare use remains a major limitation that could inflate associations, so causality cannot be inferred from these data alone [^115FwrPf] [^11734saC]. Sensitivity analyses across trimesters in related reports show variability that further suggests residual confounding and exposure misclassification, so I should be cautious not to ascribe a causal effect in counseling or decision-making [^11338uUB] [^113sFaSM].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations to see how experts integrate these data. The 2013 American College of Gastroenterology GERD guideline states that PPIs are safe for use in pregnancy when clinically indicated, which supports continuing or initiating PPIs for appropriate indications rather than withholding therapy due to theoretical risks [^115Skcza]. The 2024 RCOG guidance for pregnancy-related care explicitly recommends offering PPIs to manage reflux effectively in pregnancy, aligning obstetric and gastroenterology guidance around appropriate symptom control and complications prevention [^115gcD9K]. I should also confirm that modern AGA deprescribing guidance focuses on ensuring a valid indication rather than stopping therapy out of concern for putative adverse events, which helps frame discussions about stepping down therapy only when indications resolve and not simply because of pregnancy status [^115VgCy6] [^116mRu8j] [^111niNyf].

> I will now examine the overall risk–benefit balance, because symptom burden and complications matter in pregnancy. GERD is extremely common in pregnancy and can substantially impair quality of life; conservative measures and H2RAs are reasonable first steps, but many patients will require PPIs for adequate control and for complications such as erosive esophagitis, so I need to ensure we do not undertreat based on misperceptions of risk [^115aPZyE]. For step-up therapy, antacids and H2RAs have reassuring safety profiles, and if these are insufficient, PPIs should be used at the lowest effective dose with routine obstetric care and no special fetal surveillance required beyond standard prenatal anatomy screening, consistent with guideline and labeling statements [^115BD3aH] [^115Skcza] [^111tdzyi].

> Let me consider agent selection and drug–drug interactions, since pregnancy often involves other medications. Pantoprazole and rabeprazole have lower CYP-mediated interaction potential compared with omeprazole and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole, so choosing pantoprazole or lansoprazole is a reasonable strategy to minimize DDI risk when clinically feasible, while remembering that overall the class is well tolerated at standard doses in pregnancy [^1161VuS7] [^111tdzyi] [^117LNZBR]. If esomeprazole is already effective and necessary, I should confirm that Category C labeling does not equate to contraindication and that epidemiology has not shown a malformation signal with first-trimester exposure, thus avoiding unnecessary switches that could destabilize symptom control without improving safety [^116negZi].

> But wait, what about long-term child outcomes like infections and allergy, which some patients ask about. Large pediatric cohorts show an association between PPI use in children and serious infections, but those analyses reflect postnatal exposure in the child rather than maternal prenatal use, so I should not extrapolate those risks to in utero PPI exposure without evidence, and current labeling does not cite these as established prenatal risks [^11552xqH] [^111tdzyi]. Observational studies examining prenatal or early-life acid suppression and allergic diseases try to control for confounding, but residual confounding and within-family factors remain challenging; no causal link has been established, and these signals should not drive deprescribing when there is a clear maternal indication during pregnancy [^115AgyUi].

> I need to ensure I synthesize certainty across outcomes transparently. The evidence is consistent that PPIs are not teratogens in humans, supported by FDA labeling and multiple large observational datasets, although observational limitations persist, which I should acknowledge explicitly [^111tdzyi] [^112sVzxb]. Associations with preeclampsia, GDM, preterm birth, and SGA are possible but likely confounded and not sufficient to change guideline-supported care when a PPI is indicated, which I should communicate as hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^115FwrPf]. Overall, it is reasonable and evidence-aligned to treat clinically significant GERD or acid-mediated conditions in pregnancy with PPIs when needed, using the lowest effective dose and reassessing the indication periodically, consistent with ACG and RCOG guidance [^115Skcza] [^115gcD9K].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "Category C" for esomeprazole meant it should be avoided in pregnancy, but hold on, I should verify what that really implies. Category C reflects limited controlled human data and some animal signals at supra-therapeutic exposures; epidemiologic studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of major congenital malformations with first-trimester esomeprazole, so Category C does not equal contraindication, and clinical decisions should be based on indication and response rather than the legacy category label alone [^116negZi].

> Putting this together into a practical recommendation, I would start with lifestyle changes and antacids, consider H2RAs if symptoms persist, and initiate a PPI for moderate to severe or refractory symptoms, esophagitis, or other acid-mediated indications, favoring pantoprazole or lansoprazole to limit DDI concerns, and using standard pregnancy-compatible doses with routine prenatal care and no special fetal monitoring beyond usual anatomy ultrasound, while avoiding unnecessary discontinuation if symptoms or complications recur off therapy [^115Skcza] [^115BD3aH] [^111tdzyi] [^117LNZBR]. I should confirm periodically whether a continued indication exists and step down when appropriate, but not because of unproven observational associations alone, which aligns with contemporary deprescribing guidance [^115VgCy6] [^116mRu8j].

> Final safety statement, after reviewing labels, cohorts, meta-analyses, and guidelines: Current evidence does not demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage with PPI use in pregnancy, and guideline bodies support PPI treatment when clinically indicated; observed associations with maternal and some neonatal outcomes likely reflect confounding and should not lead to withholding necessary therapy, provided we use the lowest effective dose and reassess the indication over time [^111tdzyi] [^112sVzxb] [^114gqkba] [^115Skcza] [^115gcD9K].

Overall, **PPIs are considered safe for pregnant patients when clinically indicated**, with no significant increase in major congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion [^112sVzxb] [^114gqkba]. Pantoprazole and lansoprazole have the most reassuring human data and **are preferred**; omeprazole is also acceptable if needed [^111tdzyi] [^116JWBPZ] [^114gqkba]. Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, and avoid self-medication or OTC use without medical supervision [^114t5fhj] [^115fiyKc].

## Safety of PPIs during pregnancy

### Congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion

A meta-analysis of 134,940 patients (1,530 exposed, 133,410 unexposed) found **no significant increase in major malformations** (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86–1.45) or spontaneous abortion (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84–1.97) with PPI exposure [^112sVzxb]. Pantoprazole and lansoprazole likewise have reassuring human data, with no significant associations with major malformations or spontaneous abortion [^111tdzyi] [^116JWBPZ].

---

### Maternal and neonatal outcomes

Observational data on maternal and neonatal outcomes suggest small increases in pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age infants with PPI use, which may reflect confounding by indication and comorbidities [^115FwrPf] [^111sbMpP]. However, **no significant association with low Apgar scores or major neonatal complications** has been demonstrated.

---

### Long-term outcomes

Limited evidence suggests **no significant long-term adverse outcomes** in children exposed to PPIs in utero, though further research is needed.

---

## Recommended PPIs for pregnant patients

| **PPI** | **Pregnancy safety data** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Pantoprazole | - Extensive human data <br/> - No significant increase in malformations or adverse outcomes [^111tdzyi] | Preferred |
| Lansoprazole | - Extensive human data <br/> - No significant increase in malformations or adverse outcomes [^116JWBPZ] | Preferred |
| Omeprazole | - Acceptable <br/> - Some data suggest slight increase in malformations <br/> - But overall risk is low [^112sVzxb] [^114gqkba] | Acceptable if needed |
| Esomeprazole | - Limited data <br/> - Use if benefits outweigh risks [^116negZi] | Use with caution |
| Rabeprazole | - Limited data <br/> - Use if benefits outweigh risks | Use with caution |

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) **endorse PPIs for GERD in pregnancy when clinically indicated** [^115Skcza] [^115gcD9K] [^1179NnSm]. They also advise using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and avoiding self-medication or OTC use without supervision [^114t5fhj] [^115VgCy6].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

PPIs are generally well tolerated; potential risks include **hypomagnesemia**, **vitamin B12 deficiency**, and an increased risk of **enteric infections** with long-term use [^112QZmP1] [^113uXtVA] [^114yiYrC]. Notably, no significant increase in major congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion has been demonstrated [^112sVzxb] [^114gqkba].

---

## Alternative treatments

Lifestyle and dietary modifications are **first-line** for mild GERD in pregnancy [^113JmXa8]. Antacids (calcium or magnesium) and H2 receptor antagonists (famotidine) are also safe alternatives [^113NAsgh] [^115BD3aH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly reassess the need for continued **PPI therapy** and document the indication [^114t5fhj] [^115VgCy6]. Also monitor for adverse effects, including hypomagnesemia and vitamin B12 deficiency, with prolonged use [^112QZmP1].

---

PPIs are safe for pregnant patients when indicated, with **pantoprazole and lansoprazole preferred**. Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, and avoid unsupervised use [^115Skcza] [^111tdzyi] [^116JWBPZ] [^114t5fhj] [^115fiyKc].

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) = 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08–3.95].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR = 1.12 [95% CI 0.86–1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### The safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in pregnancy: A meta-analysis [^112sVzxb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Heartburn and acid reflux are common medical disorders in pregnancy and can result in serious discomfort and complications. Furthermore, some pregnant women also experience more severe gastrointestinal conditions, such as Helicobacter pylori infections, peptic ulcers, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. To allow the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in pregnancy, the fetal safety of this drug class must be established. The aim of this study is to determine the fetal safety of PPIs during early pregnancy through a systematic literature review.

- **Methods**: All original research assessing the safety of PPIs in pregnancy was sought from inception to July 2008. Two independent reviewers identified articles, compared results, and settled differences through consensus. The Downs-Black scale was used to assess quality. Data assessed included congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and preterm delivery. A random effects meta-analysis combined the results from included studies.

- **Results**: Of the 60 articles identified, 7 met our inclusion criteria. Using data from 134,940 patients, including 1,530 exposed and 133,410 not exposed to PPIs, the overall odds ratio (OR) for major malformations was 1.12 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.86–1.45). Further analysis revealed no increased risk for spontaneous abortions (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.84–1.97); similarly, there was no increased risk for preterm delivery (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.96–1.33). In the secondary analysis of 1,341 exposed and 120,137 not exposed to omeprazole alone, the OR and 95% CI for major malformations was 1.17.

### Dexilant [^116JWBPZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole. Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and lansoprazole use. However, methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.

In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 62 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 30 mg of lansoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) = 1.04, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.25–4.21].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects with first-trimester exposure to lansoprazole in 794 live births.

A meta-analysis comparing 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increase in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs. The odds ratio (OR) for major malformations was 1.12 [95% CI 0.86–1.45] and for spontaneous abortions was OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97].

### Use of proton-pump inhibitors in early pregnancy and the risk of birth defects [^114gqkba]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are common in pregnancy, but there are limited data on the risk of birth defects associated with exposure to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in early pregnancy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cohort study to assess the association between exposure to PPIs during pregnancy and the risk of major birth defects among all infants born alive in Denmark between January 1996 and September 2008. We linked data from nationwide registries, including individual-level information on exposure to PPIs (prescriptions), birth defects, and potential confounders. Major birth defects, diagnosed within the first year of life, were categorized according to the standardized classification scheme of the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT). Our primary analyses assessed the use of PPIs from 4 weeks before conception through 12 weeks of gestation and from 0 through 12 weeks of gestation (first trimester).

- **Results**: Among 840,968 live births, 5082 involved exposure to PPIs between 4 weeks before conception and the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. There were 174 major birth defects in infants whose mothers had been exposed to PPIs during this period (3.4%), as compared with 21,811 in the group whose mothers had not been exposed (2.6%) [adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05 to 1.44]. In analyses limited to exposure during the first trimester, there were 118 major birth defects among 3651 infants exposed to PPIs (3.2%), and the adjusted prevalence odds ratio was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.34).

**Dose–response association**: Women with 2 (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09–1.36) or 3 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.52) prescriptions had higher odds of pre-eclampsia compared to non-users. An increased odds of GDM was associated with any number of PPI prescriptions, yet without large differences in the odds of GDM between the different categories. All prescriptions increased the odds of preterm birth, with 3 prescriptions (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.37–1.78) having a larger effect compared to 2 (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.23) or at least 4 (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.03–1.36) prescriptions. The odds of SGA were higher in women with 2 (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.14–1.49) or at least 4 (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.05–1.56) prescriptions compared to non-users, with no additional increase in effect among women with 4 or more prescriptions compared to those with 2. The filling of 2 prescriptions was significantly associated with lower odds of LGA (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.71–0.92).

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1161VuS7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred.

- **Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in the following concerns:

	- **Digestive system**: Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs, and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly modify their pharmacokinetics.

	- **Extra-digestive effects**: PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance.

A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs), since it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. DDIs therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects (extensive metabolizers).

### Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of serious infections in young children [^117Eiua6]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use may lead to infections through alteration of the microbiota or direct action on the immune system. However, only a few studies were conducted in children, with conflicting results.

- **Objective**: To assess the associations between PPI use and serious infections in children, overall and by infection site and pathogen.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This nationwide cohort study was based on the Mother-Child EPI-MERES Register built from the French Health Data System (SNDS). We included all children born between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, who received treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease or other gastric acid-related disorders, namely PPIs, histamine 2 receptor antagonists, or antacids/alginate. The index date was defined as the first date any of these medications was dispensed. Children were followed up until admission to the hospital for serious infection, loss of follow-up, death, or December 31, 2019.

- **Exposure**: PPI exposure over time.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Associations between serious infections and PPI use were estimated by adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs using Cox models. PPI use was introduced as time-varying. A 30-day lag was applied to minimize reverse causality. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic data, pregnancy characteristics, child comorbidities, and health care utilization.

- **Results**: The study population comprised 1,262,424 children (median [IQR] follow-up, 3.8 [1.8–6.2] years), including 606,645 who received PPI (323,852 male [53.4%]; median [IQR] age at index date, 88).

### The effects of proton pump inhibitors during pregnancy on treatment of preeclampsia and related outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112xKFGb]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Low credibility.

This systematic review evaluated the available evidence on the effects of proton pump inhibitors during pregnancy on preeclampsia and related maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Global Medicus Index) were searched on November 17, 2023.

Randomized controlled trials of pregnant women who used any class or dose of proton pump inhibitor were eligible. A meta-analysis was conducted for all outcomes of interest using random-effects models. Results were presented as risk ratios or mean difference. Quality assessment was performed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment was completed to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. The study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under identifier CRD42023423673.

Our search identified 3879 records that were screened independently by two authors. Nine reports (describing eight trials) met our eligibility criteria; however, six trials were ultimately excluded from our analysis because women were only given proton pump inhibitors immediately before cesarean delivery for acid aspiration prevention. The two trials that were included in the meta-analysis evaluated the treatment of 177 women with diagnosed preeclampsia. For the primary outcomes, moderate-certainty evidence showed that the use of proton pump inhibitors likely has no effect on the risk for hemolysis.

### The risks and benefits of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review and best practice advice from the American Gastroenterological Association [^111YisHb]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risks associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It focuses on three common indications: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) bleeding prophylaxis.

The recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and relevant publications from PubMed, EMbase, and the Cochrane Library (through July 2016). To identify relevant ongoing trials, we queried these sources.

### Proton pump inhibitor use is not strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 related outcomes: A nationwide study and meta-analysis [^114KDkyG]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has been associated with an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe outcomes. However, meta-analyses show unclear results, leading to uncertainty regarding the safety of PPI use during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nationwide observational study including all SARS-CoV-2 cases (n = 83,224) in Denmark as of December 1, 2020. The association of PPI use with the risk of infection was examined in a case-control design. We investigated the risk of severe outcomes, including mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, or death, in PPI users (n = 4473) compared with never users. Propensity score matching was applied to control for confounding. Finally, we performed an updated meta-analysis on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality attributable to PPI use.

- **Results**: PPI use was associated with an increased risk of infection; adjusted odds ratio, 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.13). Among SARS-CoV-2 cases, PPI use was associated with an increased risk of hospital admission; adjusted relative risk, 1.13 (1.03–1.24), but not with other severe outcomes. The updated meta-analysis showed no association between PPI use and risk of infection or mortality; pooled odds ratio, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.75–1.32) and relative risk, 1.33 (95% CI, 0.71–2.48).

- **Conclusions**: PPI use may be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission.

### AGA clinical practice update on de-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review [^115VgCy6]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used medications in the world. Developed for the treatment and prevention of acid-mediated upper gastrointestinal conditions, these agents are increasingly being used for indications where their benefits are less certain. PPI overprescription imposes an economic cost and contributes to polypharmacy. In addition, PPI use has been increasingly linked to a number of adverse events (PPI-associated adverse events [PAAEs]). Therefore, de-prescribing of PPIs is an important strategy to lower pill burden while reducing real costs and theoretical risks. The purpose of this clinical update was to provide Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements about how to approach PPI de-prescribing in ambulatory patients.

Our guiding principle was that, although PPIs are generally safe, patients should not use any medication when there is not a reasonable expectation of benefit based on scientific evidence or prior treatment response. Prescribers are responsible for determining whether PPI use is absolutely or conditionally indicated and, when uncertainty exists, to incorporate patient perspectives into PPI decision making. We collaboratively outlined a high-level "process map" of the conceptual approach to de-prescribing PPIs in a clinical setting.

- **Documentation of PPI indication**: It is important to establish clear documentation of the PPI indication.
- **Identifying suitable candidates for consideration of de-prescribing**: Not all patients may be good candidates for PPI de-prescribing.
- **Optimizing successful de-prescribing**: Ensuring a successful de-prescribing process is critical.

Co-authors drafted one or more potential BPAs, supported by literature, for each identified domain.

### Population-based cohort study: proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^1163KxP8]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The study was performed using a Swedish cohort including all live singleton births delivered between July 2006 and December 2016. The terms "women" and "mother" were defined based on biological sex and pregnancy status, not gender identity. The cohort was created by linking information from four high-quality nationwide Swedish health data registries maintained by the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen), as described earlier: the Medical Birth Registry (established in 1973), the Prescribed Drug Registry (established in July 2005), the Patient Registry (inpatient and outpatient care), and the Causes of Death Registry (since 1952). Information was linked through the unique Swedish personal identification number. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm (2017/2423–31), without the need for informed consent due to the registry-based nature of the data.

- **Maternal outcomes**: The maternal outcomes were pre-eclampsia, characterized by hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) combined with proteinuria (24-hour urine protein level > 300 mg), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy.

- **Neonatal outcomes**: The neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks of gestation), an Apgar score 5 minutes after birth (AS 5min) < 7, and small (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) based on birth weight in the 10th or 90th percentile based on gestational age.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of serious infections in young children [^113xQwYN]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Sociodemographic and medical characteristics were examined, which included various covariates. Sociodemographic data encompassed age, sex, and, at childbirth, the mother's affiliation with complementary universal health insurance (providing free access to health care for individuals with low incomes), deprivation index, and size of the urban unit of residence.

Pregnancy and delivery characteristics involved maternal age at the start of pregnancy, use of assisted reproductive technology, and maternity status (public or private). Additionally, the mode of delivery, gestational age (categorized as full-term, ≥ 37 weeks; moderate to late preterm, 32–36 weeks; very preterm, 28–31 weeks; and extremely preterm, 22–27 weeks) and birth weight adjusted for age and sex (z-score categorizations: severe macrosomia, > 97th centile; macrosomia, > 90th centile; normal weight, 10th-90th centile; small for gestational age, < 10th centile; and severe low weight, < 3rd centile) were also considered.

Maternal comorbidities were identified during pregnancy and within the two years before the start of pregnancy through hospital discharge or long-term disease diagnoses or if three or more drugs were dispensed. Identified comorbidities included diabetes (including gestational diabetes), hypertension (including preeclampsia), and obesity. The consumption of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substances during pregnancy was documented.

Child comorbidities and drug exposures were identified at the index date and throughout follow-up via hospital discharge, long-term disease diagnoses, or drugs dispensed. These included chronic respiratory diseases, neurological or degenerative diseases, diabetes, obesity, liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and major congenital malformations of the urinary system.

### Lansoprazole [^117LNZBR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy - Risk summary**: Available data from published observational studies overall do not indicate an association of adverse pregnancy outcomes with lansoprazole treatment. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lansoprazole to rats during organogenesis through lactation at 6.4 times the maximum recommended human dose produced reductions in the offspring in femur weight, femur length, crown-rump length, and growth plate thickness (males only) on postnatal Day 21. These effects were associated with a reduction in body weight gain. Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to the fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

If lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets are administered with clarithromycin, the pregnancy information for clarithromycin also applies to the combination regimen. Refer to the prescribing information for clarithromycin for more information on use in pregnancy.

- **Data - Human data**: Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and lansoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^115SmdVY]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastric acid-related disorders, but their safety profile and risk stratification for high-burden diseases need further investigation. Analyzing over 2 million participants from five prospective cohorts from the US, the UK, and China, we found that PPI use correlated with increased risk of 15 leading global diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory infections, and chronic kidney disease. These associations showed dose-response relationships and consistency across different PPI types.

PPI-related absolute risks increased with baseline risks, with approximately 82% of cases occurring in those at the upper 40% of the baseline predicted risk, and only 11.5% of cases occurring in individuals at the lower 50% of the baseline risk. While statistical association does not necessarily imply causation, its potential safety concerns suggest that personalized use of PPIs through risk stratification might guide appropriate decision-making for patients, clinicians, and the public.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of serious infections in young children [^11552xqH]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

We included all children born between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, who received their first-time treatment for GERD or other gastric acid-related disorders. These treatments were proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code A02BC), histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs; ATC code A02BA), or antacids/alginate (ATC codes A02A, A02BX13), administered between birth and December 31, 2019. These drugs share the same indications, so restricting the study population to children receiving these treatments at baseline would mitigate residual confounding. Importantly, only PPIs dramatically reduce gastric acid secretion and are therefore most likely to lead to infections. The index date was defined as the first date any of these medications was dispensed.

Children were excluded from the study if they did not receive any outpatient care before the index date or if their mother did not receive any outpatient care in the year before the start of pregnancy. These criteria ensured a sufficient time window to identify comorbidities. Children with a history of perinatal infection (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10], codes P35 to P39) or other serious infections (ICD-10 codes in eTable 1 in Supplement 1) identified during an inpatient stay before the index date were also excluded.

Children were followed up until the occurrence of a serious infection, loss of follow-up (censored 1 year after the last date of outpatient care), death, or December 31, 2019, whichever came first.

The exposure of interest was PPI use over time.

### SPL drug information for famotidine [^113NAsgh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of famotidine IV (also known as Pepcid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Famotidine IV is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an observed increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Effect of pregnancy on effectiveness of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication [^115aQYjC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are experienced by up to 85% of pregnant women. Some young women on maintenance proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment are choosing surgery to stop their medical treatment and avoid severe symptoms during pregnancy. There are no reports describing the effect of pregnancy on the long-term efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pregnancy on the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

- **Methods**: This study surveyed 146 women of childbearing age with proven GERD who had undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication from 1992 through 2002. The patients who became pregnant (group 1) were compared with those who did not (group 2).

- **Results**: The study focused on 25 patients who became pregnant after surgery. Of these patients, 40% (n = 10) had chosen surgery as a way to discontinue PPI treatment before pregnancy. The mean time from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to pregnancy was 25.9 ± 4.6 months. A total of 19 patients (76%) had no reflux symptoms, whereas 5 (20%) required antacids during pregnancy. One patient (4%) experienced an acute intrathoracic stomach migration during her pregnancy and required emergency open surgery, which resulted in the loss of her fetus. After pregnancy, six patients (24%) had recurrence of GERD symptoms, and three (12%) required a redo fundoplication. The higher rate of GERD recurrence (24% vs 16.7%) and redo surgery (12% vs 4%) in group 1 did not reach statistical significance, but showed a definite trend.

### Efficacy and safety measurements of proton pump inhibitors in infants and children [^112m2EBo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The design of studies to evaluate the efficacy of acid-lowering drugs in children differs significantly from study designs in adult populations. Efficacy measurements may be less extensive than those used in adult studies due to limitations related to concerns for patient safety, parental and institutional review board acceptance of efficacy endpoints, and existing standards of care within the pediatric gastroenterology community. Study designs involving patients who would routinely receive acid-lowering therapy have been successfully used to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of acid-lowering therapies, such as H2 receptor antagonists, and have led to pediatric labeling for these drugs. This approach may likewise be used in the study of newer acid-lowering agents, such as proton pump inhibitors.

### AGA clinical practice update on de-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review [^117AFx4X]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The AGA 2022 guidelines recommend deciding on discontinuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) solely based on the lack of an indication for PPI therapy, rather than due to concerns about PPI-associated adverse events. Specifically, - **Do not use**: the presence of a PPI-associated adverse event, a history of a PPI-associated adverse event in a PPI user, or the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of a PPI-associated adverse event as independent indications for PPI withdrawal.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^111sbMpP]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Our results are consistent with previous studies relating proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use to a higher (or not reduced) risk of pre-eclampsia and low birth weight. Contradictory to our results, other observational studies have reported no significant relation between PPI use, low birth weight, and/or preterm birth. However, compared to this large nationwide study, both studies had a much lower number of observations available and mainly focused on major anomalies. To our knowledge, there are no randomized clinical trials investigating the safety of maternal PPI use regarding maternal and neonatal adverse events. We also question if it is still ethically defendable to conduct these on PPI use during pregnancy with the accumulating safety concerns based on association studies and our increasing understanding of drug interactions and the microbiome.

The maternal and neonatal adverse events investigated can affect the short- and long-term health of both the mother and the child. Pre-eclampsia is a cause of worldwide maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has previously been associated with an increased frequency of maternal hypertensive disorders and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. GDM has been associated with the child having a higher odds of developing obesity, glucose intolerance, and diabetes in late adolescence and young adulthood. Preterm birth is a major cause of neonatal and infant morbidity. Children that are too small or too light at birth have a higher risk of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life and a lower quality of life.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the kidney: Implications of current evidence for clinical practice and when and how to deprescribe [^111Psyk6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), long thought to be safe, are associated with several non-kidney adverse health outcomes and multiple untoward kidney outcomes, such as hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, kidney failure, and an increased risk for all-cause mortality and mortality due to chronic kidney disease. PPIs are abundantly prescribed, rarely deprescribed, and frequently purchased over the counter. They are often used without medical indication, and even when medically indicated, they are frequently used for much longer than needed.

This review summarizes evidence linking PPI use with adverse events in general and adverse kidney outcomes in particular. It examines the literature on the association of PPI use with the risk for hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, end-stage kidney disease, and death. The review also assesses how this evidence should inform clinical practice.

- **Impact on patients' perception of risk**: We review how this evidence affects patients' perception of risk.

- **Deprescription literature and recommendations**: We synthesize PPI deprescription literature and provide our recommendations on how to approach PPI use and deprescription.

### Nexium [^116negZi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

In specific populations, particularly during pregnancy, Nexium falls under Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Nexium in pregnant women. Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, does not demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester use according to available epidemiologic data.

Animal reproduction studies involved oral administration of esomeprazole magnesium to rats and rabbits at doses approximately 57 times and 35 times the human dose of 40 mg, respectively. Teratogenicity was not observed. However, changes in bone morphology were seen in offspring of rats when dosed throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses equal to or greater than approximately 33.6 times the human dose of 40 mg. Due to the observed effects on developing bone at high doses in rat studies, Nexium should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Esomeprazole, compared with omeprazole, was considered in four epidemiological studies examining the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy and compared to those exposed to H2-receptor antagonists or other controls.

### Are proton-pump inhibitors harmful for the semen quality of men in couples who are planning pregnancy [^115G6v8w]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

To determine associations between proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and semen parameters in young men of couples who are planning pregnancy, a case-control study of a population-based registry was conducted.

A total of 2,473 men from couples planning pregnancy, comprising general practitioner patients with a recorded semen analysis, were included. Among them, 241 had a low total motile sperm count (TMSC ≤ 1), and 714 with TMSC > 1 served as matched controls. There was no intervention in this study.

- **Main outcome measures**: Exposure to PPI and PPI dosage.

The study analyzed data from 1996 to 2013 from the Integrated Primary Care Information database in the Netherlands, which includes medical records of 1.5 million patients from 720 general practitioners. The findings indicated that PPI use in the period of 12 to 6 months before semen analysis was associated with a threefold higher risk of low TMSC, with an odds ratio of 2.96 (95% confidence interval 1.26–6.97), adjusted for age and other medication. However, PPI use during the 6 months immediately preceding the semen analysis was not statistically significantly associated with low TMSC.

The conclusion is that PPI use in the period 12 to 6 months preceding semen analysis is associated with a threefold higher risk of low TMSC, suggesting that a long-term increase in gastric pH may result in a decline in sperm quality. This finding underscores the need for more preconceptional research and counseling on the potential effects of medication use on semen quality.

### Long-term safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^113hh6JM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. Their use has resulted in dramatic improvements in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Despite an acceptable safety profile, mounting data demonstrate concerns about the long-term use of PPIs. To provide a comprehensive review regarding the concerns of long-term PPI use, a literature search was performed to identify pertinent original and review articles.

Despite study shortcomings, the collective body of information overwhelmingly suggests an increased risk of infectious complications and nutritional deficiencies. Data regarding any increased risk in gastric or colon malignancy are less convincing. PPIs have revolutionized the management and complications of acid-related disorders with a high margin of safety; however, with the data available, efforts to reduce the dosing of or discontinue the use of PPIs must be reassessed frequently.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^111FrojA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs has become widespread, coinciding with an exponential growth in literature surrounding their safety and efficacy. This makes it challenging to establish an evidence-based guideline for their use. In a study by Scarpignato et al, committees from three Italian scientific societies collaborated with international expert reviewers to address 13 clinical scenarios fraught with uncertainty regarding PPI prescription and common drug misuse. They conducted a systematic literature review of almost 500 papers and presented a narrative review on the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy in each scenario.

- **Appropriate PPI use**: Table 1 summarizes key messages about appropriate PPI use across the 13 scenarios. These are organized according to scenarios suitable for long-term or short-term PPI use or where PPIs should not be used at all.

Upon reviewing this compendium, it becomes apparent that many usages included in the table lack Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. However, a wealth of evidence from global literature supports the efficacy of PPIs even outside FDA-approved uses.

### Receipt of proton-pump inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for preeclampsia [^117GvmQz]. American Journal of Perinatology (2021). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine whether receiving a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) prescription during pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk for preeclampsia. The Truven Health MarketScan database was utilized to evaluate the risk for preeclampsia based on the receipt of a PPI prescription either any time during pregnancy or specifically during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters. Additionally, the study assessed the risk for all preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and preterm severe preeclampsia. Adjusted models were used, factoring in risk aspects such as chronic hypertension, maternal age, multiple gestation, and diabetes, with adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of effect.

A total of 2,755,885 women were included in the analysis, of whom 69,249 were prescribed a PPI during pregnancy, representing 2.5% of the sample. In adjusted models, receiving a PPI prescription anytime during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia (aRR 1.28, 95% CI 1.24–1.32), as was receipt during the 1st trimester (aRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04–1.22), the 2nd trimester (aRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15–1.26), and the 3rd trimester (aRR 1.41, 95% CI 1.35–1.47). The risk for severe preeclampsia was also significantly increased with receipt of a PPI prescription anytime during pregnancy (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15–1.27), specifically during the 2nd trimester (aRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.23), and during the 3rd trimester (aRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.24–1.43), but not during the 1st trimester.

### National study of off-label proton pump inhibitor use among New Zealand infants in the first year of life (2005–2012) [^113qp2cj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Off-label prescribing of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to infants to treat symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is widely reported, despite evidence that PPIs are no more effective than placebo in relieving those symptoms. To initiate discussion about appropriate prescribing of these drugs for infants, we describe the characteristics of PPI use among infants in New Zealand.

In this population-based study, we used routinely collected dispensing data to identify all children born between 2005 and 2012 who were dispensed a government-subsidized PPI (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole) before their first birthday. Unique patient identifiers were used to link administrative datasets containing patient-level demographic, dispensing, and health information.

In total, 22,643 children were dispensed a study PPI before their first birthday. The prevalence of infant PPI use as a proportion of all live births increased from 2.4% for children born in 2005 to 5.2% for children born in 2012. Overall, 71.6% of infants were dispensed a PPI by 3 months of age, and 8.7% received a PPI within the first month of life. Before PPI initiation, only 7.0% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of GERD (with or without esophagitis), and 4.7% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of one or more known or suspected GERD risk factors.

Off-label prescribing of PPIs to New Zealand infants was relatively common and increased over the study period. The appropriateness of PPI treatment should be questioned, as the majority of infants…

### Association between proton pump inhibitor use during early pregnancy and risk of congenital malformations [^115fiyKc]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the use of pantoprazole sodium DR PO (also known as Protonix) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. Advise against self-medication with PPIs (OTC formulations) during pregnancy. The drug pantoprazole sodium DR PO, classified under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy, has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of serious infections in young children [^11768KAx]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

We identified 6,349,003 children born between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, of whom 1,497,773 received a first-time PPI, H2RA, or antacid/alginate treatment before December 31, 2019. We excluded data for 38,561 children (2.6%) who did not receive outpatient care before the index date or whose mother did not receive outpatient care in the year before the start of pregnancy, and 196,788 children (13.5%) with perinatal or serious infection before the index date. The study population comprised 1,262,424 children with a median (IQR) follow-up of 3.8 (1.8–6.2) years, of whom 606,645 received PPIs at least once during follow-up (median [IQR] follow-up, 3.7 [1.8–6.0] years) and 655,779 did not (median [IQR] follow-up, 3.9 [1.9–6.4] years).

Children who received PPIs during follow-up had a median (IQR) age of 88 (44–282) days, while those who did not received PPIs had a median age of 82 (44–172) days at the index date (ASD, 0.22). Of these, 323,852 (53.4%) in the PPI group and 342,454 (52.2%) in the non-PPI group were male (ASD, 0.02). Children who received PPIs also presented more frequently with comorbidities at the index date, including respiratory diseases (48,972/606,645 [8.1%] vs 23,636/655,779 [3.6%] without PPIs; ASD, 0.19), and were more likely to use corticosteroids (40,251 [6.6%] vs 19,173 [2.9%] without PPIs; ASD, 0.18).

### Prenatal and infant exposure to acid-suppressive medications and risk of allergic diseases in children [^115AgyUi]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Existing observational data indicate positive associations of acid-suppressive medication (ASM) use in prenatal and early life with allergic diseases in children. However, no study at the time of writing has accounted for confounding by indication or within-familial factors.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the association of prenatal or infant exposure to ASMs with the risk of allergic diseases in children.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This nationwide cohort study included data from South Korea's National Health Insurance Service mother-child-linked database, covering the period from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2020. Participants included mother-child pairs of neonates born from April 1, 2008, to December 31, 2019.

- **Exposures**: Prenatal and infant exposure to ASMs, specifically histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Composite and individual outcomes of allergic diseases — such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy — in children followed up to 13 years of age were assessed. The ASM-exposed individuals were compared with unexposed individuals in propensity score (PS)-matched and sibling-matched analyses to control for various potential confounders and within-familial factors. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

- **Results**: The study included 4,149,257 mother-child pairs. Prenatal exposure analyses involved 808,067 PS-matched pairs, with 763,755 pairs receiving H2RAs and 36,529 pairs receiving PPIs. The women had a mean (standard deviation) age of 31.8 (4.2) years. The PS-matched HR was 1.01 (95% CI: [values not provided]).

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^115FwrPf]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately half of all women suffer from heartburn at some stage during pregnancy. The most effective treatment is proton pump inhibitors, but the safety of their use during pregnancy cannot be guaranteed. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of proton pump inhibitors on the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, an Apgar score at 5 minutes below 7, and a child being small or large for its gestational age.

- **Methods**: This Swedish population-based study included 1,089,514 live singleton deliveries between July 2006 and December 2016 in Sweden. Multiple logistic regression was used to model the outcomes as a function of the covariates. Results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Results**: In 1.4% of all pregnancies, the mother used proton pump inhibitors in the period from 3 months before the last menstrual period up to delivery. The use of proton pump inhibitors was associated with higher odds of pre-eclampsia (odds ratio = 1.19, 1.10–1.29), gestational diabetes mellitus (odds ratio = 1.29, 1.16–1.43), preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.23, 1.14–1.32), and being small for gestational age (odds ratio = 1.27, 1.16–1.40) and lower odds of being large for gestational age (odds ratio = 0.84, 0.77–0.91). No significant association was found with a low Apgar score 5 minutes after birth.

- **Conclusions**: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and being born small for gestational age.

### Protonix delayed-release [^115eHfoY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.

In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) = 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08–3.95].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR = 1.12 [95% CI 0.86–1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### Clopidogrel with proton pump inhibitors: Safe or not [^111ZUvuE]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious complication associated with the use of antiplatelet therapy, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to be beneficial in decreasing such risk. Several studies in the recent past have suggested concerns regarding the interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs, presumably due to the inhibition of clopidogrel activity and thus attenuation of its antiplatelet activity.

A web-based literature and guidelines search was conducted using the keywords "clopidogrel", "omeprazole", "proton pump inhibitors", and "interaction". Of the available results, relevant studies (n = 11) were then systematically reviewed and summarized.

- **Retrospective or prospective studies**: The studies were categorized based on their retrospective or prospective nature. Most of the retrospective, observational studies suggested a link between the two; however, recent prospective studies have shown no interaction, as well as a positive influence of PPIs in preventing the GI side effects of antiplatelet therapy.

There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to suggest an interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs, and the decision to add PPI therapy to clopidogrel should be guided by its clinical indications rather than as a routine prophylactic measure.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^1138Tver]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The study examined the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for any of the 15 unintended outcomes among the derivation population. Key terms included BMI (body mass index), HR (hazard ratio), and CI (confidence interval).

- **Absolute risk of PPI-related high-burden diseases**: According to the distribution of the baseline predicted risk, the histogram showed the distribution of baseline predicted risk for any of the 15 PPI-related diseases. The performance and nomogram for the prediction model are provided in Supplementary Table S36 and Supplementary Figures S7 and S8. The risk difference (RD) and attributable fraction (AF) of PPI use for one year were calculated. The annual number of cases attributed to PPI use in each stratum was determined based on attributable risk and exposure and then summed to give the total annual number of cases attributed to PPI use across all populations. The results indicated that most cases occurred in individuals with a high baseline predicted risk, whereas those with a low baseline risk should not be overly concerned and should continue adhering to PPI treatment. Source data are available as a Source Data file.

### Recent safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^112QZmP1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

There have been recent concerns about the safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We focus here on three specific concerns: the possible interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, the postulated link between PPI use and fractures, and the possibility that long-term PPI use might lead to hypomagnesemia. There is evidence for an in vitro interaction between clopidogrel and at least some PPIs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against the use of certain PPIs by patients on clopidogrel. However, a randomized controlled trial that compared clopidogrel alone with the combination of clopidogrel and omeprazole found no increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and a reduction in the rate of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes attributable to omeprazole.

PPI use may be a weak risk factor for certain fractures, but the quality of evidence is relatively poor, and there is a strong possibility of confounding. The mechanism whereby PPI use might increase fracture risk is unknown. Currently, no additional measures concerning calcium supplementation or bone mineral density monitoring are recommended for patients on a PPI. The FDA has suggested monitoring serum magnesium levels in patients on PPI therapy. The mechanism and frequency of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia are unclear. PPI treatment should not be withheld from patients who genuinely require it, but should be taken in the lowest effective dose and only for as long as clinically indicated. The same is, of course, true for all medicines. The benefits of PPI therapy greatly outweigh the risks.

### Proton pump inhibitors: Placing putative adverse effects in proper perspective [^113FTRdk]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

This review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). PPIs are among the most widely prescribed and over-prescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well tolerated, epidemiologic studies that mine large databases have reported a panoply of putative adverse effects associated with PPIs. It should be emphasized that the quality of the evidence underlying most of these associations is very low and the studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. These associations continue to be sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by providers and patients. The unintended consequences are that patients who require PPIs, such as those taking dual antiplatelet agents, are not being prescribed or taking these necessary medications. In addition, physicians are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective for their patients and reassuring them upon initiating PPI treatment as well as at every follow-up visit.

Most of the recent publicized putative serious adverse effects attributed to PPIs rely on observational data and have not been confirmed in prospective randomized trials. Nevertheless, PPIs should be prescribed for valid indications, and when prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose with the need for their use periodically reassessed.

### Protonix i.V [^114MSXH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available human data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association between adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. The methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, with a relative risk (RR) = 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08–3.95].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during the analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs, for major malformations (OR = 1.12 [95% CI 0.86–1.45]) and for spontaneous abortions (OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111ofaxZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the safest classes of drugs. Although concerns have been raised about their long-term safety, the preponderance of evidence does not strongly support these concerns, which have been publicized over the last few years, and the absolute risk is probably low. Some adverse effects are plausible and predictable; others are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and rare. Based on the quality of existing evidence, the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh the potential risks in most patients, especially if PPI use is based on a relevant and appropriate indication. Conversely, patients treated without an appropriate therapeutic indication are only exposed to potential risks, and the benefit-to-harm balance becomes very low. Consequently, the overall focus should be on the appropriateness of PPI therapy and on a regular assessment of the need for continued PPI treatment.

Nearly all the adverse outcomes associated with PPIs occur among patients who receive long-term therapy; minimizing the duration of treatment by periodically reviewing a patient's need for acid-suppressive therapy could eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. During continued long-term use, the clinical effects should always be reviewed, and attempts should be made to discontinue any therapy that may not be needed. It is imperative to use the lowest dose of the drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic goals. This may entail implementing the discontinuation of treatment in asymptomatic patients as well as step-down, intermittent, or on-demand PPI therapy for the maintenance of GERD. It should be emphasized, however, that…

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Human data**: Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association between adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^114VssRA]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Given the links with a substantial global disease burden and the high rate of inappropriate overuse of PPIs (up to 70%), the potential impact of long-term PPI use should not be ignored, even if the causal effects for these outcomes have not been established. In practice, the net risk of PPI-related adverse effects is low in those with low baseline risk, but it is not negligible, and the risk profile may change over time. Personalized prevention is feasible by regularly evaluating the baseline risk with readily available predictive factors for long-term PPI users while focusing on high-risk patients.

For high-risk individuals, potential effective strategies may include dose reduction, discontinuation, transitioning to "on-demand" use, considering less profound acid suppressants like H2RAs, and regular monitoring for early indications of adverse events (e.g. blood glucose levels for the risk of diabetes). These strategies may help mitigate the additional absolute risk associated with PPI use.

Further research is still required to:

- **RCT-based meta-analysis**: Confirm the causal effects of PPIs on disease risk.
- **Prediction models**: Improve and validate the performance of prediction models for multiple PPI-related adverse effects.
- **Risk population definition**: Investigate the appropriate cut-off value for defining high-risk populations.
- **Effectiveness evaluation**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the risk stratification strategy.

These research avenues have the potential to refine clinical practices and optimize PPI use, ensuring a balanced approach between therapeutic benefits and potential risks in diverse patient populations.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^111s45EV]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have revolutionized the medical approach to upper gastrointestinal disorders. Initially developed as a treatment for reflux esophagitis, these potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion have subsequently proven effective for a broad range of syndromes known (or suspected) to be attributable to acid reflux, acid secretion, or acid hypersecretion. Combined with seemingly excellent safety and tolerance, these broadened indications triggered an exponential increase in PPI use (and consequently cost) worldwide. Furthermore, PPIs have become a victim of their own success. Not only are they now often prescribed for syndromes of dubious merit ("silent reflux"), but an almost cultish faith in potent acid suppression as a treatment for all that ails the human race has led to progressive escalation of PPI dosage and potency. Indeed, a vocabulary has emerged around the concept of "PPI failure", often ignoring the possibility that the condition in question had no relationship to gastric acid secretion in the first place. Consequently, it is no surprise that, in less than 30 years, PPIs have evolved from wonder drugs to a major healthcare epidemic. Coupled with this has been unprecedented scrutiny of the safety of chronic PPI use; it is in this background that Scarpignato et al. author a position paper on "Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases".

### Protonix delayed-release [^111YzcAZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies have not demonstrated an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with pantoprazole. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with pantoprazole. Reproduction studies have been conducted in rats at oral doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (about 88 times the recommended human dose) and rabbits at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (about 16 times the recommended human dose) with administration during organogenesis in pregnant animals, revealing no evidence of harm to the fetus due to pantoprazole in this study.

A pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats, including additional endpoints to evaluate the effect on bone development, was carried out with pantoprazole sodium. Oral doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day (GD) 6 through lactation day (LD) 21. Changes in bone morphology were observed in pups exposed to pantoprazole in utero and through milk during lactation, as well as through oral dosing from postnatal day (PND) 4 through PND 21 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals.

Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal harm. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies carry a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

### Prevacid SoluTab [^116r8GgE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies overall do not indicate an association of adverse pregnancy outcomes with lansoprazole treatment (see Data).

In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lansoprazole to rats during organogenesis through lactation at 6.4 times the maximum recommended human dose produced reductions in the offspring in femur weight, femur length, crown-rump length, and growth plate thickness (males only) on postnatal Day 21 (see Data). These effects were associated with reduction in body weight gain. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

If PREVACID or PREVACID SoluTab is administered with clarithromycin, the pregnancy information for clarithromycin also applies to the combination regimen. Refer to the prescribing information for clarithromycin for more information on use in pregnancy.

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and lansoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.

### Over-the-counter medications in pregnancy [^115BD3aH]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the use of famotidine PO (also known as Pepcid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used with caution. Famotidine PO is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### How to advise patients on the risk of chronic proton pump inhibitor therapy [^114yiYrC]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and have excellent short-term tolerability. Administrative database studies have highlighted that many diseases are associated with PPI therapy, including pneumonia, fracture, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. This review, therefore, examines the evidence of the risks and benefits of these drugs.

- **Recent findings**: There is high-to-moderate quality evidence that PPIs are effective at treating many acid-related disorders. Recent randomized trials have suggested that the associations between PPIs and various diseases are likely to be related to bias and residual confounding, and these drugs appear to be safe apart from a possible increased risk of enteric infections.

- **Summary**: PPIs should be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible. They are still relatively well-tolerated drugs but should only be prescribed for proven indications.

### Gablofen [^116NKyju]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Use in specific populations**:

- **Pregnancy**: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Gablofen in pregnant women. In animal studies, oral administration of baclofen to pregnant rats produced an increase in fetal malformations. There are no animal data on developmental risk associated with baclofen administered via continuous intrathecal infusion. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years have not been established.

- **Data**: Baclofen given orally to pregnant rats has been shown to increase the incidence of omphaloceles (ventral hernias) in fetuses at a dose associated with maternal toxicity. This abnormality was not seen in mice or rabbits.

- **Lactation**: There is insufficient information regarding levels of baclofen in the milk of nursing mothers receiving Gablofen. There are no adequate data on the effects of Gablofen on the breastfed infant or on milk production. At recommended oral doses, baclofen is present in human milk and withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of baclofen is stopped.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114oVcxn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Overall, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment, like any drug therapy, carries risks of adverse effects.

The overall benefits of therapy and the improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients. Nevertheless, individuals without a clear clinical indication are exposed solely to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines is the only rational approach to ensuring effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Safety of proton pump inhibitor exposure [^116GJ4zc]. Gastroenterology (2010). High credibility.

Proton pump (H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase) inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat patients with acid-related disorders because they are generally perceived to be safe and effective. However, as with any pharmacologic agent, they have the potential for side effects. Many studies have examined the side effects of long-term or short-term PPI exposure. We review the mechanism of action of PPIs, focusing on recently released products that might have greater risks of adverse effects than older products due to increased potency and/or duration of action. We summarize the data available on the putative adverse effects of PPI therapy and propose guidelines for clinicians who prescribe these agents to limit the potential for adverse outcomes in users of these effective therapeutic agents.

### Therapy insight: Drugs for gastrointestinal disorders in pregnant women [^115aPZyE]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The management and treatment of gastrointestinal ailments in pregnant women require special attention and expertise, as the safety of the mother, fetus, and neonate remains the primary focus. Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are common, as is symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease, while peptic ulcer disease occurs less frequently and with fewer complications. Gastroenterologists and obstetricians should be familiar with safe treatment options for these conditions, as they can profoundly impair the quality of life for pregnant women.

During pregnancy, constipation can develop de novo, or chronic constipation can increase in severity. Given the array of therapies available, physicians must be informed about drugs that are safe for both mother and fetus. Management of acute, self-limited diarrhea should focus on supportive therapy, dietary changes, and maintenance of hydration. Treatment of chronic diarrhea should be considered in the context of therapy for the underlying disorder.

Inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome present a unique therapeutic challenge — to control the disease while minimizing toxicity to the fetus and mother. Initiation and alteration of medical therapy for gastrointestinal disorders during pregnancy must be undertaken after discussion with the patient's obstetrician.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) carrying some risks, like any other classes of drugs, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them, and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some, if not all, safety concerns to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence-based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound, and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this position paper, we have reviewed the available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. summaries of the evidence).

- **Indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy**: Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion. They are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment; however, they go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances.

### Adverse event reporting for proton pump inhibitor therapy: An overview of systematic reviews [^113uXtVA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To assist clinicians in counseling patients regarding the risk of adverse events from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), evidence was synthesized from published systematic reviews of antireflux therapy.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge.

- **Review methods**: The overview was based on PRISMA reporting standards (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) of English-language meta-analyses and systematic reviews of PPI therapy for reflux disease through December 2014. Two independent investigators assessed study eligibility, rated the review quality with AMSTAR criteria (assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews), and abstracted data for adverse events.

- **Results**: Thirty-three systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. The most commonly reported adverse events were community-acquired pneumonia (odds ratios, 1.04–1.92), with a greater association noted with shorter duration of therapy and higher doses. Hip fractures were also associated with PPI use (odds ratios, 1.16–1.50), especially with long-term therapy. Enteric infection with Clostridium difficile was more common with PPI therapy (odds ratios, 1.69–1.33). Other less commonly reported adverse events included electrolyte and vitamin deficiency. Risk factors for adverse events are reported in the text.

- **Conclusion**: Our overview shows that PPI therapy is associated with significant and potentially serious adverse events that should be discussed with patients. The effect sizes and risk factors provided should facilitate this discussion and promote shared decision-making between patients and clinicians.

### Population-based cohort study: proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^11338uUB]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs at different timepoints (trimesters):

- **Odds of pre-eclampsia**: The odds of developing pre-eclampsia increased when PPIs were used during the second (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.16–1.65) or third (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.20–1.76) trimester of pregnancy. If a woman was prescribed PPIs during both the second and third trimesters, her odds of pre-eclampsia were 1.29 (95% CI 1.12–1.50).

- **Odds of preterm birth and SGA**: The use of PPIs only in the 3 months before the last menstrual period (LMP) was significantly associated with an increased odds of giving birth to a child preterm (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.12–1.42) and of the child being small for gestational age (SGA) (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.11–1.82). PPI use only in the first trimester slightly increased the odds of preterm birth (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.30) and SGA (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.00–1.57).

- **PPI use in specific trimesters**: The odds of preterm birth were primarily affected by PPI use during the second trimester (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.40–1.78). Conversely, PPI use in the third trimester reduced the odds of preterm birth (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.47–0.61).

*The associations were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), obtained by multiple logistic regression including all live births.*

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: What does the gastroenterologist need to know [^113JmXa8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is reported by 40–85% of pregnant women, usually beginning at the end of the first trimester, and can profoundly impair the quality of life. When present, GERD persists during the entire pregnancy and usually resolves after delivery. Complications such as erosive esophagitis, bleeding, or strictures are rarely described.

For mild symptoms, lifestyle and dietary modifications are recommended. Conservative measures include avoiding eating late at night, elevating the head of the bed by 10–15 cm, and lying on the left side. If symptoms persist, medication may be necessary. First-line treatment is based on antacids. Antacids containing calcium and magnesium are considered safe in pregnancy. Furthermore, patients prefer to use this medication because it relieves the symptoms promptly and can be taken on demand. No teratogenic effects of these drugs have been observed in animal studies.

Bicarbonate-containing agents, such as sodium bicarbonate, should be avoided as they can precipitate metabolic alkalosis and fluid overload in the mother and fetus. A further concern with aluminum antacids is the potential developmental retardation described when women take high doses of this medication. The potential fetal toxicity when using sucralfate is associated with its aluminum component. However, no maternal or fetal adverse effects have been observed, and therefore sucralfate is usually considered safe during pregnancy.

Histamine type 2 antagonists are often the next-line therapy. Both cimetidine and ranitidine have been used with excellent safety records.

Use of PPIs increased the odds of the mother developing pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 19% and 29% respectively, compared to non-users (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.10–1.29 and OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.16–1.43). The neonate of a PPI user had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.23 (95% CI 1.14–1.32) for being born preterm compared to non-users. The odds of a low Apgar score at 5 minutes were not significantly affected by maternal PPI use. The use of PPIs increased the odds of having a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) child (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.16–1.40), whereas it was associated with a decrease in the odds for a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) child (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.91).
