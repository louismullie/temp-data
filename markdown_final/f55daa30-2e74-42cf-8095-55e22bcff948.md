## Question

Is nitrofurantoin effective for an Enterococcus faecalis UTI in men?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nitrofurantoin is effective for Enterococcus faecalis urinary tract infections in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about nitrofurantoin's intrinsic activity against Enterococcus faecalis and real‑world susceptibility rates. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration, especially into the prostate and upper tract. Next, I will consider how male UTIs differ anatomically and clinically, influencing antibiotic choice and duration. After that, I need to check whether there is direct clinical evidence for nitrofurantoin in men with Enterococcus faecalis cystitis. Finally, I should review guideline positions and synthesize a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the spectrum question. Nitrofurantoin is FDA‑labeled for UTIs caused by susceptible strains including Enterococcus species, which implies potential activity against Enterococcus faecalis, but this is contingent on susceptibility testing and clinical context [^1151Cp6Y] [^115gQPm5]. Wait, let me verify contemporary susceptibility data in urinary Enterococcus faecalis isolates; a 2022 cohort of urolithiasis patients reported nitrofurantoin susceptibility around 80.0% in younger patients and 63.6% in older adults, underscoring that coverage is far from universal and that age may correlate with lower susceptibility rates [^114W48UB].

> Now, I need to examine pharmacokinetics and site penetration, because this will determine whether activity in urine translates into clinical efficacy in men. Nitrofurantoin is concentrated in urine and lacks broader tissue distribution; it achieves bactericidal levels in bladder urine but not in renal parenchyma, blood, or prostatic tissue, which is critical for male infections that may involve these compartments [^115GiqJ8]. Hold on, I initially said it was contraindicated for pyelonephritis, but I should correct that; the label specifically states it is not indicated for pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess, functionally steering prescribers away from upper‑tract disease where tissue penetration is required [^1151Cp6Y].

> Next, I should review how UTIs in men differ in ways that affect antibiotic choice and outcomes. Male UTIs are commonly classified as complicated, in part due to frequent structural abnormalities and the potential for occult prostatic involvement, making tissue‑penetrating agents and longer courses more important than in women with uncomplicated cystitis [^116o8CN8]. I need to check outcome data by sex; in a pragmatic randomized trial of febrile UTI, men had higher short‑term failure with 7 days versus 14 days of ciprofloxacin, suggesting unrecognized prostatitis even when chronic prostatitis was excluded, whereas women did well with 7 days, highlighting sex‑specific differences driven by tissue involvement [^111PE5AN] [^116FWq1T].

> I will now examine whether there is direct clinical evidence supporting nitrofurantoin for Enterococcus faecalis cystitis in men. Hmm, wait a minute, most modern randomized trials evaluating nitrofurantoin for cystitis enrolled women only, such as the JAMA trial comparing nitrofurantoin to fosfomycin and the EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 phase 3 trials comparing gepotidacin to nitrofurantoin, which do not provide male‑specific efficacy data and do not isolate Enterococcus faecalis outcomes for men [^111YMvTh] [^112UsGfP] [^114KWcB5]. I should confirm that no male‑specific nitrofurantoin trials for Enterococcus faecalis cystitis are present in the provided evidence; based on what I see, male data are either absent or extrapolated from mixed or female cohorts and from in vitro susceptibility, so there is no direct, high‑quality efficacy demonstration in men [^112UsGfP] [^114KWcB5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions with attention to sex‑specific recommendations. The EAU recommends nitrofurantoin as first‑line for acute cystitis in females but offers no parallel endorsement for males, and it specifically advises against nitrofurantoin for pyelonephritis because of inadequate tissue concentrations, which aligns with the PK limitations in men with potential occult upper‑tract or prostatic disease [^112TE65A] [^111pVC8n]. Let me double‑check U.S. primary care guidance; the AAFP 2024 rapid review lists nitrofurantoin among first‑line agents for uncomplicated cystitis in women only, again highlighting the lack of guidance for men and the concern that male UTIs are often complicated by anatomy or tissue involvement [^116hPLMo].

> Putting these threads together, I need to ensure I synthesize pharmacology, anatomy, microbiology, and guidelines into a clinically coherent answer. Nitrofurantoin can eradicate susceptible Enterococcus faecalis confined to the bladder because it achieves high urinary concentrations, but its lack of prostatic and renal parenchymal penetration makes it a poor empiric choice in men, in whom infection is more likely to involve those tissues or behave as complicated disease requiring a tissue‑penetrating antibiotic and longer duration, a conclusion supported by sex‑stratified outcomes in febrile UTI trials [^111YMvTh] [^111PE5AN] [^116FWq1T].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing the narrow scenario where nitrofurantoin might be reasonable. If a man has clear, afebrile lower‑tract symptoms, no flank pain, no systemic features, a urine culture proving Enterococcus faecalis susceptible to nitrofurantoin, and no clinical signs suggesting prostatitis, then targeted nitrofurantoin may be appropriate with close follow‑up, recognizing the age‑associated drop in susceptibility and the risk of occult prostate involvement that would not be cured by nitrofurantoin [^114W48UB] [^1151Cp6Y] [^111YMvTh]. But wait, what if symptoms persist at 48–72 hours or recur rapidly; in that case, I should reassess for prostatic or upper‑tract disease and switch to a tissue‑penetrating agent consistent with male UTI data demonstrating better outcomes with fluoroquinolones for febrile or complicated presentations, mindful of stewardship and local resistance [^111PE5AN] [^116FWq1T].

> I should confirm dosing considerations, since regimens differ by formulation and by the population studied. The FDA‑labeled regimen for nitrofurantoin macrocrystals is 50–100 mg four times daily with food for treatment, whereas many modern trials in women use macrocrystal/monohydrate 100 mg twice daily for 5 days; there are no high‑quality male‑specific duration data for cystitis, so if used in a narrowly selected male cystitis case, many clinicians extend to 5–7 days with careful monitoring, recognizing that label dosing remains QID and that febrile or prostatic disease requires alternative agents and longer courses [^113sa6qo] [^117JL87X] [^116hPLMo]. Let me reconsider renal function briefly; labeling advises caution and monitoring in relation to renal function, so I need to ensure kidney function is adequate before prescribing and to avoid use if there is suspicion of tissue‑invasive disease where nitrofurantoin will underperform [^117D7dN2].

> Next, I should review safety and counseling, as these often get overlooked when we focus on microbiology alone. Nitrofurantoin can rarely cause pulmonary toxicity and peripheral neuropathy with longer exposures or prophylaxis, so even during short courses patients should be instructed to report concerning respiratory or neurologic symptoms, and prolonged use should be avoided when alternatives exist [^1146opcB] [^112X6s8H]. I need to ensure administration with food to enhance absorption and tolerance and to reinforce completion of the planned course, with early reassessment if symptoms fail to improve [^1158nAjS].

> Final answer, with self‑check for internal consistency. Nitrofurantoin has in vitro and label‑supported activity against Enterococcus species, and some Enterococcus faecalis urinary isolates remain susceptible; however, in men, the frequent involvement of the prostate and the need for tissue penetration make nitrofurantoin a suboptimal empiric choice, and there is no direct, high‑quality male‑specific clinical trial evidence confirming efficacy against Enterococcus faecalis cystitis in this population [^1151Cp6Y] [^114W48UB] [^111YMvTh] [^111PE5AN] [^116FWq1T] [^112UsGfP] [^114KWcB5]. Therefore, I should recommend reserving nitrofurantoin for carefully selected men with confirmed, susceptible Enterococcus faecalis lower‑tract infection without systemic or prostatic features, while using tissue‑penetrating antibiotics guided by culture and local resistance patterns when disease is febrile, recurrent, slow to respond, or anatomically complicated [^111pVC8n] [^112TE65A].

Nitrofurantoin is **not recommended** for E. faecalis UTIs in men because UTIs in men are typically considered complicated and often involve the prostate, which nitrofurantoin does not penetrate. Although E. faecalis is usually susceptible, nitrofurantoin should be reserved for **uncomplicated lower UTIs** without prostatic involvement [^112TE65A] [^111YMvTh]. In men, use agents with prostatic penetration (e.g. fluoroquinolones, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or ampicillin) and treat for 7–14 days, guided by clinical response and culture results [^116FWq1T] [^111PE5AN].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Urinary concentration: Nitrofurantoin achieves **high urinary levels** but has minimal systemic distribution and **poor prostatic penetration**. Prostatic involvement: Male UTIs often involve the prostate and require antibiotics with **good prostatic penetration**, which nitrofurantoin lacks.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guideline stance: Nitrofurantoin is indicated for **uncomplicated lower UTIs** [^116o8CN8] and is **not recommended** for complicated UTIs, including those in men [^115MxJSK] [^1151Cp6Y]. Alternative agents: Use antibiotics with **good prostatic penetration**, such as fluoroquinolones, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or ampicillin, for male UTIs.

---

## Clinical evidence and outcomes

Evidence: Clinical data supporting nitrofurantoin's efficacy in male UTIs — particularly those involving E. faecalis — are **limited**. Failure risk: Clinical failure is **likely** if prostatic involvement is present due to **poor tissue penetration**.

---

## Resistance patterns and susceptibility

Susceptibility: E. faecalis is **generally susceptible** to nitrofurantoin, but **resistance can occur**, especially in recurrent or complicated infections [^115gQPm5] [^115LYoAc]. Testing: Susceptibility testing is **essential** to guide antibiotic selection [^112B6adk].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Adverse effects: Nitrofurantoin is generally well tolerated but can cause **gastrointestinal upset, pulmonary reactions, and peripheral neuropathy**, particularly with prolonged use [^1146opcB] [^112X6s8H]. Renal function: Use caution in patients with **renal impairment**, as reduced renal function can **increase toxicity risk** [^111YMvTh].

---

## Clinical scenarios where nitrofurantoin may be considered

Uncomplicated lower UTIs: Nitrofurantoin may be considered rarely in men **without prostatic involvement**, confirmed by clinical evaluation and imaging. Short-term use: A **5–7 day course** may be considered if **susceptibility is confirmed** and there is no evidence of prostatic involvement.

---

## Recommended alternative antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) | 500 mg PO BID | 7–14 days | - Excellent prostatic penetration <br/> - Monitor for resistance |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg PO BID | 7–14 days | - Effective against E. faecalis <br/> - Good prostatic penetration |
| Ampicillin | 500 mg PO QID | 7–14 days | - Effective against E. faecalis <br/> - Good prostatic penetration |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Nitrofurantoin is generally **not recommended** for E. faecalis UTIs in men due to poor prostatic penetration and limited evidence of efficacy in complicated infections. Agents with good prostatic penetration — such as fluoroquinolones, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or ampicillin — are preferred. Nitrofurantoin should be reserved for rare cases of uncomplicated lower UTIs without prostatic involvement, confirmed by clinical evaluation and susceptibility testing [^116o8CN8] [^112B6adk].

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^111PE5AN]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Our findings extend recent results from a highly similar randomized controlled Swedish study conducted in women with acute pyelonephritis, demonstrating non-inferiority of 7- to 14-days of antimicrobial treatment. Compared to our study, their patient group was younger, had fewer comorbidities, and fewer instances of complicated UTIs.

In men, our results indicate an increase in the rate of clinical and bacteriological treatment failure after the 7-day treatment compared to 14 days. Likely, though chronic bacterial prostatitis was an exclusion criterion, this is due to prostatic involvement of the infection, as this is known to cause recurrent UTIs, even after appropriate antimicrobial treatment. There is a lack of studies on optimal treatment duration for fUTI in men. One study directly compared different treatment durations in an open, prospective, and randomized trial in 72 men with community-acquired fUTI, showing similar bacteriological cure rates with ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily for either 2 or 4 weeks. Similarly, a randomized, double-blind trial in Sweden supported the efficacy of a 14-day treatment with fluoroquinolones in men. Taken together, the studies confirm that, at present, a 14-day treatment regimen of fluoroquinolones is the minimum period necessary for optimal therapy of fUTI in men. Recently, however, a retrospective analysis of a large database of male veterans indicated that more than 7 days of antibiotic treatment (the vast majority being treated with ciprofloxacin) was not associated with a reduction in UTI recurrence.

### Comparative study of the bacterial distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens in older and younger patients with urinary stones [^114W48UB]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Table 4 illustrates the susceptibility rates of major Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis and E. faecium) to various antibiotics. Overall, major Gram-positive E. faecalis bacteria exhibited significant differences in overall susceptibility trends between older and younger patients (P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test). Gentamicin and tobramycin revealed a high level of in vitro susceptibility against E. faecalis and E. faecium, whereas cephalosporins indicated relatively high resistance rates. Nitrofurantoin exhibited 80.0% susceptibility in younger patients but 63.6% in older patients to E. faecalis. Gentamicin confirmed a high susceptibility rate of 81.8% in older patients, whereas only 50% susceptibility was observed in younger patients to E. faecium.

- **Statistical analysis**: The Chi-square test was performed to detect differences in the specific distribution of uropathogens. ✱ p < 0.05 illustrates statistical significance*.

### Susceptibility of antimicrobial-resistant urinary Escherichia coli isolates to fluoroquinolones and nitrofurantoin [^115iHwzH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

In vitro surveillance data from across the United States indicate that approximately 10%-20% of urinary Escherichia coli isolates from female outpatients are resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Alternative therapies for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women include fluoroquinolones and nitrofurantoin. However, the activities of these agents against TMP-SMX-resistant isolates are rarely reported. Among TMP-SMX-resistant urinary E. coli isolates tested in US laboratories from 1998 through 2001, 9.5% (5,767 of 60,414) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 1.9% (1,214 of 63,817) were resistant to nitrofurantoin; 10.4% of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates (683 of 6,560) were resistant to nitrofurantoin. An association between resistance to fluoroquinolones and nitrofurantoin in E. coli has not been previously reported and warrants further study.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^116FWq1T]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

In adults with febrile urinary tract infection (fUTI), data on optimal treatment duration in patients other than non-pregnant women without comorbidities are lacking.

- **Methods**: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted among 35 primary care centers and 7 emergency departments of regional hospitals in the Netherlands. Women and men aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of fUTI were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 or 14 days, with the second week being ciprofloxacin 500 mg or placebo administered orally twice daily. Patients indicated for antimicrobial treatment for at least 14 days were excluded from randomization. The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, with a preset subgroup analysis including sex. Secondary endpoints were the bacteriologic cure rate at 10–18 days post-treatment and clinical cure at 70–84 days post-treatment.

- **Results**: Of the 357 patients included, 200 were eligible for randomization; 97 patients were randomly assigned to a 7-day treatment and 103 patients to a 14-day treatment. Overall, short-term clinical cure occurred in 85 (90%) patients treated for 7 days and in 94 (95%) of those treated for 14 days (difference –4.5%; 90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7; P non-inferiority = 0.072, non-inferiority not confirmed). In women, clinical cure was 94% and 93% in those treated for 7 and 14 days, respectively (difference 0.9; 90% CI, –6.9 to 8.7, P non-inferiority = 0.011, non-inferiority confirmed), and in men, it was 86% versus 98% (difference –11.2; 90% CI –20.6 to –1.8, P superiority =).

The study suggests that a shorter treatment duration might be non-inferior in some subgroups, though the results varied across different groups.

### Fosfomycin tromethamine [^112HsPQX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Fosfomycin tromethamine is indicated solely for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, specifically acute cystitis, in women. This is in response to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. It is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess.

If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs following treatment with fosfomycin tromethamine, alternative therapeutic agents should be selected. Please refer to the precautions and clinical studies sections for further guidance.

### 5-day versus 10-day course of fluoroquinolones in outpatient males with a urinary tract infection (UTI) [^115MxJSK]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines classify urinary tract infections (UTIs) in males as complicated and recommend longer treatment than for UTIs in females. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that males with UTIs may be successfully treated with an outpatient 5-day course of levofloxacin.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from a previously conducted clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00210886), a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg intravenously/by mouth once daily for 5 days and ciprofloxacin 400/500 mg intravenously/by mouth twice daily for 10 days in complicated UTI (cUTI). The study was a post hoc, subgroup analysis of male and female subjects with cUTI. Subjects were stratified into groups based on sex and antibiotic received. The subjects were analyzed at the end of therapy (EOT) and post-therapy (PT) for clinical success rates, defined as no further need for antimicrobial treatment.

- **Results**: Totals of 427 patients (224 male, 203 female) and 350 patients (189 male, 161 female) were included in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations, respectively. Clinical success rates between males and females were not statistically different between antibiotic groups in either the mITT or ME populations at EOT or PT.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates that males with UTI may be treated with a shorter course of antimicrobial therapy for UTI than previously recommended.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^112XZiFX]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Blood cultures were obtained in 339 patients, of which 80 (24%) had bacteremia, with E. coli being the most commonly identified organism (n = 67, 84%).

Both treatment regimens resulted in a high clinical cure rate at short-term follow-up in the ITT population, with 90% in patients treated for 7 days and 95% in those treated for 14 days (Table 3). The difference in the short-term clinical cure rate between both treatment arms was 4.5% (90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7, P non-inferiority = 0.072). Consequently, the criteria for non-inferiority were not met as the 90% CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The median time to defervescence did not differ between the two groups: 2 (IQR, 1–2) days in the 7-day antimicrobial treatment, compared to 2 (IQR, 1–3) days in the 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Short-term clinical cure was 85% in non-randomized patients, with a median time to defervescence of 2 (IQR, 1–3) days. Among all analyses performed, there were no significant differences between ITT and PP analysis; therefore, only outcomes of ITT analysis are presented.

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: A randomized clinical trial [^115GiqJ8]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Use of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin has increased since guidelines began recommending them as first-line therapy for lower urinary tract infections (UTIs). This study aims to compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin in women with uncomplicated cystitis.

This multinational, open-label, analyst-blinded, randomized clinical trial included 513 nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older with symptoms of lower UTI such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness. Participants had a positive urine dipstick result indicating nitrites or leukocyte esterase and no known colonization or previous infection with uropathogens resistant to the study antibiotics. Recruitment occurred from October 2013 through April 2017 at hospital units and outpatient clinics in Geneva, Switzerland; Lodz, Poland; and Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral nitrofurantoin, 100 mg three times a day for five days (n = 255), or a single 3-g dose of oral fosfomycin (n = 258). Follow-up included clinical evaluation and urine culture collection 14 and 28 days after completing therapy.

The primary outcome was clinical response within 28 days following therapy completion. This was defined as clinical resolution, characterized by the complete resolution of UTI symptoms and signs without prior treatment failure, failure (which included the need for additional or changed antibiotic treatment due to UTI or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy), or indeterminate cases where symptoms persisted without objective evidence of infection resolution.

### No. 250-recurrent urinary tract infection [^114rAos1]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infections in women, particularly concerning antibiotic prophylaxis, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering continuous daily antibiotic prophylaxis. This includes the use of co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a quinolone for a duration of 6–12 months. This is advised for patients experiencing either two UTIs within a six-month period or three UTIs within a twelve-month period.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^113AK4Tq]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

It should be noted that there were similar clinical cure rates between 7 and 14 days of treatment during longer follow-up (70–84 days post-treatment). This holds for both women and men, indicating that the need for additional antibiotic UTI treatment during longer follow-up is similar irrespective of whether the initial treatment of febrile UTI was for 7 or 14 days. Given the principles of antimicrobial stewardship, this finding is significant. Even in men with febrile UTI, this might be an argument to treat them for 7 days. Indeed, our study suggests that further research on the treatment duration for men with febrile UTI should be performed, with outcome measures set at 3 months or even longer, instead of the traditional 2–6 weeks.

Given the consistency of our findings and those of a recent study in Sweden, we conclude that women with febrile UTI, irrespective of disease severity and comorbidities, can be treated orally with 7 days of adequately dosed fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin was chosen as the treatment because of its reliable intestinal resorption, bioavailability, and excellent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of susceptible gram-negative uropathogens, making it a drug of choice in both outpatient and hospital settings. Additionally, its activity against Enterobacteriaceae colonizing the perineum and vagina may help to prevent early recurrences. An important concern has been the rise of ciprofloxacin resistance in the community; currently, up to 15% of Enterobacteriaceae are resistant in The Netherlands, potentially precluding the use of fluoroquinolones.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^1172okH4]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Women with fUTI can be successfully treated with antibiotics for 7 days, including those who initially were treated with β-lactams intravenously. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days when considering short-term clinical cure. However, during long-term follow-up, even in men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 14 days.

It should be considered that the primary outcome measures for future trials on antibiotic treatment duration of fUTI in men should be set at 3 months instead of the traditional 2 weeks.

### Nitrofurantoin [^113dDvwq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antimicrobial agent with activity against certain Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of nitrofurantoin is unusual among antibacterials. Nitrofurantoin is reduced by bacterial flavoproteins to reactive intermediates which inactivate or alter bacterial ribosomal proteins and other macromolecules. As a result of such inactivations, the vital biochemical processes of protein synthesis, aerobic energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis are inhibited. Nitrofurantoin is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses. The broad-based nature of this mode of action may explain the lack of acquired bacterial resistance to nitrofurantoin, as the necessary multiple and simultaneous mutations of the target macromolecules would likely be lethal to the bacteria.

- **Interactions with other antibiotics**: Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between nitrofurantoin and quinolone antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.

- **Development of resistance**: Development of resistance to nitrofurantoin has not been a significant problem since its introduction in 1953. Cross-resistance with antibiotics and sulfonamides has not been observed, and transferable resistance is, at most, a very rare phenomenon. Nitrofurantoin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections:

### Nitrofurantoin [^1158nAjS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients should be advised to take nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) with food to further enhance tolerance and improve drug absorption. They should complete the full course of therapy; however, they are advised to contact their physician if any unusual symptoms occur during therapy.

Many patients who cannot tolerate microcrystalline nitrofurantoin are able to take nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) without nausea. Patients should be advised not to use antacid preparations containing magnesium trisilicate while taking nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals).

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals), should only be used to treat bacterial infections as they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by nitrofurantoin (macrocrystals) or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever).

### Furadantin [^1151Cp6Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Furadantin is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients 1 month of age and older, specifically for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species.

- **Limitations of use**: Furadantin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Usage**: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Furadantin and other antibacterial drugs, Furadantin should only be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Furadantin is a nitrofuran antibacterial indicated for treating urinary tract infections in adults and pediatric patients 1 month of age and older, specifically those caused by susceptible bacteria.

### Reversible lung fibrosis in a 6-year-old girl after long term nitrofurantoin treatment [^1146opcB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pulmonary side effects, including lung fibrosis, are well known in elderly patients treated with long-term nitrofurantoin to prevent urinary tract infections and secondary renal injury. However, such pulmonary side effects have rarely been reported in pediatric cases, despite nitrofurantoin being a first-line prophylactic treatment for childhood urinary tract infection.

- **Case presentation**: A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, general fatigue, loss of appetite, and the need for nasal oxygen treatment after long-term nitrofurantoin treatment. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed lung fibrosis, and a biopsy confirmed this diagnosis. We suspected the fibrosis was caused by the nitrofurantoin treatment. Thorough examinations revealed no other explanations. Nitrofurantoin was discontinued, and the girl was treated with methylprednisolone. After 17 months, a new scan and lung function test showed total regression of the lung fibrosis.

- **Conclusions**: This case underlines that the risk of severe side effects should be taken into account before the initiation of long-term nitrofurantoin treatment in children.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^112SsJ43]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

For participants assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis, the drug used was chosen from nitrofurantoin (50 or 100 mg), trimethoprim (100 mg), or cefalexin (250 mg), given orally once daily depending on previous urine culture results and individuals' history of allergy or intolerance. Methenamine hippurate was prescribed as a twice-daily oral dose (1 g). Participants were allowed to switch between antibiotic drugs or between treatment strategies; however, the need to adhere to the allocated intervention was emphasized. Participants experiencing symptomatic UTI episodes were advised to seek discrete treatment courses of antibiotics in their usual way, typically via their general practitioner.

Follow-up assessments took place every three months until month 18. At each visit, participants were asked about the occurrence of any UTIs, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Information on UTI episodes was confirmed where necessary from healthcare records. Blood samples were taken to monitor kidney and liver function in all participants. Urine samples were submitted to the central laboratory at baseline, at scheduled three-monthly visits, and at the time of UTI episodes. Optional perineal swabs were submitted at baseline and at six-monthly routine visits. Participants completed symptom questionnaires every three months and at the time of symptomatic UTI.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: A pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^113BEzPi]. BMC Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with the absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least a 2-point improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without the need for additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI).

Secondary outcome measures included bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. Additionally, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups: men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, and patients with bacteremic UTI.

Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria, indicated by pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture, combined with the disappearance of leucocyturia.

### Nitrofurantoin neuropathy: a forgotten adverse effect [^112X6s8H]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Nitrofurantoin is a widely prescribed antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. Unknown in the obstetric and gynecologic literature is the complication of peripheral neuropathy as an adverse effect.

- **Case**: We describe a patient who developed a severe sensory neuropathy after taking nitrofurantoin intermittently and then continuously over a 7-year period. She recovered almost completely after its discontinuation.

- **Conclusion**: Peripheral neuropathy is a rare and potentially reversible adverse effect, unreported in the obstetric and gynecologic literature, and commonly unrecognized by physicians who prescribe it.

### Nitrofurantoin's efficacy and safety as prophylaxis for urinary tract infections: A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of controlled trials [^112jTMuX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Nitrofurantoin has been used for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI) for over 60 years. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess its efficacy and safety in the prophylaxis of UTI.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review of all controlled trials in humans assessing nitrofurantoin for UTI prophylaxis published from 1946 to 2015. We further reviewed population-level cohort studies evaluating nitrofurantoin's toxicity. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on controlled trials.

- **Results**: Twenty-six controlled trials including 3,052 patients fulfilled entry criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and toxicity, and 16 population-level cohort studies were identified for review of toxicity. Overall quality was poor, with all studies at increased risk for various biases. When compared with no prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI (risk ratio 0.38 in favour of nitrofurantoin, 95% CI 0.30–0.48). Its prophylactic efficacy is superior to that of methenamine hippurate and comparable to that of other antibacterials. Compared with patients receiving other antibacterials, those receiving nitrofurantoin had an increased risk of 2.24 (95% CI 1.77–2.83) for a non-severe adverse effect. In all controlled trials, only one patient experienced a severe adverse effect (interstitial pneumonia). Cohort studies reported severe adverse effect frequencies of 0.02–1.5 per 1,000 nitrofurantoin users.

- **Conclusions**: Nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI. Its use may be beneficial in certain circumstances, though the overall quality and increased risk of biases should be considered.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: Longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^111zxeUU]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Data collection: We retrieved annual information on recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim can be used in different dosages and treatment durations, as well as for UTI prophylaxis. The Dutch GP UTI guideline recommends for an uncomplicated UTI treatment — first, nitrofurantoin (ATC code: J01XE01) as a dose of 200 mg/day for 5 days, either 100 mg in a controlled release tablet twice daily for 5 days or 50 mg in a regular tablet four times per day; second, fosfomycin (J01XX01) as a one-off dose of 3 g; and third, trimethoprim (J01EA01) as a dose of 300 mg once daily for 3 days.

Data analysis: The number of women with dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim in each year of follow-up was divided by the total number of included women with a first dispensing in 2012. The number of women with dispensing in 2012 and in the follow-up years was stratified by age categories. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data with SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

### Nitrofurantoin 100 mg versus 50 mg prophylaxis for urinary tract infections, a cohort study [^113a5pGG]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines do not distinguish between 50 mg or 100 mg nitrofurantoin as daily prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), although 50 mg might have a better safety profile. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness and safety of both regimens. Data were retrospectively collected from 84 Dutch general practitioner practices between 2013 and 2020. Nitrofurantoin prescriptions of 100 mg and 50 mg every 24 hours in women were included. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios on the first episode of UTI, pyelonephritis, and adverse events. Patients were followed for the duration of consecutive repeated prescriptions, assuming non-informative right censoring, up to 1 year.

Nitrofurantoin prophylaxis was prescribed in 1893 patients. Median lengths of follow-up were 90 days (interquartile range (IQR) 37–179 days) for 100 mg (n = 551) and 90 days (IQR 30–146 days) for 50 mg (n = 1342) with few differences in baseline characteristics between populations. Under 100 mg and 50 mg, 82/551 (14.9%) and 199/1342 (14.8%) developed UTI and 46/551 (8.3%) and 81/1342 (6.0%) developed pyelonephritis, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios of 100 mg versus 50 mg were 1.01 (95% CI 0.78–1.30) on first UTI, 1.37 (95% CI 0.95–1.98) on first pyelonephritis episode, 1.82 (95% CI 1.20–2.74) on first consultation for cough, 2.68 for dyspnoea (95% CI 1.11–6.45), and 2.43 for nausea (95% CI 1.03–5.74).

Daily prophylaxis for recurrent UTI with 100 mg instead of 50 mg nitrofurantoin was associated with an equivalent hazard on UTI or pyelonephritis.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline [^115fXgm6]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women, particularly in relation to the choice of antibiotics, the AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend administering nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, or fosfomycin. The selection of these antibiotics should depend on local antibiogram data as first-line therapy for symptomatic patients with rUTIs.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115Aib5q]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

The primary clinical outcome measure was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTI episodes self-reported by participants over the 12-month treatment period. An episode of UTI was defined as the presence of at least one symptom reported by patients or clinicians from a predefined list produced by Public Health England, together with the taking of a discrete treatment course of antibiotics for UTI. Consequently, the occurrence of the primary outcome was always defined by the independent prescribing clinician via confirmation of the likely diagnosis and recommendation of antibiotic treatment. The end of one UTI episode was defined as 14 days after the final antibiotic dose. If symptoms restarted or further antibiotics were prescribed within 14 days, this event was counted as the same episode.

Secondary outcomes were the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTI in the six months after treatment; microbiologically confirmed UTIs; antibiotic resistance profiles in Escherichia coli isolated from urine and perineal swabs; asymptomatic bacteriuria; total antibiotic use; and hospital admissions due to UTI. Participant satisfaction with treatment was measured using the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication, which assessed four domains of treatment satisfaction: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction.

Microbiologically confirmed UTIs were episodes defined as per the primary outcome but with an additional criterion of a positive urine culture at the time of UTI. A positive urine culture was defined as one isolate of…

### The bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility in female recurrent urinary tract infection: How different they are from sporadic single episodes [^113Lq7q2]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

To analyze and compare the etiological uropathogens and the susceptibility profile findings on urine culture between sporadic cases of community-acquired, uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and recurrent UTI (reUTI) cases in women, we conducted a retrospective analysis. The study examined clinical data from 1629 women with uncomplicated UTI, evaluated at our hospital between January 2007 and December 2012. Patients were divided into two groups: those with no recurrent UTI and those with recurrent UTI. We analyzed the microbiological findings and compared susceptibility profiles between these groups.

A total of 420 women were included in the study, with group 1 consisting of 233 (55.5%) patients and group 2 comprising 187 (44.5%) patients. Escherichia coli was identified as the most common agent in both groups (76.4% and 74.3%, respectively; p = 0.625). Staphylococcus saprophyticus (8.2%) was the second most common in group 1, while Enterococcus faecalis was the second most common in group 2 (8.0%). Nitrofurantoin was the only oral agent that maintained the susceptibility profile in both groups, with rates of 87.1% and 88.7%, respectively (P = 0.883). For E. coli infections, only nitrofurantoin and amoxicillin/clavulanate maintained susceptibility rates above 90% in both groups.

UTI episodes in patients with recurrent UTI had similar bacterial spectra but different susceptibility profiles compared with those from patients with non-recurrent infections. The susceptibility rate for nitrofurantoin in patients with recurrent UTI remained high and comparable to that observed in patients with sporadic UTI, reinforcing its indication for use.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in English primary care: Cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^1174z6KP]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

For two of the antibiotic indications we studied, treatment was frequently prescribed for shorter durations than recommended — both urinary tract infections in men: acute cystitis and acute prostatitis. This could arise because prescribers appreciate that recommendations for these conditions are based on expert opinion and historical precedent rather than evidence, and that treatment durations for urinary tract infections in women have declined considerably in recent years. It needs to be established whether shorter treatment durations are effective for men with urinary tract infections, as this is a small but important patient population with a risk of harm from under-treatment. Notably, the conditions for which course durations tended to be less than recommended in the guidelines were those for which evidence supporting the duration of treatment is weak (supplementary figures S5-S7).

In general, the preference seemed to be for antibiotic prescriptions with durations of five or seven days or multiples thereof, without a clear evidence base for this preference. The preference for such durations has been observed previously in other settings and depended more on local practice and subspecialty than on clinical features such as fever, comorbidities, and severity. In addition, for conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation is substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^115LYoAc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Similar to prior findings, in our data, the most common nonsusceptibility patterns included nonsusceptibility to penicillins and TMP-SMZ (9%), nonsusceptibility to penicillins and nitrofurantoin (6%), and MDR involving penicillins (9%). Although nitrofurantoin resistance remained low in most settings since 2000 (∼2%), we observed a high prevalence of nonsusceptibility to nitrofurantoin (> 14%). Increased use of nitrofurantoin among the recommended first-line antibiotics for UTI may help explain the high nonsusceptibility. The change in susceptibility may also be explained by change in causative bacteria (e.g. decreasing proportion with E. coli and increasing proportion with Klebsiella). Also, our definition of "nonsusceptibility" included "intermediate". Of all isolates nonsusceptible to ≥ 1 antibiotic class, about 9% were "intermediate". Among isolates nonsusceptible to nitrofurantoin, about half were "intermediate". As such, varying definitions of antibiotic resistance used in previous studies (e.g. definition of "nonsusceptibility" with or without including "intermediate") may partially explain the difference.

Less is known about antibiotic resistance of reUTI (rUTI). Studies have shown that most recurrences have been associated with specific antibiotic resistance traits and sequence types. A study of rUTIs in nursing home residents showed that the recurrences were caused by both the same and different strains of E. coli or other uropathogens. In our data on UTI recurrences, we observed that the prevalence of both single antibiotic nonsusceptibility and MDR gradually…

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade due to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have shown high rates of guideline-discordant treatment, with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to assess the concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

- **Study design**: A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, aged 18 to 75 years, were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

### Oral gepotidacin versus nitrofurantoin in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection (EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3): two randomised, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3, non-inferiority trials [^112UsGfP]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

The EAGLE-2 study, published by Florian Wagenlehner and colleagues in the journal Lancet in 2024, focuses on acute cystitis. The primary question addressed was whether gepotidacin is noninferior to nitrofurantoin in treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).

This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial included 607 female participants. Inclusion criteria required that participants be adolescent or adult females with uncomplicated UTIs. Key exclusion criteria encompassed residence in nursing homes or dependent care-type facilities, a history of sensitivity to study treatments, an immunocompromised state, COPD, acute porphyria, any surgical or medical condition, and G6PD deficiency.

The interventions were:

- **Gepotidacin group**: n = 320, with an oral dose of 1,500 mg BID for 5 days.
- **Nitrofurantoin group**: n = 287, with an oral dose of 100 mg BID for 5 days.

The primary outcome focused on the difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in therapeutic success (50.6% vs. 47%; AD 4.3%, 95% CI -3.6 to 12.1). Secondary outcomes revealed:

- **No significant difference in clinical success**: 65.6% vs. 65.2%; AD 1.2%, 95% CI -6.3 to 8.7.
- **No significant difference in microbiological success**: 72.5% vs. 67.6%; AD 5.2%, 95% CI -2.1 to 12.5.

The study concluded that in adolescent and adult female patients with uncomplicated UTIs, gepotidacin was noninferior to nitrofurantoin with respect to therapeutic success.

### Prevention of urinary tract infections in nursing homes: Lack of evidence-based prescription [^111ojtRN]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs, including upper and lower symptomatic) are the most common infections in nursing homes. Prevention may reduce patient suffering, antibiotic use, and resistance. The spectrum of agents used in preventing UTIs in nursing homes is scarcely documented. The aim of this study was to explore which agents are prescribed for this purpose.

- **Methods**: We conducted a one-day, point-prevalence study in 44 Norwegian nursing homes during April-May 2006. Nursing home residents prescribed any agent for UTI prophylaxis were included. Information recorded was type of agent and dose, patient age and gender, together with nursing home characteristics. Appropriateness of prophylactic prescribing was evaluated with references to evidence in the literature and national guidelines.

- **Results**: The study included 1473 residents. Eighteen percent (n = 269) of the residents had at least one agent recorded as prophylaxis for UTI, varying between 0–50% among the nursing homes. Methenamine was used by 48% of residents prescribed prophylaxis, vitamin C by 32%, and cranberry products by 10%. Estrogens were used by 30%, but only one third was for vaginal administration. Trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin were used as prophylaxis by 5% and 4%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The agents frequently prescribed to prevent UTIs in Norwegian nursing homes, such as methenamine and vitamin C, lack documented efficacy. Recommended agents like trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, and vaginal estrogens are infrequently used. We conclude that the prescribing of prophylactic agents for UTIs in nursing homes is not aligned with current recommendations.

### Interaction between antibiotic resistance, resistance genes, and treatment response for urinary tract infections in primary care [^112hByhW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Among the isolates, high proportions were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (86%), ceftibuten (91%), nitrofurantoin (87%), and fosfomycin (98%). However, less than 80% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (76%), levofloxacin (76%), and co-trimoxazole (74%). Isolates also demonstrated high susceptibility to parenterally administered antibiotics, with a minimum susceptibility of 89% for gentamicin. Using data exclusively from female participants yielded similar results, as referenced in Table S1 in the supplemental material, but the numbers were insufficient for a corresponding assessment in males.

- **Factors associated with resistance**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance was positively associated with Indian ethnicity (versus Chinese), physician-diagnosed UTI in the past 12 months, hospitalization in the past 6 months, and diabetes mellitus. Ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and ceftriaxone resistance were positively associated with recent UTIs, hospitalization, or genitourinary abnormalities for all three. Age group was associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. The use of antibiotics in the past four weeks was associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole, and a history of diabetes mellitus was linked with resistance to ceftriaxone only.

### Reversible lung fibrosis in a 6-year-old girl after long term nitrofurantoin treatment [^113iMC5x]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pulmonary side effects, including lung fibrosis, are well known in elderly patients treated with long-term nitrofurantoin to prevent urinary tract infections and secondary renal injury. However, these side effects are rarely reported in pediatric cases, despite nitrofurantoin being a first-line prophylactic treatment for childhood urinary tract infections.

- **Case presentations**: A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, general fatigue, loss of appetite, and a need for nasal oxygen treatment following long-term nitrofurantoin treatment. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed lung fibrosis, which was confirmed by a biopsy. We suspected the fibrosis was caused by the nitrofurantoin treatment and thorough examinations revealed no other explanations. Nitrofurantoin was discontinued, and the girl was treated with methylprednisolone. After 17 months, a new scan and lung function test showed total regression of the lung fibrosis.

- **Conclusions**: This case underscores the importance of considering the risk of severe side effects before initiating long-term nitrofurantoin treatment in children.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection but is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI traditionally involves a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or trimethoprim (TMP) alone for patients with sulfa allergies.

Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin.

Factors to consider in selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence within the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. Additionally, there are special considerations in managing UTIs among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Furadantin [^117JL87X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following outlines the recommended dosage and administration for Furadantin:

- **Dosage & administration for adult patients**: The recommended dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg of Furadantin, taken four times a day. For uncomplicated urinary tract infections, the lower dosage level is recommended. In long-term suppressive therapy for adults, a reduction to 50 mg to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. This should be balanced with the potential for systemic toxicity and development of antibacterial resistance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4, 5.6)]. Administer Furadantin with food to enhance drug absorption and tolerance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Dosage & administration for pediatric patients (1 month of age and older)**: Pediatric patients aged 1 month and older should receive 5 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, divided into four doses. This medication is contraindicated for patients under one month of age. As with adults, administer Furadantin with food to improve drug absorption and tolerance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Table 1, which is not shown here, lists individual dosage volumes for two different strengths of Furadantin (25 mg/5 mL and 50 mg/5 mL) based on pediatric body weight. It is crucial to measure the correct pediatric doses accurately.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^115EfgMh]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

At baseline, the groups did not differ in frequency of antimicrobial resistance of urinary isolates to eight oral antibiotics that are commonly used for UTI treatment. During the 12-month trial, resistance appeared more common in isolates that were cultured from urine submitted during symptomatic UTIs by participants in the prophylaxis group than those in the control group (see Figure 2).

In urine samples submitted during asymptomatic periods between months 9 and 12 of the trial, resistance to nitrofurantoin (12 [24%] of 51 participants with at least one isolate from the prophylaxis group vs. six [9%] of 64 participants with at least one isolate from the control group; p = 0.038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 participants vs. 21 [33%] of 64 participants; p = 0.0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 participants vs. 15 [24%] of 62 participants; p = 0.002) was significantly more frequent in the prophylaxis group than the control group.

Over the baseline and subsequent 3-monthly intervals during the 12-month trial period, resistance to amoxicillin (38 [52%] of 73 participants, 25 [74%] of 34 participants, 31 [82%] of 38 participants, 32 [74%] of 43 participants, and 37 [76%] of 49 participants; p = 0.004), cephalexin (11 [14%] of 78 participants, ten [25%] of 40 participants, 13 [32%] of 41 participants, 17 [38%] of 45 participants, and 16 [31%] of 51 participants; p = 0.005), co-trimoxazole (18 [25%] of 73 participants, 23 [59%] of 39 participants, 14 [37%] of 38 participants, 21 [48%] of 44 participants, 26 [53%] of 49 participants; p = 0.006), and trimethoprim (32 [42%] of 77 participants, 31…

### Antibiotics dispensed to privately insured pregnant women with urinary tract infections - United States, 2014 [^112ph6V3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

According to 2011 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, nonpregnant women with uncomplicated UTIs should be treated with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. For pregnant women in their first trimester, a 2011 committee opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin may be prescribed only if other antimicrobial therapies are deemed clinically inappropriate. In this analysis, 34.7% of pregnant women with UTIs in 2014 filled a prescription for nitrofurantoin, and 7.6% filled a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during their first trimester of pregnancy.

Few estimates of UTI treatment of pregnant women are available, though the estimate is similar to a previous report of approximately 700 mothers of liveborn infants without major birth defects enrolled in a large, multisite, population-based case-control study of risk factors for major birth defects from 1997 to 2011. In that study, approximately 6.7% of pregnant women reported at least one UTI from the month before conception through the third month of pregnancy, and two-thirds (66.6%) reported antibiotic treatment, similar to the prevalence observed in this analysis.

The estimates of antibiotic treatment for UTIs during the 3 months before LMP are similar to estimates from previous studies of nonpregnant women. A 2003 study examined approximately 13,000 claims among women aged 18–75 years with acute cystitis enrolled in a preferred provider care organization during 1997–1999.

### The use of nitrofurantoin for children with acute cystitis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli [^1136Ym86]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Acute cystitis in children caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) is on the rise. Treatment of these infections typically involves parenteral therapy. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of oral nitrofurantoin treatment in children with lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by ESBL-producing E. coli.

- **Methods**: Fifty children with lower UTIs due to ESBL-producing E. coli were prospectively studied. Demographic data, clinical condition, laboratory values, treatment regimens, and complications of the patients were recorded. Urine samples were obtained by transurethral catheterization or clean catch, and urine bags were not used for specimen collection for culture. Patients with lower UTIs due to ESBL-producing E. coli and found to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin were given oral nitrofurantoin. Patients were re-evaluated 3–4 days after the end of treatment, and renal scintigraphy was performed 1–3 months after the end of treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 50 pediatric patients (48 females and 2 males) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 7.5 ± 3.96 years (range, 1–17 years). The duration of nitrofurantoin treatment was 10 days. Bacteriological response was observed in 49 of 50 patients (98%). No patient exhibited symptoms after treatment. No significant side-effects were observed in any of the patients. All patients had normal serum creatinine values. Renal scintigraphic studies, performed in all patients 1–3 months after completion of treatment, demonstrated non-scarring in 48 of 50 patients.

### Prevention of urinary tract infections in nursing homes: Lack of evidence-based prescription [^116WMGQ5]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the elderly include both upper and lower symptomatic UTIs. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, and there is a wide consensus that this should not be treated. Guidelines have been developed for diagnostic criteria and the treatment of UTIs. In spite of this, studies show that a large proportion of antibacterial use in nursing homes may be inappropriate.

Nursing home residents frequently have infections, and the prevalence is estimated to be 6–8%. UTIs account for around half of these infections, and the estimates are similar irrespective of differences in study design. In Norway, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens has been relatively stable in the last decade. The antimicrobial resistance pattern and health policy influence the national guidelines, and pivmecillinam, trimethoprim, and nitrofurantoin are the drugs of choice for the treatment of acute symptomatic UTIs in Norway. Quinolones are only recommended in cases of resistance or in upper UTIs.

As a consequence of the high frequency of UTIs in nursing homes, several prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs (reUTIs) are suggested. In addition to infection control programs and the appropriate use of urinary catheters, the use of prophylactic agents has been regarded as important. The use of prophylactic treatments for UTIs is commonly studied in subpopulations with risk factors such as catheter use or urine reflux. These risk factors are prevalent in nursing homes, but little is known about UTI prophylaxis in these institutions. There is evidence that prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics and vagina…

The study EAGLE-3, published by Florian Wagenlehner and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet, is related to acute cystitis. The trial question was whether gepotidacin is superior to nitrofurantoin in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: 541 female patients. Inclusion criteria included adolescent and adult female patients with uncomplicated UTIs.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Residence in nursing homes or dependent care-type facilities; history of sensitivity to study treatments; immunocompromised state; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); acute porphyria; any surgical or medical condition; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 277 received gepotidacin (an oral dose of 1,500 mg BID for 5 days).
	- n = 264 received nitrofurantoin (an oral dose of 100 mg BID for 5 days).

- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in therapeutic success was observed (58.5% vs. 43.6%; absolute difference 14.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.4 to 22.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in clinical success (67.9% vs. 63.3%; absolute difference 4.4%, 95% CI -3.5 to 12.3).
	- Significant increase in microbiological success (72.2% vs. 57.2%; absolute difference 15%, 95% CI 7.2 to 22.9).

The conclusion was that in adolescent and adult female patients with uncomplicated UTIs, gepotidacin was superior to nitrofurantoin with respect to therapeutic success.

### Competitive fitness of asymptomatic bacteriuria strain 83972 against uropathogens in human urine [^115y8LMd]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection, affecting approximately 150 million people globally each year. UTI begins when bacteria enter the urethra and ascend to the urinary bladder, causing bladder infection (cystitis). Once in the bladder, these uropathogens can ascend to the kidneys, triggering pyelonephritis and potentially leading to renal damage and/or dissemination to the blood (bacteremia/sepsis). Women are significantly more prone to UTIs than men, with 40% of women experiencing clinical UTI at least once in their lives. Clinically, UTIs are classified as either uncomplicated or complicated. Complicated UTIs occur in individuals with conditions such as anatomical urinary tract abnormalities, compromised immune systems, renal transplants, pregnancy, or a history of recurrent UTI (reUTI). ReUTI is a major clinical problem that often leads to repeated and extended use of antibiotics, which do not always prevent recurrence.

The main causative agent of UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), responsible for 65%–70% of all UTIs. Other clinically significant uropathogens include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Group B Streptococcus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida spp. Depending on the genetic composition of the E. coli strain and host factors, colonization of the urinary tract could result in UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). Genomes of UPEC strains encode significant virulence factors.

### Oral antibiotics to prevent postoperative urinary tract infection: A randomized controlled trial [^115rnjZa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate whether nitrofurantoin prophylaxis prevents postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients receiving transurethral catheterization after pelvic reconstructive surgery.

-In **Methods**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Participants undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery were randomized to receive 100 mg nitrofurantoin or a placebo once daily during catheterization. This was applicable if they were: 1) discharged with a transurethral Foley or performing intermittent self-catheterization, or 2) hospitalized overnight with a transurethral Foley. The primary outcome was treatment for clinically suspected or culture-proven UTI within 3 weeks of surgery. Statistical analysis was performed using χ² and logistic regression. Assuming 80% power at a P value of .05, 156 participants were needed to demonstrate a two-thirds reduction in UTI.

-In **Results**: Among 159 participants, 81 (51%) received nitrofurantoin, and 78 (49%) received a placebo. No significant differences were found in baseline demographics, intraoperative characteristics, duration and type of catheterization, or postoperative hospitalization, except for a lower rate of hysterectomy in the nitrofurantoin group. Nitrofurantoin prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of UTI treatment within 3 weeks of surgery (22% UTI with nitrofurantoin compared with 13% UTI with placebo, relative risk 1.73, 95% confidence interval 0.85–3.52, P = 0.12). UTI treatment was higher in premenopausal women, lower in diabetics, and increased with longer duration of catheterization.

Recommending nitrofurantoin to treat uncomplicated cystitis was associated with increased nitrofurantoin use from 3.53 to 4.01 prescriptions per 1,000 outpatient visits. However, nitrofurantoin resistance in E. coli isolates remained stable at 2%. Concomitant levofloxacin resistance was a significant risk for nitrofurantoin resistance in E. coli isolates (odds ratio [OR], 2.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–7.17).

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^116gKAa7]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Reductions in clinically diagnosed UTIs during the treatment period were in line with previously published results from systematic reviews and were similar in both arms, confirming efficacy for both treatments. Around half of all participants were UTI-free during the treatment period, with a UTI-free rate of 43% for the methenamine hippurate group and 54% for the antibiotics group.

Microbiological testing of urine samples during the treatment period showed that using a positive urine culture as a criterion for UTI diagnosis would have failed to capture around half (48%) of all patient-reported episodes treated with antibiotics. This proportion is in line with results from another trial, which reported that only 58% of clinical UTIs were confirmed by a positive urine culture. The discordance between clinical and microbiological UTI definitions suggests that a clinical definition of UTI is better aligned with actual clinical practice, given that most urinary tract infections are treated before the results of microbiological cultures are available. Furthermore, some guidelines now encourage symptom-based diagnosis of UTI and recommend moving away from reliance on microbiological culture. The latest Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network publication underlines this, stating that "Routine urine culture is not required to manage LUTI [lower urinary tract infection] in women" and "Women with symptomatic LUTI should receive empirical antibiotic treatment".

The two trial treatments are licensed for UTI prevention; therefore, as expected, the adverse event rate was low. Only two serious adverse events were reported.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of single-dose levofloxacin with single-dose fosfomycin pre-urodynamic study related to the incidence of urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^114Guh3P]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

These results were further supported by a female-focused systematic review conducted by Benseler et al. in 2020. The review analyzed three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 325 women and found that antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the rate of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies (pooled 5/206 vs. 8/119; OR ≈ 0.47). However, due to very low event counts, the effect on symptomatic urinary tract infections remained inconclusive (2/206 vs. 3/119). A sub-analysis of the individual studies identified levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin as the most effective agents, with levofloxacin in particular reducing bacteriuria cases from 6/63 in the placebo group to 1/59 in the prophylaxis group.

Local evidence echoes these findings: a randomized controlled trial by Rahardjo et al. (2016) conducted in our own setting demonstrated a markedly lower post-UDS UTI rate with levofloxacin prophylaxis (12.7%) versus placebo (28.6%; p = 0.028), against an overall baseline incidence of 20.6%. Although the newest EAU guidance advises against fluoroquinolone prophylaxis because of growing resistance, levofloxacin was retained in our protocol because, at the time of study initiation, it was the agent most widely available, supported by local susceptibility patterns, and familiar to practicing clinicians.

Taken together, the global evidence from Wu et al, the sex-specific analysis by Benseler et al, and our own institutional RCT provided a cogent rationale for incorporating single-dose levofloxacin prophylaxis when this study was launched.

### Evaluation of MicroScan and VITEK 2 systems for susceptibility testing of Enterobacterales with updated breakpoints [^114ejPG2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Nitrofurantoin CA was low on both systems, and CLSI has made no updates to the breakpoints initially established for this drug. Although updating breakpoints is a burden for clinical laboratories and device manufacturers, the process ultimately helps improve device performance. The clinical data supporting nitrofurantoin breakpoints to guide treatment of uncomplicated UTIs are limited, which explains why the EUCAST guidance for Enterobacterales restricts the application of nitrofurantoin breakpoints to E. coli causing uncomplicated UTIs. Only two of the VITEK and MicroScan nitrofurantoin minor errors in our study occurred for E. coli, with the rest spread across multiple species: 4 or 6 C. koseri, 1 C. freundii complex, 7 E. cloacae complex, 3 K. aerogenes, 2 K. oxytoca (VITEK only), 8 or 17 K. pneumoniae, 2 or 1 M. morganii, and 1 S. marcescens (MicroScan only). Most of the nitrofurantoin minor errors were due to the commercial system undercalling the result (22/30 for VITEK; 28/38 for MicroScan). An elevated minor error rate for nitrofurantoin was reported in an earlier VITEK study.

Cefepime error rates were similar for the two systems despite the lower EA observed on VITEK 2 (84.3%) compared to MicroScan (91.0%). The lower range of cefepime MICs that can be reported on VITEK (≤ 0.12 µg/mL) contributed to the lower EA. Seven of the VITEK cefepime results outside of EA were MICs ≤ 1.0 µg/mL below the MicroScan lowest calling range of ≤ 2.0 µg/mL, which is the susceptible breakpoint. The 18 MicroScan cefepime errors were all overcalling resistance, with 1 major and 17 minor errors.

### Clinical management of an increasing threat: Outpatient urinary tract infections due to multidrug-resistant uropathogens [^115H9zXq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly treated bacterial infections. Over the past decade, antimicrobial resistance has become an increasingly common factor in the management of outpatient UTIs. As treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogens are limited, clinicians need to be aware of specific clinical and epidemiological risk factors for these infections.

Based on available literature, the activity of fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin remains high for most cases of MDR Escherichia coli UTIs. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole retains clinical efficacy, but resistance rates are increasing internationally. Beta-lactam agents have the highest rates of resistance and lowest rates of clinical success. Fluoroquinolones have high resistance rates among MDR uropathogens and are being strongly discouraged as first-line agents for UTIs.

In addition to accounting for local resistance rates, consideration of patient risk factors for resistance and pharmacological principles will help guide optimal empiric treatment of outpatient UTIs.

### Multidrug resistance in urinary E. coli higher in males compared to females [^114qHwBg]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

MDR rates are expectedly higher in the hospital setting compared to the community, likely due to the higher complexity of patients presenting for tertiary care, whereas uncomplicated UTIs are largely diagnosed and managed in the community. Our findings of increasing MDR over time are alarming and reflect the increasing resistance globally. A study in the United States indicated that the prevalence of MDR urinary E. coli increased from 9.1 to 17.0% between 2001 and 2010. Similarly, in Australia, MDR rates increased from 4.5% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2012. In our study, MDR rates of 6.4% in the community and as high as 16.5% in the hospital are worrying since Australia is considered a low prevalence country for AMR.

Identifying the mechanisms of MDR was beyond the scope of this study. Increasing rates of MDR E. coli are associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and co-located resistance mechanisms on transferable plasmids. ESBL-producing E. coli have increased in Australia and have been found more commonly in urinary samples from men. Some of the risk factors associated with ESBL-producing E. coli infections include urinary stones, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, advanced age, prior surgeries, indwelling catheters, and recent prescription of antibiotics. Infections caused by MDR bacteria, including ESBLs, result in poorer clinical outcomes.

In the hospital setting, significantly higher AMR was seen in males compared to females for four of the five tested antibiotics, except trimethoprim. According to the national antibiotic guidelines, trimethoprim is recommended.

### Nitrofurantoin: cause of dress syndrome [^111zRPWh]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common pathological entity among elderly patients. The widespread use of antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs has gained many opponents, mainly due to the increasing drug resistance observed. Nitrofurantoin is a commonly used antibacterial drug because it has low side effects and a good anti-urinary bacterial profile. However, in this paper, we present a case of a nitrofurantoin-induced DRESS (drug reaction/rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome in a 77-year-old woman. During UTI treatment, the patient developed an acute skin rash which spread all over the body and a considerable decrease in urine volume. At the emergency department, we found her developing eosinophilic pneumonia, anaemia, and renal impairment that we relate to nitrofurantoin administration. To our knowledge, this is the second published case report which evokes nitrofurantoin as a possible cause of DRESS syndrome.

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice — an observational study [^115M7NUz]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

- **Susceptibility testing**: Susceptibility of E. coli as the main causative agent was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, showing low resistance rates of 4.5% and 2.2% respectively. In 17.5%, E. coli was resistant to trimethoprim (TMP) and in 8.5% to ciprofloxacin. In contrast to E. coli, other typical uropathogens showed higher resistance rates for TMP, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin (50%, 21.7%, 23.8%). Ciprofloxacin is equally effective against E. coli and other typical uropathogens with resistance rates of 8.7% and 8.1% respectively. Further results on susceptibility are presented in detail in Table 2.

- **Testing inconsistencies**: In a few cases, urine cultures were not tested for all the requested antibiotics. This issue mainly concerned trimethoprim, as only 130 out of 139 samples were tested, reflecting the lack of a standard in antibiotic testing among laboratories (see Table 2).

- **ReUTI**: Thirty-five patients had experienced a previous urinary tract infection in the last six months. Besides E. coli (29/35), causative pathogens in re-infections included Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In cases of reUTI, E. coli showed higher resistance rates against trimethoprim (25%) and ciprofloxacin (17%), while resistance rates for nitrofurantoin (3.4%) and fosfomycin (0%) remained very low.

Nitrofurantoin is reduced by a wide range of enzymes, including bacterial flavoproteins, to reactive intermediates, which are damaging to macromolecules such as DNA and proteins.

- **Resistance**: Nitrofurantoin is not active against most strains of Proteus species or Serratia species. It has no activity against Pseudomonas species. Although cross-resistance with other antibacterials may occur, cross-resistance with sulfonamides has not been observed.

- **Interaction with other antibacterials**: Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between nitrofurantoin and quinolones.

- **Antibacterial activity**: Nitrofurantoin has been shown to be active against most of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections:

	- **Aerobic bacteria**
		- **Gram-positive bacteria**: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species
		- **Gram-negative bacteria**: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter species, Klebsiella species

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Nitrofurantoin exhibits in vitro activity against the following bacteria; however, the safety and efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

- **Aerobic bacteria**
	- **Gram-positive bacteria**: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus), Streptococcus agalactiae, Viridans group streptococci
	- **Gram-negative bacteria**: Citrobacter koseri, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: Challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles used in the management of female patients. This includes the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.
