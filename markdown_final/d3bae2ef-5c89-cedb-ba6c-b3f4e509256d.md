## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the pressure of an ideal gas changes when the temperature is doubled and the volume is increased by a factor of 8, and which answer choice matches that result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ideal gas law and how to set up the before-and-after states. Then, I should verify the proportional relationships and compute the net effect on pressure. Next, I will double-check the arithmetic and make sure I'm not missing a factor. Finally, I will map the result to the answer choices and confirm the correct option with a quick sanity check.

> Let me first confirm the governing equation. For an ideal gas, the ideal gas law states PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, T is absolute temperature, n is the number of moles, and R is the gas constant. Since n and R are constant here, I can write the relationship as P ∝ T/V, which means pressure is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to volume [^01092705].

> Now, I will set up the initial and final states. Initially, let the pressure be P1, the volume be V1, and the temperature be T1. After the changes, the temperature becomes T2 = 2 × T1 and the volume becomes V2 = 8 × V1. I need to find the new pressure P2 in terms of P1 [^notfound].

> Next, I should apply the proportional relationship. Using P ∝ T/V, I can write P2/P1 = (T2/T1) × (V1/V2). Substituting the changes, that gives P2/P1 = (2T1/T1) × (V1/8V1) = 2 × (1/8) = 1/4. So, P2 = P1/4, which means the pressure decreases by a factor of 4 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the arithmetic so I don't jump to conclusions. Doubling temperature tends to double pressure, but increasing volume by a factor of 8 tends to reduce pressure by a factor of 8. Net effect is 2 divided by 8, which equals 1/4, confirming a fourfold decrease in pressure, not a sixteenfold decrease or any of the other options [^notfound].

> I should now match this to the choices. The pressure decreases by a factor of 4, which corresponds to option B. Options A, C, and D do not match this calculation, so they can be excluded [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should double-check the logic one more time to ensure I'm not overlooking anything. The derivation assumes constant moles of gas and ideal behavior, which is consistent with the problem statement. No additional constraints or non-ideal effects are introduced, so the proportional reasoning stands and the answer is robust [^01092705].

---

The pressure of an ideal gas **decreases by a factor of 4** when the temperature is doubled and the volume is increased by a factor of 8. This follows from the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where pressure is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to volume. Thus, doubling temperature alone would double pressure, but increasing volume eightfold reduces pressure eightfold; the net effect is a fourfold decrease in pressure.

---

## Step-by-step reasoning

### Initial state

The ideal gas law is **PV = nRT**, where:

- P = pressure
- V = volume
- T = temperature
- n = number of moles (constant)
- R = ideal gas constant (constant)

Initially, the pressure is **P₁**, the volume is **V₁**, and the temperature is **T₁**:

P₁V₁ = nRT₁

---

### Final state

After the changes:

- **Temperature doubles**: T₂ = 2T₁
- **Volume increases eightfold**: V₂ = 8V₁
- **New pressure**: P₂

The ideal gas law for the final state is:

P₂V₂ = nRT₂

Substitute the new values:

P₂(8V₁) = nR(2T₁)

---

### Solving for the new pressure

Divide both sides by 8V₁:

P₂ = (nR × 2T₁) / (8V₁)

Simplify:

P₂ = (2/8) × (nRT₁ / V₁)

Recognize that nRT₁ / V₁ = P₁:

P₂ = (2/8) × P₁ = (1/4) × P₁

---

### Conclusion

The new pressure **P₂ is one-fourth of the initial pressure P₁**, meaning the pressure decreases by a factor of 4.

---

## Answer

The correct answer is **B. P decreases by a factor of 4**.

Measurement of lung volumes: whole body plethysmography

Measurement principles

This section relates to constant volume plethysmography. The principle of whole body plethysmography is based on Boyle's law, which states that at a constant temperature, the volume (V) of a given mass of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its pressure (P), that is, PV = K. The constant (K) is proportional to the mass of the gas (the number of moles) and its absolute temperature. Assuming that temperature remains constant (isothermal conditions of measurement), the following mathematical expression is developed:

Determination of TGV is possible if the lungs can be treated as a closed compartment and if alveolar pressure can be measured simultaneously to the changes in volume. At the end of a tidal expiration, with the airway open (ie, at FRC), P ALV closely approximates P MOUTH, which is equal to atmospheric pressure. The lungs are made a closed compartment by closing a shutter at the mouth at the end of a tidal expiration. This prevents airflow. The patient is instructed to make gentle panting efforts with the shutter closed. This causes rarefaction of the gas in the lungs during inspiratory efforts (TGV↑, P ALV ↓) and compression of the gas in the lungs during expiratory efforts (TGV↓, P ALV ↑).

5 Temperature Effects

The tracheal mucosa can be used to monitor patient core temperature accurately in adults and children by using a thermocouple embedded in the cuff. If filled with ambient air, the ETT cuff temperature would initially be the same as the surrounding environment. It then approaches the patient's temperature over time in an ill‐defined manner. Since the tracheal mucosa's temperature is close to core temperature and the air in the ETT is warmed by the patient, the intracuff temperature would be expected to be close to that of the patient; however, this has never been studied. Notably, field temperatures might be much colder than that of the patient.

Air may be treated as an ideal gas at clinically relevant temperatures and pressures. According to the ideal gas law, the temperature of cuff air dramatically affects its pressure. Cuff pressure change (if the volume is not allowed to vary) is linearly proportional to the absolute temperature change of the cuff air. Measurements are not needed to understand the magnitude of the consequences. For example, a cuff at 20 cm H 2 O gauge pressure (1053 cm H 2 O absolute pressure) at 5°C will increase to 141 cm H 2 O gauge pressure as its temperature climbs to 37°C. Evidence of this is seen in patients undergoing induced hypothermia on cardiopulmonary bypass, who experience a linear decrease in cuff pressure as cooling progresses. This was noted first in adult cardiac operations and, 20 years later, in children. The temperature effect may explain some variation in results regarding cuff pressures in air transport studies. Saline and water do not appreciably expand or contract with temperature variation, so temperature effects on liquid‐filled cuffs would be minimal.

### A universal entropic pulling force caused by binding [^b1085409]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Forces in molecular systems can arise from various mechanisms, including not only van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds but also entropic forces –. Entropic forces are more prevalent than often assumed. A classic example is the pressure of an ideal gas, which arises purely from entropic effects: gas molecules expand to maximize their accessible volume, thereby increasing entropy. This mechanism directly yields the pressure equation: where n is the molecular number density, and T is temperature. Another illustrative example is the entropic force of a DNA chain. A free DNA chain naturally adopts a random coil conformation to maximize its conformational entropy, just like other polymers. Stretching the DNA chain requires overcoming an entropic force, because a stretched DNA has less conformational entropy. Based on this entropic mechanism, the force-extension equation can be derived, such as the Marko-Siggia formula, which has been experimentally validated through single-molecule techniques such as magnetic and optical tweezers.

In this work, we report a universal entropic pulling force arising from binding. We demonstrate its existence through theoretical analysis, validate it using simulations as well as macroscopic and molecular experiments, and discuss its biological significance.

### Dynamic void behavior in polymerizing polymethyl methacrylate cement [^862e2fcb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2006). Low credibility.

Cement mantle voids remain controversial with respect to survival of total hip arthroplasty. Void evolution is poorly understood, and attempts at void manipulation can only be empirical. We induced voids in a cement model simulating the constraints of the proximal femur. Intravoid pressure and temperature were recorded throughout polymerization, and the initial and final void volumes were measured. Temperature-dependent peak intravoid pressures and void volume increases were observed. After solidification, subatmospheric intravoid pressures were observed. The magnitude of these observations could not be explained by the ideal gas law. Partial pressures of the void gas at peak pressures demonstrated a dominant effect of gaseous monomer, thereby suggesting that void growth is a pressure-driven phenomenon resulting from temperature-dependent evaporation of monomer into existing trapped air voids.

### A metafluid with multistable density and internal energy States [^a1462652]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Internal energy

We now calculate the internal energy for all of the possible permutations { n I, n s, n II } of the suspension. For the current analysis, we neglect the compressibility of the external fluid and assume that all capsules are identical. Thus, the internal energy of the suspension is composed of the total energy of the ideal gas, denoted by U gas, and the energy of the multistable elastic capsules, denoted by U el.

The elastic energy U el of a bi-stable element i for the three possible phases is given by integration of (2) over v i, yieldingand the total elastic potential energy per-unit-mass is thus

To calculate U gas we assume an ideal gas model, p gas = ρ gas R T. For isothermal processes, we thus obtain the relation, where R is the specific gas constant, T is the constant temperature, m g is the mass of the gas within the capsule. For adiabatic processes, assuming ideal gas and isentropic compression/expansion, the gas pressure is given by, where p atm is atmospheric pressure, and v atm is the volume taken by the gas contained within a single capsule at atmospheric pressure. In the adiabatic case, the temperature of the gas within the capsules will change during pressure variations according to, but not the temperature of the external incompressible fluid. These spatial temperature variations may yield heat transfer between the gas, solid and liquid, and more complex dynamics. To allow simple treatment of this case, we assume in the current analysis that an adiabatic process corresponds to the more strict requirement of no heat transfer from the encapsulated gas.

### Universal equation of state for wave turbulence in a quantum gas [^a476dcf5]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Boyle's 1662 observation that the volume of a gas is, at constant temperature, inversely proportional to pressure, offered a prototypical example of how an equation of state (EoS) can succinctly capture key properties of a many-particle system. Such relationships are now cornerstones of equilibrium thermodynamics 1. Extending thermodynamic concepts to far-from-equilibrium systems is of great interest in various contexts, including glasses 2,3, active matter 4–7 and turbulence 8–11, but is in general an open problem. Here, using a homogeneous ultracold atomic Bose gas 12, we experimentally construct an EoS for a turbulent cascade of matter waves 13,14. Under continuous forcing at a large length scale and dissipation at a small one, the gas exhibits a non-thermal, but stationary, state, which is characterized by a power-law momentum distribution 15 sustained by a scale-invariant momentum-space energy flux 16. We establish the amplitude of the momentum distribution and the underlying energy flux as equilibrium-like state variables, related by an EoS that does not depend on the details of the energy injection or dissipation, or on the history of the system. Moreover, we show that the equations of state for a wide range of interaction strengths and gas densities can be empirically scaled onto each other. This results in a universal dimensionless EoS that sets benchmarks for the theory and should also be relevant for other turbulent systems.

Calculation of the lung volume subdivisions

Using the directly measurable values obtained from a spirometry manoeuvre and the indirectly measured lung volumes estimated by one of the techniques discussed in the following sections, the lung subdivisions can then be derived (figure 7):

Figure 7
Static lung volumes shown on a volume versus time spirogram. The blue line is the ideal curve and the red line(s) the erroneous curves. Source: ARTP Spirometry Handbook. BTPS, body temperature and pressure saturated.

TLC can be calculated as either TLC = RV+VC or TLC = FRC+IC.

RV is either RV = FRC–ERV or TLC–VC.

The former equation is preferable and ideally should be calculated from measurements performed without the patient disconnecting from the mouthpiece as the RV can be miscalculated in patients with significant obstruction when using the VC from a separate spirometric measurement.

Specific to whole body plethysmography

Thoracic gas volume

Thoracic gas volume (TGV) is the volume of compressible gas within the thorax at the time of airflow occlusion during plethysmographic measurement, which may be higher or lower than FRC depending on precisely where airflow occlusion occurs during the tidal breathing cycle.

FRC determined by whole body plethysmography

This is the volume of intrathoracic gas measured when airflow occlusion occurs at FRC. A correction may be applied to TGV to obtain FRC PLETH.

Alveolar dry gas pressure

Alveolar dry gas pressure (P ALV) is the pressure in the alveoli at any point throughout the respiratory cycle. ΔP ALV is the change in alveolar pressure. When the glottis is open with no airflow, P ALV is the difference between ambient P BOX and saturated water vapour pressure at body temperature (PH 2 O, sat).

Mouth pressure

Mouth pressure (P MOUTH) is the airway pressure measured at the mouth at any point throughout the respiratory cycle. ΔP MOUTH is the change in pressure measured at the mouth during panting against a closed shutter.

Box pressure

Box pressure (P BOX) is the pressure measured within the sealed body box at any point throughout the respiratory cycle. ΔP BOX is the change in pressure measured within the body box.

Shift volume

Shift volume (ΔV) is the change in TGV as determined from the change in plethysmographic gas pressure during compression and decompression of thoracic gas, expressed as a volume.

Flow

Flow (V̇) is measured at the mouth or via a transmural port which when integrated electronically or mathematically yields volume.

### Volume-guaranteed pressure-support ventilation facing acute changes in ventilatory demand [^7bd8e598]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare volume support ventilation (VSV) in which the pressure support level is continuously adjusted to deliver a preset tidal volume, with pressure support ventilation (PSV), in terms of patient behavior and ventilator response when ventilatory demand was increased by addition of dead space to the circuit.

Design and Setting

Randomized cross-over study in an intensive care unit university hospital.

Interventions

We assessed in ten patients being weaned off mechanical ventilation the effect of increasing the ventilatory demand by adding a heat-and-moisture exchanger to augment the dead space with a fixed level of PSV and VSV.

Measurements and Results

Arterial blood gases, breathing pattern, and respiratory effort parameters at the end of each of the four steps. Adding dead space significantly increased minute ventilation and PaCO2 values with both PSV and VSV. Indexes of respiratory effort (pressure-time index of respiratory muscles and work of breathing) increased with both ventilatory modes after dead-space augmentation. This increase was 2.5–4 times with VSV than with PSV and induced overt respiratory distress in two patients. The assistance delivered during VSV decreased significantly after dead-space augmentation, from 15.0 ± 6.5 to 9.1 ± 4.8 cmH2O, whereas no change occurred with PSV.

Conclusions

With a fixed level of VSV, but not of PSV, an increase in ventilatory demand results in a decrease in the pressure support provided by the ventilator, opposite to the desired response. VSV may conceivably result in respiratory distress in clinical settings.

Pressure-volume changes in the body are isothermal

An underlying assumption of the technique is that the pressure-volume changes in the body are isothermal. During inspiration, air is warmed and humidified to body temperature and pressure under saturated conditions (BTPS), and air is cooled during expiration. It is assumed that any heat generated by warm, expired air is instantaneously lost to the surrounding tissue, such that changes of alveolar volume will occur under isothermal conditions. However, during rarefaction and compression of gas within the plethysmograph, heat may or may not be lost through the walls of the container (ie, conditions within the plethysmograph are not isothermal). The plethysmograph must therefore be calibrated at an appropriate frequency to mimic respiratory efforts. The plethysmograph is also open to the atmosphere via a small leak with a mechanical time constant of between 5 and 25 s. This controlled leak minimises slowly occurring pressure changes that are not related to respiratory manoeuvres, such as thermal drift (heating) caused by the presence of a subject breathing and body heat within a closed chamber.

Linear behaviour between changes in P MOUTH and P ALV

The respiratory system comprises both elastic recoil forces and resistance forces; thus, a pressure change in the respiratory system will take a finite time to come to equilibrium. This time constant (τ) of the respiratory system is a function of the elastance/compliance and resistance of the system and is the time taken for 63% of a step change to stabilise.

Stiff lungs (low compliance) with a low resistance will therefore have a short τ and empty and fill rapidly, whereas lungs with normal/high compliance and high airways resistance will have a long τ and will empty/fill more slowly. The main assumption of body plethysmography is that changes in P MOUTH closely approximate changes in P ALV during respiratory efforts against an occlusion (ie, there is equilibration); however, in airflow obstruction (where there is a long τ) the P MOUTH and P ALV may not have time to equilibrate; hence, the change in P MOUTH may potentially underestimate the changes in P ALV in the presence of airways obstruction and overestimate total TGV.

### Quasi-equilibrium phase coexistence in single component supercritical fluids [^63cf0649]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In their supercritical state simple fluids are generally thought to assume a homogeneous phase throughout all combinations of pressures and temperatures, although various response functions or transport properties may exhibit anomalous behavior, characterizing a state point as either more gas-like or liquid-like, respectively. While a large body of results has been compiled in the last two decades regarding the details of the supercritical phase in thermodynamic equilibrium, far less studies have been dedicated to out-of-equilibrium situations that nevertheless occur along with the handling of substances such as carbon dioxide or Argon. Here we consider successive compression-expansion cycles of equal amounts of Argon injected into a high-pressure chamber, traversing the critical pressure at two times the critical temperature. Due to expansion cooling, the fluid temporarily becomes sub-critical, and light scattering experiments show the formation of sub-micron-sized droplets and nanometer-scale clusters, both of which are distinct from spontaneous density fluctuations of the supercritical background and persist for a surprisingly long time. A kinetic rate model of the exchange of liquid droplets with the smaller clusters can explain this behavior. Our results indicate non-equilibrium aspects of supercritical fluids that may prove important for their processing in industrial applications.

### How I optimize power to avoid VILI [^625c5198]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Mechanical ventilation is an inherently dynamic process. Nonetheless, tidal volume and static tidal airway pressures (plateau, PEEP, and their difference, the driving pressure) have long served as the primary variables guiding prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Despite their prominence in current practice, such non-dynamic pressures cannot act alone to inflict damage; a pressure must be paired with a volume change, thereby expending energy. More specifically, any instigator of damage couples pressure applied directly to the lung, i.e. transpulmonary pressure (stress), to the associated change of lung volume (strain). Because damage depends not only on the frequency of such pairings but also on the rate of tidal stress/strain development across the epithelium and within individual extracellular fibrils that oppose lung expansion, rapid flows accentuate VILI hazard.

Until recently, breathing frequency and duration of exposure have been underemphasized as contributors to VILI. As experimental data now indicate, however, more attention should be directed toward ventilating power, i.e. the product of energy delivered per tidal cycle and ventilating frequency, adjusted for the capacity of the lung to tolerate it. Non-mechanical factors, such as high inspired oxygen fraction, raised body temperature, and increased trans-alveolar gradients of pulmonary vascular pressure, increase vulnerability to VILI.

The total inflation energy of each tidal cycle is expended in overcoming flow resistive and elastic forces, both static and dynamic (Fig. 1). Total energy input per minute, usually defined as "power," is the product of minute ventilation (V E) and the sum of these same three tidal pressure components (flow resistive (FR = flow × resistance), DP, and PEEP). Primary emphasis is correctly placed on inflation, but expiration should not be ignored. Allowing sudden tidal deflations may accentuate VILI, perhaps due primarily to abrupt discharge of parenchymal energy.

### Dimension-reconfigurable bubble film nanochannel for wetting based sensing [^01092705]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The film thickness is also expected to be pH-dependent, as a higher pH value increases surface charge density and hence the electrostatic contribution to the disjoining pressure. We characterized the conductance of the film nanochannel per unit length for pH values ranging from 8.5 to 3, similar as above. The results in Fig. 3c demonstrate for a 10-mM KCl solution that the conductance decreases nearly an order of magnitude in this pH range, as well as the calculated channel height in Fig. 3d (32 nm to 10 nm). The lowest pH value is close to the isoelectric point of both glass surface (pH 2.8 ± 0.2) and air/water surface (pH3.0 ± 0.5), where both interfaces are nearly electroneutral.

Besides the height, the length of the film channel can be adjusted, as a compressible gas bubble is used. To keep the bubble in a static position in the capillary, we applied identical external pressures at the two ends of the microchannel (Fig. 3e). With applied pressures increasing from 0 to 1 bar, the bubble length gradually shrinks from 1100 µm to 500 µm (Fig. 3e), with the effects by pressure increase shown in Supplementary Note 10. The ideal gas law (pV = nRT, where p, V, n, T, R are the pressure, volume, the number of moles, thermodynamic temperature of ideal gas, and ideal gas constant respectively) well predicted the bubble-length decrease (black solid line in Fig. 3f).

### The effects of temperature on nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture homogeneity and stability [^169f335a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Homogeneity and Stability

As described by Tunstall, and later by Gale, Tunstall and Wilton-Davies, it is possible to produce cylinders filled to 138 bar (2000 psig) with a 50%/50% v/v mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen where the contents are a homogeneous gas mixture, i.e. no liquid nitrous oxide will be present in the cylinder. This ability to combine nitrous oxide and oxygen at high pressure while remaining in the gaseous state is due to the Poynting effect (named after John Henry Poynting, an English physicist). Poynting found that the critical temperature and pressure of a vapour may be affected when it is mixed with another gas. The critical point of a substance is the temperature at above which a gas cannot be liquefied, no matter how much pressure is applied. Conversely, it is the temperature and pressure point at which condensation of the gas into liquid will commence. For nitrous oxide this critical point occurs at a temperature of +36.4°C and at a pressure of 72.45 bar (1050 psi). For a cylinder of a 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen v/v mixture filled to 138 bar (2000 psi), the new critical temperature of the nitrous oxide (known as the pseudocritical temperature) decreases from +36.4°C to -6°C.

One of the concerns about nitrous oxide and oxygen mixtures was effect of adiabatic cooling on their stability and homogeneity. The term "adiabatic" literally means impassable, coming from the Greek roots meaning not passing through. In gas physics it refers to changes in the temperature of a system due to changes in the volume or pressure of a gas with an absence of net heat transfer between the system and its environment. No net heat transfer takes place because the event occurs rapidly resulting in very little time for the gas to interact with its environment. Opening a cylinder valve and releasing the contents is considered an adiabatic event. Given that the total amount of energy in the gas remains essentially the same (none is added or lost), as the pressure of the gas is reduced and volume increases the available energy can either be used to do the work of expansion, or to maintain the temperature of the gas, but it cannot be used for both. Therefore the temperature of the gas will decrease.

### Thermodynamics of freezing and melting [^b0f92715]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Along an isomorph the structure is invariant in the reduced-unit system definedby the length unit ρ −1/3 (ρ ≡ N / V is the number density and V is the system volume), the energy unit k B T (T is the temperature) and the time unit(m is the particle mass). Figure 1b shows the LJ liquid's static structure factor S (q) along an isomorph close to the freezing line (used below as the liquid-state reference isomorph) plotted for a range of temperatures. A comparison with Fig. 1a confirms the recent finding of Heyes and Brankathat the freezing line is not an exact isomorph, although it is close to one.

The melting pressure as a function of temperature, p m (T), can be predicted from information obtained at a single coexistence reference state point. The details about how this works are given in the 'Methods' section. The argument may be summarized as follows. Recalling that the entropy as a function of density and temperature is a sum of an ideal-gas term and an 'excess' term S ex (ref.), isomorphs are the phase-diagram lines of constant excess entropy for any system obeying equation (1). A computer simulation at the liquid/solid reference state point generates a series of configurations R 1 0,…, R n 0. Scaling each of these uniformly to density ρ one obtains configurations representative for the state point with density ρ and temperature T on the isomorph through the reference state pointin which T is identified from the configurational temperature expression k B T = 〈(∇ U) 2 〉/〈∇ 2 U 〉. The average potential energy U and virial W at the state point (ρ, T) are likewise found by averaging over the scaled configurations. The key assumption here is that the canonical probabilities of the scaled configurations are identical to those of the original configurations, which follows from equation (1) (thus no new MD simulations are required). As shown in the 'Methods' section, in conjunction with the excess isochoric specific heat C V ex calculated from the potential-energy fluctuations of the scaled configurations (C V ex = 〈(Δ U) 2 〉/ k B T 2) and the so-called density-scaling exponentalso calculated from the fluctuations (γ = 〈Δ U Δ W 〉/〈(Δ U) 2 〉), one has enough information to determine the thermodynamics of freezing and melting, as well as the variation along the melting line of isomorph-invariant properties like the Lindemann ratio and the reduced-unit viscosity.

### Fundamental principles and applications of natural gas hydrates [^a8ed7ddf]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Natural gas hydrates are solid, non-stoichiometric compounds of small gas molecules and water. They form when the constituents come into contact at low temperature and high pressure. The physical properties of these compounds, most notably that they are non-flowing crystalline solids that are denser than typical fluid hydrocarbons and that the gas molecules they contain are effectively compressed, give rise to numerous applications in the broad areas of energy and climate effects. In particular, they have an important bearing on flow assurance and safety issues in oil and gas pipelines, they offer a largely unexploited means of energy recovery and transportation, and they could play a significant role in past and future climate change.

### Low tidal volumes for everyone? [^06dafc80]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the first description of mechanical ventilation, our understanding of the positive and negative effects of this form of life support has continued to evolve. To maintain "normal" aeration of the lungs and "normal" blood gas measurements, patients often require much higher airway pressures and tidal volumes than would be expected in a healthy, spontaneously breathing adult. In the early days of mechanical ventilation, the goal was to normalize the blood gas levels, but over the last several decades, we have developed a much better appreciation for the deleterious effects of mechanical ventilation. We have found that lower tidal volumes, which may actually worsen oxygenation and reduce clearance of CO 2, can decrease the level of harm caused by mechanical ventilation. This scenario is best described and agreed upon in the setting of ARDS, but a growing body of evidence suggests that the use of higher tidal volumes is harmful in patients with normal lungs undergoing general anesthesia or in patients with lung diseases other than ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation. Finally, the concept of self-induced lung injury has emerged as a mechanism through which patients generating large negative intrathoracic pressures to achieve larger tidal volumes can contribute to worsened lung injury. Given a growing supportive evidence base, we suggest that efforts be made to achieve low tidal volume ventilation in all patients with lung injury or undergoing mechanical ventilation for any reason.

### Immiscible hydrocarbon fluids in the deep carbon cycle [^3884da67]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The volumes of the two types of gas bubble are calculated as: (1) the ratio of the volume of the cylindrical top bubble to the volume of the whole cell can be expressed as the ratio of the area of the bubble to the cell (56,486/559,256 = 9.95%) (Supplementary Fig. 4), so the volume of the top bubble is 175,746 μm 3. (2) The estimated volume of the two bottom gas bubbles in pixels 3 was converted into μm 3. By scaling the area of the cell in the picture (567,971 pixel 2) to the surface of the compression chamber (17,671 μm 2), we obtained a conversion factor of 5.669 (pixel per μm). The volume of the two bottom gas bubbles is 4,526,113 pixel 3, that is, 24,843 μm 3. So the total volume of gas bubbles is 200,589 μm 3. Then we used the ideal gas law (equation (6)) to calculate the amount of gas:

where T = 298.15 K (25 °C), R = 8.314 J mol −1 K −1, P = 4.24 MPa, V = 200,589 μm 3. Thus, the amount of gas n is 0.34 × 10–9 mol. On the basis of the relative peak area of the C–H stretching of isobutane and methane (Supplementary Fig. 3b), we know that methane is 95.5% and isobutane is 4.5%. Ethane and propane are < 1%. Ignoring the ethane and propane, we obtain the number of moles of carbon in the gas phase to be (0.34 × 0.955+0.34 × 0.045 × 4) × 10 −9 = 0.386 × 10 −9 mol, which represents 11% of total carbon.

### Hydrogenation of saturated organic and inorganic molecules in metallic hydrogen [^520015e0]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Metallic hydrogenis believed to be the most common condensed phase of matter in the universe, comprising the cores of gas-giant planets – and giving rise to their enormous magnetic fields. However, it is exceptionally challenging to make metallic hydrogen on Earth –. Consequently, most of our understanding of this material comes from theory. Most elements become metallic at sufficiently high pressures and, in general, metallic liquids will mix, lowering the melt point. Here, we investigate the solubility of other light elements in a metallic hydrogen environment.

The chemical bonding in these systems can be described in detail using electronic structure calculations, however the coexistence of localised and delocalized electrons means that descriptions used in conventional chemistry must either be discarded or extended. In this analysis, "covalent" bonds will be defined in terms of Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis.

Planetary models depict layers separated by the weight of elements, e.g. gas giants feature an outer molecular hydrogen and helium envelope and a core of metallic hydrogen depleted of helium,– which is predicted to be insoluble below its own metallization conditions –. Understanding material properties allows us to infer the composition and structure of exoplanets from their mass-radius relation.

Chemical bonding is different at high pressure. For example, on Earth, the major components of the mantle exhibit sixfold coordinated silicon –, in contrast to the fourfold sp 3 bonding found in normal conditions. The unconventional formation of sixfold coordinated silicates are well described by density functional theory calculations as being enabled by the electrons donated from positive ions, and lower mantle minerals are stabilised at pressure thanks to the increased density –. If chemistry can change so radically just few thousand kilometres beneath our feet, how different might it be elsewhere in the solar system? Network formation and fourfold-sixfold coordination change in carbon has been subject to much discussion based on experimental and theoretical work –.

### Gas embolism during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: diagnosis and management [^a5fcdc07]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is recommended in severe cases of air embolism with hemodynamic compromise and neurologic deficits. Hyperbaric oxygen is based on the principle of Boyle's law that surface area and volume of gas bubble is inversely proportional to pressure at constant temperature. HBOT provides 100% oxygen at a pressure above that of the atmosphere at sea level and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen is greater than 2000 mmHg. With increasing ambient pressure from HBOT, the gas bubble shrinks and leads to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia creates diffusion gradient which promotes oxygen into the bubble and nitrogen out of the bubble. Hyperoxia also increases the extent of diffusion of oxygen into the tissues by dissolving large amounts of oxygen into the plasma. HBOT has been shown to decrease cerebral edema by decreasing the adherence of leukocytes to damaged endothelium and by reducing the permeability of blood vessels. The ideal time to initiation of HBOT is not clear, however patients who received HBOT within 5 h from the onset of symptoms are likely to have good recovery. HBOT is generally safe when standard protocol of atmospheric pressure not more than 3 and maximum treatment exposure time of 120 min is used. Most common side effect of HBOT is reversible myopia from direct toxic effect of oxygen on the lens.

### Motility-induced coexistence of a hot liquid and a cold gas [^1d5e6be8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

We are all used to the experience that a gas is often hotter than a liquid of the same material. For example, to evaporate water from a pot in our kitchens, we need to increase its temperature. Then, at some point, vapor molecules rapidly escape from the liquid and distribute in the surrounding air. This experience that vapor emerges when increasing the temperature of a liquid has played a key role throughout human history: It was an essential ingredient, e.g. for the development of the steam engine, and it is key to technological applications like distillation techniques, or physical vapor deposition, as well as to natural spectacles such as geysers. The central exception from the experience that gases are hotter than liquids of the same material occurs when two phases, e.g. a gas and a liquid, coexist at the same time. Then they share the same temperature. This is guaranteed by the fundamental laws of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics for all equilibrium systems and it also applies to some non-equilibrium systems –. Intuitively, this is plausible since any type of temperature gradient seems to evoke an energy flow evening out an initial temperature gradient.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^65dd3793]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/ESICM/SCCM ARDS ventilation — Low tidal volume and plateau pressure limits: We recommend that adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receive ventilation strategies that limit tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight [PBW]) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) (strong recommendation, moderate confidence in effect estimates). In nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 1,629 patients comparing low tidal volume (LTV) with traditional volumes (10–15 ml/kg PBW), delivered volumes averaged 6.8 ± 1.2 ml/kg PBW versus 11.4 ± 1.1 ml/kg PBW, with no significant mortality difference overall (seven studies, 1,481 patients; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.70–1.08), and no significant differences in barotrauma (three studies, 1,029 patients; RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.67–1.37) or ventilator-free days (two studies, 977 patients; 0.3 more VFDs; 95% CI, –5.88 to 5.95). For implementation, the initial tidal volume should be set at 6 ml/kg PBW and can be increased up to 8 ml/kg PBW if the patient is double triggering or if inspiratory airway pressure decreases below PEEP.

### Model predictions of gas embolism growth and reabsorption during xenon anesthesia [^b625473e]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It is not readily obvious whether an intravascular bubble will grow or shrink in a particular tissue bed. This depends on the constituent gases initially present in the bubble, the surrounding tissue, and the delivered gas admixture. The authors used a computational model based on the physics of gas exchange to predict cerebrovascular embolism behavior during xenon anesthesia.

Methods

The authors estimated values of gas transport parameters missing from the literature. The computational model was used with those parameters to predict bubble size over time for a range of temperatures (18 degrees -39 degrees C) used during extracorporeal circulation.

Results

Bubble size over time is highly nonlinearly dependent on multiple factors, including diffusivity, solubility, gas partial pressures, magnitude of concentration gradients, vessel diameter, and temperature. Xenon- and oxygen-containing bubbles continue to grow during xenon delivery. Bubble volume doubles from 50 to 100 nl in approximately 3–68 min, depending on initial gas composition and bubble shape. Bubble growth and reabsorption are relatively insensitive to temperature in the physiologic and surgical range.

Conclusions

Xenon anesthesia results in gas exchange conditions that favor bubble growth, which may worsen neurologic injury from gas embolism. The concentration gradients can be manipulated by discontinuation of xenon delivery to promote reabsorption of xenon-containing bubbles. Estimated growth and reabsorption rates at normothermia can be applied to temperature extremes of cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Are we ready to think differently about setting PEEP? [^536e2ea0]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In stark contrast to the undisputed mortality benefit of lower tidal volume ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the best strategy to determine optimal positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) remains an unresolved question. It is an important question because conventional understanding predicts the right PEEP will maintain recruitment of mechanically unstable alveoli, improving both oxygenation and lung compliance. Improved compliance, combined with lower ventilation volumes, maximizes lung protection by limiting tidal airway pressure changes.

Oxygenation is a convenient target for determining PEEP, and protocols directing clinicians to increase PEEP in a stepwise fashion, based on the fraction of inspirated oxygen (FiO 2) required to maintain arterial oxygen levels within a specified range, have been used in several studies and guidelines. Increasing PEEP to "chase" FiO 2 requirements in this manner is simple, reproducible, and in the absence of a superior strategy, commonly practiced. However, it assumes the dominant mechanism of hypoxemia is alveolar collapse and an associated reduction in compliance, where increasing PEEP increases recruitment of functional lung units. These assumptions fail when patients meet ARDS criteria and the dominant mechanism of hypoxemia is not alveolar collapse, because hypoxemia may coexist with minimally impaired lung compliance. While such patients may only represent one end of the compliance spectrum in ARDS, increasing PEEP to "chase" FiO 2 requirements in this setting leads to the use of ever higher PEEP, even though relatively few functional lung units are re-opened.

This mechanistic distinction is important. When increasing PEEP does not recruit functional lung units and improve pulmonary compliance, it will increase lung distention and energy transfer to the pulmonary-parenchymal matrix. This raises the risk of lung injury, dead-space formation, pneumothorax, and detrimental hemodynamic consequences. Oxygenation measures are not sensitive to this; increasing PEEP elevates mean airway pressure, and Henry's law predicts this also increases the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) to FiO 2 (P:F) ratio regardless of whether functional lung units are recruited, at least until cardiac output becomes impaired. This would be of no consequence if the coexistence of hypoxemia and minimally impaired compliance was exceedingly rare in ARDS. However, this is not the case because the ARDS definition only accounts for P:F ratio, a measure of oxygenation, not compliance. Therefore, although mean lung compliance in ARDS cohorts is usually low, the range is wide and some patients may experience only mild compliance reductions.

### Setting the frequency-tidal volume pattern [^af6796a1]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Alveolar (and thus arterial) P(O2) and P(CO2) clearly depend on minute ventilation. However, we need to balance gas exchange goals against the risk of overstretching, especially of the healthier regions of the lung. The plateau pressure is probably the best easily-obtained marker of the risk of stretch in the lung, and a commonly quoted threshold is 30–35 cm H(2)O, the normal maximum transalveolar pressure at total lung capacity. In establishing the proper balance of stretch versus gas exchange, we need to address what levels of pH and P(aO2) we consider acceptable. There are no good data to guide us on the lowest tolerable pH, but 7.2 is commonly quoted in the literature, and 7.15 was the lower limit of acceptability in the ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) Network trial. P(O2) levels as low as 55 mm Hg may be well tolerated, provided there is reasonable oxygen delivery. In distributing the desired minute volume between respiratory frequency and tidal volume (V(T)), a V(T) of 6 mL/kg ideal body weight has been shown to improve ARDS outcome, compared to 12 mL/kg. Thus, 6 mL/kg should be the "start point". Adjustments upward could be considered the plateau pressure is acceptable, in order to improve gas exchange or comfort. Conversely, downward adjustments should be considered if the plateau pressure is high and the gas exchange is acceptable. Frequency is adjusted for the desired minute ventilation. It must be recognized, however, that as frequency (and minute ventilation) increases, the risk of air trapping and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increases. Just like applied PEEP, intrinsic PEEP increases the baseline pressure and stretch upon which the V(T) is delivered. The end-inspiratory stretch increases accordingly. The shape and duration of the flow pattern may affect gas mixing, recruitment, cardiac function, intrinsic PEEP buildup, and patient comfort. It is also conceivable that certain flow patterns can produce an acceleration injury. Although small clinical trials using physiologic end points espouse certain flow patterns, there are no good outcome data at present supporting any particular approach. Some authors suggest that high-frequency ventilation (HFV) might be considered an "ultimate" lung-protective strategy. HFV creates considerable intrinsic PEEP, which, when coupled with sustained inflation maneuvers, can provide substantial alveolar recruitment. In addition, the small V(T) of HFV prevents excessive end-inspiratory distention. Although considerable clinical data support the use of HFV in pediatric patients at risk for ventilator-induced lung injury, there are few data from adults. Whether HFV will prove valuable in well-designed open lung strategies in the adult population still has to be determined.

### Microorganism microneedle micro-engine depth drug delivery [^ffab72ed]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In the gas-assisted drug delivery system, the dynamics of gas diffusion and pressure distribution in the skin microenvironment play a critical role. Specifically, after the gas is injected into the subcutaneous tissue, gas molecules begin to diffuse through the tissue according to Fick's laws of diffusion. The diffusion process is influenced by the structure and composition of the skin, including the stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis. As observed in our experiments, gas diffusion in the skin exhibits significant lateral diffusion characteristics. This indicates that gas diffuses not only longitudinally (in-depth) but also laterally (in-plane). When gas diffuses subcutaneously, it creates a high-pressure environment in the local area. This pressure can be explained by the volume expansion of the gas and the limited compressibility of skin tissue. According to the ideal gas law, when gas is released in an enclosed or semi-enclosed space (such as subcutaneous tissue), its volume expansion exerts pressure on the surrounding tissue. This pressure acts as a "push" for the drug in the microneedle delivery system, facilitating the drug's penetration into deeper layers of tissue. As mentioned in our previous experimental results, despite the presence of lateral gas diffusion, the local high-pressure area formed around the microneedle puncture point enables the drug to effectively diffuse longitudinally into deeper layers. By controlling the glucose concentration loaded in the microneedles, we can adjust the speed and pressure of gas release, thereby controlling the depth and range of drug diffusion (Fig. 5d, e). The porous structure and complex physiological characteristics of the skin microenvironment make gas diffusion and pressure application somewhat predictable and controllable. By combining Darcy's Lawand Fick's Law, it is theoretically possible to establish a mathematical model for gas and drug diffusion to further understand the pressure effects of gas on drug delivery. This is also a direction worth investing more efforts in the future exploration of gas-driven microneedles.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^f854893f]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Steam sterilization — overview and operating parameters — Of all the methods available, moist heat in the form of saturated steam under pressure is the most widely used and most dependable; it is nontoxic, inexpensive, rapidly microbicidal and sporicidal, and rapidly heats and penetrates fabrics, though deleterious effects include increased hardening time (5.6 fold) with plaster-cast. Steam sterilization relies on four parameters — steam, pressure, temperature, and time — and the ideal steam is dry saturated steam with entrained water (dryness fraction ≥ 97%). Common operating temperatures are 121°C (250°F) and 132°C (270°F), and recognized minimum exposure for wrapped healthcare supplies includes 30 minutes at 121°C (250°F) in a gravity displacement system.

Measurement of lung volumes: helium dilution

Measurement principle

Multiple breath gas dilution measurements of static lung volumes are based on the principle that helium (being used as a physiologically inert tracer gas) of known concentration contained in a spirometer of known volume will be diluted by alveolar gas when the subject is switched into the system and a closed spirometer circuit is maintained (figure 14). A circulating pump within the spirometer maintains an even distribution of the test gases and the volume of the circuit is kept constant by absorbing the CO 2 that the subject produces during the measurements and replenishing the O 2 taken up. After a few minutes of tidal breathing, the tracer gas should be evenly distributed throughout the subject's lungs, and a second, lower tracer gas concentration will be established, hence allowing the calculation of the FRC.

Figure 14
Calculation of FRC: helium (He) dilution method. Closed circuit for He equilibration and calculation of thoracic gas volume and FRC He. System volume includes spirometer and all tubing and so on, up to the valve in the mouth, and is filled initially with 10% He. Because of CO 2 absorption and O 2 consumption, spirometric trace has rising baseline, made horizontal by continuous O 2 addition. Time course of He equilibration and in normal and in patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) shown. Reproduced from Hughes, 'Physiology and Practice of Pulmonary Function', published by the Association for Respiratory Technology & Physiology. FRC, functional residual capacity; IC, inspiratory capacity; TLC, total lung capacity.

Helium (He) is traditionally chosen as the tracer gas in multiple breath gas dilution methods as it is easily measurable in low concentrations with the degree of accuracy required and the analysers require little maintenance.

To calculate the unknown value (FRC), the following equation can be used:

FRC = V 1 × ((He 1 − He 2)/He 2)

where V 1 = circuit vol, He 1 = initial helium concentration and He 2 = final helium concentration.

All measurements are made at ambient temperature, pressure and saturated with water vapour. The appropriate correction factor must be applied to allow values to be reported at BTPS. If the equipment used does not have a built-in thermometer and barometer to automatically correct for room temperature and P BOX, then these variables should be entered into the software prior to testing.

### Can modern infrared analyzers replace gas chromatography to measure anesthetic vapor concentrations? [^13d86a4c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

A flame ionization detector GC (Gow-Mac 580; Gow-Mac, Bethlehem, PA) was used, equipped with a 4.57 m, 22-mm internal diameter column containing 10% SF-96 on WHP, 68/80 mesh, maintained at 43°C with an 8 mL/min N 2 carrier flow. The detector (at 122°C) received H 2 at 20 mL/min and air at 200 mL/min. The GC was calibrated before and at intervals during each test using secondary (cylinder) calibration standards. The same calibration gas (one for each agent) was used throughout the study. The calibration gas comes out of a stainless steel cylinder which contains a known concentration of vapor; for each agent, a different cylinder was prepared. The mixture is prepared by creating a subatmospheric pressure in the cylinder. Next, an amount of liquid agent is aspirated into the cylinder. This amount is calculated such that after vaporization the calculated pressure in the cylinder will remain below the vapor pressure of the agent. The cylinder is then filled/pressurized with air. To mix its contents, the cylinder is rolled several times, and subsequently heated overnight by applying an external heat pad. The exact concentration of this secondary standard is determined by comparing it with a primary volumetric standard using gas chromatography. The primary standard is prepared by injecting a known exact amount of liquid agent (measured by weight or glass micropipette) in a glass Erlenmeyer of known volume, taking the effect of temperature into account. Using this primary standard, it was determined that the concentrations of isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane in the tank was 0.744, 1.49, and 4.20%, respectively. Over the entire course of the study, the peak height with the same calibration gas for isoflurane (0.744%), sevoflurane (1.49%), and desflurane (4.20%) was 54.0 mm (standard deviation 1.1 mm) for isoflurane, 52.2 mm (standard deviation 2.0 mm) for sevoflurane, and 54.1 mm (standard deviation 1.4 mm) for desflurane; the coefficients of variation for isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane therefore were 2.0, 3.8, and 2.6% respectively. These calculations are based on 6 calibrations, 3 before and 3 after measuring each agent for each analyzer (total of 18 per analyzer).

### Molecular determinant of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein folding stability [^3ee2080b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions

The volume that a protein molecule occupies in solution is an additive quantityand can be separated into the geometric volume of the protein (V SE), and the volume changes in solvent due to the interactions with the protein surface (V Hyd). The geometric volume is the volume that is encompassed by the molecular surface as first defined by Richardsand will be referred here as solvent-excluded volume (V SE). The V SE of a protein comprises its van der Waals (V vdW) and void volume (V Void) (Fig. 1).

The van der Waals volume is the volume occupied by protein atoms, each given a specific van der Waals radius, while the void volume is the space inside the protein that is not occupied by protein atoms and is inaccessible to the solvent molecules modelled as spherical probes. The total volume of the protein in solution, V Tot, can be defined as the sum of two components:

The volume changes upon protein unfolding are defined as the difference in total volumes of the unfolded, V Tot, U, and native, V Tot, N, states (Fig. 1).

In the following section we will discuss the volumetric properties of the native and unfolded states and the contributions of the individual components, Δ V SE, and Δ V Void, to the total volume changes upon unfolding of proteins.

### "Ideal PEEP" is superior to high dose partial liquid ventilation with low PEEP in experimental acute lung injury [^b9fdb229]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of a high dose partial liquid ventilation (PLV) approximating the amount of the functional residual capacity (FRC) with low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) compared to a lung-protective strategy with volume-controlled mechanical ventilation (vcMV) with a PEEP level above the lower inflection point (LIP) on pulmonary gas exchange, haemodynamics, respiratory mechanics and lung injury in an experimental model of acute lung injury (ALI).

Design

Prospective, randomised, controlled study.

Methods

Twenty-four anaesthetised, tracheotomised and mechanically ventilated (FIO(2) 1.0) pigs underwent induction of ALI by repeated saline wash-out of surfactant. Animals were randomly assigned to receive either PLV (PLV, n = 8) with 30 ml/kg of perfluorocarbons (PF 5080, 3 M, Germany) and a PEEP level of 5 cmH(2)O, to receive vcMV with a PEEP level of 1 cmH(2)O above the LIP ((ideal) PEEP, n = 8), or to receive vcMV with a PEEP level of 5 cmH(2)O (Controls, n = 8).

Measurements and Results

Measurements of pulmonary gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and haemodynamics were performed hourly for a 6 h period. In the (ideal) PEEP group, intra-pulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) decreased from 55 ± 5% after induction of ALI to 10 ± 3% (p < 0.05 versus Controls and versus PLV) and PaO(2) increased from 52 ± 4 to 566 ± 19 mmHg after 6 h of treatment (p < 0.05 versus Controls and versus PLV). In the PLV group, Qs/Qt decreased from 50 ± 5% after induction of ALI to 24 ± 3% (p < 0.05 versus Controls) and PaO(2) increased from 59 ± 5 to 306 ± 35 mmHg after 6 h of treatment (p < 0.05 versus Controls). In the PLV group and in Controls, mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) was significantly increased from 27 ± 2 to 38 ± 2 mmHg and from 29 ± 1 to 40 ± 1 mmHg, respectively, 6 h after induction of ALI (p < 0.05 versus (ideal) PEEP), while in the (ideal) PEEP group, MPAP was maintained between 26 ± 1 and 31 ± 2 mmHg for 6 h after ALI. Cardiac output (CO) decreased significantly in the (ideal) PEEP group compared to Controls (p < 0.05), while CO did not change in the PLV group and in Controls. The compliance of the respiratory system (C(RS)) increased in the (ideal) PEEP group after induction of ALI from 11 ± 2 to 22 ± 5 ml/mbar (p < 0.05 versus Controls and versus PLV) and in the PLV group from 10 ± 2 to 13 ± 3 ml/mbar after 6 h of treatment (p < 0.05 versus Controls). On histological examination, the highest total injury scores were found in animals of the PLV group (p < 0.05 versus Controls and versus (ideal) PEEP), while the lowest total lung injury score was found in the dependent lung regions of the (ideal) PEEP group (p < 0.05 versus Controls).

Conclusion

In this porcine model of ALI, vcMV with a PEEP level of 1 cmH(2)O above the LIP was superior to high dose PLV with a PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O in improving gas exchange and lung mechanics. In terms of lung damage, the treatment in the (ideal) PEEP group resulted in the lowest total lung injury scores.

Procedures

Hospital respiratory therapists who were not a part of the study initiated all the ventilatory regimens. The initial settings for HVNI (Vapotherm Inc.) included fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) 0.50, flow 30 L/min, and temperature 37°C. The initial settings for NiPPV included FiO 2 0.50 and pressure settings of 10–12 cmH 2 O in inspiration and 5–6 cmH 2 O in expiration were chosen for a targeted tidal volumes of 6–8 mL/kg ideal body weight as a volume goal, with each center's standard humidification settings. The settings for both HVNI and NiPPV were titrated according to standard practice to determine the optimal effect. Details about changes in settings during titration and the final settings of each ventilatory support were recorded as part of study protocol. The treating clinician at each center decided on the need for intubation, specific medication treatment regimen, and final disposition per routine practice.

### Calorimetry of a bose-einstein-condensed photon gas [^bd76be95]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Phase transitions, as the condensation of a gas to a liquid, are often revealed by a discontinuous behaviour of thermodynamic quantities. For liquid helium, for example, a divergence of the specific heat signals the transition from the normal fluid to the superfluid state. Apart from liquid helium, determining the specific heat of a Bose gas has proven to be a challenging task, for example, for ultracold atomic Bose gases. Here we examine the thermodynamic behaviour of a trapped two-dimensional photon gas, a system that allows us to spectroscopically determine the specific heat and the entropy of a nearly ideal Bose gas from the classical high temperature to the Bose-condensed quantum regime. The critical behaviour at the phase transition is clearly revealed by a cusp singularity of the specific heat. Regarded as a test of quantum statistical mechanics, our results demonstrate a quantitative agreement with its predictions at the microscopic level.

Sub-sea Arctic methane and gas hydrate reservoirs are expected to be severely impacted by ocean temperature increase and sea-level rise. Our understanding of the gas emission phenomenon in the Arctic is however partial, especially in deep environments where the access is difficult and hydro-acoustic surveys are sporadic. Here, we report on the first continuous pore-pressure and temperature measurements over 4 days in shallow sediments along the west-Svalbard margin. Our data from sites where gas emissions have not been previously identified in hydro-acoustic profiles show that tides significantly affect the intensity and periodicity of gas emissions. These observations imply that the quantification of present-day gas emissions in the Arctic may be underestimated. High tides, however, seem to influence gas emissions by reducing their height and volume. Hence, the question remains as to whether sea-level rise may partially counterbalance the potential threat of submarine gas emissions caused by a warmer Arctic Ocean.

### Ventilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with conventional tidal volumes for patients without acute lung injury: a preventive randomized controlled trial [^6e910115]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Interventions

The volume-controlled mode was used for mechanical ventilation. To calculate tidal volume, predicted body weight was used, as described. The target tidal volume in the conventional group was 10 ml/kg of predicted body weight, which was routine practice at the time of the conduct of the study. Patients from the intervention group were ventilated at tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight. In case patients were randomized to 6 ml/kg, the attending physician was allowed to increase tidal-volume size to 7 to 8 ml/kg if patients had severe dyspnea, as identified by increased respiratory rate (more than 35 to 40 breaths per minute) accompanied by increasing levels of discomfort (with or without need for more sedation). Levels of PEEP were set, together with the level of inspired oxygen (Fi 2) depending of the Pa 2 according to a local protocol.

The ventilator was routinely (3 times/day) switched to the pressure support mode. If the pressure support mode was tolerated, this mode was used for further mechanical ventilation. Toleration of pressure support mode was assessed at the discretion of the attending physician. The pressure support was adjusted to reach the target tidal volumes. In case the attending physician preferred pressure-support ventilation in a patient randomized to the lower-tidal-volume group, and the applied tidal volume exceeded the target tidal volume because of high levels of pressure support, then this was accepted. Such patients were kept in their original randomization group in the statistical analyses.

As soon as patients were ready to be weaned from the ventilator, the pressure-support level had to be lowered stepwise to 5 cm H 2 O within 24 hours. If this was not possible because of severe dyspnea, then the pressure support had to be increased to maintain tidal-volume size based on randomization group. Attending physicians decided to extubate the patient, based on general extubation criteria (that is, responsive and cooperative, adequate oxygenation with Fi 2 of 40% or less, hemodynamically stable, no uncontrolled arrhythmia, and having a rectal temperature greater than 36.0). If a patient had been weaned from the ventilator but was reintubated for additional mechanical ventilation within 28 days, the same tidal-volume protocol was resumed.

Lung injury was diagnosed if a patient met the consensus criteria. If it was diagnosed by the attending physician, the local protocol mandated mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg in a pressure-controlled mode for the remaining ventilation period.

### Setting and titrating positive end-expiratory pressure [^585b7092]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Although maintaining some amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) seems essential, selecting and titrating a specific level for patients with ARDS remains challenging despite extensive research on the subject. Although an "open lung" approach to ventilation is popular and has some degree of biological plausibility, it is not without risk. Furthermore, there is no clear evidence-based guidance regarding initial PEEP settings or how to titrate them early in the course of the illness. Many busy clinicians use a "one-size-fits-all" approach based on local medical culture, but an individualized approach has the potential to offer significant benefit. Here we present a pragmatic approach based on simple measurements available on all ventilators, focused on achieving balance between the potential risks and benefits of PEEP. Acknowledging "best PEEP" as an impossible goal, we aim for a straightforward method to achieve "better PEEP".

### On the parameters affecting the sensitivity of MR measures of pressure with microbubbles [^dcfe5ce5]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Recently, it has been suggested that gas encapsulated distensible microbubbles may serve as pressure probes in the MR field through the relationship between bubble size and 1/T(2) or 1/T(*)(2). Currently, in vivo application of this technique is hindered by the ability of T(2) or T(*)(2) to detect pressure changes that are clinically relevant. This work identifies and characterizes, through numerical simulations, the set of parameters which optimize the ability of this technique to detect small pressure changes. Results show that when the bubbles do not interact magnetically, the T(2)- and T(*)(2)-based measurements of pressure are strongly influenced by the bubble size at atmospheric pressure, static magnetic field strength, magnitude of the susceptibility difference between the encapsulated gas and plasma, bubble volume fraction, and the refocusing interval. In particular, to detect clinically relevant pressure changes, microbubbles need to be approximately 2–3 microm in radius, distributed at a volume fraction of 0.15%, and have a volumetric magnetic susceptibility difference of at least 34 ppm.

### Volumetric capnography: lessons from the past and current clinical applications [^8a62c4fb]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Definitions

The terms physiological or respiratory dead space (VDphys) refer to lung units that are ventilated but do not contribute to gas exchange because the expired gas from these units has no contact with pulmonary capillary blood flow. VDphys can be divided further into alveolar dead space (VDalv) and anatomical dead space, which also is known as airway dead space (VDaw). As shown in Fig. 1, VDaw corresponds to the volume in conducting airways and ends at the alveolar compartment. The term VDalv refers to volume in alveoli that is ventilated but not perfused (compartment C in Fig. 1) as described by Riley and Cournand. This compartment corresponds to West zone I as identified by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. West zone I occurs when alveolar pressure is greater than the pressure inside the collapsible pulmonary vessels and the alveolar pressure thus stops pulmonary flow in that region. This can occur with hyperinflation of the lungs or even due to gravitational effects as vascular pressures in upper regions become less than alveolar pressure.

Fig. 1
Riley three compartment model. Compartment A: shunt = perfused but not ventilated alveolae (V/Q = 0). Compartment B: ideal condition. Compartment C: dead space = ventilated but not perfused alveolae (V/Q = ∞). VDaw airway dead space, VDalv alveolar dead space, VDphys the sum of airway and alveolar dead space

In the clinical context, VDalv typically arises through two general processes. The first involves over-inflation of the lung, which can be due to dynamic hyperinflation because the expiratory period is too short to completely expire the inflated volume, the level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is high, or the delivered tidal volume is large. The second process involves decreased pulmonary perfusion or changes in the distribution of perfusion caused by either direct obstruction of arterial pulmonary vessels or by reduction of output from the right ventricle. VDaw normally is relatively fixed, but it changes with changes in body position or tracheal diameter. The latter can be decreased by the presence of an endotracheal tube and increased by high levels of PEEP. Additional equipment attached in series between the patient's mouth and the Y-piece of the ventilator circuit also increases VDaw; this is called instrumental dead space (VDinst). The product of VDphys (mL) and respiratory rate give the dead space ventilation (VD) (L/min).

### The footprint of column collapse regimes on pyroclastic flow temperatures and plume heights [^aeff637c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Thermodynamic constraints for collapsing mixtures

To better understand the mechanism of temperature drop due to mixing with atmospheric air, we here derive, from thermodynamic considerations, the thermal conditions that would characterize the collapsing mixture. We assume an isobaric transformation between an initial state where the erupted material and air are perfectly separated and a final state where the two phases are perfectly mixed and the resulting mixture is homogeneous. The final mixture temperature T (ξ) can be expressed, from enthalpy conservation, as a function of the mass fraction of the erupted material ξ. A dimensionless temperature θ (ξ) can be written aswhere T 0 is the initial temperature of the erupted material, T air is the initial air temperature, and C P air is the specific heat at constant pressure of the air (thermodynamic properties used are listed in Supplementary Table 2). The specific heat at constant pressure of the erupted material is C P m = y w C P w + (1 − y w) C s, where y w is the initial gas fraction in the erupted material, C P w and C s are the specific heats of the gas and solids, respectively. The ratio between the mixture density ρ (ξ) and the air density ρ air iswhere R w and R air are the gas constant of the erupted gas and air, respectively. Eqs. (1) and (2) are derived under certain assumptions. The enthalpy is conserved, thus the transformation is at constant pressure and the effects of dissipation and gravity can be disregarded. The erupted material in the final state is considered as a homogeneous fluid made of a perfect mixture of gas and particles. Particle separation is thus ignored. Air temperature and density are constant, i.e. atmospheric stratification is neglected. Finally, the volume fraction of solid is negligibly small. In the following, we compare theoretical results with the 3D simulation, to evaluate to which extent these assumptions are correct cell by cell and in the whole collapsing region. From Eqs. (1) and (2), the minimum temperature and mass fraction for which the mixture is nonbuoyant (ρ (ξ) > ρ air) can be derived

### Size limits the formation of liquid jets during bubble bursting [^323c30dd]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

The rapid rupture dynamics deforms a spherical bubble to a cone shape prior to jet formation, as usually observed. The cone shape implies a significant partial gas ejection from the deformed bubble into the atmosphere, causing a large volume shrinkage, Δ V = V 0 − V g where V 0 is the initial gas volume and V g is the gas volume at jet formation. The partial gas ejection can be significantly enhanced as the pressure difference, Δ p = 2 σ / R, increases. From literature for bubble bursting, the gas volume (V g) versus the initial radius (R) is plotted in Figure 6a and can be fitted by a power law, V g / V 0 ∼ R c (the solid line: V g = 9.75 V 0 R 0.33). The bubble-size dependence of the travelling length (L) normalized by the original travelling length (πR), measured from literature, is plotted in Figure 6b and can be fitted by L / πR ∼ R d (the solid line: L / πR = 2.1 R 0.13). The exponent of d = 0.13 is well matched to c /3 = 0.11, assuming that (L / πR) is proportional to (V g / V 0) 1/3. This finding also suggests that the partial gas rejection in bubble bursting leads to the reduction in the travelling length and therefore induces the increase in the critical Oh number.

### Bench test evaluation of volume delivered by modern ICU ventilators during volume-controlled ventilation [^05270f6b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

During volume-controlled ventilation, part of the volume delivered is compressed into the circuit. To correct for this phenomenon, modern ventilators use compensation algorithms. Humidity and temperature also influence the delivered volume.

Methods

In a bench study at a research laboratory in a university hospital, we compared nine ICU ventilators equipped with compensation algorithms, one with a proximal pneumotachograph and one without compensation. Each ventilator was evaluated under normal, obstructive, and restrictive conditions of respiratory mechanics. For each condition, three tidal volumes (V (T)) were set (300, 500, and 800 ml), with and without an inspiratory pause. The insufflated volume and the volume delivered at the Y-piece were measured independently, without a humidification device, under ambient temperature and pressure and dry gas conditions. We computed the actually delivered V (T) to the lung under body temperature and pressure and saturated water vapour conditions (BTPS).

Results

For target V (T) values of 300, 500, and 800 ml, actually delivered V (T) under BTPS conditions ranged from 261 to 396 mL (-13 to +32%), from 437 to 622 mL (-13 to +24%), and from 681 to 953 mL (-15 to +19%), respectively (p < 0.01). Respiratory system mechanics and application of an inspiratory pause significantly affected actually delivered V (T). Assuming a set V (T) of 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight, a difference of 1–2 ml/kg with actually delivered V (T) would be commonly observed.

Conclusion

The difference between preset V (T) and actually delivered V (T) is clinically meaningful and differs across modern ICU ventilators.

### Methane emissions from thermokarst lakes must emphasize the ice-melting impact on the tibetan plateau [^22c911e5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

At each sampling point, we also measured water quality parameters, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen and conductivity, using a multi-parameter water quality meter (Fig. 1d). Meteorological data, including air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed, were sourced from automated field weather stations located at Liangdao River, Tanggula, and Beilu River, as well as from the National Meteorological Science Data Center (NMSDC;) for the Maduo, Wudao Liang, and Tuotuo River.

Calculation of dissolved CH 4 concentrations

Dissolved CH 4 concentration in water was calculated by integrating the principles of the ideal gas law and Henry's law with the concentration of CH 4 in the headspace of the syringe. This methodological approach allowed for the precise calculation of CH 4 levels in the aquatic environment, providing accurate results for gas solubility in lake water under varying atmospheric and temperature conditions. The dissolved CH 4 concentration in water was calculated using Eq. (1):where C w is dissolved CH 4 concentration in water (μmol L −1). S is the CH 4 solubility in water when equilibrium is reached between the air and water phases (μmol L −1). V h is the volume of headspace gas in the syringe (L). V w is the volume of water in the syringe (L). C h is CH 4 concentration in the headspace gas of the syringe, calculated using Eqs. (2) and (3).where n represents the molar quantity of CH 4 in the headspace gas when equilibrium is reached between the air and water phases (mol). P m is CH 4 partial pressure in the headspace gas (atm), determined by the CH 4 volume concentration in the headspace gas and the actual atmospheric pressure at the sampling location. R is the ideal gas constant (L atm K −1 mol −1). T air is the air temperature in degrees Kelvin (K).

### Vapor pressures of anesthetic agents at temperatures below 0 ° C and a novel anesthetic delivery device [^0875536e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

At room temperature, the vapor pressures of desflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane are well above the clinically useful range. We hypothesized that therapeutic concentrations of these agents could be achieved at temperatures below 0°C, but the vapor pressure-temperature relationship is unknown below 0. Second, we hypothesized that this relationship could be exploited to deliver therapeutic-range concentrations of anesthetic vapor. We therefore set out to determine the low temperature-vapor pressure relationships of each anesthetic agent, thereby identifying the saturated vapor concentration of each agent at any temperature below 0°C. To test our hypothesis, we measured the saturated vapor concentration at 1 atm of pressure for temperatures between -60 and 0°C, thus developing an empiric relationship for each agent. There was consistency in repeated experiments for all 3 agents. To test the empiric data, we constructed a digitally controlled thermoelectric anesthetic vaporizer, characterized the device, and used it to deliver anesthetic vapor to laboratory mice. We report, for the first time, the temperature-vapor pressure relationship at temperatures below 0°C for desflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane as well as the TMAC of these agents: the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the minimum alveolar concentration. We describe the construction and limited validation of an anesthetic vaporizer prototype on the basis of this principle. We conclude that clinically relevant concentrations of volatile anesthetics may be achieved at low temperatures.

### Complications of tracheal gas insufflation [^1301f38a]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous reports of patient, lung model, and animal use of tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) have appeared in the literature over the past 10 years. However, no commercial TGI system is available. As a result, extreme care must be exercised if attempts are made to provide TGI. Numerous problems with noncommercial systems have been identified. Continuous-flow TGI results in an increase in peak pressure and delivered tidal volume. The use of a flow-limiting or pressure relief valve or a ventilator with an exhalation valve active during exhalation minimizes these problems. Ideally, TGI should only be activated during the expiratory phase. However, this requires that the TGI system be integrated with the mechanical ventilator. In addition, appropriate system monitoring should be available, including measurement of total positive end-expiratory pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, and tidal volume, and there should be a method of identifying increased carinal pressure and deactivating the TGI system if an obstruction occurs proximal to the point of TGI injection. As a result of the potential complications of TGI, this technique cannot be recommended for routine use until commercial systems are available.

### Charge decay in the spatial afterglow of plasmas and its impact on diffusion regimes [^f2ed1101]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

With our validation of the model at pressures where experimental measurements were possible, we are able to circumvent the experimental challenges faced at higher pressures by extending our model calculations to higher pressures up to atmospheric (~760 Torr). Input plasma parameters for the model were obtained by extrapolating Fig. 2a to 760 Torr for n p (4.1 × 10 20 m –3), and assuming the same T e (1.5 eV) measured by DLP at lower pressures, which was found to be consistent with other reports of continuous-flow, atmospheric-pressure plasmas with similar geometries to that studied here.

An important issue that must be considered as the pressure increases is that the gas temperature in the plasma will increase as a result of the increasing electron–neutral collision frequency. We note that because the charge density decreases in the afterglow, the temperature in the plasma will not be the same as in the afterglow, and it may decrease substantially depending on various conditions already discussed, such as pressure and distance, as well as other parameters, including gas flow rate and geometry. To address this issue, we developed a 1D heat transfer model for the bulk plasma to estimate the gas temperature at the end of the bulk plasma, i.e. at the plasma–afterglow boundary (Supplementary Note 8). Briefly, the model includes mechanisms for heat generation, such as electron–neutral elastic collisions and recombination, in the volume as well as at the walls, including heat loss by radiation and natural convection to the walls. We then assume two limiting conditions for the temperature in the afterglow. The first is isothermal, where the temperature in the afterglow is the same as the plasma–afterglow boundary and represents an upper bound. The second is room temperature (300 K), where the temperature in the spatial afterglow is assumed to rapidly decrease to the ambient and represents a lower bound. The actual temperature in the afterglow could be between these upper and lower bounds and will depend on the specific system; for this reason, we have purposefully left our analysis general.

### Exploring the thermodynamics of a universal fermi gas [^e36534ea]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

One of the greatest challenges in modern physics is to understand the behaviour of an ensemble of strongly interacting particles. A class of quantum many-body systems (such as neutron star matter and cold Fermi gases) share the same universal thermodynamic properties when interactions reach the maximum effective value allowed by quantum mechanics, the so-called unitary limit. This makes it possible in principle to simulate some astrophysical phenomena inside the highly controlled environment of an atomic physics laboratory. Previous work on the thermodynamics of a two-component Fermi gas led to thermodynamic quantities averaged over the trap, making comparisons with many-body theories developed for uniform gases difficult. Here we develop a general experimental method that yields the equation of state of a uniform gas, as well as enabling a detailed comparison with existing theories. The precision of our equation of state leads to new physical insights into the unitary gas. For the unpolarized gas, we show that the low-temperature thermodynamics of the strongly interacting normal phase is well described by Fermi liquid theory, and we localize the superfluid transition. For a spin-polarized system, our equation of state at zero temperature has a 2 per cent accuracy and extends work on the phase diagram to a new regime of precision. We show in particular that, despite strong interactions, the normal phase behaves as a mixture of two ideal gases: a Fermi gas of bare majority atoms and a non-interacting gas of dressed quasi-particles, the fermionic polarons.

### The multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET) [^d261656c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This brief review centers on the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET). This technique, developed in the 1970s, measures the pulmonary exchange of a set of six different inert gases dissolved together in saline (or dextrose) and infused intravenously. It then uses those measurements to compute the distribution of ventilation/perfusion ratios that best explains the exchange of the six gases simultaneously. MIGET is based on the very same mass-conservation principles underlying the classic work of Rahn and Fenn and of Riley and coworkers in the 1950s, which defines the relationship between the ventilation/perfusion ratio and the alveolar and capillary partial pressures of any gas. After a brief history of MIGET, its principles are laid out, its information content is explained, and its limitations are described. It is noted that in addition to quantifying ventilation/perfusion inequality and pulmonary shunting, MIGET can identify and quantify diffusion limitation of O(2) exchange, when present, as well as explain the contributions of extrapulmonary influences such as inspired O(2) concentration, ventilation, cardiac output, Hb concentration/P(50), body temperature and acid/base state on arterial oxygenation. An overview of the technical details of implementing MIGET is given, and the review ends with potential future applications.

### Best clinical practices for the sleep center adjustment of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in stable chronic alveolar hypoventilation syndromes [^30856a56]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2010). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) titration — pressure support (PS) and tidal volume targets: For volume targeted bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP), the recommended tidal volume target is 8 mL/kg using ideal body weight, and in normal individuals dead space is approximately equal to 2 mL/kg. The PS should be increased in 1 TO 2 CM H2O increments if the transcutaneous PCO2 or end-tidal PCO2 remains 10 MM HG or more above goal for 10 minutes or more (Level A - Consensus). Pressure support may be increased if respiratory muscle rest has not been achieved by NPPV treatment at the current settings for 10 minutes or more, with adequate rest associated with resolution or improvement in tachypnea and/or excessive inspiratory effort as measured by phasic EMG activity of inspiratory muscles (Level A - Consensus). Pressure support may be increased if the SPO2 remains below 90% for 5 minutes or more and tidal volume is low (< 6 TO 8 ML/KG); if discrete obstructive apneas or hypopneas are present, the clinical guidelines for PR titration in OSA patients should be followed (Level A - Consensus).

### Fast or slow rescue ventilations: a predictive model of gastric inflation [^f6e4ea0a]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Rescue ventilations are given during respiratory and cardiac arrest. Tidal volume must assure oxygen delivery; however, excessive pressure applied to an unprotected airway can cause gastric inflation, regurgitation, and pulmonary aspiration. The optimal technique provides mouth pressure and breath duration that minimize gastric inflation. It remains unclear if breath delivery should be fast or slow, and how inflation time affects the division of gas flow between the lungs and esophagus.

Methods

A physiological model was used to predict and compare rates of gastric inflation and to determine ideal ventilation duration. Gas flow equations were based on standard pulmonary physiology. Gastric inflation was assumed to occur whenever mouth pressure exceeded lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Mouth pressure profiles that approximated mouth-to-mouth ventilation and bag-valve-mask ventilation were investigated. Target tidal volumes were set to 0.6 and 1.0 L. Compliance and airway resistance were varied.

Results

Rapid breaths shorter than 1 s required high mouth pressures, up to 25 cm H 2 O to achieve the target lung volume, which thus promotes gastric inflation. Slow breaths longer than 1 s permitted lower mouth pressures but increased time over which airway pressure exceeded lower esophageal sphincter pressure. The gastric volume increased with breath durations that exceeded 1 s for both mouth pressure profiles. Breath duration of ∼1.0 s caused the least gastric inflation in most scenarios. Very low esophageal sphincter pressure favored a shift toward 0.5 s. High resistance and low compliance each increased gastric inflation and altered ideal breath times.

Conclusions

The model illustrated a general theory of optimal rescue ventilation. Breath duration with an unprotected airway should be 1 s to minimize gastric inflation. Short pressure-driven and long duration-driven gastric inflation regimens provide a unifying explanation for results in past studies.

### Pressure-controlled versus volume-controlled ventilation for acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^744b94b9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) account for one-quarter of cases of acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICUs). A third to half of patients will die in the ICU, in hospital or during follow-up. Mechanical ventilation of people with ALI/ARDS allows time for the lungs to heal, but ventilation is invasive and can result in lung injury. It is uncertain whether ventilator-related injury would be reduced if pressure delivered by the ventilator with each breath is controlled, or whether the volume of air delivered by each breath is limited.

Objectives

To compare pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) versus volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in adults with ALI/ARDS to determine whether PCV reduces in-hospital mortality and morbidity in intubated and ventilated adults.

Search Methods

In October 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Isssue 9), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 1 October 2014), the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1994 to 1 October 2014) and Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) at the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1990 to 1 October 2014), as well as regional databases, clinical trials registries, conference proceedings and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (irrespective of language or publication status) of adults with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure or acute on chronic respiratory failure and fulfilling the criteria for ALI/ARDS as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference who were admitted to an ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation, comparing pressure-controlled or pressure-controlled inverse-ratio ventilation, or an equivalent pressure-controlled mode (PCV), versus volume-controlled ventilation, or an equivalent volume-controlled mode (VCV).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification from trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Main Results

We included three RCTs that randomly assigned a total of 1089 participants recruited from 43 ICUs in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Spain and the USA. Risk of bias of the included studies was low. Only data for mortality and barotrauma could be combined in the meta-analysis. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the three mortality outcomes on the basis of serious imprecision around the effect estimates. For mortality in hospital, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; three trials, 1089 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and for mortality in the ICU, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; two trials, 1062 participants; moderate-quality evidence). One study provided no evidence of clear benefit with the ventilatory mode for mortality at 28 days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 983 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The difference in effect on barotrauma between PCV and VCV was uncertain as the result of imprecision and different co-interventions used in the studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.77; two trials, 1062 participants; low-quality evidence). Data from one trial with 983 participants for the mean duration of ventilation, and from another trial with 78 participants for the mean number of extrapulmonary organ failures that developed with PCV or VCV, were skewed. None of the trials reported on infection during ventilation or quality of life after discharge.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available data from RCTs are insufficient to confirm or refute whether pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation offers any advantage for people with acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. More studies including a larger number of people given PCV and VCV may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based.

### Volume-targeted ventilation: one size does not fit all. evidence-based recommendations for successful use [^110074aa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite level 1 evidence for important benefits of volume-targeted ventilation (VTV), many vulnerable extremely preterm infants continue to be exposed to traditional pressure-controlled ventilation. Lack of suitable equipment and a lack of appreciation of the fact that 'one size does NOT fit all' appear to contribute to the slow uptake of VTV. This review attempts to improve clinicians' understanding of the way VTV works and to provide essential information about evidence-based tidal volume (V T) targets. Focus on underlying lung pathophysiology, individualised ventilator settings and V T targets are keys to successful use of VTV thereby improving important clinical outcomes.

### On the use of plume models to estimate the flux in volcanic gas plumes [^6fda4808]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Vertical plumes: buoyancy flux, mass flux and gas temperature

To convert the buoyancy flux to a gas flux, we account for the flux of heat Q V and the mass flux M of the volcanic gas in the plume. Both of these properties are conserved in the lower part of the plume as air is entrained into the plume. However, since the volcanic gas may initially be very hot, with temperature T + Δ T V much higher than the ambient temperature T, then as air is mixed into the plume, and the mixture cools and the gas contracts, the buoyancy flux gradually evolves towards a constant. We now explore how this buoyancy flux depends on the source mass flux and temperature. This can be used to estimate the range of possible source mass fluxes based on the possible range of source temperatures.

To calculate the buoyancy flux, we note that as air is entrained, heat conservation requires that the mixture temperature T + Δ T A is given in terms of the mass flux of entrained air, M A where M is the mass flux and C the specific heat capacity, while the density of the mixture of volcanic gas and entrained air iswhere ρ V and ρ A are the density of the volcanic gas and the air mixed into the plume respectively, each of which may be calculated using the ideal gas lawwhere R is the gas constant, which has value 287 J kg −1 K −1 for air and 461 J kg −1 K −1 for water vapour. For the volcanic gas, we use the mass-averaged value of R based on the different volatile species, but given that water vapour normally constitutes over 95% of the mass of volcanic gas, this average is approximately given by the value for water vapour. The buoyancy of the mixture is given bywhere g = 9.81 ms −2 is the acceleration of gravity and ρ 0 is the ambient density of the air. Combining these results, we estimate that after a mass flux M A of air has been entrained into the plume, the buoyancy flux, B, is given by

### Forces required for isolated malleus shaft fractures [^d02513e0]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Calculation of Negative Pressure Force

Using the ideal gas law PV = nRT and assuming that the external auditory meatus is completely sealed during the event makes PV a constant.

We can further derive to the formula:

P = standard normal air pressure defined as 101,000 Pascal

A = area of the tympanic membrane, average at 64.3 mm 2 according to Pannu et al.

X = the length of the external auditory meatus filled with a finger

L 1 = the distance from tympanic membrane to the fingertip

L 2 = the total length of the ear canal, measured on our test persons to calculate L 1 by subtracting X. (Fig. 4 B).

FIG. 4
A, A schematic illustration of the force generating trauma when a finger is withdrawn the length of X out of the ear canal. L 1 marks the distance between the tympanic membrane and the fingertip. The tensor tympani muscle and its tendon are in red. B, Schematic illustration of our scale model of the trauma with an artificial tympanic membrane (blue) with a cast in metallic malleus replica that attaches to the force measuring dynamometer via a hook marked H. V marks a screw valve for normalization of pressure before the piston that acts as the withdrawn finger is extracted the length X (drawn here as a hollow arrow to the right). C, A similar construct as in (B), but when the first piston is drawn the length of X (marked by the hollow arrow to the right), the dynamometer attached to the second piston marked P measures the force required to withdraw P. The friction force needed to withdraw P is separately measured and then subtracted from the result to give the force applied by the negative pressure of withdrawing the first piston.

With this formula, the force applied via the tympanic membrane due to air expansion can be calculated. It is also possible to account for several variabilities such as the likely scenario that the ear canal is not sealed during the entire extraction of the finger (by subtraction from X). Moreover, the amount of air between the finger and the tympanic membrane could be lessened due to the presence of water (by subtraction from L 1). Since water expansion can be considered negligible, it was not accounted for in the equation. Hydraulic mechanisms work on the effectiveness of energy transfer in liquid.

### Noninvasive respiratory support [^489dadb7]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) physiologic principles and safety — A key feature of HFNC is the preconditioning of the inspired gas, and because warming and humidifying normally require metabolic energy, HFNC has the advantage of reducing resting energy expenditure; an in vivo study revealed that the humidity of gas delivered by HFNC was significantly greater. Clinically reported benefits have been decreased work of breathing and reduced supplemental oxygen requirement, with proposed mechanisms including reduction of inspiratory resistance, washout of nasopharyngeal dead space, and provision of positive airway distending pressure. Under certain circumstances (tightly fitting nasal prongs, high flow rates, and closed mouth), HFNC can generate high nasopharyngeal airway pressures, although it is unlikely that excessive pressures will occur if the manufacturers' recommendation to use prongs less than half the size of the nares is followed.

### Humidification during invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation: 2012 [^e4ee4fdf]. Respiratory Care (2012). Medium credibility.

HME contraindications and low tidal volume considerations — There are no contraindications to providing physiologic conditioning of inspired gas during mechanical ventilation, but an HME is contraindicated under some circumstances; use of an HME is contraindicated for patients with frank bloody or thick, copious secretions, for those with an expired tidal volume less than 70% of the delivered tidal volume, for patients with body temperatures < 32°C, and for those with high spontaneous minute volumes (> 10 L/min). When lung-protective low tidal volumes are used, HMEs are not recommended because they contribute additional dead space and can increase PaCO2; in ARDS with low tidal volumes when managing hypercapnia is warranted, HMEs should be avoided. Removal of the HME significantly reduces dead space and PaCO2 and increases pH, and in acute respiratory failure HMEs substantially increase minute ventilation, ventilatory drive, and work of breathing.

Computational method: Spin-polarized calculations were performed to obtain ground DFT energies of Fe m Co 8- m O 12 (m = 0,2,4,6,8) clusters, Fe n Co 4- n (PO 4) 4 (n = 0–4) clusters, and Fe n Co 4- n (PO 4) 4 (010) surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulation packagewith projected augmented wave functional. The exchange-correlation potential was corrected by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)for generalized gradient approximation with Tkatchenko–Scheffler(TS) dispersion correction (PBE + TS). For structure optimization, a 2 × 2 k -grid (1 × 1 k -grid for clusters) was used to sample the first Brillouin zone and the cut-off energy was set to 500 eV. Self-consistent field calculations were used to optimize electronic and ionic steps until the energy difference between two successive steps becomes 0.01 meV and the force constant on each ion reaches to 0.02 eV Å −1. Calculations were optimized with spin-polarized method, resulting in the high-spin ferromagnetic configuration for Fe n Co 4- n (PO 4) 4 (010) surfaces (Supplementary Table 9) and the most stable magnetic configuration was also considered for clusters models. These ferromagnetic configurations are in agreement with the experimentally verified ferromagnetic magnetic materials of catalysts 1–3.

### Finding the optimal tidal volume in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^f408b59c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A simplified reading of these arguments may lead to the suggestion that V T should be set to optimize ΔP and C RS (i.e. the elastic components of mechanical power contributing to VILI). Nevertheless, in our view, all the above discussed arguments raise two still unresolved questions: (a) Is ΔP an indicator of unsafe V T and does it have a direct impact on the outcome? (b) What factors can influence C RS and the interplay between V T and ΔP? Addressing these issues is crucial for clinicians to tailor V T, enhance mechanical ventilation, and minimize the potential risk for VILI.
Is ΔP an indicator of unsafe V T and does it have a direct impact on the outcome? ΔP was originally proposed as the ventilation variable that best stratifies the risk of hospital death. More recently, an emulated randomized trial based on registry of invasively and non-invasively ventilated patients showed that the 30-day ventilatory mortality was 20.1%. A 1.9% and 4.4% reduction of the absolute risk of 30-day ventilator mortality was shown for ΔP < 15 and < 10 cmH 2 O, respectively. This may be especially true when ΔP is limited at the very onset of mechanical ventilation and for a longer ventilation time. Interestingly, ΔP was shown to be correlated to mortality if calculated statically (i.e. using in the calculation end-inspiratory plateau pressure) or dynamically (i.e. using in the calculation peak-inspiratory pressure). Although a recent trial failed to support the use of V T < 6 ml/kg PBW when implemented with extracorporeal CO 2 removal, the absence of lower safe limits still encourage further studies to evaluate the clinical efficacy of "ultra-protective" ventilation.
What factors can influence C RS and the interplay between V T and ΔP? The level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) selected by the clinician as well as the elastic components of the chest wall (chest wall elastance: E CW) have an important influence on C RS, and on the interplay between V T and ∆P. Under these circumstances, the component of mechanical stress imputable to (a) lung volume (as influenced by the level of applied PEEP) and (b) to the partitioning of respiratory mechanics between chest wall and lung components (as assessed by measurement of E CW) may both affect C RS and ∆P for a given V T. Clinical trials comparing high vs low PEEP did not target a limited ∆P strategy, whereas studies testing physiology-guided protocols to set PEEP used different methodologies (e.g. aiming at end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure of zero, or at the highest C RS following or not lung recruitment). Moreover, several other uncontrolled factors may contribute to the variable effects of ∆P and PEEP optimization. They include severity and pattern of injury, body positioning, airway closure and hemodynamic and the non-homogeneous distribution of ventilation makes regional stress not necessarily mirrored by a single values of ∆P and/or C RS. In this context, stress index (describing the changes in compliance with tidal inflation), lung imaging technique (e.g. electric impedance tomography and computed tomography) and estimation of pleural pressure, may guide personalized ∆P and PEEP setting aiming at a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation and regional lung mechanics.

### Best PEEP trials are dependent on tidal volume [^08b2b70a]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Determining the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome remains an area of active investigation. Most trials individualizing PEEP optimize one physiologic parameter (e.g. driving pressure) by titrating PEEP while holding other ventilator settings constant. Optimal PEEP, however, may depend on the tidal volume, and changing the tidal volume with which a best PEEP trial is performed may lead to different best PEEP settings in the same patient.

### Can mathematical modeling explain the measured magnitude of the second gas effect? [^fc8ae787]. Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical studies suggest that the magnitude of the second gas effect is considerably greater on arterial blood partial pressures of volatile agents than on end-expired partial pressures, and a significant second gas effect on blood partial pressures of oxygen and volatile agents occurs even at relatively low rates of nitrous oxide uptake. We set out to further investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon with the help of mathematical modeling.

Methods

Log-normal distributions of ventilation and blood flow were generated representing the range of ventilation-perfusion scatter seen in patients during general anesthesia. Mixtures of nominal delivered concentrations of volatile agents (desflurane, isoflurane and diethyl ether) with and without 70% nitrous oxide were mathematically modeled using steady state mass-balance principles, and the magnitude of the second gas effect calculated as an augmentation ratio for the volatile agent, defined as the partial pressure in the presence to that in the absence of nitrous oxide.

Results

Increasing the degree of mismatch increased the second gas effect in blood. Simultaneously, the second gas effect decreased in the gas phase. The increase in blood was greatest for the least soluble gas, desflurane, and least for the most soluble gas, diethyl ether, while opposite results applied in the gas phase.

Conclusions

Modeling of ventilation-perfusion inhomogeneity confirms that the second gas effect is greater in blood than in expired gas. Gas-based minimum alveolar concentration readings may therefore underestimate the depth of anesthesia during nitrous oxide anesthesia with volatile agents. The effect on minimum alveolar concentration is likely to be most pronounced for the less soluble volatile agents in current use.

### Carbon footprint of fluorinated gases used in endothelial keratoplasty [^776281d9]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This single-center, retrospective case series was carried out at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, focusing on all endothelial keratoplasties using fluorinated gases. The study spanned 36 months, from January 1, 2021, to January 1, 2024, and all EK procedures — Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK), Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK), and EK rebubbling — were included. Data of included procedures were obtained from patients' electronic chart records (MediSight, Medisoft Limited, Leeds, United Kingdom). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital (13016; Ophth/CA/2023–24/12) and was performed in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Environmental Impact Calculations

The environmental impact of gas tamponade was calculated by converting milliliters (mL) of gas to grams (g) of mass using the modified ideal gas law formula at standard temperature and pressure for the smaller canisters, as described by Moussa et al. Intraocular gas masses were then converted to their Global Warming Potential over 100 years (GWP100). This study used the GWP100 reference values from the latest IPCC6 assessment report: 25,200 for SF6, 11,100 for C2F6, and 8900 for C3F8.

### Gas transport mechanisms during high-frequency ventilation [^831dc0fd]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The expression in Eq. (7) naturally incorporates the impact of frequency and pressure and can be related to the concept of the pressure cost of achieving flow proposed in. Equation (7) can equally be rearranged to find an expression for the required pressure as

If the dead space volume is used to define the representative length scale, then the quotient of the two parameters on the right-hand side recovers the nondimensional frequency, of from Eq. (2). I.e.

Combining the two parameters suggests that the pressure amplitude is only a function of the parameter, i.e.

Equations (3) and (5) (from) define the dimensionless flow cost of ventilation parameter, as a function of the same dimensionless frequency. Therefore, it could be taken that the relationship between pressure andis an implicit one moderated by, i.e.

Written this way, the flow cost of achieving ventilation and the pressure cost of achieving flow are incorporated into a single non-dimensional relationship. It makes it clear that for a given flow cost of ventilation, the only parameter to minimize is, and this is likely to occur when using a frequency near the resonance frequency (i.e.). However, in order to arrive at this relationship, the two independent dimensionless parameters on the right-hand side of Eq. (8) need to be combined.

The section titled: Alignment of currently used frequencies with those suggested by RLC-type models outlines thatin most studies across infant and adult cohorts. There is an effort to maintain this dimensional similitude, suggesting parameters are scaled between the two cohorts in the way suggested by Eq. (11).

However, we highlight two points:
this final relationship for a non-dimensional pressure cost of achieving flow is built by combining two, potentially independent, parameters into a single parameter; and,
the relationship outlined in Eq. (8) contains no parameters related to the airway resistance or the fluid properties of air, that will have a significant impact on the pressure loss and gas transport properties.

### Lung inhomogeneity in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^d8cb2365]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Pressures and volumes needed to induce ventilator-induced lung injury in healthy lungs are far greater than those applied in diseased lungs. A possible explanation may be the presence of local inhomogeneities acting as pressure multipliers (stress raisers).

Objectives

To quantify lung inhomogeneities in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods

Retrospective quantitative analysis of CT scan images of 148 patients with ARDS and 100 control subjects. An ideally homogeneous lung would have the same expansion in all regions; lung expansion was measured by CT scan as gas/tissue ratio and lung inhomogeneities were measured as lung regions with lower gas/tissue ratio than their neighboring lung regions. We defined as the extent of lung inhomogeneities the fraction of the lung showing an inflation ratio greater than 95th percentile of the control group (1.61).

Measurements and Main Results

The extent of lung inhomogeneities increased with the severity of ARDS (14 ± 5, 18 ± 8, and 23 ± 10% of lung volume in mild, moderate, and severe ARDS; P < 0.001) and correlated with the physiologic dead space (r(2) = 0.34; P < 0.0001). The application of positive end-expiratory pressure reduced the extent of lung inhomogeneities from 18 ± 8 to 12 ± 7% (P < 0.0001) going from 5 to 45 cm H2O airway pressure. Lung inhomogeneities were greater in nonsurvivor patients than in survivor patients (20 ± 9 vs. 17 ± 7% of lung volume; P = 0.01) and were the only CT scan variable independently associated with mortality at backward logistic regression.

Conclusions

Lung inhomogeneities are associated with overall disease severity and mortality. Increasing the airway pressures decreased but did not abolish the extent of lung inhomogeneities.

### Hydrogenation of saturated organic and inorganic molecules in metallic hydrogen [^368fe77e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

One challenge for theory is the richness of hydrocarbon chemistry. The demonstration that methane is unstable to decomposition does not preclude other stable hydrocarbons. Moreover, given the high temperatures and excess of hydrogen over carbon in gas giant planets, even a low solubility limit could result in much of the carbon remaining in solution in the metallic hydrogen layers.

Here, we use density functional theory calculations to consider what form of carbon will exist in a metallic hydrogen environment. We start by examining the free energy of solid solution carbon in crystalline I4 1 /amd metallic hydrogen with the well-characterized quasiharmonic method. Then we demonstrate the equivalence of the molecular dynamics (MD) approach as an equally reliable estimator of thermodynamic properties, and apply MD to investigate the planetary-relevant fluid metallic hydrogen.

Our result is that we predict the existence of a chemistry, based around a basic sixfold coordination of carbon, fourfold coordination of nitrogen and threefold coordination of oxygen. For example we observe CH 6, C 2 H 8, C 3 H 10, OH 3 and CH 4 OH and NH 4. These hypermolecules become stable over methane, water and ammonia in conditions of high pressure and modest temperatures, in both solid and liquid metallic hydrogen.

It is worth noting that sixfold coordinated carbon has previously been synthesized, inand in the nitrogenase iron-molybdenum cofactor. The 2+ ions are described as non-classical carbocations, with multicentred covalent bonds. However, our hypermolecules only exist in a metallic environment, and we will show that the molecules are stabilised by the high electron density rather than the pressure per se.

### Best PEEP trials are dependent on tidal volume [^db360f38]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Determining the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome remains an area of active investigation. Most trials individualizing PEEP optimize one physiologic parameter (e.g., driving pressure) by titrating PEEP while holding other ventilator settings constant. Optimal PEEP, however, may depend on the tidal volume, and changing the tidal volume with which a best PEEP trial is performed may lead to different best PEEP settings in the same patient.

### ATS / ERS recommendations for standardized procedures for the online and offline measurement of exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide, 2005 [^3c34f3f6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Nitric oxide analysis — ambient conditions, humidity management, and interfering substances can affect measurements. Ozone chemiluminescence analyzers are sensitive to ambient conditions including temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, and exposure to sunlight. Exhaled and nasal gas samples are presumed to be fully saturated with water vapor; drying through agents such as Drierite is not recommended, and an acceptable approach is equilibration of sample humidity with ambient humidity using Nafion tubing. Calibration gases (dry [ATPD]) and clinical gas samples (body temperature [37°C] and pressure, saturated [BTPS]) should be measured under uniform humidity and temperature conditions, and it is recommended that manufacturers measure and report the quantitative effect of humidity on NO measurement. Quenching by H2O should be less than 1% of measured NO signal per 1% volume H2O, and quenching by CO2 should be less than 1% NO per 1% CO2. Interfering substances include volatile anesthetic gases, oxidation of analyzer and tubing materials, and the risk of spontaneous combustion.

Background

Tessari-made foam sclerotherapy is performed around the world in a variety of clinics differing in methods, equipment, temperatures, and altitudes. We investigated how the following factors affected the foam's longevity: silicone vs nonsilicone syringes, volume of foam made, ratio of gas to sclerosant, use of air vs 50:50 mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen, temperature, altitude, and 10 consecutive reuses of the syringes.

Methods

Sclerosant foam was made by the Tessari double-syringe technique. To calculate the longevity, the time was taken for half of the original volume of sclerosant to settle. Half-lives were compared with use of silicone and silicone-free syringes to make the foam. We investigated how the volume (5 mL vs 2 mL) and different ratios affected the foam by observing the half-life of 4:1, 3.5:1, and 3:1 ratios of gas to sclerosant. Air and a 50:50 mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen were both used as the gas in changing the ratio and volume to see which produced better foam. These experiments were conducted at room (23.9°C) and refrigerator (3°C) temperatures with a constant pressure. The different ratio, volume, and silicone vs nonsilicone syringe experiments were all repeated at 9314, 7460, 4575, and 2326 feet above sea level in addition to the baseline experiment, which took place at 236 feet above sea level. To test how consecutive uses of syringes affected the foam, we made consecutive batches of foam reusing each pair of syringes 10 times; this was repeated five times with silicone syringes and twice with nonsilicone syringes.

Results

Switching to nonsilicone syringes can increase longevity by 70%. A larger volume of foam and a 3:1 ratio produced longer half-lives at all temperatures and altitudes. The lower (3°C) temperature increased the longevity of foam in all instances, as did the use of air. A high altitude (low pressure) had a detrimental effect on the foam's longevity. Ten consecutive syringe uses had no significant impact on the foam's half-life (silicone syringe mean between first five and last five uses, P = 0.95).

Conclusions

The optimum conditions for making foam are nonsilicone syringes, larger volumes, a 3:1 air to sclerosant ratio, and low temperatures. Silicone syringes can be reused until friction becomes a burden. Temperature has a bigger effect than altitude on longevity of the foam. Making foam in larger volumes would allow the foam to last longer. To compensate for high altitudes (low pressures), decreasing the temperature will increase the foam's longevity.

Recommendations for NPPV titration equipment — The NPPV device used for titration should have the capability of operating in the spontaneous, spontaneous timed, and timed mode; the airflow, tidal volume, leak, and delivered pressure signal from the device should be monitored and recorded if possible, with the airflow signal used to detect apnea and hypopnea and the tidal volume signal and respiratory rate used to assess ventilation; transcutaneous or end-tidal PCO2 may be used to adjust NPPV settings if adequately calibrated and ideally validated with arterial blood gas testing; an adequate assortment of masks (nasal, oral, and oronasal) in both adult and pediatric sizes, a source of supplemental oxygen, and heated humidification should be available.

### 40th international symposium on intensive care&emergency medicine: brussels, belgium. 24–27 March 2020 [^8300b2c9]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

σCO2: CO2 solubility in blood, R: gas constant, T: temperature. PvCO2: venous partial pressure, Kc: function of pH (12.5 for a pH of 7.2), Q: blood flow [5 l/min]).

Results:

Increasing DS from 10 to 40% increases the minimal mechanical power from 5.9 to 10.8 J/min, primarily caused by an increase of optimal Vt (495–672 ml). Optimal RR was only slightly increased (6.4–7.5 /min, Figure 1 Panel A). For varying ECCO2R removal, necessary ventilation ranges from 1.6 to 3.6 L/min. This predicts a minimal power between 5.6 and 10.4 J/min with an unchanged optimal Vt (540–543 ml) and an increasing optimal RR (5.4 to 12.3 /min (Figure 1 Panel B)).

Conclusions:

In order to minimize mechanical power, increasing shunt or CO2 production should be met with increases in RR while increases in DS should be met with increases in VT. Our results indicate that during ECCO2R, mechanical power and thus risk for lung injury can be minimized with higher VT compared to conservative ventilation strategies.

### Nanofiber-interwoven gel membranes with tunable 3D-interconnected transport channels for efficient COseparation [^a1c0cb3b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Measurement of gas separation performance of NIGMs

Gas permeance tests were conducted at room temperature (298 K) using a self-built permeation device employing the constant pressure-variable volume method (Supplementary Fig. 25). Specifically, the membranes were first fixed in a membrane module, which was placed inside a temperature-controlled oven to maintain isothermal conditions. Before experiment, the whole pipeline of the permeation device was purged with the test gas for at least 1 min. During experiment, the upstream pressure of the module was set at 151.0 cmHg, while the downstream pressure was maintained at 76.0 cmHg (atmospheric conditions). The gases were tested in sequential order: N 2, CH 4 and CO 2. Downstream gas flow rates were monitored with a digital bubble flowmeter. After the system reached steady-state, all gas permeation measurements were performed more than three times, and the reported data includes the average values along with the standard deviation. The evaluation of the gas separation performance of the NIGMs involved the quantification of gas permeance (P, GPU), gas permeability (G, Barrer) and ideal selectivity.

The gas permeance was calculated by:whererepresents the volume of gas permeating through the membrane (cm 3), denotes the permeation time (s), is the effective separation area of the membranes (2.2 cm 2), indicates the pressure difference between the upstream and the downstream of the membranes (75.0 cmHg), is 273.15 K and T is the test temperature (298.15 K).

### Volume and its relationship to cardiac output and venous return [^60c0a05e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary compliance and volume shifts between systemic and pulmonary circuits

So far in this review cardiac function has been considered as one unit starting from the right atrium and exiting from the aortic valve. Pulmonary vessels and independent functions of the right and left ventricle have not been considered. This simplification normally produces a small error because total pulmonary compliance is only one-seventh of total systemic vascular compliance and the pulmonary circuit does not contain a lot of volume that can be shifted to the systemic circulation. It also cannot take up a lot of volume without causing a large increase in pulmonary venous pressure and a major disturbance to pulmonary gas exchange. Even maximal sympathetic stimulation results in only a small shift from the pulmonary circuit to the systemic circulation. However, the small volume reserves in the pulmonary vasculature become important during the variation in pulmonary flow during ventilation, especially during mechanical ventilation and increases in pleural pressure.

### Dynamics of end expiratory lung volume after changing positive end-expiratory pressure in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients [^63b3a6ef]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Measurements and calculations

Flow and airway pressure (P AW) were measured with a proximal pneumotachograph (linear between −120 L/min and +120 L/min with ± 5% [SD], PN279331; Hamilton Medical) positioned at the Y-piece. Volumes were integrated from flow measurements. Flow, volumes, and P AW were continuously recorded using Study Recorder software (Hamilton Medical) at 50 Hz.

ΔEELV after a PEEP step was calculated by direct spirometry, which was shown to be a robust method compared with functional residual capacity measured by a washin/washout method with insoluble gases. The difference between inspiratory and expiratory V T measured by direct spirometry was calculated for each breath following a PEEP step. This difference was corrected by the systematic difference, called V T offset, between inspired and expired V T, calculated from the last 30 seconds of the step, owing to humidity and temperature differences between inhaled and exhaled gas and oxygen consumption. ΔEELV was calculated as the cumulative difference between inspiratory and expiratory V T, corrected by V T offset, measured over the 30 breaths following the PEEP step (Fig. 1). ΔEELV was partitioned between the expected volume (V EXP) to distend already open alveoli (calculated as the product of C RS of the previous PEEP level by ΔPEEP) and the additional increased volume (V ADI) following the increase in PEEP. Thus, ΔEELV = V EXP + V ADI for each level of PEEP. During the increase in PEEP, the number of breaths required to achieve V EXP to distend already open alveoli, as well as the number of breaths needed to achieve 95% of the V ADI, was calculated. The number of breaths required to ensure completion of the volume change in 99% of the increase in PEEP events was measured. During the decrease in PEEP, the number of breaths needed to achieve the expected decrease in volume (V EXP), as well as the number of breaths required to achieve 95% of the additional decreased volume (V ADD), was calculated. Thus, ΔEELV = V EXP + V ADD for each level of PEEP. The number of breaths required to ensure completion of volume change in 99% of the decrease in PEEP change events was measured.

### Immiscible hydrocarbon fluids in the deep carbon cycle [^a8e7a7f0]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

We quantified the amount of the hydrocarbon fluids by counting the number of optically visible droplets, knowing the volume of the cell, and estimating the density of isobutane at pressure and temperature. It is assumed that the droplets are distributed in the system evenly. That is, in each optical picture, the ratio of the areas of the droplets to the cell was assumed to represent the volume of the hydrocarbons to that of the cell. However, when examining the pictures with droplets, we found that some of the in-focus droplets were clearer than the out-of-focus ones. Therefore, we counted the most apparent droplets as a lower limit (a) of the hydrocarbon amount, and all visible droplets as the higher limit (b). The values plotted in Fig. 3 are (a + b)/2 and error bar as (b − a)/2. In this way, we obtained the volume of the droplets and uncertainties. Using an equation of state of fluid isobutane, we calculated the density of isobutane within our experimental pressure-temperature range, with the following results: (1) 0.558 kg l −1 at 25 °C and 4.24 MPa, (2) 0.839 kg l −1 at 25 °C and 1.0 GPa and (3) 0.923 kg l −1 at 300 °C and 3.0 GPa. Using the volume and density, we obtained the mass of isobutane (assuming the droplet is pure isobutane).

For instance, at 300 °C and 3.0 GPa, the density of pure water is 1.33 kg l −1. We can calculate the volume of the water fluid to be 1.33 × 10 6 μm 3, smaller than initial volume due to compression. In the last picture taken before quench_2 of Exp_3, we know that the area of hydrocarbons is about 2.11 ± 0.13% of the total area of cell, so we can calculate the mass of hydrocarbon droplet (isobutane) to be m = 2.11/100 × 1.33 × 10 6 μm 3 × 0.923 kg l −1 = 2.59 × 10 −8 g, that is, 4.456 × 10 −10 mol of isobutane. Multiplying the value by 4 gives a value of 1.78 × 10 −9 mole carbon, representing 52% of the total carbon (3.4 × 10 −9 mole). The rest of the estimated carbon contents of hydrocarbons are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

Ultracold quantum gases are ideal sources for high-precision space-borne sensing as proposed for Earth observation, relativistic geodesy and tests of fundamental physical laws as well as for studying new phenomena in many-body physics during extended free fall. Here we report on experiments with the Cold Atom Lab aboard the International Space Station, where we have achieved exquisite control over the quantum state of single 87 Rb Bose-Einstein condensates paving the way for future high-precision measurements. In particular, we have applied fast transport protocols to shuttle the atomic cloud over a millimeter distance with sub-micrometer accuracy and subsequently drastically reduced the total expansion energy to below 100pK with matter-wave lensing techniques.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^41658ff6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical examples of reasonable divergence from empirical evidence — examples include low tidal volume ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inhaled nitric oxide for severe ARDS, and induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest — with scenario-specific rationales. For low tidal volume ventilation for severe ARDS, elevated plateau pressures in the context of abdominal compartment syndrome can justify allowing higher plateau pressures based on pathophysiologic reasoning about transpulmonary pressures. For inhaled nitric oxide for severe ARDS, single organ failure with severe life-threatening hypoxia can lead to pathophysiologic reasoning to implement therapy without proven benefit for improving hospital survival. For induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest, a witnessed in-hospital cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity as the initial rhythm can prompt extrapolation from out-of-hospital arrest to induce hypothermia.

### A statistical model that predicts the length from the left subclavian artery to the celiac axis; towards accurate intra aortic balloon sizing [^3d6cd019]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The efficiency of the IABP depends on multiple factors, which include: The ability of the ejection system to trace electrical stimulation events and transfer the gas during every cardiac cycle, the patient's hemodynamic status, the anatomical position of the balloon and lastly the volume of the selected balloon.

The variables that affect the size and duration of the IABP inflation with gas and consequently the diastolic increase in pressure, were first published 20 years ago, in an innovative study by Weber et al. They reported that the arterial pressure has direct impact on the balloon performance and that the beneficial effects of the IABP reduces when arterial pressure increases.

The heart rate also affects the balloon functioning. The faster the heart rate, the less the balloon inflation time and the diastolic augmentation.

The relation between the aortic pressure and the volume of the aorta reflects the aortic elasticity and the reduced aortic elasticity means reduced diastolic augmentation.

The closer the IABP to the aortic valve, the higher is the incremented diastolic augmentation.

The effect of the IABP diameter to the patient's hemodynamics was studied by Weber, Janicki, and Walker. They concluded that for any given arterial pressure or aortic size, the greatest augmentation in mean aortic diastolic pressure was achieved with complete occlusion. It is obvious that in 100% occlusion of the aortic lumen, a lesion to the aortic wall and erythrocytes could possibly occur and thus the ideal convergence is thought to be approximetly 90 to 95%.

The balloon volume shall be at least 50% of the stroke volume. In a hypothetical patient with poor cardiac index, the rate of the diastolic incrementation to support an insufficient heart is limited because of the fact that the stroke volume in the given patient is low and thus the ideal balloon volume shall be low. In the course of improvement of the hypothetical s patient s hemodynamics and the more the stroke volume improves, which means that the volume of blood transferred within the aorta at every stroke increases, then the balloon volume of the IABP, necessary to maintain the same level of diastolic augmentation, increments. This fact may suggest that during a period of time from the balloon implantation till the successful removal of the balloon, the performance of corrective interventions to the balloon volume by intervals, based on the patient's clinical status, may be the proper method in order to provide ideal diastolic augmentation, both for the insufficient heart and the heart that shows improvement.

### Practical assessment of risk of VILI from ventilating power: a conceptual model [^a054cf49]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Threshold pressure for damage

The actual threshold pressure, that determines the damaging potential for elastic energy per cycle is unknown and likely varies–both between patients and within the various regions of the mechanically heterogenous lung. As already noted, two numbers that serve currently as lung protection guidelines for clinical practitioners are the end-inspiratory pressure in the absence of flow, the 'plateau pressure', and the 'driving pressure'. When the entire breath is considered using observable bedside data during passive ventilation, the numerical upper limits commonly considered 'safe' for these parameters in everyday practice are: = 30 cmH 2 O and DP = 15 cmH 2 O. Fundamentally, however, pressure alone cannot injure — to do that the expenditure of sufficient and potentially damaging energy (a product of pressure and volume) is required. One plausible approach to approximate the latter may be to use theas a boundary marker.

Onceis assigned, the proportion of the total intracycle elastic energy that does not exceed that threshold value can be estimated as a 'safety ratio' (SR), which we designate to be the quotient of infra-thresholdelastic inflation energy to that of the entire inflation cycle. The complementary hazardous energy fraction (HR) bears a simple relationship to SR:). Some authors and clinicians consider the only elastic energy component of VILI interest to be the purely dynamic piece (the 'driving energy') expended in reaching the potentially hazardous end-tidal DP. Alternatively, the elastic energy of concern might also include the PEEP-related static component of pressure, as well as the DP. Here, theis the relevant pressure associated with maximum risk, as it helps define the total of ventilation-delivered elastic energy and parallels strain. Therefore, one might set two elastic SRs for each breath: one purely dynamicand one that is all-inclusive. Using these SR indicators with a safety threshold for total elastic inflation pressure in mind, the delivered breath can be characterized by the proportion of its elastic energy that is, on average, 'safe' or 'hazardous'.

If the SR for either driving energy or total elastic energy of the PEEP andcombination exceeds the desired SR value, new targets for maximally safe DP, andcan be calculated. In clinical practice, adjusting PEEP may have consequences for hemodynamics and gas exchange. Therefore, again in principle, the linked variables adjusted by the clinician to improve the energetics of VILI risk would likely be tidal volume and DP (with frequency fine-tuned as needed to maintain ventilation stable).

Natural evaporation

The natural evaporation simulation was conducted using STAR-CCM+ with 3D multiphase interaction and volume of fluid (VOF) analysis. The primary objective was to compare evaporation dynamics between a closed chamber and an open chamber. Both chambers were modeled with water at the bottom and air at the top, with variations in the chamber hole size used as a parameter to study changes in relative humidity during evaporation. A gap of 0.05 mm was maintained between the target areas of both chambers to facilitate the analysis.

The simulation assumed that the air consisted solely of "dry air" and "water vapor," following the ideal gas law. Initial conditions were set at a temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 20%. The gas species included H₂O (gas) and air, with molecular weights of 18.015 g/mol and 28.96 g/mol, respectively. The initial mass fraction of the gas species was defined as H 2 O (gas): Air = 0.0043: 0.9957, corresponding to 20% relative humidity, where P P and Ps are the partial pressure of H 2 O (gas) and saturation vapor pressure. The liquid species was H 2 O (liquid). The field functions in the simulation were defined as follows:where P U is the absolute pressure, and H is the mass fraction ratio of H 2 O (gas) to air.where T is the temperature of air.

Limit power delivery as well as airway pressures to avoid ventilator-associated lung injury

Luciano Gattinoni, MD

Background

Although excessive forces applied to the lung during mechanical ventilation are known to cause lung damage, the exact mechanism by which these physical forces cause injury and therefore the hazard targets and thresholds at which the clinician should direct attention are less well understood. Experiments have shown that damage occurs when tidal volume encroaches upon the total lung capacity and pressures rise into a dangerous zone. The total lung capacity of the injured baby lung varies from patient to patient, and therefore tidal volume represents an insufficient marker of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) risk when considered alone without knowing the aerated volume into which it is delivered. In fact, what appears to hurt the lung structure more closely relates to the energy load that the tissue sustains. The determining variables of the delivered energy per unit time (power) are the peak pressure and excursion of pressure which the tidal volume generates within the baby lung, the flow rate (how fast the tidal volume is delivered and pressure builds), and the respiration frequency, an intuitively important variable to consider, whatever the characteristics of the individual tidal cycle might be. According to current understanding rooted in experimental science, we need to become more sophisticated in our understanding of the variables to control and the targets to identify. A key objective of ongoing work is to determine the power threshold of ventilation below which ventilation is always innocent and above which it is always dangerous. The quantification of such a threshold, an objective with firm biologic plausibility, will dictate the mandate to apply or withhold artificial extracorporeal support.

Idea

Power delivered to the lung, rather than tidal volume or any specific pressure associated with the tidal volume, most directly determines the potential for VILI. Identification of the numerical threshold for power delivery that separates safety from injury is feasible to identify for clinical practice.

### Effect of pressure support on end-expiratory lung volume and lung diffusion for carbon monoxide [^e976b0cb]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The level of pressure-support ventilation can affect mean airway pressure and potentially lung volume, but its increase is usually associated with a reduced respiratory rate, and the net effects on the gas exchange process and its components, including end-expiratory lung volume, have not been carefully studied. We measured pulmonary conductance for gas exchange based on lung diffusion for carbon monoxide in patients receiving pressure-support ventilation.

Design

Prospective, randomized, crossover study.

Setting

Medical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

Sixteen patients mechanically ventilated in pressure-support ventilation mode and free from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Interventions

Two pressure-support ventilation levels (5 cm H2O difference) at the same level of positive end-expiratory pressure.

Measurements and Main Results

End-expiratory lung volume, lung diffusion for carbon monoxide, and SpO2/Fio2 were evaluated. Increasing pressure-support ventilation by 5 cm H2O significantly increased the mean tidal volume from 6.8 to 8.5 mL/kg of predicted body weight and decreased the mean respiratory rate by 6.6 breaths per minute. Although SpO2/Fio2 did not change significantly, there was a slight but significant decrease in lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (average decay rate of 4.5%) at high pressure-support ventilation. The pressure-support ventilation level did not significantly affect end-expiratory lung volume (1737 ± 629 mL at 9.6 ± 2.5 cm H2O pressure-support ventilation level vs. 1749 ± 657 mL at 14.9 ± 2.1 cm H2O pressure-support ventilation level).

Conclusions

A 5-cm H2O increase in pressure-support ventilation neither affected end-expiratory lung volume nor increased the pulmonary volume participating in gas exchange. A target tidal volume closer to 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight than to 8 mL/kg during pressure-support ventilation was associated with better gas exchange.

Gas permeation measurements

The gas separation performance of PIM-1/pGMA-x, 6FDA-DAM/pGMA-x, TB/pGMA-x membranes were tested at 35 °C using a constant-volume/variable-pressure method. The downstream pressure was measured using a transducer down to 10 −6 torr, and the steady state pressure changing with time (dp/dt) was selected to calculate the permeability (P). Pure gas was tested in the sequence of N 2, CH 4, O 2, CO 2, and H 2 at 80 psi. PIM-1/pGMA-x and TB/pGMA-x polyolefin reweaved membranes were tested for three different samples, and the deviation was less than 5%. Permeability (P) was calculated using the following Eq. 2 :Where P is the permeability (Barrer), 1 Barrer = 10–10 cm 3 (STP) cm cm – 2 s – 1 cmHg – 1, V d is the calibrated permeate volume (cm 3), l is the membrane thickness (cm), p up is the upstream pressure (cmHg), A is the effective membrane area (cm 2), T is the operating temperature (K), R is the gas constant (0.278 cm 3 cmHg cm – 3 (STP) K – 1), and dp/dt is the steady-state downstream pressure increase rate (cmHg s – 1).

The ideal selectivity (α x/y) for components x and y was defined as the ratio of gas permeability of the two components via Eq. 3.

The diffusion coefficient D was calculated from the time-lag apparatus using Eq. 4:

### ISHLT consensus statement on the perioperative use of ECLS in lung transplantation: part III: postoperative considerations [^5781cd2b]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative VV extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) — weaning criteria and method: We recommend weaning of VV ECMO when improvements are noted clinically, radiologically, and biologically with improvements in both gas exchange and pulmonary compliance, and in the postoperative setting VV ECMO weaning should be initiated at signs of graft recovery including improvements in compliance, gas exchange, and radiological infiltrates (CoR: I LoE: B2). We recommend combining a stepwise weaning function with both a trial of sweep off and sequential arterial blood gases; in trial protocols, adequate gas exchange without excessive ventilation used thresholds of peak pressure < 30 cm H2O and FiO2 < 60%, and the VV ECMO weaning test involved turning sweep off for an hour prior to discontinuation, while weaning of VV ECMO should be approached in a stepwise fashion with gradual reduction in flow and a trial of sweep OFF prior to decannulation (CoR: I LoE: C1). Additionally, we recommend tidal volumes tailored to donor's ideal body weight with ventilation adjustments as needed.
